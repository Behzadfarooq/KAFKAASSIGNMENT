<p>He keeps on posting the little tidbits from the back of certain <a href="../../../g/o/o/Goosebumps.html" title="Goosebumps">Goosebumps</a> books. I've marked all so far as {{db-nonsense}}, as it seems to be pretty much patent nonsense, and I didn't want to have to go through the trouble of trying to mark it {{db-copyvio}}. Anyway, I'm sure the articles will be deleted in due time, as the administrators find them, but as for the user, I'm not sure what to do with him. I warned him once for reposting a deleted article, but that's about all I could do. Some administrator help here would be nice. <a href="../../../t/m/o/User%7ETmopkisn_365a.html" title="User:Tmopkisn">tmopkisn</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/m/o/User_talk%7ETmopkisn_1dc1.html" title="User talk:Tmopkisn">tlka</a></sup> 16:15, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

Thi is very disconcerting to me, especially since it was deleted for "Cross-namespace redirect, see <a href="../../../a/s/r/WP%7EASR_31e6.html" title="WP:ASR">WP:ASR</a>", which makes no sense, since its a template (not a redirect) and not a self-reference. Normally at this point I would contact Cyde, but I have found that Cyde tends to attack, flame, and ban people who speak against him for no reason, violating basically everything in <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> at once.</p>
<p>I undertstand that the German Userbox Solution moves the templates to User Space, but also, compromise and consensus must be followed. according to <a href="../../../g/u/s/WP%7EGUS_633c.html" title="WP:GUS">WP:GUS</a>, "Compromise is the source of community."</p>
<p>Someone should speak to Cyde about his problem with civility and the way he treats other users. He seems to have a lack of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiLove_dbab.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiLove">Wikilove</a>, and that should be addressed. Perhaps he does notunderstand the full impact of <b>community consensus</b>, especially when it applies to controversial subjects. Admins should not be above the law, they should be the epitome of it.</p>

<p>That IP is held by a large law firm. It seems someone at the firm has recently discovered how to edit Wikipedia articles. Most of their edits are really vandalism ast listed here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=12.10.34.242" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=12.10.34.242" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=12.10.34.242</a> I sent an email to the law firm and someone else warned them on their talk page. 01:48, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>For various reasons I have the last few ANI archives on my watchlist. Several times people have inserted material into the discussions, which I have reverted. It seems to me the archives should be a record of what was said, not what one <i>wishes</i> was said. Samsara has added material to Archive126 relating to the KarlIV saga; I reverted. He told me that he considers it slander and will continue to alter the archive. I think he has a fair complaint in that things were said about him that he didn't have a chance to respond to; I also think archives should be archives. However, I'm not looking for a fight. I bring this to the attention of the group for consideration.

<dd>Well I'm not sure that our current archiving rate is appropriate for issues like this. The thread was huge, no one wants to read though it again, but the issue is current. It is unfortunate that it got archived, but changing it and then putting a note up about the changes doesn't bother me in the least. The changes are transparent that way. Reverting someones comments is never a good idea. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 01:08, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree, if a thread is accidentally archived instead of modifying the archive either the thread should be moved over from the archive or a new thread should be created with a link at the top to the proper section of the archive where the original thread was, the latter is simpler but the former would assure that the archived posts are read by people who come late into the conversation. There should be no need for anyone to directly edit an archived post other than to possibly move it out or fix something that causes a display issue or something like that. If people are editing archives I'd suggest leaving a note on their talk page and reverting the change (note I said revert not rollback since rollback would be improper for this situation) If it can be reasonably assumed that they saw the note and are still editing the archives then block them since they'd then be ruining the integrity of even having an archive. <small><a href="../../../t/h/y/User%7EThygard_bbce.html" title="User:Thygard"><font color="#CC1100">Thygard</font></a> - <a href="../../../t/h/y/User_talk%7EThygard_cf45.html" title="User talk:Thygard"><font color="#FF6600">Talk</font></a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Thygard_f5c2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Thygard"><font color="#006400">Contribs</font></a> - <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Thygard_ece6.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Thygard"><font color="#3333FF">Email</font></a></small> ---- 01:16, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm in favor of leaving the archives unmodified. If an old discussion needs to be revived, paste it from the archive into ANI or into a new ANI sub-page.

<dd>It seems to be a recent problem.

<dd>Not sure I understand that last comment. Anyways, I'm surprised the archives aren't protected. I'll start watchlisting some of them just to make sure this stuff doens't happen. But an archive should be just that--a record of an old discussion. It shouldn't be modified. If a discussion needs to be continued, a new thread should be posted with a link to the archives. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force"><b><font color="black">Ungovernable Force</font></b></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_Wikipedian_kitchen_68b8.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force/Wikipedian kitchen"><font color="green"><sup>The Wiki Kitchen!</sup></font></a> 06:25, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Protecting the archives here makes no sense. That's not what protection policy is for. We don't protect archived RFAs (either type) and plenty of other important archives, nor should we unless vandalism is apparent. Community consensus is that protection has never applied to archives (except for extremem vandalism and then not forever). Not to mention the fact that it would most likely be admins editing WP:ANI, thus protection would do nothing to stop them. If you'll take a look at <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_indefinitely_protected_pages_e191.html" title="Wikipedia:List of indefinitely protected pages">Wikipedia:List of indefinitely protected pages</a> you can see that not one archive is on there. It has been made very clear that page protection policy applies in a narrow set of circumstances. This is not one of them. Teh protection is evil. Use the page history. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 12:54, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

He or she has had those edits reverted by me, among others (as the page is on my watchlist), but this user has, for whatever, reason, decided to single me out and vandalized my user page and user talk page on multiple occasions. This led, yesterday, to protection of that IP address's user talk page and a 24 hour block on that IP address. I have attempted to be civil, and have been rebuffed at every turn. As soon as the ban expired, the user's single edit since was to go BACK to my user talk page and make snide remarks, which I have since removed. What I am asking for, if possible, is monitoring of further edits from this IP address, as I can't keep a constant eye on my own user page and the other pages on my watch list (not if I'm going to keep my day job anyway&#160;:).

<dd>It's a good rule of thumb to not edit war, <i>ever</i>, over what another user does on his/her talkpage. You run a big risk of being seen as petty or frivolous when you do that, and the 3RR might be enforced against you instead. The removal of warnings on one's own page is "discouraged", not outlawed, and the 3RR is usually not enforced against such edits. Anyway, he removes a warning, that means he's seen it. There's no need to keep shoving it in his face.

At this time, and based on this evidence, I would not yet be willing support an indefinite block.

<dd>Not sure. His actions convince me that he should never be an admin, and any future RfAs should be speedily closed. He should also be limmited to one account.

<dd>Doc is, I think, quite right, and his suggestions seem roughly orthogonal with those of Cyde infra. Jtk should be limited to one account, of course, with the provision that his creating a sockpuppet for the purpose of disrupting projectspace will be strongly disfavored; his mainspace participation seems to be altogether fine, and I don't think there's any risk of disruption relative to work on articles. I'm not certain that a year-long ban from RfA is in order—his only sockpuppeteering at RfA seems to have been relative to his own RfAs, and I can't imagine that he'll be requesting adminship anytime soon—since he may have particular prescience apropos of the judgment of prospective admins, but I don't think such a ban would be particularly wrong. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 17:44, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There's a lot of ugly in that RFA, but <b>if</b> he can agree to having only one account, there's a possibility he can still be a useful editor (though not an admin or anything with additional trust, apparently).

<dd>Indeed. Jt, I don't believe you would dispute that your actions have been less than appropriate. People are responding to them differently, and at this point the community has not come to any kind of decision -- and I don't suppose that it would be reasonable for you to expect that all of this be forgotten at the drop of a hat: if you want this to be let go eventually, the first step is to own it, that is, accept responsibility for the mistakes made.<br />
I don't have a crystal ball, of course, but if I had to guess, I'd say you are not likely to be banned, but you are equally unlikely to become an administrator, or to hold any kind of special position in this community. If you can settle for being an editor (and doing it from a single account), who knows, in the future (granted, it would take a lot more time than "usual"), you might even arrive at a point where the community will we willing to trust you with Admin tools again. But if you up and leave now, nothing gets resolved, and the last memory of your participation in the project would be this debacle. Would you say that's fair? Be patient; accept responsibility. And don't get angry because people are having a hard time digesting what has happened, since that's not fair either. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 18:16, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As I've said I am going on a self imposed Wikiban from this account and the other 2 have already been blocked and I fully agree to a community enforced one account probation, however due to the strong feelings in this case I am loathe to do it on this account and once this discussion has died down I will be scrambling my passwords on this and the other two accounts to long letter/number combinations to prevent abuse by myself or others. Considering that if my one account would not have a fair shot of being a good editor I would not publicly reveal what the nick is (when I have created it) however if a few trusted Wikipedian's would come forth and swear secrecy I think that having them as oversight would be a good idea, that way the needs of the community knowing what I'm doing and the needs of me being able to make a fresh start under one account would be met.

<dd>I would agree to this, on the one additional proviso that, if you ever want to seek RFA on the new account, you must publically reveal the link in the process. This may result in it being impossible for you to ever get adminship back, but I'm afraid that that would have to be part of the consequences for you actions. For you to ever seek adminship again, it must be done in the public light. I have no problem with you returning to edit quietly, but I have a big problem with the possibility of you using that secrecy to try to get adminship once again.

The sock notice which should be preserved is also present on the the talk page so that's not an issue eithyer. My requests while inline with policy have been deemed "vandalism" and my userpage ad been protected against even me editing it. <s>Could an admin please fulfill my request? thanks. Jtkiefer 20:54, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</s> CanadianCaesar has brought up the good point that there may be an administrative need to keep the page, I disagree since my userpage is just links and notes created as a listing of my interests and some of my comings and goings and unlike my talk page has no real administrative substance but more comment is probably needed in that regard.

<p>I see that <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegations_of_Israeli_apartheid_c912.html" title="Allegations of Israeli apartheid">Allegations of Israeli apartheid</a> has been <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Allegations_of_Israeli_apartheid_508f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Allegations of Israeli apartheid">nominated for deletion yet again</a> (for the third time, I believe). Not surprisingly, it's producing a perfect storm of POV warriors on both sides, blatantly voting for their own partisan POVs on the article, totally ignoring the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability criteria</a> in favour of their own opinions on the subject matter.</p>
<p>I'm concerned by the rationale for the deletion nomination, which <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHaham_hanuka_7d7e.html" title="User:Haham hanuka">User:Haham hanuka</a> states as: "Stinks of POV, useless, non encyclopedic, propagadna..." This looks like a textbook example of an abuse of the deletion process as defined by <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html#Abuse_of_deletion_process" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy#Abuse of deletion process</a>: <i>"XfD(deletion) processes are not a way to complain or remove material that is personally disliked, whose perspective is against ones beliefs, or which is not yet presented neutrally. Using XfD as a "protest strategy" in an editorial or NPOV debate is generally an abuse of process and the article will usually be speedy kept."</i></p>
<p>I note that Haham hanuka has just recently been blocked for a week for another abuse of process on AfD and has a long history of blocks for 3RR violations and egregrious revert warring (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Haham_hanuka" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Haham_hanuka" rel="nofollow">[35]</a>). This seems to be another such abuse of process from a problem user; I suggest that the AfD be speedy kept per <a href="../../../d/e/l/WP%7EDEL_635e.html" title="WP:DEL">WP:DEL</a>, as the nomination plainly violates policy.

<dd>Yes, I see what you're saying now.

It's very unlikely to reach a conclusion any time soon, assuming that the ArbCom doesn't just ditch the whole thing as unmanageable - frankly, if I was in their shoes I'd do that. The AfD in question will have closed one way or another long before the RfAr.

<p>I think the AfD needs to be thrown out. There is clear evidence of people soliciting votes. Whether an article is to be in Wikipedia or not is not determined by a organized campaign to delete (or keep) it. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> 19:00, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I hope I am permitted to add something here even though I am not an admin. I think a few facts need to be added into the mix here. There was an AfD at the very beginning of this article, started by someone who is not only voting "keep" this time but is also the source of the vote solicitation evidenced on the AfD page (as disclosed by someone who also voted "keep", both times.) As I recall, there was a clear majority in favor of deletion, but "no consensus" and it was closed on that basis. More recently, someone unrelated to any of the prior "activity" (to choose a neutral word) proposed deletion and the AfD was closed as a "speedy keep" less than 40 minutes after it was opened. Only a few people voted in that AfD, and neither I nor (I suspect) most of the other people interested in the article were even aware of it until after it was over. Therefore, I suggest that the "second" AfD not even "count." That brings us to the current, truly "second" nomination, proposed more than two months (and many hundreds of edits) after the first one closed. This AfD was started by a user, Haham hanuka, who has not been involved in any of the prior "activity." In fact, I just looked at his (the gender is an assumption on my part) contribution history and it confirms that he has never edited the article in question (except for the Aug. 2 placement of a deletion-related tag that apparently did not result in a true AfD, followed by the placement of a tag related to this AfD) and that he also has never contributed to the article's talk page. He is not involved in the arbitration and, although I did not check, most likely never participated in any of the "centralized discussions." It appears that he simply happened upon the article, maybe he read the talk pages and maybe he didn't, and decided to nominate the article for deletion. I assume that this is permitted. I do not see where Haham hanuka has "abused" anything relating to this AfD, he simply put up a nomination and as of last count, well over 60 people have voted. After some initial hesitation (because my thought has been that there should be some "process" <i>following</i> the close of the pending arbitration to determine whether there will be a separate article on this subject and, if so, what its name should be), I decided that since the question has been asked, I will vote, and I did ("delete or merge.") This is also not a case of someone "losing" an AfD and then posting it again "over and over" as in a previous case referred to above. The person who started the first AfD is now against it and is soliciting votes against it, the nominator this time was not involved previously, and I suspect that some of the other "delete" voters (including some of those involved in the arbitration) share my concerns about the timing. Nevertheless, I do not see this as anything other than a legitimate AfD. Whether some of the voting practices are questionable, I will leave to more experienced persons. Excuse the length of this comment, I felt it was all relevant. <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 20:08, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The abuse is in the initial nomination by Haham hanuka: "Stinks of POV, useless, non encyclopedic, propagadna..." As I said above, <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html#Abuse_of_deletion_process" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy#Abuse of deletion process</a> states: "XfD(deletion) processes are not a way to complain or remove material that is personally disliked, whose perspective is against ones beliefs, or which is not yet presented neutrally. Using XfD as a "protest strategy" in an editorial or NPOV debate is generally an abuse of process and the article will usually be speedy kept." Haham hanuka's nomination is based essentially on the grounds that he doesn't like it ("useless"), that it's against his beliefs ("propaganda"), and that it's not presented neutrally ("Stinks of POV"). None of those are grounds for deletion. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 20:45, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But if you look at many of the "delete" or "delete or merge" or "merge" votes that have been cast, various people have stated their own grounds, rather than "delete per nom." In fact I believe there are not many of the latter. I referred to all of my past comments on the matter, which I believe support my vote. The point is, can't people decide on their own on what grounds they wish to vote? It doesn't seem fair to invalidate an AfD because you don't happen to like how the nominator chose to phrase his nomination. Your proposed action would wipe out the votes of 60+ people who presumably exercised their own free will in deciding how to vote... not that it is really going to matter, given the spamming that was apparently done in favor of a "keep" vote. Personally I think the spam-ees can exercise their free will how they wish also, but evidently it is against the rules anyway. Why don't you seem to be concerned about <i>that</i>, rather than focusing on a poorly worded nomination? <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 21:26, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've nominated several lists and a template for speedy deletion. I don't think they meet the standard rules for speedy deletions. They all include redlinked or unlinked names. The lists or templates they are on would be defamatory if they are not accurate. Since the names don't have articles the potentially defamatory information is unsourced. Under the current policy regarding biographies of living persons such information would deleted without hesitation if in ordinary articles. So I think the lists and template should be speedy deleted.

I furthermore don't see saying someone is a porn star as inherently defamatory, nor do I think many editors would. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 21:32, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>One definition of defamation listed in the WP article is "any published statements which defame a named or identifiable individual or individuals in a manner which causes them loss in their trade or profession, or causes a reasonable person to think worse of him, her or them." There are many reasonable people who would think less of someone who was a porn star or sex trade worker. US law is statebystate. Porn stars have sex for money and many people think of them as prostitutes. These are "negative" statements to many many people to use Jimbo's word and should be sourced if they're to be in WP. But the lists with so many nolinked and redlinked names are obviously unsourced. What happens if the names match up to real actors or models? Even if that's not what the person who wrote the list meant. Some of the names are obvious fakes that no one outside porn would use but there are lots of "real" names. No good reason to keep these lists and template around but lots of problems. <a href="../../../h/u/l/User%7EHullaballoo_Wolfowitz_1fda.html" title="User:Hullaballoo Wolfowitz">The editor formerly known as Harmonica Wolfowitz</a> 22:03, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I understand your concerns, but IMHO Gerd is far from claiming "ownership" of the article, he is just the editor that does most of the work expanding and improving the article (mostly because the rest of us in the WikiProject Automobiles are too lazy), as well as usually the first to remove strange and inappropriate statements from it. I put the info on that here to explain the relation between the issue and comments on Gerd's talk page.</dd>

<dd>If we were to have to deal with a hotel-owned IP, I would suggest that a 24 hr block be the maximum we apply, as the IP may be assigned to the room (unlikely) or roll among the various IP's. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:12, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I have put notices on all the accounts. In the meantime, I think the evidence is so clear that an immediate ban can be made.

<dd>the "divine curses" are of course unacceptable and sufficient reason for a block. As Andries, I am unsure about the "link-spamming" charge, since the site linked is actually quite good, and the user added the link to pertinent articles: I doubt the links would have been removed if he had not self-identified as the site's owner. It appears the user was treated somewhat unfairly preceding his outburst. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 09:01, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Looking at the Angry Clueless Newbie rants, I can understand the impulse to block. But he has only been here for two days, is apparently <b>using his real name</b>, and is asking to "have his **** account out of this ***** encyclopedia." That's a vulnerable constellation, that we need to be considerate of. The account can't actually be "removed", right? Somebody please correct me if I'm wrong about that. I think his request should be taken to mean he wants the userpages deleted. I've done that, and hope they won't remain in Google's cache for very long. I've changed the indef block to a three-day cooling-down period, so he'll have a clean slate and no CheckUser issues if he should change his mind about contributing in the future (and in that case, I trust, register a different username).

<dd>Some remove 'bad faith' warnings placed on theirs and other's talk pages, but it can be dangerous because it can be used to justify the removal of good faith warnings. Personally, I would either leave it alone (no-one is going to read a warning placed by an IP address and think you must be a vandal) or leave a reply below it making clear that it's a bad faith warning. No need for a lengthy defence going into what the IP was doing and why you were reverting, just write ':Bad faith warning' or similar. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 13:35, 12 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A tag? The form of a tag? Argghh. I've said this before, and will pay <a href="../../../m/y/_/My_two_cents_%28idiom%29.html" title="My two cents (idiom)">good money</a> to the user who makes me a {{tagwarningwarning}} template of it: opinions don't acquire any miraculous virtue or special immunity against removal by being expressed in the form of a tag. Too many people have the notion that if only they use a tag, they're free to harass users by endlessly reverting their talkpages and threatening them. Planting warning templates frivolously and then triumpantly accusing the person who removes them of "vandalism" is misuse of process. I'm getting so I'd like to see it a blockable offence. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 04:15, 12 August 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>Harassment <i>is</i> a blockable offense. Though personally I feel that applies to <i>everyone</i> using the 'OMG, they removed a warning tag!' excuse to harass people. This isn't "misuse of process"... because there isn't any process which supports it in the first place. As I said before, <a href="../../../r/e/m/Wikipedia%7ERemoving_warnings_48c6.html" title="Wikipedia:Removing warnings">Wikipedia:Removing warnings</a> is a <b>proposal</b>.

<p>How many users that get a warning tag feel it is illegimate? Probably most of them. That's why there is a procedure to follow, which does not involve unilateral deletion. These are really not convincing arguments. Is there a second set of rules that applies to everyone else besides me? What is written in policy and what happened, which violated that policy is all crystal clear (above). People can deny, rationalize, and namecall me all they want. All this does is attack Wikipedia and its processes, not me. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarastro777_95c7.html" title="User:Sarastro777">Sarastro777</a> 04:35, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think the sockpuppetry is almost assured. One redlink account provides "proof" that the software is the best thing ever, and then Antman says, "I have proved that the software exists." This is aside from the identical paranoid insults coming from one of them (ZeekGeek) and him. If he throws these away, I wouldn't care, as they're not accomplishing anything on DRV (DRV is not a second AfD, etc.), but he has gone superheated and <i>could</i> be blocked.

<p>Wow. That discussion has gone up to 40KB now. I think it's just gotten a little out of control; isn't DRV supposed to be about <i>process</i> disputes, not <i>content</i> disputes?

<dd>Man, why was that even an AfD? When there is a hoax like that, it's pretty much simple vandalism. "New Blogism goes back to the ancient Greeks" is patent absurdity.

<p>No. You are incorrect. A hoax that is a fully fledged deception, like the Spaghetti Monster, cannot be a speedy delete. On the other hand, "Alex Bradford is the coolest. In 2008 he conquered Asia and made himself king of the grand mukluk" is vandalism. "New Blogism has been around since the ancient Greeks" is in the latter category. It's a "hoax" only in that it is a lie. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:40, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hoax articles come in two categories: (1) articles describing hoaxes as hoaxes and (2) articles attempting to mislead the audience. Hoaxes-as-hoaxes can be notable (see <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_hoaxes.html" title="List of hoaxes">List of hoaxes</a>) or non-notable ("In 2006 John claimed Alex conquered Asia in 2008"). Attempts to mislead the audience can be credible or non-credible. Credible attempts to mislead should be evaluated by the community. In this case, the "ancient Greece" claim wasn't credible, and there was consensus that the article should be deleted. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small><a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../a/u/g/August_13.html" title="August 13">08-13</a> 03:04Z</small></i></span></p>

<dd>Quarl has it right, essentially, except that outright lies are simple vandalism. The CSD categories are somewhat contradictory, if you read each word as an absolute. What is the difference between going into <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_the_Great_5bb4.html" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a> and putting "was a fag" on it and writing a new article called Alexander the Great was a fag? The latter could say, "He was a big homo who only got with chicks when they was skanks." Is it no longer vandalism because it's a new article? If it is vandalism, then there is zero tolerance, and it's a speedy delete. Any article making an obviously impossible claim for itself (people born a decade after they died, doing great deeds a century before they were born, doing something remarkable in the future) is just vandalism and a proper speedy delete. This is different from the high level hoax. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 04:24, 13 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>The New Blogism article wasn't a simple hoax or pure vandalism - the "New Blogism dates back to the ancient Greeks" was a (not very good) attempt at humor by the author and not the main "claim" of the article. It shouldn't have been speedied as a hoax or vandalism. AfD was the right venue for it, and the debate correctly ended in a Delete decision.

<p>Because of recent edit wars at <a href="../../../m/y/s/Power_Rangers%7E_Mystic_Force_ca8f.html" title="Power Rangers: Mystic Force">Power Rangers: Mystic Force</a> over the use of the colon in the title, a discussion was set up at <a href="../../../p/o/w/Talk%7EPower_Rangers%7E_Mystic_Force_97bc.html" title="Talk:Power Rangers: Mystic Force">Talk:Power Rangers: Mystic Force</a> to decide anything. Through discussion at the English Wikipedia IRC channel we have come to the the conclusion that the colon is what is should be used, since it is grammatically correct to utilize it to differentiate between the title (Power Rangers) and the subtitle (Mystic Force, and all other similar series' names). However, because I linked the Spanish Wikipedia page at a fan forum where they have decided to run a poll to decide for Wikipedia, the Spanish article was unilaterally moved (I registered and moved it back). Frankly, since this issue now crosses languages, I think it requires more administrative know-how, perhaps from Spanish Wiki admins, as well. This issue has gone past any sort of simple discussion, as a user has unilaterally moved the pages on the English Wikipedia at least five times (not all at the article that is currently fully protected). So far, I have had to revert the move at the Spanish Wiki twice, so far. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryūlóng</a> 22:35, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I noticed you claimed that NPOV77 is a confirmed puppet of mine? Where was this confirmed? I think you will find that this is one of those in the "suspected" category. You know, no evidence, other than the "secret liguistic" evidence presented by ideological opponents who would rather I not be here to make it easier for them to bias articles with their POV. But, confirmed, No, never has been. I also note that you say 'he has many <i>confirmed</i> socket puppets, such as (naming two (one false), so as to suggest there are more than two--which is not true. I suggest you retract your statement, and I give you the benefit of the doubt of an honest mistake, since unlike others, I do assume good faith.<a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">Giovanni33</a> 09:26, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Giovanni has two confirmed puppets, and ten suspected ones. And I hasten to add that they are not suspected simply because they have the same POV. Alienus, who sided with Giovanni, and reverted to his version, was <i>never</i> suspected of being connected to Giovanni.

<dd>But, ofcourse. That is your plan and desire, is it not? If you can't kill the message you kill the messenger. Nothing surprising there.

<dd>You also fail to mention that your block was issued by you while you were a party to the dispute to give you an advantage in the content dispute. How is this within the "rules and guildines?"</dd>
<dd>Turning over a new leaf? Yes, I did, however others did not. That is why they pursued me to my own user page to insult me with a label that purports to make a claim that is about 8 months old!! Yet, it is only now deemed necessary to affront my user page with it? No logical answer has yet been given for this odd timing, other than the obvious reason that such a scarlet letter serves to futher insult and humiliate, to poison the well to whoever takes a look at my user page.

<dd>Deskana's 24-hour block of Giovanni was most definitely not to gain advantage in a content dispute.

<p>First of all, I hope Essjaybot II's feelings won't be hurt, but I've undone the archiving of this section! I was getting ready to make a comment, and found it had been archived after one day. (I had previously been thinking that Werdnabot was over hasty in archiving after <i>two</i> days!) I've also changed the heading from "{{userlinks|Giovanni33}}" to "Giovanni33 once again", as it makes it possible to get directly to this section from the little arrow when looking at the history of the page.

<p>In case people don't know, Giovanni posted to Danny <a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDanny_9d6e.html#Resolution_Sought" title="User talk:Danny">here</a> saying he wants to prove his innocence by showing that BelindaGong is a real person (faxing marriage certificate, and IDs), so that she can edit here again. He seems not to understand that her existence does not prove his innocence. As documented in various places, he was warned repeatedly, from 16 January, that he was violating 3RR, and continued massive violations. On 23 January, he was sent a message saying that he had reached his maximum number of reverts allowed under the 3RR policy,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:64.121.40.153&amp;diff=36350842&amp;oldid=35473168" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:64.121.40.153&amp;diff=36350842&amp;oldid=35473168" rel="nofollow">[49]</a> and less than half an hour later, BelindaGong, from an IP, did <i>"rv to better version. I've been following in talk page"</i>.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christianity&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=36351802" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christianity&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=36351802" rel="nofollow">[50]</a> She then registered an account, and made a total of five reverts in just over four hours, and started following him to other pages, to help with votes, and reverts, while they pretended not to know each other. Likewise, with his "friend" Freethinker99. Giovanni wants him to be allowed to edit again. His short career on Wikipedia consisted of:</p>

</ol>
<p>The problem with Giovanni is that he seems not to be able to acknowledge that his behaviour has been problematic. For over five months, he denied <i>any</i> wrongdoing with regard to the Belinda and Freethinker puppetry. He posted things about how had had violated 3RR once or twice in the very beginning, when he didn't know the policy, despite the fact that there are <i>numerous</i> diffs to show how he was told about the policy and continued grossly violating it. (See <a href="../../../g/i/o/User_talk%7EGiovanni33_9764.html#Claim_that_your_3RR_violations_were_when_you_didn.27t_know_the_policy" title="User talk:Giovanni33">here</a>.) After about five months, he finally acknowledged that getting his wife and friend to join and support himi was a "mistake". He claims that he didn't know that the Belinda meatpuppetry (if that's what it was — there's some indication that he made some of her posts using her account) was wrong, although there are diffs to show that the <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a> policy (which also forbids accounts created by friends for support) was explained to him at the time. He also carried out some rather unpleasant trolling at SlimVirgin's talk page, when she temporarily left Wikipedia, and he took up residence at her page and started telling everyone that this was just emotional manipulation, and that she wouldn't admit it yet but she was going to come back, and that if it turned out he was wrong, he'd convert and be a good Christian, and then started reverting her when she removed his taunts.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SlimVirgin&amp;diff=56080488&amp;oldid=56055782" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SlimVirgin&amp;diff=56080488&amp;oldid=56055782" rel="nofollow">[59]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SlimVirgin&amp;diff=56082047&amp;oldid=56080488" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SlimVirgin&amp;diff=56082047&amp;oldid=56080488" rel="nofollow">[60]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SlimVirgin&amp;diff=56082309&amp;oldid=56082047" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SlimVirgin&amp;diff=56082309&amp;oldid=56082047" rel="nofollow">[61]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SlimVirgin&amp;diff=56773295&amp;oldid=56753385" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SlimVirgin&amp;diff=56773295&amp;oldid=56753385" rel="nofollow">[62]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SlimVirgin&amp;diff=56847932&amp;oldid=56836821" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SlimVirgin&amp;diff=56847932&amp;oldid=56836821" rel="nofollow">[63]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SlimVirgin&amp;diff=56867747&amp;oldid=56862440" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SlimVirgin&amp;diff=56867747&amp;oldid=56862440" rel="nofollow">[64]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SlimVirgin&amp;diff=57002081&amp;oldid=56973771" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SlimVirgin&amp;diff=57002081&amp;oldid=56973771" rel="nofollow">[65]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SlimVirgin&amp;diff=57022798&amp;oldid=57010086" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SlimVirgin&amp;diff=57022798&amp;oldid=57010086" rel="nofollow">[66]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SlimVirgin&amp;diff=57023010&amp;oldid=57022798" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SlimVirgin&amp;diff=57023010&amp;oldid=57022798" rel="nofollow">[67]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SlimVirgin&amp;diff=57024750&amp;oldid=57023506" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SlimVirgin&amp;diff=57024750&amp;oldid=57023506" rel="nofollow">[68]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SlimVirgin&amp;diff=57025998&amp;oldid=57024838" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SlimVirgin&amp;diff=57025998&amp;oldid=57024838" rel="nofollow">[69]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SlimVirgin&amp;diff=57026822&amp;oldid=57026668" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SlimVirgin&amp;diff=57026822&amp;oldid=57026668" rel="nofollow">[70]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SlimVirgin&amp;diff=57027551&amp;oldid=57026879" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SlimVirgin&amp;diff=57027551&amp;oldid=57026879" rel="nofollow">[71]</a> He was <a href="../../../g/i/o/User_talk%7EGiovanni33_Archive1_605f.html#User_talk:SlimVirgin" title="User talk:Giovanni33/Archive1">completely unable to see that it was objectionable</a>, and started complaining about "censorship" and "abuse" and how he was going to "pursue this abuse in the appropriate manner", and even asked someone else to revert for him.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bhadani&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=57028881" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bhadani&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=57028881" rel="nofollow">[72]</a></p>
<p>Jayjg suggested <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive121_9df2.html#User:Giovanni33_again" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive121">here</a> that he should be indefinitely blocked until he admits his sockpuppetry. There was considerable support for that proposal. I was hesitating over it, knowing myself to be in content dispute with Giovanni, and unsure as to whether forcing him to own up would be preventative or punitive — and then Werdnabot came along and archived it. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoOne_b199.html" title="User:NeoOne">Another sockpuppet</a> has been found since. Is there any solution other than an indefinite block? On the one hand, Giovanni is not a vandal, and his talk page posts, though they're frequnetly objectionable with jibes about the moral and intellectual superiority of atheists over Christians, do not approach the aggressive, abusive hostility of, say, Alienus or FuelWagon. On the other hand, he frequently posts taunts at talk pages frequented by Christians, for example that Christians "don't like to talk about their origins. hehe", that when he looks at the Eucharist, he doesn't "see red blood cells. hehe", that Chrisianity is like believing that the moon is made of cheese, or referring to the Bible as "this particular book of such depraved moral instruction" etc. He has a history of reverting people who remove unwanted posts from their own talk pages. He has insisted on posting REALLY long essays (sometimes more than 3000 words) to "prove" that his POV is right, or pasting long sections of text from some website, again to prove that he's right, and sometimes cross-posting to other talk pages, despite being frequently told that the talk pages are for discussing possible improvements to articles, and not for determining which POV was the correct one. He was asked on various occasions<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Georg_Elser&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=40854406#Misuse_of_talk_page" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Georg_Elser&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=40854406#Misuse_of_talk_page" rel="nofollow">[73]</a> not to clutter up pages, and to link to other material instead of pasting it, but he kept on doing it, and sometimes even re-inserted it after someone else had removed it. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Positive_Christianity&amp;diff=60141556&amp;oldid=60140687" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Positive_Christianity&amp;diff=60141556&amp;oldid=60140687" rel="nofollow">[74]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Georg_Elser&amp;diff=40842952&amp;oldid=40836243#Evidence_for_the_Record" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Georg_Elser&amp;diff=40842952&amp;oldid=40836243#Evidence_for_the_Record" rel="nofollow">[75]</a>. He is a notorious edit warrior, and sockpuppeteer. He has shown through numerous untrue statements that he cannot be trusted. Almost all his edits are connected with his POV on religous or political matters. His very high average of edits per page suggests that he's here for a purpose. You never see him doing chores like stub sorting, reporting vandals, copyediting uncontroversial articles. As David Gerard has said, <i>"He's here to push a POV and will sock frantically to do it; he's not here to write an encyclopedia for anyone else."</i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=63882990" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=63882990" rel="nofollow">[76]</a></p>
<p>For months, we've had to deal with new users suddenly turning up to revert to Giovanni's version, and making the same spelling mistakes and showing the same mannerisms. Any tell-tale sign that he has been made aware of has been corrected. For example, after I drew attention to a post where MikaM finished a sentence and started a new one with a lower case "hehe", no puppet ever did that again. After I drew attention to the fact that BelindaGong, MikaM, Kecik, and Freethinker99 all had redlinked userpages when they turned up to support Gio, his next six (RTS, NPOV77, HK30, Mercury2001, Professor33, and NeoOne) all edited their user and talk pages as first and second edits before coming to Christianity. After I drew attention to the fact that Kecik had 27 reverts to Gio out of 29 article edits (and then 28 out of 30, 29 out of 31, etc.) and that he had never edited an article that Giovanni wasn't at, he made three very minor edits to other pages, and Professor33 took care to make a small number of edits to articles about Global warming (unconnected to Giovanni) while following Giovanni to other pages, reverting for him, and telling other editors in very Gio-like language why they were wrong and Gio was right.</p>
<p>If there were some way to block all his puppets as soon as they appear, I'd be happy with leaving Giovanni unblocked. He's definitely the main account, and when he's blocked the others don't show up to revert for him. But as he's completely unrepentant, what's to stop him from simply creating more? <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 14:21, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I see <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_WebEx_and_Min_Zhu_67fe.html#Meatpuppets" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/WebEx and Min Zhu">here</a> that the ArbCom said "A user who engages in the same behavior as another user in the same context, and who appears to be editing Wikipedia solely for that purpose, shall be subject to the remedies applied to the user whose behavior they are joining."

He has 45 article edits, of which 40 are reverts to Giovanni. The first thirty had 28 reverts to Giovanni, and two minor edits, made shortly after reverting. These edits were at <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> and <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>. In an edit war on something I know nothing about — whether the Nazi regime was fascist or totalitarian — he showed that it wasn't just in theological matters that he <i>happened</i> to agree with Giovanni.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adolf_Hitler&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=39929770" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adolf_Hitler&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=39929770" rel="nofollow">[77]</a> (I stated that I would not take sides in that, as I had no opinion, although I was part of the opposition to Giovanni's efforts to say that Hitler was a devout Christian.) After I had pointed out repeatedly on talk pages that his edits were almost exclusively reverts to Giovanni (see also the two edit summaries, side by side, in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christianity&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=49491140" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christianity&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=49491140" rel="nofollow">this edit</a>), and that he never edited anything that Giovanni didn't edit, he made his very first non-Giovanni-related edit<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Michael_Learns_to_Rock&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=53216444" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Michael_Learns_to_Rock&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=53216444" rel="nofollow">[78]</a> <i>after almost four months on Wikipedia</i>. He then made two more minor edits, unconnected to Giovanni.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Human&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=54880000" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Human&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=54880000" rel="nofollow">[79]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Human&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=54880274" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Human&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=54880274" rel="nofollow">[80]</a> — nothing like contributing content. In the meantime, he turned up at <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a>, supporting Giovanni in his campaign to insert a link to a "create-your-own-God-it's-fast-easy-and-fun" website, and then turned up at <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitler%27s_Pope_311e.html" title="Hitler's Pope">Hitler's Pope</a> to revert for Giovanni, there.</dd>
<dd>He has twenty talk page edits, on pages where Giovanni was meeting opposition. They are the talk pages of <a href="../../../e/a/r/Early_Christianity_6b3f.html" title="Early Christianity">Early Christianity</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transubstantiation.html" title="Transubstantiation">Transubstantiation</a>, and <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a>. He always arrived at those pages only <i>after</i> Giovanni. He has fourteen user page edits — mostly removing puppet tags from his own page or those of Giovanni's other suspected puppets. I don't consider that that's compelling evidence of his puppetry, though, because if (and I mean <i><b>IF</b></i>) he were innocent, it would be a natural reaction to want to help the other "innocent victims". And he has five user talk page edits. I find it particularly significant that his <i>seventh</i> edit was to vote for including Giovanni's "the-transubstantiation-doctrine-evolved-from-pagan-cannibalistic-rites" POV<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Transubstantiation&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=36669860" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Transubstantiation&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=36669860" rel="nofollow">[81]</a> and that the <i>sixth</i> edit from <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikaM_b05b.html" title="User:MikaM"><tt class="userlinks" style="1.3em">MikaM</tt></a> (<span class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikaM_ad39.html" title="User talk:MikaM">talk</a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MikaM_bf6b.html" title="Special:Contributions/MikaM">contribs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">logs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../b/l/o/Special%7EBlockip_MikaM_5b28.html" title="Special:Blockip/MikaM">block user</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">block log</a></span>) was a vote at the same page, even though the talk pages they started off at did not link there, they would be unlikely to stumble across that page by chance, they did not have e-mail enabled, and no message about it had been left on their talk pages.

<p>Jayjg's <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive121_9df2.html#User:Giovanni33_again" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive121">original suggestion</a> was to block Giovanni until he came clean about his sockpuppetry. The suggestion gained considerable support, and while I was thinking of what to say, one of those bots came along and archived it. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProfessor33_6069.html" title="User:Professor33">Professor33</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoOne_b199.html" title="User:NeoOne">NeoOne</a>, and <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleanSocks_241c.html" title="User:CleanSocks">CleanSocks</a> have been <b>confirmed</b> (through checkuser) as Giovanni33 sockpuppets since then. One reason for my hesitation (apart from the fact that I have been in content dispute with Giovanni since his arrival) was that while a parent or teacher would want to make someone "own up", it's not part of Wikipedian duties to assist in the moral formation of other Wikipedians! As the puppetry and denial continued, I becamse more and more convinced that Jayjg's solution was necessary, <i>not</i> for the purposes of character formation(!), but as the <i>only</i> possible way of getting the puppetry to stop.</p>
<p>It seems that Giovanni has now come as close as he can without losing face to admitting sockpuppetry. See <a href="../../../g/i/o/User_talk%7EGiovanni33_9764.html#Block_extended_to_one_month" title="User talk:Giovanni33">this</a> section of his talk page. I'd urge any admin who has time to read it. There's no evidence of contrition, but there is evidence of realizing that continued puppetry won't achieve anything, and it seems that he's prepared to agree to conditions that would render any future puppets powerless to simulate a false consensus or to give him extra reverts.</p>
<p>In my view, there are two possible approaches to take. One: he's not sorry. He's just making this <i>implicit</i> admission as a means of avoiding an indefinite block, and if ever he finds a means of posting (or getting a friend to post) from an IP that definitely can't be traced to him, he'll do exactly the same thing again, but just with a little extra caution. Therefore, he should be indefinitely blocked. Two: it doesn't matter to Wikipedia if he's contrite or not. He seems to have realized that his puppetry won't achieve anything and that it's only hurting him in the long run. He's prepared to agree to some rather strict conditions which would mean that he couldn't gain any advantage in a content dispute through the use of puppets, as he won't be allowed to revert or vote or give supporting arguments if even one of his (present or future) <i>suspected</i> puppets is on a page.</p>
<p>I am prepared to go along with the second approach, though I would call for an indefinite ban if his former behaviour resumes. If we can put an end to the sockpuppeting, there's no need to rub his nose in the mud. If administrators can come to some agreement about conditions, and if Giovanni agrees to them, I'd even (subject, of course, to MONGO's agreement) agree to an early unblocking as soon as he accepts the conditions, regardless of whether or not the original week (not to mention the whole month) has expired. I don't think any of his editing opponents would taunt him over his past. If that happened, I would try to put a stop to it. There would be no need to bring up his past, if he's not making snide remarks about his opponents being meatpuppets, or claiming that there's consensus when it's strongly suspected that the consensus comes at least partly from accounts that were created in order to support him.</p>
<p>In return for this act of good will (though it probably shouldn't be among the unblocking conditions), I would like Giovanni to agree to stop making taunts about the "<a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_Church_7422.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">bigoted, sexist, homophobic</a>" institution that I belong to, or about how he doesn't "see any red blood cells in the wine. hehe", and also to agree that if people remove posts from their own talk page (other than legitimate warnings from administrators or in the case of something like vandalism) it is their right to do so, whether he agrees with it or not, and they should not be harassed with reverts.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Str1977&amp;diff=52949255&amp;oldid=52812378" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Str1977&amp;diff=52949255&amp;oldid=52812378" rel="nofollow">[82]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SlimVirgin&amp;diff=57024750&amp;oldid=57023506" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SlimVirgin&amp;diff=57024750&amp;oldid=57023506" rel="nofollow">[83]</a></p>
<p>I feel that MikaM and Kecik should be blocked indefinitely, as they are both accounts that were set up for the purpose of supporting and reverting to Giovanni, as I showed in Part Two of this section. If they are separate people (and it seems that some of their posts were made from different IPs at times when Giovanni was also editing), though the linguistic idiosyncrasies are hard to explain away, they can make that argument on their talk pages, and give some explanation for how they found the voting at the Transubstantiation page just after registering, and why they spent over four months following Giovanni to unrelated articles to revert for him. If they actually want to edit Wikipedia for the sake of Wikipedia rather than for the sake of Giovanni, they can request to be unblocked on certain conditions.</p>
<p>If all his puppets are blocked (for good measure, <a href="../../../r/t/s/User%7ERTS_b316.html" title="User:RTS"><tt class="userlinks" style="1.3em">RTS</tt></a> (<span class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../r/t/s/User_talk%7ERTS_9737.html" title="User talk:RTS">talk</a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RTS_4276.html" title="Special:Contributions/RTS">contribs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">logs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../b/l/o/Special%7EBlockip_RTS_3588.html" title="Special:Blockip/RTS">block user</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">block log</a></span>) should be blocked as well), and since Giovanni seems to have realized that it's not to his advantage to use them, and if he agrees to the conditions he has suggested on his talk page (perhaps refined and modified through suggestions here), which would mean he can't revert or vote or support by arguments if one of his suspected puppets is at a page, then I would even agree to the removal of the {{<a href="../../../s/o/c/Template%7ESockpuppeteer_43b0.html" title="Template:Sockpuppeteer">sockpuppeteer</a>}} tag on his user page, as a gesture of good will, to allow him to start afresh, free from any unnecessary humiliation. It would, of course, be replaced if his puppetry resumed.</p>
<p>That's my proposal. Suggestions, please! <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 13:28, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>AnnH's second suggestion is fine with me. I don't mind if Giovanni33 edits, as long as he entirely stops using puppets. Since everyone knows about the puppets, and has for some time, I see no point in demanding any more explicit confession. Certainly all the puppets should be indefinitely blocked and identified on their user pages. It's pretty clear that this is his last chance. If it doesn't work out, indefinite blocking is all that's left. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 17:21, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I should have mentioned this in my last post, but I cannot thank Jayjg enough for unearthing this. I don't know quite what's involved in a checkuser, but I'm sure it's a fairly tedious business. I'd also like to thank Linuxbeak and Kelly Martin, who, without having seen the linguistic evidence, and probably with no prior knowledge of Giovanni's sockpuppetry, thought that the block of Professor33 was unjust, but who, rather than jumping straight in and unblocking without discussion, were prepared to ask to see the evidence. I think this case goes to prove that while another admin can undo an unblock in the case of the blocking admin having miscounted reverts (or something similar) and not being online, in the case of sockpuppet blocks, it's always good to ask for the evidence, which often cannot be made public, for fear of teaching puppeteers how to get better at it. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 17:59, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I am the blocking admin of Giovanni33. I recently blocked for one week and then upped it to one month after further confirmed proof emerged that Giovanni33 had just recently edited using sock accounts. I suppose Giovanni33 is not going to simply admit that he has been using sock accounts, but that is what I would like to see. I mentioned on Giovanni33's talk page that I might reduce the existing block back to one week, which should expire about 8/15, at which time I can lift the block. I'll lift the block on the 15th and I'll remove the sock template from Gio's userpage. I would like one last comment from Gio that he will behave which he can post on his usertalk. I'm then stepping aside from the issue but urge that any further incidents of disruption and creation of sock accounts by Gio result in a long term blocking.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 07:51, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I (non-admin, I should say) support Ann's proposal, but I think Gio really needs to agree to stop making ANY personal commentary about editors and allegations about their motives for trying to enforce policy. I have found some of his numerous claims about Ann, in particular, and her alleged motives to be really unfair and inappropriate. Sarah Ewart (Talk) 14:08, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I would agree to these terms... as long as Giovanni is aware that I won't tolerate further violations of policy and won't hesitate to indefblock him should he violate them. --<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDeskana_5f27.html" title="User:Deskana">Lord Deskana</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDeskana_208e.html" title="User talk:Deskana">talk</a>) 16:02, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>AnnH asked me to comment... so I will. I think far too many words have been wasted over someone of at best marginal value to wikipedia, and probably negative value when you factor in the ttime needed to deal with G. So I would be inclined to retain the block until a promise not to use socks for any purpose is obtained; and not to respond to any more weaselly lawyering from G <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M.

<p>Giovanni33 has now been unblocked, and the tag has been removed from his user page, as I suggested. He has agreed to follow the policies, and has agreed that if users are suspected of being his puppets, he will leave the pages where they appear, and will not support them, revert with them, or vote with them. If he invites a friend to join Wikipedia, he will state this openly. He has also apologized for the commentaries about other editors and their motives, etc. He has not yet responded to a request that he will agree not to participate in any external sites that engage in what could be considered attacking or harassment of Wikipedians, but I imagine that he will respond to that when he next logs on. (I don't accuse him of actually having done that, but point out that an account which showed a clear connection to him did take part in such activities.) I'm hopeful that there won't be any more problems. I think he understands that there are various ways in which puppets can be caught, and that further evidence of puppetry would lead to an indefinite block. Before I go on wiki-break, I want to thank everyone who has helped and supported me in this case.

<dd>No. Pschemp is absolutely correct to place this condition. "Neo-nazi" is a very severe label that can cost people their jobs and livelihoods. As we have seen (in my case on two occasions), witch-hunting is still very much alive. The label should never be used carelessly in the way KarlV did - in his case implicitly (which is worse!).

<dd>If you mean what KarlV regards as the mistake, I don't know. If you're asking what happened: in brief, KarlV was told that some far-right editors had managed to become admins on the English Wikipedia. Karl had had difficulty removing "concentration camp" from the German Wikipedia (with regard to a British internment camp), and he was told it'd be even harder to remove it from here because of the right-wing admins. So he came here to remove concentration camp from <a href="../../../b/a/d/Bad_Nenndorf_5717.html" title="Bad Nenndorf">Bad Nenndorf</a>, and to see whether he would prevented (none of the sources call it a concentration camp). Samsara and pschemp reverted him. He violated 3RR. Samsara blocked him for 24 hours. Then pschemp blocked him indefinitely for <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. Samsara also posts to the German Wikipedia. I don't know about pschemp. I asked pschemp to unblock because she was involved in the content dispute. For that reason, Lar took over the block. That's it. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 00:23, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>We reverted to stop an edit war while which term was correct was being worked out. Since when is it crime to stop an edit war so discussion can happen? That is the action that got Samsara and I labeled as a right-wing admin (ie. right wing in German means neo-nazi). Once again, the content is irrelevant, its the experimenting with Wikipedia and subsequent suspicion cast on people trying to improve an article that was his violation. And once again, the original block didn't happen until after the content dispute was over and the current article with NONE of those words was agreed on. I want a personal apology for his actions as they led to two innocent admins being accused of being a right-wing neo-nazi.

<dd>Sorry if I'm a bit short with you, but if you work through the edit history of the original article, its pretty clear who edited what when.

<dd>I remember the Guardian did use some sensationalistic terms ("torture camp" if not concentration camp), but that doesn't make those terms neutral phrasing suitable for the article intro. In fact IIRC when the term was added to the article on de, the article also got added to the German category meaning "internment camps". Btw, I got an email from KarlV that I'll summarize later. I let it slide because the discussion had gone off the radar and he said in his email that he'd be away for a month. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 01:02, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The issue I am bringing up is that KarlV stated that the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concentration_camp.html" title="Concentration camp">concentration camp</a> article was inaccurate (by his reading, I am not an expert on the subject), yet made no attempt to fix it, which should have been any <i>bona fide</i> editor's first instinct. - <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamsara_87dc.html" title="User:Samsara">Samsara</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamsara_83cc.html" title="User talk:Samsara">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Samsara_6f94.html" title="Special:Contributions/Samsara">contribs</a>) 00:41, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Declassified Whitehall papers show that members of the Labour government of the day went to great lengths to hide the ill-treatment, in part, as one minister wrote, to conceal "the fact that we are alleged to have treated internees <i>I the German concentration camps</i>". <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/germany/article/0,,1745711,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/germany/article/0,,1745711,00.html" rel="nofollow">[93]</a></dd>

<dd>I disagree Shanel... moving comments is perfectly acceptable in many circumstances. I do it all the time when a new user posts a note at the top of a talk page rather than the bottom. 'Tickle me' did it here because Samsara had posted comments in the <i>middle</i> of his own (what he meant by 'interposting')... which left 'Tickle me's' comments above the 'interposting' apparently unsigned... or incorrectly attributed to Samsara. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=68953888&amp;oldid=68952307" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=68953888&amp;oldid=68952307" rel="nofollow">here</a> for the edit by Samsara. Given the potentially confusing nature of such a 'middle post' I don't think moving it down was unreasonable, and reverting the edit Samsara made to &gt;Tickle me's&lt; comments was certainly appropriate. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 13:51, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Correct. I dispute the propriety of Burke's forging a source and Samsara helping him - and I want them to give sensible answers eventually. I want to know if there's reason behind Karl's motives, even if the involved accuse him of sheer disruptiveness - I mustn't follow suit. He had trouble with them, and I want to know why. And I'm concerned that Burke's actions, not covered by WP:AGF, don't bother most participants. Karl is painted as paranoid. Severe enough a claim to warrant a close inspection of the circumstances, forgery warranting sanction by itself. --<a href="../../../t/i/c/User%7ETickle_me_f9ac.html" title="User:Tickle me">tickle</a> <a href="../../../t/i/c/User_talk%7ETickle_me_c608.html" title="User talk:Tickle me">me</a> 10:01, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're completely missing the message here. Nobody else cared whether the statements were supported by the sources. I cared. I made sure that there was nothing there that was not supported by the sources. I may not have paid enough attention on whether "concentration camp" or "torture camp" or "internment camp" or "military prison" or whatever else various people (you can't please everybody) wanted to be used, was the exact wording. And what you call weasel words is what I call balanced presentation. I fixed the exact problem you're complaining about. And where were you when this happened? Did you care? Evidently not. I performed a community service, and I accept no criticism for that fact. As I have stated several times, I am not intimately familiar with the subject and have entirely stopped being involved.

Your synchronized attack edits on this page make me wonder if <a href="../../../t/i/n/WP%7ETINC_0d39.html" title="WP:TINC">WP:TINC</a> should be AfD'd. You four are an embarrassment to wikis everywhere, especially Wikimedia wikis. Tickles's and Slim's campaign of misinformation is rivaled only by Nazi propagandists. If KarlV does not wish to apologize, Lar's block should <b>never</b> be lifted. If SlimVirgin (et al.) wish to press the issue, their impartiality (and suitability as sysops) should be seriously questioned.</li>
<li>User:KarlV obviously has some serious language problems here. The German term <a href="../../../../de/i/n/t/Internierungslager.html" class="extiw" title="de:Internierungslager">de:Internierungslager</a> doesn't have any currency in English when translated as internment camp; see <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internment.html#Concentration_Camp" title="Internment">Internment#Concentration Camp</a>. The English term has propagandist connotations, but is so rare that native speakers invariably do not know the term. In English, the term is <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concentration_camp.html" title="Concentration camp">concentration camp</a>, regardless of when or where, or under what regime it occurred. In context, I think the Wikipedia article now conveys less information, as a result of having the language weakened (to satisfy a certain Nazi Germany propaganda POV.)</li>

<dd>I'm a bit concerned that my request for Karl's indefinite block be reviewed has now mutated into "misinformation". Rather than rehash the whole story, or get into personal conflicts, can we consider that Karl tried to improve inaccurate wording in an article, broke 3rr, got a block for it, and was then blocked indefinitely for WP:POINT because he described his action as an "experiment". As he has now apologised and stated he won't repeat the action he was blocked for, can his indef block be reviewed? That's all.</dd>

<dd>The above is an absolutely indecipherable mess. Can't <b>anyone</b> in this imbroglio give a straight answer? However, if I read between the lines and assume the <i>worst</i> then it seems like what we have here is a user who violated 3RR to make a WP:POINT about perceived enWP POV bias, and then accused the people who had edit warred/blocked him of being 'right wing' and/or 'nazis'. Anything else? Because if not... that's not grounds for an indefinite block. Short block for edit warring - yes. Short block for incivility / personal attack - yes. Indefinite block? No. Not unless there is alot more to it. Connel MacKenzie just above stated that users weakened the article "to satisfy a certain Nazi Germnay propaganda POV" and compared various users to "Nazi propagandists". Is that grounds for an indefinite block? Or just really ironic (this 'nazi comparison' is just fine... but that other one demands an indef block)? We block users indefinitely when it is clear that they will never be positive contributors. Can anyone make that claim here? Are there other 'bad acts' which haven't been mentioned? If there aren't then I see no basis for this block to be indefinite. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 14:24, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Then let me be perfectly clear: the <b>action</b> of rewording "<a href="../../../c/o/n/Concentration_camp.html" title="Concentration camp">concentration camp</a>" as "<a href="../../../i/n/t/Internment_camp.html" title="Internment camp">internment camp</a>" in my eyes is viewed as a propagandist action meant to weaken the severity of the atrocity. The term torture camp <i>(note: currently a red-link)</i> is as rare in American English as is <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internment_camp.html" title="Internment camp">internment camp</a>; both seem to have astonishingly narrow usage, while <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concentration_camp.html" title="Concentration camp">concentration camp</a> is the only colloquially understood term. On that basis, I <i>could</i> suggest "neo-nazi" ties for KarlV and his supporters, but I don't think that I have. Instead, I used strong language regarding the <b>action</b> that was taken. Ironically, KarlV has made those insinuations (from my reading of the translation link below.) --<a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConnel_MacKenzie_91fe.html" title="User:Connel MacKenzie">Connel MacKenzie</a> - <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User_talk:Connel_MacKenzie" class="extiw" title="wikt:User_talk:Connel_MacKenzie">wikt</a> 19:17, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A few things. One is that Wikipedia is not limited to American English, it should be general.

I am no historian, but afaik, in mainstream German historiography, the term ‘concentration camp’ (in either language) is used primarily for certain detention facilities in Nazi Germany. The use of the term for any other purpose is editorialising at best, and therefore very questionable outside of quotations and quite inappropriate if not adequately supported by sources (which was the case). This is independent of the severity of the atrocities perpetrated by British troops in the Bad Nenndorf facility. How advocating a change from ‘concentration camp’ to an historically more proper term, and, moreover, one supported by sources, could suggest neo-Nazi ties is very unclear to me. —<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzy_n_12cc.html" title="User:Xyzzy n">xyzzy</a><sub><a href="../../../x/y/z/User_talk%7EXyzzy_n_2d1b.html" title="User talk:Xyzzy n">n</a></sub> 20:21, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Connel, I don't think 'internment camp' is all that rare in American English. For instance, anyone who knows much about our WWII era treatment of Japanese Americans is certainly familiar with the term. As to suggestions of 'neo-Nazi' ties... any such which KarlV engaged in were, if anything, far more oblique than your statements at the top of the preceding section. He was apparently condemned for, 'being interpreted to imply that he might have been mistaken in his earlier belief that there were no 'right wing' biases in English Wikipedia'. You said that 'Tickle me' and 'SlimVirgin' were "rivaled only by Nazi propagandists" in their 'misinformation campaign' and that the article was weakened "to satisfy a certain Nazi Germany propaganda POV"... which assuredly must imply that someone, presumably those you are disputing, holds such a Nazi POV. Mind you, I <b>don't</b> think this kind of incivility and personal attack is grounds for an indefinite block, though I strongly discourage it, but the marked difference in response to the two situations seems probative to me. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 21:32, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Why are you changing the topic? CBD said my statements were oblique...well, perhaps they were. The specific statement I was refuting was CBD saying "<b>I don't think 'internment camp' is all that rare in American English.</b>" His conclusion is obviously wrong. Note also, that the searches listed above <i>do</i> also include some European texts; in American English the difference seems more pronounced. In this discussion, I'd like to emphasize the irony that CBD pointed out elsewhere; that all parties involved seem to be trying to achieve the same NPOV wording. But the European terminology (or at the very least, the German terminology) seems to be at odds with a NPOV American wording of the same concepts. I don't think entry <i>itself</i> has been edited recently; that ship has already sailed.

<p>For what it is worth, Concentration Camp in english is in the scholary literature used as an umbrella term for various types of camps, including death camps, internment camps, labour camps, etc. In Dutch and German, it is uniquely limited to Nazi Death camps. <small>with thanks to my historian neighbour</small> -- <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimvdLinde_061a.html" title="User:KimvdLinde">Kim van der Linde</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/m/User_talk%7EKimvdLinde_a7d1.html" title="User talk:KimvdLinde">at venus</a></sup> 03:54, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ditto. IF he should apologise in a way that admits fault, culpability and contrition, I'd have reason to believe that we won't be seeing further trouble from him, and would support a reduction. I see no sign of that though. It's also worthy of note that KarlV has placed block review requests on his page more than once, and had them declined more than once as well. However, you will have to look in the history for that, as SlimVirgin, standing on process, has removed all evidence of prior requests by silently reverting attempts to bring them back (the attempts had explanations of why the prior requests are relevant in this case, and she characterised that as reverting without discussion, while denying that her reversion is a reversion without discussion). Since she's trying to make a case that there is no consensus for an indef block, removing evidence that uninvolved admins have reviewed and declined seems to be giving the appearance of hiding things a bit. Some summary of prior requests seems relevant regardless of the wording of the template. and ought to be present on the page for the benefit of uninvolved admins. She has also reverted my attempts to refactor the discussion I had with her to keep it all in one place for convenience. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 13:50, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm afraid you're going to have to read quite carefully. KarlV does not make direct accusations. He insinuates things about alternatively one, two or an indeterminate number of admins, whom he refuses to name. He also simultaneously denies having implied anything.

<dd>CBD, Tickle me has also insinuated this. I've repeatedly used the words "implying" and "insinuating" as that is what was done by both. There is a cultural aspect to this too that English speakers and non-Europeans will likely not understand. Kim has explained it well above. Also note that right-wing = neo-nazi in German. Over and over on this thread and the last thread and the talk page of the article I've been hammered with "Why did you revert to the concentration camp wording?" "Why did Samsara paste in the concentration camp wording", "Why did Burke's Peerage use that word"? with the implication that we did that to support a right wing agenda. I can't speak for Burke, but I was stopping an edit war, and Samsara was merging two articles, trying to help out. These explanations have been ignored and the questions asked multiple times. It is so disheartening that so little good faith was assumed on our part that these questions keep being asked. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 20:07, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Samsara, I've read your translation twice, and it seems to be a good and a fair one; I suspect your German is better than mine though. I've also read the page history. It seems that you were reverting to "concentration camp"(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bad_Nenndorf&amp;diff=66888236&amp;oldid=66860500" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bad_Nenndorf&amp;diff=66888236&amp;oldid=66860500" rel="nofollow">here</a>, for example), and arguing for that wording on the talk page? Now, to me, the argument about whether that word appears in the reference given is somewhat moot. As you know, "concentration camp" is a loaded term in English. While it may have <b>originally</b> referred to camps to keep people together in detention, to most people now the main association is with the death and labour camps of the Third Reich.</p>
<p>We quite properly don't use the term in our article on <a href="../../../g/u/a/Guantanamo_Bay_detainment_camp_d6fa.html" title="Guantanamo Bay detainment camp">Guantanamo Bay detainment camp</a> or on <a href="../../../m/a/z/Maze_%28HM_Prison%29_3ad2.html" title="Maze (HM Prison)">Maze (HM Prison)</a>, for example, because it would be considered POV there, even though, by the <b>original</b> definition that would arguably be a very good description of these facilities, and even though you could easily find significant minority views who would like the articles to use the term. So, to describe a British facility for holding and interrogating former Nazis after the war had ended as a "concentration camp", could be seen as defending a POV that some Neo-Nazis would hold. I'm not questioning your good faith in reverting the edit for a moment, although as I argue above I think it was wrong, nor am I for a millisecond imputing the sort of motives to you that you seem to think Karl has.</p>
<p>Both of you, I've looked and haven't seen anywhere that Kurt actually said you were neo-Nazis. He was guilty of not assuming good faith if he assumed that was why you were reverting to a term he (correctly in my view) believed to be more accurate. If you can find where he said you were Neo-Nazis, please post a reference to that. Excuse me if you already have and I've missed it; there's a lot to read and although I read this business up in detail a few days ago, I've only really skimmed the new commentary. I assure you I would think differently of the matter if I thought he had said that.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, it is a matter of what you thought he implied you meant kind of thing, I wouldn't carry on with the bad feelings you seem to have about this editor, but move on, forgive the guy, accept what I see as a reasonable apology for using the term "experiment" to describe his edits in en: (edits I might have made myself if I had seen the term "concentration camp" used to describe a post-war UK facility)... as I said before, what else can he really be expected to apologise for?</p>
<p>Please, can't we shake hands all round and get on with improving more articles? The <a href="../../../d/a/c/Dachau_concentration_camp.html" title="Dachau concentration camp">Dachau</a> article needed some TLC the last time I looked.

<dd>I agree with Guinnog. This seems overdone to me. Pschemp, when El C and others "asked multiple times" about reverts and 'concentration camp' I don't think they <i>at all</i> intended an "implication that we did that to support a right wing agenda". I thought they were just trying to understand what had gone on. If a block was placed by someone who was involved in an edit war with the blockee that's relevant to evaluating the block (yes, I know Lar 'took over' the block to address that issue). Et cetera. Since a good portion of the reasons for blocking here apparently took place on the German Wikipedia people didn't really know what was going on and were looking for info. Personally it seems clear to me that everyone involved is 'anti Nazi' and the accusations/implications to the contrary on both sides seem bizarre. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 21:46, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You won't find the term neo-nazi, its not used in this context. Karl's "apology" has admitted to no wrong doing.

<dd>Guinnog, you should understand that I have no misgivings about the current wording. However, as virtual handshakes are concerned, I offered this to KarlV on 2 August in addition to having emailed him about a day earlier (iirc, I obviously don't have a copy of the email) to try and resolve the conflict off-wiki, which I would have preferred. However, as you can see in the translated document (or the original), he told me on 4 August that the analysis was being worked on, i.e. he was going to continue his witch-hunt on admins that most people now seem to agree are not politically biased. I fail to see where he's really improved beyond "I'll pretend to apologise if that gets me what I want". Lar has written some cogent commentary on this.</dd>

<dd>Pschemp, I didn't see where he called you "right-wing extremist" either. I don't think he did, though I stand to be corrected. If you think he may have thought you were a right-wing extremist, you may be right; I have no way of knowing, but I tried to show above why he conceivably might wrongly have thought so. However, what you think he thought isn't justification for an indefinite block in my view, or for any block at all unless he actually said it.</dd>

<p>Wow this thing really escalated way beyond what is necessary. I was minorly involved on the page and happened to agree with KarlIV's argument, that we should use whatever term that English sources explicitly used. It seems that was his only gripe. All the content matters have since been worked out and I see ChrisO did a fine job expanding. There's obviously some language barrier issues here and it would be best to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">AGF</a> and not project so much onto people's intentions over words (i.e., "experiment", "right wing") that easily get lost in translation. I don't see anything warranting an indefinite block for KarlIV. He violated 3RR once, and I wouldn't even go so far as to say he violated <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPoint_d154.html" title="WP:Point">WP:Point</a>, but even if he did, it still doesn't merit an indefinite block.

<dd>I agree. KarlV isn't a disruptive user. This was an isolated incident for which he has apologized twice (even if the apology is not worded exactly the way his opponents would like). Those in favor of shortening the block, from this and the previous discussion, are HGB, Nandesuka, Jayjg, InShanee, FeloniousMonk, ChrisO, tickle me, El C, Phr, Ken Arromdee, Guinnog, jossi, and SlimVirgin; and possibly also JoshuaZ, fuddlemark, and xyzzy. It's therefore clear it should be shortened; the question is only to what. Last time, one month was mentioned and seemed to be favored. KarlV has e-mailed me to say he's away until the end of August so it's a moot point until then. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 00:46, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Samsara, I'm sorry you're concerned. Please believe that I'm only trying to avoid what seems like an unjust block for a user who seems to have helped improve the project, who acknowledges he made mistakes in his methods, has apologised and agreed not to repeat the behaviour that led to a block; my impression on the last discussion was that the block was given for breach of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> in <b>calling</b> what he was doing (which seemed to me like a good-faith addition to the encyclopedia) an "experiment". I don't see that, other than his breach of 3rr and the above, he has really done anything to apologise for. If you are able to clearly express where else he has broken policy or behaved badly, you should say so and give specific examples. Otherwise I am inclined to think you are just, perhaps understandably, annoyed with this user for what you think they thought of you. Do you know what I mean? Suspected breach of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> isn't enough for a permanent block. If it were, I'm sure I probably wouldn't be talking to you now.

<dl>
<dd>This is what you aren't getting. He violated WP:POINT. He was blocked for that, not for what he called it. His actions are what resulted in the block, not his words. He has not apologized for his actions, only his words.

<dl>
<dd>We need to get this in perspective. We're currently discussing elsewhere whether a user should be indefblocked for operating three sockpuppets, one of them an admin while the other two went either for bureaucrat or adminship, the latter trying four times. Plus voting more than once in polls etc. <i>That's</i> disruption, and yet people are still undecided whether an indefblock is appropriate. KarlV's behavior doesn't approach that. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 00:52, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well you haven't been reading then because I've said multiple times now that I would consider a shorter block if a real apology appears.

<dd>He needs to admit that his method for undertaking to ferret out right-wing bias was wrong. Instead of editing disruptively, he should have brought it up here if he thought it was an issue, not provoked an edit war. And he needs to admit that he violated POINT by disrupting rather than discussing. This whole thing could have been avoided had he discussed his concerns, rather than experimenting to prove his point. The only thing he has apologised for right now is using the English word experiment, a ploy of semantics. He said he was sorry we were upset, but not that he was sorry he used the wrong method. Plenty of people agree with the fact that he used the wrong method, go read the other thread if you don't believe me. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 01:07, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What is the point of this section? Again, since no one seems to remember, if karlV apologizes for his actions properly I said I'd support a shorter block, and so did Lar, the current blocking admin. That's the real debate here. So lovely its being ignored. In fact I can pretty much say that should a proper apology happen, I don't think anyone would support an indef block. Why not get a proper apology and then we can have 100% consensus and no admin would have to overturn another's block and we could all be happy. Wouldn't that be nice?

<dd>pschemp is, as usual, spot on. If we get a proper apology with the features I outlined, I'm all over supporting a shorter block. But we're not getting that.

<dd>KarlV emailed me on August 7 saying he'd be travelling all month and would not be able to read emails or discussions on en:WP on a daily basis. I wrote him back about 2 days ago and haven't gotten a reply yet. He sent a detailed apology explaining some of his actions; he does sound contrite though I'd say what he sent didn't have all the elements that Samsara has asked for. He also expressed a belief that <a href="../../../../de/r/u/f/Benutzer%7ERufezeichen_a2d4.html" class="extiw" title="de:Benutzer:Rufezeichen">de:Benutzer:Rufezeichen</a> (now blocked as an "obvious sockpuppet" but it doesn't say of who), <a href="../../../i/_/l/User%7EI_like_Burke%27s_Peerage_fd09.html" title="User:I like Burke's Peerage">User:I like Burke's Peerage</a>, and <a href="../../../../de/p/r/o/Benutzer%7EProIsrael_a263.html" class="extiw" title="de:Benutzer:ProIsrael">de:Benutzer:ProIsrael</a> are the same person, as well as <a href="../../../../de/d/e/r/Benutzer%7EDer_Claqueur_343e.html" class="extiw" title="de:Benutzer:Der_Claqueur">de:Benutzer:Der_Claqueur</a> (blocked for vandalism) who I think hasn't come into this discussion.

<dd>The email I sent KarlV a couple days ago asked whether I could post his letter. If he says ok, then I'll post it. I don't think it was intended as private but I'll wait to hear from him. It's possible he sent something similar to SlimVirgin. I haven't so far been masochistic enough to read through every addition to this thread that's piled up. FWIW, I'm satisfied with what KarlV has sent and posted, and I don't agree with Samsara's analysis of the trust between en and de being damaged. I can read enough German to see that de's situation isn't that much different from ours, so I can't hold that against them. <s>If anyone is damaging the trust, it's those such as Samsara who seem to wish that this matter hadn't come to the attention of en users</s> If anything is damaging the trust, it's the creation of all this unnecessary drama by those seeking retribution against KarlV, and their making demands that aren't clearly grounded in objective reality. KarlV's error should have been addressed through a message on his talk page. As for remedies from KarlV, I'll settle for an ordinary acknowledgement of error from him and a promise not to do it again, and I think we've received that already.

<p>No. Absolutely not. <i>Requiring</i> an apology, or as in this case a third <i>specifically worded</i> apology, is not remotely acceptable. Blocks are preventative... not punitive. You can't force someone to symbolically lick your boots in order to be unblocked. Some of the things you are demanding he apologize for (e.g. 'damaging the trust between de and en users) are things he denies doing. To date the 'disruptive' behaviour this user has engaged in on EnWp was a 3RR violation... grounds for a 24 hour block. The fact that his motivation for making the correction he did was to check whether there were 'right wing' editors coordinating activities between en and de is, frankly, irrelevant. WP:POINT is a <i>guideline</i> (like the 'do not edit archives' guideline that is being dismissed so casually) stating that disruptions of Wikipedia to prove a point are still disruptions and handled accordingly. The 'disruption' here was a single 3RR violation. Grounds for a 24 hour block... not indefinite. Finally, we are also told that indef is neccessary because, while it may seem a small thing here, the implication that people opposing him were 'right wing' is a deadly insult in Europe that can cost people their jobs... yet his statements which some have <i>interpreted</i> to contain that implication were <b>made</b> on the Deutsch Wikipedia, where the full negativity of them (whatever that might be) should have been apparent to everyone, and yet he was not blocked <i>there</i>. If his behaviour on de Wiki was unacceptable <i>they</i> should deal with it <i>there</i>. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 17:28, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>CBD: I think we may have a miscommunication here. The desire for an apology worded a specific way is not punitive. It is to have a reasonable assurance that the behaviour we have seen (disrupting the encyclopedia to make a point) isn't going to be repeated... nothing more. The points in the desired apology (or statement, or assurance, call it what you like) are there to ensure that's the case. As far as I am aware, while it may be true that <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> is a guideline, it's one that you can nevertheless be blocked over for violating (because your violation is also including something else wrong)... ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 00:01, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am happy to mediate, but I am frustrated by how long it is taking those who feel aggrieved by what Karl did to describe what he actually did wrong (with diffs, and in reference to policy), and to state precisely what form his hypothetical new apology should take. As I said all along, I'll only pass the message to him if I feel there is actually a case to answer. Failing that in, say, the next 24 hours, we should just lift the block. --<a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinnog_5d26.html" title="User:Guinnog">Guinnog</a> 08:06, 13 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Guinnog, you're making it hard for me to assume good faith. You yourself said that KarlV was away for a month. Why this hurry suddenly? I don't feel you are occupying the mediating position you claim for yourself, instead pushing one particular POV of the situation. All the evidence is out there. If you haven't read it (as your request for diffs seems to imply), you should not be involving yourself in this way. I spent several hours on providing a full translation of the Bad Nenndorf talk (sporadically interrupted by tickle me's campaigning). You're exhausting my willingness to consider your cause. <b>We've stated precisely the form of the apology, as you requested.</b> It has its own heading above, you could not have missed it. Pschemp, Lar, myself and others have shown willingness to reconsider if remorse is shown. The consensus remains for maintaining the block.</dd>
<dd>Finally, your mediating should not be conditional on whether you agree with the evidence.

<dd>Lar, yes I agree that people can be blocked for WP:POINT violations because it implicitly requires doing "something else wrong". In this case, KarlV committed 3RR. For which he was blocked for 24 hours. The fact that he believed he had a good reason for doing so / was trying to prove a point about bias doesn't get him off the hook... he violated 3RR and he had to face the music. But how then do we get to 'indefinite block'? It is infinitely worse behaviour because he did it for what he thought was a good reason rather than just to be argumentative? Irk? As to the 'apology'... if all you are looking for is an assurance that he will not do so again; that's more commonly called a 'promise' and one can be found on his talk page currently. An 'apology' is something else, and yes... requiring one definitely seems punitive rather than preventative. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 16:44, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Samsara, I'm sorry you are finding it hard to assume good faith. Of course I saw the draft at the top of the section, and I apologise for not making it clear I had read it. It was not I, by the way, who said Karl was away for a month; I think he is definitely still checking his email occasionally. I'm sorry too that you think I have a particular POV on the matter. My only POV here is that I do not think that KarlV's actions deserve an indefinite block. My offer to mediate has always been framed in such terms, I think. In asking for diffs to show where he has broken policy, I wasn't implying that I hadn't read the history of the situation, as you suggest. I have. I was more trying to focus your idea that he maligned you onto a specific incident. Saying "All the evidence is out there" does not progress the issue, as I see it. If you can even find me one diff where he called you a bad name or questioned your good faith, for example, I will gladly call him on it and ask him to apologise for it. Failing that, I do not intend (for example) to chide him for "inciting analysis of the results on the German Wikipedia", as this in itself would not be a breach of any policy, guideline or common-sense principle, in my opinion. I really am sorry that you are finding it hard to accept that unless KarlV <b>can be shown</b> to have done something wrong beyond that which he has already apologised for, there is no good argument for expecting him to show "remorse".</dd>

<dd>If the evidence really is out there, it would be helpful if you could choose, say, the 3 most egregious examples, post diffs along with the rule each one breaks; I absolutely guarantee then to convey our demand for an apology to KarlV. If, on the other hand, you are unable or unwilling to do this, I suggest you write the matter off and move on from the matter. Either way, please accept that my intentions in the matter are good and that my only reason for getting involved at all in this is that I thought leaving him indef blocked seemed unduly harsh for what I had seen evidence of him actually doing. --<a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinnog_5d26.html" title="User:Guinnog">Guinnog</a> 19:29, 13 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This isn't about me. Once again, I'm sorry you are finding difficulty in assuming good faith.

<dd>Blanking still leaves it in the page history, where any editor can see it or restore it if needed. I would be in favor of letting her do this, because there is nothing to be gained by antagonizing an already-banned user, and if she is no longer editing articles, she will no longer need it to communicate with other editors. If she comes back with sockpuppets, and we need to have the talk page restored for comparison or enforcement purposes, we can do it at that time.

<dd>Ditto. I really dislike the 'make it policy that users cannot blank warning messages / their talk page' suggestion. Whatever problems might theoretically arise out of users 'hiding' information seem vastly outweighed by the problems caused by harrassing them over this issue.

<dd>I don't have a problem with archiving messages after a decent interval. We have an ongoing problem with users removing warnings very soon after they are issued and not archiving them, but we should not be encouraging a situation where an admin asked to follow up a report of a disruptive or vandalising user has to check the talk history to find out if a warning was issued or not. A week later? Sure, archive it, the storm is probably past. But removing warnings and criticism, and leaving only the shiny, nice comments, presents a false picture. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 13:26, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have a belief in the innate goodness of people. Unfortunately, we all have an element of attack and destruction in our mind. Some, such as User:Ste4k, have it to an extreme and actually seem to enjoy attack. I think the entire page User talk:Ste4k is an attack. I do not understand why it has not been blanked. I also do not understand why User:Ste4k has been allowed to blank their previous talk page rather than archiving it. The longer that this is allowed to continue, the better User:Ste4k can hide their earlier talk page.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I request that an administrator that is able to do so take these three actions:
<dl>
<dd>1) Restore the history to the page.</dd>
<dd>2) Archive the earlier talk page before it was blanked and removed from the history.</dd>
<dd>3) Archive the current page.

<p>I noticed more and more "children" wikipedians on here, which is probably not a bad thing. However, these young wikipedians are not editing productively and falsely assume wikipedia to be myspace or simply their own blog. (some went as far as discussing sexual activities on wikipedia, see previous AN/I post) I think a policy is needed to raise the age limit on this site (or at least banned the self-proclaimed kid user who use wikipedia for the wrong cause).

<dd>(edit conflict) Well, this is the anarchist in me talking, but I'd say that seems like a really bad idea. First off, how would we even enforce such a policy? Second, banning <i>all</i> people below a certain age is unfair. Yeah, sure, some might not be able to edit productively, but there are some who are and we of all people shouldn't make a blanket ban on all people under the age of X. If it really comes down to not allowing people to edit, do so on a case by case basis. Unless you can show that they are causing serious harm to the project, I don't see why we should really do this. And before blocking people for things like this, why not try and explain to them the importance the situation. Make sure they understand that this is not just the place for social networking and that they should be making some type of contributions. I'm sure there's something they can do that's productive. Reverting obvious vandalism isn't too hard. If someone can figure out how to look in the history and how to edit a page, they can do that. Just about everyone has something to offer. Just try and find what it is. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force"><b><font color="black">Ungovernable Force</font></b></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_Wikipedian_kitchen_68b8.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force/Wikipedian kitchen"><font color="green"><sup>The Wiki Kitchen!</sup></font></a> 05:14, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I totally agree, but if someone is putting a friend list on their userpage and over 90% of their edits are on some else's talkpage, they are using their accounts for the wrong reason.

<dd>I would not go for an age limit on Wikipedia, since that is going to be hard to prove.

<p>Nothing's wrong with Children chatting with their peers on Wikipedia, just as there's nothing's wrong when adults do, nonetheless, this purely social interaction needs to be proportional to the amount of productive work being done. They also need to be protected from predators and trolls (who might pretend to be children). In short, some (more, as I keep saying) supervision and oversight is needed. But so long as we're straight-forward about these principles (and dangers) with them, I think it's well worth every extra effort. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 05:52, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agreed. Stoping our "children" editors would probably have a dramatic effect on Wikipedia. I'm willing to bet there are <i>a lot</i> of children administrators (under a legal age) right now and blocking all editors whom are children would certainly put them in jeopardy for a block. There would no way to tell who's behind the screen of a computer, no age-o-meter, to tell how old someone is. They could easily lie about and get away with it, thus a policy couldn't do much about it. Plus, I read somewhere that <i>most</i> of the newcomers on Wikipedia and frequent editors are around the age of 13-15 years old <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>, so blocking them wouldn't help the project. Plus, I think "the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit" didn't mean "the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit as long as you over the age of [insert number here]". If someone treats the site like myspace rather than an encyclopedia, warn them on thier talk page about it, and <i>don't</i> make threats of a block in the process.&#160;:) 216.78.95.172 13:45, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Agree with the above... my summation of the consensus here that I see: age is irrelevant, it's behaviour and maturity that matter, and agree that no age limit is needed, but rather, explanation as needed, perhaps a bit more patiently than normal, followed by warnings, and (reluctantly, and only if needed) blocks. Agree? As for who...Phaedriel <i>certainly</i> has the touch, but I don't think I want to see everyone dump all the mentoring and counseling of children on her, how would she get anything else done?

<p>A lot of admins do that too, just to give other wikipedians a glimpse of their lifestyle and belief. I don't see anything wrong with my userpage. And of course, I'm not a wiki-myspacer, I got a myspace account to take care of that (even though I hardly ever use it). A look at my contributions show I never use wikipedia as myspace or self-promotion of any kind.

<li>Unsure. Clearly the events of August 2 including his week-long block were deeply scarring for MSTCrow, who indeed did edit articles before then. His talk-page, uh, manifesto makes me very angry, but I'm prepared to wait, as Geogre suggests, for actions. I think. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 16:15, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>MSTCrow's manifesto is worrying, but it may simply represent blowing off of steam after his block. As others have noted, he was editing right up until his most recent blocks. I certainly would support putting him on a very short leash – the next block should be a month if he goes back to the same bad behaviour or follows through on his manifesto – but I'm not entirely comfortable with blocking indef over what might be a mild and well-contained temper tantrum. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 17:33, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That makes sense as long as someone is keeping an eye on MSTCrow besides the editors and admins that he is likely to annoy and disturb.

<dd>From my experiences with the guy, it seems Parc wiki researcher is just one researcher who's decided to do this by himself. There is, as of yet, no evidence to prove that it's either an "official" account on behalf of Parc (and they'd know better to do so without contacting wikimedia anyway, generally they're very bright people), or that there are multiple people acting on the account. Best solution would be to AGF and simply ask the user, pointing out the policy regarding role accounts just to make sure. <b><i><font color="#FF00FF">~Kylu (<a href="../../../k/y/l/User%7EKylu_6ad3.html" title="User:Kylu">u</a>|<a href="../../../k/y/l/User_talk%7EKylu_3741.html" title="User talk:Kylu">t</a>)</font></i></b> 04:03, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Rex, the template you used is inappropriate, since there clearly is a dispute about the merits of deletion (please read <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProposed_deletion_cb76.html" title="Wikipedia:Proposed deletion">Wikipedia:Proposed_deletion</a>). Please take note that one page redirects to the other (i.e. the two pages you're complaining are duplicated are the same page), and refrain from personal attacks on fellow editors.

<dd>Do please read <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">WP:PROD</a> as Samsara suggests. PROD is for articles that are uncontroversial, uncontested deletions, and anyone, including an article author, can contest the deletion simply by removing the template, which is what Ulritz did—and once removed it should not be put back. Even if the article were deleted under PROD, it could be undeleted on anyone's request. So your assertiveness about his removal of the template is simply wrong, and Ulritz is doing precisely what the policy was made for. It looks like, if you want this article deleted, you will have to take it to AfD. <b><span style="color: #f33">·<a href="../../../r/o/d/User_talk%7ERodii_6c72.html" title="User talk:Rodii"><span style="color: #669">&#160;rodii&#160;</span></a>·</span></b> 04:26, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Indeed. Some people advocate deleting everything that is not referenced. Your version of the disputed section implies that the Dutch "hate" Germans.

<p>No offence, but what are you talking about? This is not about people not respecting me (they do), nor is it about sources. I don't want this users respect, I want him to leave me alone and stop harrasing me so I can get on with improving wikipedia. For some reason after numerous personal attacks, insults, revisionism and proof he is fixed on annoying me, of which I provided diffs, he apparently still hasn't gone far enough to allow you (admins) to stop him. I hope the mediation will result in something, so I hope Ulritz accepts ... that way I can try to resolve this matter: <b>myself</b>. <a href="../../../r/e/x/User%7ERex_Germanus_1602.html" title="User:Rex Germanus">Rex</a> 23:28, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>But more importantly, user continues in not providing references, sensible edit summaries, and not participating in talk page discussion in a constructive matter. What can I do? I cannot work this way. I cannot continue in providing sources, starting discussion and taking all these insults, it gets me nothing. Sources get ignored or "overruled" by some theory or reference to wikipedia policy which doesn't exist. Discussions are simply (I'm talking about the one in which he responds of course) messages in which I (again) provide sources and explain why he is wrong, these then get answered either by insults or a simple message that basically says; "<i>despite all your sources, and eventhough I have none of my own I am still right</i>". I cannot go on like this. So far he has 3 admin warnings, and it simply doesn't help.</p>

<p>Squeakbox is boisterous in his protests here, which should be toned down, but I do not find Squeakbox's edit (the one linked above, by JKelly), to be any less accurate than the one Kilo-Lima reverted (for the second time) to before removing the POV tag and locking the article. There was a reasonable debate underway on what sources validate a "president." If some media articles of the time refer to Carmona as "president" or "interim president" or "defacto president," does that make Carmona a president for historical and encyclopedic purposes? If other nations, the UN, or OAS do not recognize him, is he a president? If he "proclaims himself president" does that indicate he was president (lolakana/Kilo-Lima says it does, read the discussion page)? If the elected parliament of Venezuela disavows him or not, does that affect whether he is president?</p>
<p>There was a fairly civil argument going on on these points, but then Kilo-Lima, a party to the argument and one who had reverted good faith edits of another, not only reverted and locked the article but removed the NPOV tag, and this I find to be questionable behavior for an admin. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielM_572f.html" title="User:DanielM">DanielM</a> 22:27, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi all! I'm not quite sure if this is the appropriate spot to converse, but I'd rather <a href="../../../b/e/_/WP%7EBe_Bold_2c3b.html" title="WP:Be Bold">be bold</a> then let what is now a flurry of reversions turn into something more serious. Apparently, as a result of a lack of consensus to redirect the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angela_Beesley_5b39.html" title="Angela Beesley">Angela Beesley</a> article to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikia.html" title="Wikia">Wikia</a>, there has been some moderate edit warring. I was first made aware of the situation off-wiki on #wikipedia, one of the Wikipedia IRC channels. <a href="../../../a/p/p/User%7EAppleboy_7cf8.html" title="User:Appleboy">User:Appleboy</a> apparently met Ms. Beesley at Wikimania and per a conversation they had, he decided that he liked her and she shouldn't have a Wikipedia biography if she doesn't want one. Obviously, I can see how this bit might be rendered moot as conjecture, since logs are disallowed from being publicised. Regardless, <a href="../../../a/p/p/User%7EAppleboy_7cf8.html" title="User:Appleboy">User:Appleboy</a> and to a lesser extent, <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">User:Zscout370</a> have taken it upon themselves to create the redirect. While I'm fully aware that consensus is certainly not needed for a redirect and could be construed as simply being bold, I thought that given that the article had been AfD'd three times and kept (as a default result stemming from a lack of consensus) each time that a mention of the redirect on the talk page and an explanation might be in order. I've no personal investment in the article and was not part of any editing or discussion of the article prior to now. The only reason it was brought to my attention was that I saw it being discussed in an IRC channel, so I was wondering if an administrator might take a look at the situation to prevent any escalation of edit warring. Thanks and I apologise in advance if this should be directed elsewhere! <font color="#008000"><span style="cursor: w-resize"><b>hoopydink</b></span></font><sup>Conas tá tú?</sup> 23:08, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I found that this user, CFIF has made this accusation with out even the courtesy of leaving a note on my talk page. I took a look into the history of this user and he/she seems to jump to conclusions rather quickly and without any conclusive evidence; something which I did unlike him acting like the boy who cries wolf. I do hope that he/she can give us some insight on his/her standard of proof. On the various deletion pages I stated clear and valid reasons why the articles should be deleted and I have now placed this on my user page as well just to be clear. I do not have a bloody vendetta against all lists, just those which do not meet the established guidelines. I have encountered some pages of lists that I felt did not violate <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> and <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_directory" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#Wikipedia is not a directory</a>. The purpose of deletions is to establish a consensus. How can a consensus be established if a user with out any real evidence screams that the nomination is in bad faith? This adds a bit of doubt to a perfectly valid nomination for deletion that was based on the established guidelines of Wikipedia. I feel that CFIF's behaviour is bordering on vandalism and given his/her prior history I feel that he/she may be in need of some form of censure as he seems to over react against those who do not meet your viewpoints. <a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDisplaced_Brit_130f.html" title="User:Displaced Brit">Displaced Brit</a> 18:36, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>It looks like the poor-taste barn star intended to disparage vandals as "retards", while Javsav is claiming he intended to call himself a retard?

<p>Just picked up this link - you are quite right I'm not very active, I know a Forth Road bridge problem when I see one - this site is far too risky to get deeply involved! The picture of the boy is definitely my son, and I've very happy for him to be here and so well looked after by you guys!</p>
<p>The problem of abusive mis-use of photographs of people with DS isnt new, some people seem to think it quite hilarious to add various humerous captions such as "heres a picture of XXXs girlfriend", which is all the more reason to post them in the first place - its good to know that there are sensible folk out here who can admonish and hopefully shame the perpetrators. I've had some much more serious cases of photos I have taken of other young people with DS at social events being abused like this on american college student bulletin boards, and whilst it makes me sick, it is almost inevitable. We have a big job to educate people to think of folk with DS as people first, not a diagnosis - The main DS entry is still pretty medically biased imho - but thats another fight for another day. <a href="../../../e/x/c/User%7EExcalibur_1839.html" title="User:Excalibur">Excalibur</a></p>

<p><a href="../../../m/u/g/User%7EMugaliens_0078.html" title="User:Mugaliens">User:Mugaliens</a> has created Wikipedia:Admin Policy. It has the look of policy and, in fact, <b>says</b> that it's policy. User:Doc Glasgow attempted to defang it a bit by putting a tag on it saying that it's an essay. My concern is that it's still called "policy." It's still called "Admin Policy." The author seems to be disgruntled and fairly displeased with what he sees as a majority of administrators who are abusive. The problem here... well <b>a</b> problem here ...is that it's in name space rather than user space, and we have few real rules about name space. One common sense rule, however, is that name space is where we put policies, and anything that's not a policy that is in name space that calls itself policy is absolutely forbidden. (The lack of rules, incidentally, doesn't mean that things are untouchable. The reverse. It means that any administrator can delete without discussion.) I'd like to see this userfied, but I want this to be the community's point of view rather than merely mine. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:34, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I say userfy it. The author has been here less than a month and appears to have little experience with the workings of Wikipedia. There are external links to policy pages and poorly paraphrased versions of the rules he considers important. In addition, it seems to switch between giving advice to admins and non-admins. This "essay" clearly isn't ready for prime-time. <a href="../../../a/r/e/User%7EAren%27t_I_Obscure__6bd1.html" title="User:Aren't I Obscure?">Aren't I Obscure?</a> 13:47, 13 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Good. Given the fact that the user felt picked-on already, I thought it would be better and more calming if we demonstrated some community consensus before we made the move. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 16:50, 13 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I've written a note to the user, referring him here for any questions and trying to explain the process for making policy proposals.

<li>I appreciate the light touch, George. I created the admin policy as while searching for clarification on the comments I've received, I noticed that policy was scattered all over the place. That page was merely a consolidated version of the policy pages that are already out there. I was hoping it could remain a starting/jumping off point for others so they wouldn't have to dig around so much. <a href="../../../m/u/g/User%7EMugaliens_0078.html" title="User:Mugaliens">Mugaliens</a> 17:31, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Those are laudable goals. A single sheet would be helpful, or a sheet that had links to all the dependent sheets. We have a general prohibition against subpage organization and cross-namespace directs, but your point is well taken that our Welcome kit ought to have an overview sheet on administrators -- what is expected of them and what is expected of those interacting with them. I'm not entirely sure the best way to move forward with it, except that others will probably have an idea of which projects are at work on summaries and overviews. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 20:08, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Handled very thoughtfully, Geogre. I also think that someone (more experienced here than I) might want to advise Mugaliens to withdraw his RfAr as premature and point him in the right direction there, before it's unceremoniously rejected by the Arbs or de-posted by the Arb Clerks. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 17:39, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm not taking a position on that, not having reviewed it, but the arbitrators will accept or deny the case, and it looks like Metamagician is trying to explain the sometimes-frustrating policies. Let's all hope for the best for all involved. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 20:08, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>He expressed appreciation for my efforts, so I hope it all calms down now. As far as I can see, it's been misunderstandings of our policies rather than any malice or bad faith. I've tried to explain that everyone else has been acting properly and the RfAr was not wise. I hope he'll withdraw the RfAr or that it'll just fizzle out with no harm done. I'll drop him another note. Fingers crossed. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 01:46, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>He has indeed now withdrawn the case, after a couple of arbitrators had voted to turn it down, and thanked Metamagician3000 for clarifying the situation. Hopefully a more positive outcome for everyone than a flat rejection of the arbitration case would have been. Good work Geogre and Metamag. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 18:36, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm delighted. Some of the new users have chips on their shoulders, but some are just lost in the maze of our policies, which seem to contradict each other, and the onslaught of an administrator's pronouncement can make anyone defensive or hostile, so it's great when we can defuse situations like that and show that, in general, we really do make sense. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 20:21, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

"Of course the thing is a Cyde creation", "I've no respect left for Cyde"... and if you have a problem with his actions on CFD, don't be passive agressive and whine about them here, do something about it in a more official venue. --<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolbez_ce9f.html" title="User:Golbez">Golbez</a> 21:28, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What? I was never blocked from wikipedia.

<dd>Geogre, I admire you greatly, but did you read the deleted article? It was full of slander against a particular person at Microsoft by name and against the Microsoft corporation in particular.

<dd>Thanks for the nice words, and I confess that I hadn't read it. Now that I have, it seems much more...bizarre...than malicious. It looks like the winky blinky stuff that shows up here in paroxysms. I still stand by what I said, though, <i>because</i> the author seems so...marginal. I.e. a true believer in conspiracies that fringe is going to get knocked out pretty quickly in any event, but ... Nah, never mind. I take it back: it's not worth being a scold over someone this out on the edge. There have been some people with unaccepted ideas who have turned to profit on Wikipedia, but not to any <i>great</i> profit. They mainly act to countervene other people with competing unaccepted views. (E.g. some of the people with extremely personal views on aliens are useful because they revert other people with personal views of aliens.) The military conspiracists haven't yet, to my knowledge, been profitable. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:47, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think that it is a hoax, given claims like this, "Ray corrected the problem but he was thrown out of the (space) shuttle when the gear went down prior to landing. It is unclear from current information how he survived the fall but the author assumes he deployed a parachute."

Everyone knows that Bill Gates controls (or controlled) Microsoft and it was never a secret. The manner in which it is said makes it seem like it is meant to be humorous.

<dd>You are correct that Ati3414 had previous contact with me outside of Wikipedia, this is how he knew who I was to harass me through the police. He also previously harassed me by calling my employers (and police again) over a contract dispute, but this was unrelated to wikipedia. <b>The matter at hand is that in a recent post on wikipedia he threatenned to call them <u>again</u> due to reverting his deletion on a talk page.</b> While I don't really feel it is necessary or relavent to go into the details of the contract referred to in a later post, I might as well state it since it is ridiculously simple: I would return money he owed for documentation I located for him, if in return he would agree to not contact me or post on the website (not this site) that started the nonsense in the first place and if he violated that simple task, he would immediately owe me the money back.

<dd>I really don't feel any of those details of how he knows my identity is important. What is important is that he called the cops once claiming harassment when I removed his wiki spam.

Given the age skew of Wikipedia's volunteers (often satirized in <i>The Onion</i>), missing something in Church's article isn't that surprising, which is why each should monitor according to his ability.

<dd>Well, the thing is, since having a politician die in a plane crash is not that infrequent, this sort of conspiracy-laden false edit is very plausible, which makes it very dangerous.

<p>Users Isarig and <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intangible.html" title="Intangible">Intangible</a> brook no critcism of Israel. They delete and revert in kneejerk fashion. My edit has been revised to meed all objections of all previous editors. See Talk Pages. They operate at the level of thugs and vandals. Best Wishes. Will314159 23:18, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
