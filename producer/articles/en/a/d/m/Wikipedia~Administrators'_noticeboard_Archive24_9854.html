<dd>Sure - that's why I mention it is kind of sad. I mean, she was involved in some community building etc. - but even then it was like an edit war on every page over silly things like the color of a template (<a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUser_aspie_dda7.html" title="Template:User aspie">Template:User aspie</a>). I think she would have just took advice from other people seriously she would have been ok... *sigh*. Of course, I could say that about a lot of users, I suppose.

<dd>That's a good site: it describes the behavior of not a few people I've run across on here. This snippet in particularly is apt:
<dl>
<dd><i>To counteract such behavior, it helps to understand the mentality of those who engage in it. People generally do not do it consciously. No one wakes up in the morning and says to himself: "Today I'm going to cynically manipulate procedural forms in order to be an irritating obstructionist." Instead, such actions are often preceded by a semi-paranoid feeling of being shut out of group interactions and decisions. The person feels he is not being taken seriously, or (in the more severe cases) that there is almost a conspiracy against him—that the other project members have decided to form an exclusive club, of which he is not a member. This then justifies, in his mind, taking rules literally and engaging in a formal manipulation of the project's procedures, in order to make everyone else take him seriously. In extreme cases, the person can even believe that he is fighting a lonely battle to save the project from itself.</i></dd>

<li>Certainly. This user has been blocked <i>11 times is two weeks</i>, all by fellow adminstrators whom I trust and respect, and always (in my opinion) wth good cause. This user has latched onto edit wars all across Wikipedia, frequently on issues that have long been areas of dispute. This user caused a huge ammount of disruption, frequently making disputes much, much, worse than they have to be. All this shows, to me, that this user is not here to build an encyclopedia, in fact seems to want to do quite the opposite.--<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESean_Black_d709.html" title="User:Sean Black">Sean</a>|<a href="../../../s/e/a/User_talk%7ESean_Black_aa92.html" title="User talk:Sean Black">Bla</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">ck</font></a> 21:32, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>With good cause, and well justified perhaps. But for some reason, I can see good faith in this user. Don't ask me why. I suggest a few proposals to indefinitely blocking:</p>
<ul>
<li>Block for six months, or a year. See how it turns out after that.</li>
<li>Remain blocked from all pages, except she has the ability to appeal to an arbitration case. If she violates this she will be reblocked immediately. If she does not violate (what we treat as a temporary injunction), then when the case concludes we accept the decision of the arbitrators.</li>
<li>Put under mentorship and parole, with limits on editing.</li>
</ul>
<p>These I feel could easily work out with minimal risk, and she must understand we are giving her mercy, not a right, and that if she violates any terms of this she is reblocked ASAP. Oh, don't you think this could just be a symptom of having Asperger's? (As well as attention-seeking et al.) Just a thought. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Elle <small><sub><font color="#CC9920">vécu heureuse</font></sub></small> <small><font color="blue"><sup>à jamais</sup></font></small></a> (<a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENatalinasmpf_9405.html" title="User talk:Natalinasmpf">Be eudaimonic!</a>) 22:04, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>On a "lark" I ran a CheckUser on the dear departed Mistress Selina Kyle. It turns out that she shares an IP address with a veritable nest of program vandals. Two of the IPs she has used, including the one she shares with the squad of vandals, belong to a company not engaged in the business of providing web connectivity (they are actually a hosting provider). I suspect that "she" is in some way involved in the program vandalism we've been seeing for months. Given this, I see absolutely no reason why she should not be banned permanently, and the earth salted in her footsteps. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 22:49, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Furthermore, I think it quite likely that whoever is behind the Mistress did in fact "wake[] up in the morning and says to himself: 'Today I'm going to cynically manipulate procedural forms in order to be an irritating obstructionist.'" <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 22:51, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Organised. Such as Willy on Wheels, Obesity, etc. The IP she has been using for many of her edits corresponds to one being used for organised vandalism of the aforementioned sort. I suspect that much of that vandalism is automated at this point, as well. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 23:02, 10 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Call me dense, but if organised/program vandalism was coming from a static IP, why wasn't it blocked before?

<dd>I am shocked indeed. Perhaps it is my disbelief; when I came across her on Christmas I thought she was such a promising user. I literally cannot believe it.

<ol>
<li>What does everyone feel about admins protecting their user pages permanently? I know there are a few handfulls of admins who do it, and I know I don't like it, and have commented on it to a few admins already. This is because this is a wiki, and userpages aren't special. Most user pages don't get much vandalism, users that would are often watched by many people, and vandalism quickly reverted. Protecting these will tend to make users envy us. It also encourages us to be more pro-protection. Furthermore, I specifically allow people to edit my userpage, with a note at the bottom. I suck at web design and a few bored users have made my user page pretty cool.</li>
<li>I've noticed that many user pages of indef blocked users are being protected. That's perfectly ok if the user is vandalizing their user page, but many are being protected pre-emptively. That's not neccessary, wastes time, and stuff. Some of these are just Willy on Wheels socks, and our wheelers normally don't care about their accounts...at this point, they're basically making the on wheels accounts to waste our time and never going near them again.</li>
<li>Anyway, I've made a list of protected user pages at <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhroziac_Protected_user_pages_5ec7.html" title="User:Phroziac/Protected user pages">User:Phroziac/Protected user pages</a>. --<a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhroziac_d326.html" title="User:Phroziac">Phroziac</a> <sub>.</sub> <small>o</small> º <sup>O (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhroziac_3a1f.html" title="User talk:Phroziac">♥♥♥♥ chocolate!</a>)</sup> 04:40, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I never found it necessary to protect my main user page, although it has been vandalized often in the past, but I fully understand and have absolutely nothing against anyone else protecting his or her user page due to vandalism. Protection of user subpages used as boilerplates for subst'ing is of course also fine by me, as one wouldn't want some vandal changing it. From Phroziac's list I gather that there are about 300 protected pages in user space (user pages or subpages thereof). Why worry at all?

<dd>I protected mine once when some kid ran a bot on it, but in general I think it's better that vandal-time is spent on my simple and rather unimportant page than some article where it might not be discovered. Userpage-vandalism is usually reverted very quickly and the vandal revealed and blocked. And sometimes it's just a kid testing and having fun. I don't mind, but I can understand those who do mind and want it kept clean.

<dd>I've never found it nessecary to protect my page. Most vandalism I get is simple one off 'omg u suk!' things. I have however semiprotected a few users' pages over the past weeks, mostly because they've been hit on and off by AOL vandals. Blocking one vandal ip on AOL doesn't stop them from coming right back with a new one in the cases I've looked at. I don't think I would full protect a userpage though; vandalism not handled by semi should be handleable by normal channels of blocks. --<a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 13:16, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Jeffrey as well, but I have not completely disenfranchised the vandals, as my page is only semi-protected, and there is still a subpage for them to attack instead. — <b><i><a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakofnurture__f15d.html" title="User:Freakofnurture/"><font color="#006000" title="User:Freakofnurture">F<small>REAK OF</small> N<small>UR<sub>x</sub>TURE</small></font></a></i> <small>(<span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" rel="nofollow"><font color="#006000" title="User talk:Freakofnurture">TALK</font></a></span>)</small></b> <small>17:32, Jan. 12, 2006</small></dd>
<dd>I agree with Jeff, obviously. If troublemakers are allowed to have virtually anything they want on their userpage by the reasoning that user pages are different, what reasoning would not allow me to keep mine from being vandalized? I see no reason anyone needs to edit my userpage and it's been really nice not having to worry about vandalism on it. Reverting vandalism on my userpage is wasted time that could better be spent on basically anything else. Besides, the protection policy specifically allows it: "A permanent or semi-permanent protection is used for: User pages and their subpages that are subject to repeated vandalism." I also don't like being included on a list as if I've done something wrong. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 14:48, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yesterday I listed Forest Wraiths for speedy deletion because it was a work of fiction created by Caseycool. It was deleted by Administrator <a href="../../../e/n/o/User%7EEnochlau_9436.html" title="User:Enochlau">Enochlau</a>. Today Caseycool posted to my <a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETomTheHand_aeb7.html#caseycool_articles" title="User talk:TomTheHand">talk page</a> stating that he'd wished he'd gotten a chance to move the contents of the page to his user page before it had been deleted. This is probably an odd request, and I know it's not quite a normal administrator task, but I'm under the impression that administrators can view deleted pages. If that's the case, would it be possible for an administrator to copy the former contents of Forest Wraiths to Caseycool's talk page as sort of a favor? I understand if you guys don't have time or can't do it. Thanks! <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 18:21, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm sorry, but this seems absurd to me. Wikistalking? Karmafist, you claim there is "no need for diffs"... well guess what, I'm gonna ask for <b>one</b> anyway. Please identify even ONE page that Rbj has 'wikistalked' you to... some article or talk page where you were contributing and he showed up not for some legitimate interest, but just to harass you. Just one diff to show that this 'wikistalking' claim isn't <b>completely</b> baseless. Or were you claiming that he 'wikistalked' you to the RFC you filed against him? The arbitration vote pages where he voted based on how likely he thought people would be to oppose what he sees as your harassment?</p>
<p>If wikistalking is "basically all he does" then no doubt you are a regular contributor at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gravitational_constant&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=34851447" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gravitational_constant&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=34851447" rel="nofollow">Gravitational constant</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shannon%E2%80%93Hartley_theorem&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=34785913" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shannon%E2%80%93Hartley_theorem&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=34785913" rel="nofollow">Shannon-Hartley theorem</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Planck_units&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=34591403" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Planck_units&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=34591403" rel="nofollow">Planck units</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Discrete-time_Fourier_transform&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=32798057" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Discrete-time_Fourier_transform&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=32798057" rel="nofollow">Disrete-time Fourier transforms</a> and the <b>many</b> other pages where he has contributed in the last few days. Either that or <i>you</i> just engaged in personal attacks / false accusations against <i>him</i>.</p>
<p>Yes, Rbj complains about Karmafist and Phroziac (and some of their friends)... just as they complain about him. The complaint above happens to be <i>untrue</i>. Plainly and obviously untrue. A 'personal attack'. There are absolutely no grounds for the claim that Rbj 'does little else'... he does ALOT else. I can actually <i>provide</i> <b>diffs</b> showing that (see above). Yes, he also spends alot of time complaining about the (largely baseless) RFC these same users brought against him. They attack him... he attacks them... it's all an unseemly uncivil mess. Yet what happens? The regular user gets blocked based on <b>blatantly</b> untrue claims that he is not contributing to the encyclopedia and creative re-interpretation of <a href="../../../b/p/_/WP%7EBP_c8aa.html" title="WP:BP">blocking policy</a> to allow blocks for such, while the equally 'guilty' admins do not.

<p>The page for Kurt Beyer, famed professional wrestler and son of Hall of Famer The Destroyer, was redirected to Kurt Beyer Films. Kurt Beyer Films can keep it's page, but it should NOT have taken over the page dedicated to Kurt Beyer the wrestler. How do we get the original page restored? <i>(above unsigned but by User:Zatoichi101)</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>It was a normal old redirect so just a matter of going into the history and reverting to an older version, which I just did. When there is a dispute over who should be at the plain old name usually we do some disambiguation and discussion instead of erasing the article and redirecting. I'll leave a message for the anon as well. I don;t know if your article meets notability guidelines (didn;t really look) but some discussion needs to be done here on the appropriate talk pages. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 08:46, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not only not sure which Kurt Beyer is more notable, I'm not sure either one is notable at all. For fairness I tagged both <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurt_Beyer_3be9.html" title="Kurt Beyer">Kurt Beyer</a> and Kurt Beyer Films and hope people will discuss and give good reasons. Both seem a bit vanity/spammy to me. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 09:09, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thank you for looking into the matter. We are currently working hard to get the verification you require. Since most sources for information on Kurt Beyer are Japanese, that process is taking us a little longer. Please be patient - we will get the information you require. And although relatively unknown in the States, except among serious professional wrestling fans, Kurt Beyer's name value in Japan is much, much higher, and, therefore, a candidate for a page on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we are adding U.S. sources gradually -- and added a short note at the top of the page that links to a U.S.-based source.</p>
<p>Again, it should be noted that Kurt Beyer's fame is centered more around Asia, especially, Japan. His father, Hall of Famer The Destroyer, will be added soon -- as soon as we all learn more about Wikipedia. This has all been quite a learning process. Thank you!</p>
<p>Also, as for sources for images (pictures), I see that the picture submitted has been questioned for source -- but through The Destroyer (www.thedestroyer.com) we have received permission to use photos on this entry. What are the steps we should take to meet your requirements for authorization? Again, thank you!</p>

MSK's longest actually-served block previously was 24 hours (4 times, all for 3RR), and regarding the snowballing disruption and NPA violation and so forth, we shouldn't completely disregard the Asperger's issue (nor that the extent/severity of that behaviour is disputed).

<p>I'm in the process of expanding the blocks for the various open proxies I've found to cover the entire range owned by whatever hosting center hosted the proxy. Several of these proxies move (their hosting centers reassign IPs on a semi-regular basis), and as a result I end up blocking them over and over again.

<p>I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to ask. I just provided information from the deletion logs of two images for the editors of an article who were wondering what happened to the images. Is there any reason why the images cannot be deleted while keeping the image page with the image history and deletion history? It seems that all it would take is to replace the images in the history with blank ones. This would only be in the case of copyright problems. Is this possible?

Since I had edited the disambiguation page, and moving it over the {{<a href="../../../d/e/l/Template%7EDeletedpage_0567.html" title="Template:Deletedpage">deletedpage</a>}} would mean the content would end up being protected, I took the unusual decision of pointing <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virago.html" title="Virago">Virago</a> to <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virago_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Virago (disambiguation)">Virago (disambiguation)</a>, which is exactly opposite the usual way.

<p>The BigFooty Appleyard has contacted another Wikipedian expressing concern that he is being impersonated. The problem is that in the AFL fan community, the Adrian Appleyard at bigfooty is well-respected for his opinions, but the Wikipedia Adrian Appleyard is <i>claiming to be the same person</i> and making edits to footy-related articles. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">Scott Davis</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottDavis_9428.html" title="User talk:ScottDavis">Talk</a></sup> 06:26, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

Look at <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdrian_Appleyard_9b02.html" title="User:Adrian Appleyard">User:Adrian_Appleyard</a>, it says "Dictator of bigfooty.com" on there, meaning someone has set up the account as a joke.</dd>

In any case, it looks to me like the person who registered <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdrian_Appleyard_9b02.html" title="User:Adrian Appleyard">User:Adrian Appleyard</a> may have gotten bored and gone away. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreplySpang_52d7.html" title="User:FreplySpang">FreplySpang</a> <a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreplySpang_a627.html" title="User talk:FreplySpang">(talk)</a> 18:14, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Well the current Adrian Appleyard account can be moved to another name, moving all its edits with it. In the renaming procedure we then recreate an account with the original name and block that to stop impersonation. In this case we'd recreate the account and then send the real Appleyard the password. <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecretlondon_1805.html" title="User:Secretlondon">Secretlondon</a> 23:25, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I've left a couple of nicely worded notes to the involved users asking them to take a look back at things and see if there is anywhere they could be of help to DF83.

<p>Hi everyone, I've asked <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> to add an email address to allow users to email him (due to the number of blocks he places, occasionally sometimes an innocent user will be blocked and will have no way of contacting him to be unblocked) twice now<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ACurps&amp;diff=34244698&amp;oldid=34224943" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ACurps&amp;diff=34244698&amp;oldid=34224943" rel="nofollow">[4]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ACurps&amp;diff=34827325&amp;oldid=34820782" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ACurps&amp;diff=34827325&amp;oldid=34820782" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, and he hasn't even acknowledged my messages. I think it is important that an admin who places as many blocks as Curps does should be contactable by email to be able to deal with any cases where he has blocked another user because of shared IPs. What do other people think? <a href="../../../t/a/l/User%7ETalrias_6b30.html" title="User:Talrias">Talrias</a> (<a href="../../../t/a/l/User_talk%7ETalrias_9ef0.html" title="User talk:Talrias">t</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Talrias_7d2c.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Talrias">e</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Talrias_2658.html" title="Special:Contributions/Talrias">c</a>) 20:17, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I second this as I was misidentief by Curps as a pagemove vandal and had no way of contacting him directly. (Although in this case he unblocked me within two minutes after realizing his mistake, he forgot the autoblock and I could only contact him by using another IP address.) —<i><a href="../../../r/2E/k/User%7ER.Koot_9d15.html" title="User:R.Koot">Ruud</a></i> 20:22, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure I have a strong feeling either way. It isn't like someone blocked has to email <b>only</b> the blocking admin...tho I suspect thats one of the easier paths to unblocking. In most cases, they still have access to placing {{<a href="../../../u/n/b/Template%7EUnblock_0164.html" title="Template:Unblock">unblock</a>}} on their talk page. --<a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 20:24, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>True, but you assume that Curps reads the talk pages of all the people he blocks (my experience was that he doesn't) or that you know an admin (the page you see when you are blocked only allows you to email the admin who blocked you. —<i><a href="../../../r/2E/k/User%7ER.Koot_9d15.html" title="User:R.Koot">Ruud</a></i> 20:43, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think it should be mandatory for an admin who performs blocks on a regular basis to have an email address enabled in their preferences. I might even go so far as to say that the software shouldn't enact a block if an admin isn't contactable by email. It's trivial to get a Gmail, Yahoo, or other free email account specifically for Wikipedia use. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 20:25, 16 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's also trivial to give a non-working email address or just ignore email entirely. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a> 20:47, 16 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yep, that restriction could easily be bypassed, but it would be a clear message that admins were expected to provide an email address if they're going to perform blocks. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 20:53, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Fellow admins. I'm a baby admin and am slightly new to this, but we have a situation with the above user. Ths user is going to several articles on <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi.html" title="Nazi">Nazi</a> leaders and removing them from a category devoted to <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_crimes.html" title="War crimes">war crimes</a>. The user then states that to call such Nazis war criminials is "POV". However, the nazis we are talking about include <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heinrich_Himmler_4919.html" title="Heinrich Himmler">Heinrich Himmler</a>, <a href="../../../a/m/o/Amon_Goth_cc90.html" title="Amon Goth">Amon Goth</a>, and <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> to name but a few. In Goth's case, he was convicted twice of war crimes, Himmler was convicted posthumously at several different trials, and Hitler...well...to say he wasn't a war criminal is revisionism in my opinion. In any event, this user is not responding to talk pages and continues this campaign. I am at my third revert on <a href="../../../a/m/o/Amon_Goth_cc90.html" title="Amon Goth">Amon Goth</a> and could use some help.

<dd>I unblocked the only autoblock I saw with your name attached to it; it was over a non-vandal username block, so it should have been released anyway. (Let me clarify: the original block was a username block of a username that was inappropriate for WP, but not one of the vandal-type usernames; those autoblocks are routinely lifted so the user can choose a new name.) Also, I've unblocked that IP directly; if you go to the unblock screen and type in that IP, it will unblock it even if it is blocked as a result of an autoblock (and thus, a block doesn't acutally appear under that IP number, but a cloak instead.) Problem should be solved. -- <font color="#696969"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> <sup><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><i>Talk</i></a> • <i>Contact</i></sup></font> 20:23, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In the past month, wikipedia has seen an explosion of userboxes. Many of these templates feed into dedicated categories. Wikipedia has also seen a massive controversy over which userboxes are desirable and which are not, and what actions and processes are appropriate to deal with "undesirable" userboxes. I personally don't see this issue being resolved soon. Also, a lot of bad blood has been created, which might interfere with community operations in the future. Would it be an idea to create a new deletions process, Wikipedia:Userboxes for deletion (UfD), to deal with this issue? I believe that there are now so many userboxes, with so many more being created every day, that filling this with new deletion requests shouldn't be much of a problem. It could also prevent an overflow of deletion requests at tfd. This overflow could obstruct non-userbox-related deletion requests. Furthermore, the occasional linkage of templates and categories could create some friction with tfd and cfd. The same has happened between rfd, cfd and tfd on one side, and sfd on the other side. I don't know if this is the proper place to raise this issue, or whether I should go to the Village Pump for it. I also don't know if this is feasible, viable and/or desirable. What are the obstructions to this issue? <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis">Aecis</a> <a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis"><sup>Mr. Mojo</sup></a> <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_Userboxes_0d05.html" title="User:Aecis/Userboxes"><sup>risin'</sup></a> 00:25, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Strongly disagree with Doc. I thought that the recent RfCs should have taught one that single-handed actions by people "feeling strongly" about issues is unproductive. I would also add that it is abuse of administrative powers to go on a deletion rampage; actually to delete even a single userbox without proper process, unless it is clear nonsense or clearly offensive. For full disclosure, I hate userboxes, even the Babel ones (the granddaddy of them all I would guess). But if one does anything, let it be done by proper process, whatever that may be. <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> (<a href="../../../o/l/e/User_talk%7EOleg_Alexandrov_0298.html" title="User talk:Oleg Alexandrov">talk</a>) 00:52, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Witness the morass that <a href="../../../s/f/d/WP%7ESFD_4ddf.html" title="WP:SFD">WP:SFD</a> has become, where perfectly good redirects like <a href="../../../u/s/-/Template%7EUs-rail-stub_b3b3.html" title="Template:Us-rail-stub">Template:Us-rail-stub</a> → <a href="../../../u/s/-/Template%7EUS-rail-stub_7491.html" title="Template:US-rail-stub">Template:US-rail-stub</a> are unanimously deleted, until it's gotten so that it's practically impossible to sort stubs unless that's almost the only thing you do.

<dd>I tend to agree with Cryptic. TfD is the appropriate venue. I'm also concerned that having a separate UFD would lead to a subcommunity of voters that develops a sense of consensus and practice that is at odds with the broader sense of community standards. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 04:10, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>What Kelly said about a separate UfD culture developing makes sense to me - we don't want that. The userbox situation is going to have to be resolved by some kind of widespead discussion and consensus about the role of the Wikipedia community and what bounds, if any, need to be placed on its growth as a community, which is a non-trivial question. That's the root of the userbox issue, though, and has to be addressed somewhere.</dd>

<dd>Meanwhile, I would take issue with Cryptic's characterization of SfD - are you aware that template redirects cost double the server resources, and that developers support deleting template redirects? Fascinating stuff, that. Turns out not all redirects are cheap. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 04:25, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I'm aware that they cause an extra database query. I'm also aware that they're cheaper than normal redirects, since don't make the squids cache an extra copy of the whole, rendered page. This is an argument for either a soft redirect or bot enforcement.

<dd>I find your referring to a "UfD subcommunity" a bit of a fallacy. That's a risk you get with every deletions process, whether it's AfD, CfD, TfD, IfD, MfD or SfD. I don't see why it should be more of a problem with userboxes than with other types (although I agree that some people have become overly owneristic of new userboxes). <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis">Aecis</a> <a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis"><sup>Mr. Mojo</sup></a> <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_Userboxes_0d05.html" title="User:Aecis/Userboxes"><sup>risin'</sup></a> 11:08, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It still never ceases to amaze me that we have new users with a ton of fugly userboxes and very few actual edits.

<p>After his previous two proposals to remove the term "conspiracy theory" from articles failed, Zen-master has now started a third, nearly identical proposal at Wikipedia:Conspiracy_theory_titles. I've tried pointing out the mistakes in his reasoning for a while, but he tends not to be responsive to any opinions other than his own, and prefers wikilawyering to back his claims, and prefers repetetive polling or voting over sensible discussion. I do believe he qualifies as being a <a href="../../../v/e/x/Vexatious_litigant.html" title="Vexatious litigant">vexatious litigant</a>.</p>
<p>Hence, to put an end to these fruitless one-sided discussions, and by his <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Zen-master_0dbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Zen-master">ArbCom probation</a>, <b>Zen-master is hereby banned</b> from discussing, or commenting on, <i>article titles</i> on any page in the Wikipedia namespace, and is requested to use the relevant talk pages instead. Additionally, Zen-master is hereby banned from starting polls or votes related to article titles on any page in the Wikipedia_talk namespace, and is requested to use consensual discussion instead. Both bans have a duration of one month.</p>
<p>I'm putting this here for general notification (and discussion, if need be). Note that several other admins have recently expressed disagreement with Zen-master's opinion and methods, such as on <a href="../../../s/p/e/Wikipedia%7ESpeedy_deletions_bb1d.html" title="Wikipedia:Speedy deletions">Wikipedia:Speedy deletions</a> and <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAr_9ea1.html" title="WP:RFAr">WP:RFAr</a>. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 22:09, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

Secondly, there is no justification within <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProbation_b453.html" title="Wikipedia:Probation">Wikipedia:Probation</a> to ban a user from <i>discussing</i> or proposing a straw poll/vote or criticizing a title as being non-neutral, that is the antithesis of Wikipedia. By what justification was the proposal moved to my user namespace? By what justifiaction did Radiant rollback my edits to other user's talk pages informing them of the vote 2 days ago? By what justification was version 2.0 of the proposal speedy deleted, after 4 months of work, from its Wikipedia:Title Neutrality location? User Radiant falsely claimed the proposal failed twice, voting on version 1.0 of the proposal closed 6.5 months ago, version 2.0 of the proposal was mistakingly speedy deleted 2 days just as voting had begun. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 23:01, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

It's what it is there for. You often ask "how is x disruptive?" Well this is a textbook case. Instead of using the correct process, you decided to create new versions of the same proposal.

<dd>Radiant and others were well aware version 2.0 of the proposal was substantially updated, the previous vote closed 6.5 months ago and it has been worked on, by both sides, for 3 months so the speedy deletion was completely without merit and is an obvious case of censorship of a proposal certain admins don't like. Even if it is the same core proposal they can be resubmitted for renewed debate, discussion and voting. If you are so confident the updated proposal would still be rejected by the community why are you so adamantly against allowing the community to become aware of it? <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 05:10, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wehatetech and We hate tech were deleted per <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Wehatetech_3b8a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Wehatetech">an afd vote</a>. {{deletedpage}] was put on both of them. Well today, it was recreated as Wehatetech.com. I just put the deletedpage tag on it. I'm alerting everyone because now we have it recreated with names in different languages! Oi. Nous détestons la technologie is the name. And we've also had a user account created which consists of the deleted material. It was at User:Wehatetechdotcom. I just deleted it.

<dd>They tried to bring it up on DRV yet again, and I deleted the discussion. Now I'm being threatened.

<li>Yes. Titoxd already did that, though. Speaking of blocks, I noticed a permablock (by Curps) on a vandal named User:Ｔony Sidaway. Indeed, an imposter with zero edits. Problem is, on my system his name renders exactly like that of the well-known admin (e.g. no i/l tricks etc).

<dd>It should be deleted as a copy vio (possibly after merging the lists into one of the general missing biographies lists). Having led the charge that eventually managed to delete the similar lists that had been copied out of Britannica and Encarta, I can tell you that the people working on a project like this <i>really</i> don't like being told that copyright extends to the index of a book, and I am not up for going through that fight again myself. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 02:16, 18 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The copyright on a list extends to the selection of items on that list (as well as arrangement and presentation), but not to the particular items on a list as they themselves just facts that can't be copyright protected. It is generally believed that one list can draw on and incorporate many of the items on another list provided that the net effect is to create a new list whose selection and purpose is still distinctive. For example, if you created a list of "the best Chinese restaurants in the San Francisco", it is probably permissible for me to draw on your list (and others) when compiling a list of the "most distinctive restaurants on the West Coast" as the two are different in scope and purpose. By taking the list of Canadian biographies, excerpting just those figures not found in Wikipedia, and merging it with other lists of missing biographies, the net effect is probably to create something sufficiently distinctive that it does not infringe the copyright interests of the original compilers. At least that is my understanding of the reasoning given by the lawyers that looked at this during the last go around. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 16:33, 18 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Excuse me, but isn't a selection only copyrightable if there is a "spark of creativity"? <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=499&amp;invol=340" class="external text" title="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=499&amp;invol=340" rel="nofollow">Justice O'Connor's majority opinion</a> was pretty clear that while a list could be copyright if there was something unique about the order of presentation, alphabetic order didn't qualify. The amount of effort someone put into creating a list doesn't matter when it comes to deciding if it qualifies for copyright. I am sorry if you experienced unpleasantness in earlier discussions. But I believe you are incorrect. Your list of chinese restaurants? What makes you think it is anymore copyrightable than the names in Rural's phonebook? -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 04:19, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you actually read our Feist article, which is pretty good, you would note that there are a variety of factual compilations that can be copyright protected. For example, under <i>Eckes v. Card Prices Update</i> any list whose selection is based primarily on editorial opinion (rather than say statistics or geography) is considered to have that minimal spark of creativity necessary for copyright. There is an actual case covering Chinese resteraunts specifically, though I don't recall the citation right now. Feist v. Rural is far more narrow than you believe. The exception covers only lists of facts that lack <i>both</i> creativity in selection and creativity in presentation. A list such as DCB that is based on editoral judgment of which individuals are worthy of inclusion is going to meet the minimal standards for creativity in selection and be subject to copyright. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 22:25, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

This wasn't a personal attack so much as an accusation of vested interest (which is different from "is a troll"); accusations of vested interests are bad of course, and should be discouraged, but there aren't as horrible. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Elle <small><sub><font color="#CC9920">vécut heureuse</font></sub></small> <small><font color="blue"><sup>à jamais</sup></font></small></a> (<a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENatalinasmpf_9405.html" title="User talk:Natalinasmpf">Be eudaimonic!</a>) 22:19, 18 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Its very similar to accusing someone of being a bad editor. It was a clear case of poisoning the well despite her aggreement not to do so. Furthermore this is the remnants of an accusation of <i>vote-stacking</i>. Instead of a friendly "please don't do this, she accused of vote stacking by a biased editor whos judgement cannot be trusted because of religious beliefs.

<dd>Erm, if I get this correctly, she meant to discount a vote because, for one, anything up for deletion is more about consensus than a vote, "religious reasons" are not a valid criteria for deletion.

<p>Then follow the standard process. Have a non involved admin review the situation and block if necessary as at least a 24 hour block appeared to be. But instantly escalating to the indefinite blocks that are currently in place is innapropriate. Evading a 24 hr block is not grounds for an indefinite one. A block of 48hrs to a week and then more discussion on how to handle the issue would have been the more appropriate thing to do. Since the 24 hr block appears appropriate we have at least that long to discuss how long to extend it if need be, I see no reason to undo the current blocks yet. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 20:55, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I also agree, blocking indefinitly so fast might have been harsh and too quick. An admin unconnected to the article did intervene and the permanent blocks were etablished by others after that admin had reviewed the situation. This user has now edit warred under no less than 5 different anon ip addresses and apparently two different user names. I'm also new to this kind of thing, and probably didn't follow the book exactly as to how admins should behave. I apologize in advance for any improper things I did and encourage others to correct me. But, on the other hand, I strongly feel we are very clearly dealing with someone who has no respect for Wikipedia policies and will continue to edit war until he/she gets thier way. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 22:14, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That's fine, but if you're unsure, read the policy guys. When in doubt, be conservative. 24hrs is plenty of time to discuss to see if a block needs to be extended. If the user returns after the block and repeats the same thing or does it with another IP or username, then reblock for a slightly longer period. For me it depends on how obvious the violation is, but repeating the exact violation immediately after a block expires is obvious intent to disrupt and earns a week then a month then more if need be. That only applies when the behavior is obvious and isn't simply a content dispute. Now when it's obvious its the same person but new usernames or IP's, consider 24 or 48 hr blocks for each. The longer the block the more important it is to get admin consensus on it. Again, just do a shorter block and discuss if need be. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 22:35, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello. I just wanted to drop a line here as I couldnt figure out where else it should go. I love the idea of Wikipedia, but I do not like the eagerness of users here to delete information. There should be an eagerness to preserve information. There should be a willingness to offer unfiltereed access to items that may or may not be of interest to you, with the understanding that the information just may have relevance for someone else. While I understand there needs to be a baseline which must be met for inclusion, the bar should be set relatively low. One line nonsense or obvious fiction are one thing. But article that are relevant and are newsworthy should be given the benefit of the doubt.I do not like the loopholes that clog up the processes here. I do not like that an article that was unable to be deleted can be renominated over and over again until success is achieved (unless apparently we are talking about the GNAA site which while FAR more offensive and irrelevant than anything in this article people somehow refuse to delete). There is nothing to restrict users from constantly redirecting, merging, blanking, or AfDing an article that has made it through AfD process without a deletion or merger mandate if that article offends them or if they singularly disagree with the decision of the AfD discussion.As I said before, I like the idea of Wikipedia, and I have used it extensively in the past as a resource to garner information. I may continue to do so, but the likelihood of being an active contributor has diminished greatly after seeing what I consider to be a blatant disregard for the work of others by users who often times have an agenda which is obviously not the provision of information to the masses. Processes here are abused and manipulated. Thank you for your time. <a href="../../../t/o/k/User%7ETokyojoe2002_0497.html" title="User:Tokyojoe2002">Tokyojoe2002</a> 19:41, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I refer specifically to the article "saugeen stripper". Some valid arguments have been made for merger, although I believe that at this time it merits its own article. But that said, as soon as the first AfD was closed (the article made it through AfD without consensus), the article has since been blanked, redirected, merged, vandalized, and now AfD'd again by users AND ADMINS with no consideration of processes. many have indicated they have moral objections to ther article. Is wiki an arbiter of what is moral suddenly? And I thought there was supposed to be a 30 day moratorium on AfDing an article. I just don't get it. Leaves an awful taste in my mouth about what this place is all about. I dont expect anything done about it. I don't know who could at this point.

<dd>Can you say how or from where you formed the impression there was a deletion moratorium of any kind, and specifically a 30 day one? On your general complaints, yes, this <i>is</i> the correct place for the issues to do with out of process/improper deletions, though as the article's been recreated, currently exists, and is being re-voted on, I don't see much urgency to that question. It's of course not the best place for discussing the merits of a particular article, or of inclusionism or deletionism in general. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 20:43, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This may have been a byproduct of some things I have read (specifically, on the Saugeen Stripper discussion page) where users refer to possibly relistting the article when the "30 days are up", although it seemed like a plausibility tinged with common sense, as it would seem inappropriate to allow an article to be repeatedly AfD'd one on top of another. I guess I misinterpreted something somewhere along the line regarding that specific requirement, although I still believe this has been a nightmare in terms of process violations. <a href="../../../t/o/k/User%7ETokyojoe2002_0497.html" title="User:Tokyojoe2002">Tokyojoe2002</a> 20:50, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Yes, immediate <i>re</i>listing for deletion isn't normally allowed, but in this case, we in effect have disputed closing of the original AfD, and "relist" was the specific consensus at deletion review, so that part at least is entirely within process.

I strongly support process, as <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProcess_is_Important_0fa4.html" title="Wikipedia:Process is Important">Wikipedia:Process is Important</a> will show, but I don't see major process violations here. I argued that the redirect/merge was being imposed without consensus, but the AfD process has been perfectly open and I see no problems besides not agreeing with the views of many there. However, that will happen from time to time. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 20:02, 18 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>DES, while I respect your opinion, and appreciate your support, I have to disagree that there have been no process problems. From the moment that the previous AfD was closed, there has been a specific admin that has made it his personal mission to prurge this article from the pages of wiki. he twice attempted to outright delete the article, the decision to do so was not arrived at in afD. Then, once that stopped working, he repeatedly began redirecting the article WITHOUT INCLUSION OF THE INFO. He did this at least a handful of times despite beiung asked not to. And then the article was relisted for AfD short of what I could swear I read as a 30 day moratorium on relisting. The primary goal of this admin was, I believe immediate removal of the content. The secondary mission was to make this article such a lightening rod that it would generate negative interest among the wiki community and enough support could be rallied to achieve a sure delete on a second Afd.From the moment that the AfD ended there has not been a blink of process followed, and it is extremely disheartening. I created the article. Admittedly I have a personal desire to see the information contained within disseminated. But why someone would have an equally strong passion NOT to see that take place is bewildering and disappointing. <a href="../../../t/o/k/User%7ETokyojoe2002_0497.html" title="User:Tokyojoe2002">Tokyojoe2002</a> 20:09, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree that this is an abuse of administrator power, of the sort we are seeing increasingly.

<p>I haven't looked into the specifics of this case, but <a href="../../../t/o/k/User%7ETokyojoe2002_0497.html" title="User:Tokyojoe2002">Tokyojoe2002</a>, you have to realize that Wikipedia is a project made up of thousands of different volunteers with many different opinions. Ideally everyone would behave appropriately and nicely, but human nature is that that will not always happen. I also apologize on behalf of the community if you have been wronged, but reallize if you have been, it is from individual actions, not the project's. I think the project as a whole could certainly use a return to civility and kindness to deal with disagreements. Unfortunately as the project's popularity skyrockets we seem to be getting worse at basic courtesies. There is still dispute resolution that you can avail yourself of as we do all have an interest in having participants of the project follow our rules, and important one of which is civility. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 20:31, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you to Phil, Taxman, and Dragon. I appreciate your comments. Note, I have encountered many good-intentioned admins here (DES above is another), and I do not paint admins with one sweeping stroke. But it is just disappointing that the small percentage of admins who do not honor process and do not respect content that they may disagree with can wield so much power here. I wish there was some way to preserve this article, but at this point, the situation has spiraled out of control. I believe that those who wanted from day one for this content to disappear from wikipedia will succeed. But I want to make situations like this known in hopes that someone with the power to do so can make sure that they do not happen again so that someone's efforts are not so readily discarded. <a href="../../../t/o/k/User%7ETokyojoe2002_0497.html" title="User:Tokyojoe2002">Tokyojoe2002</a> 20:47, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I strongly suspect it's not Mr Treason at all (he's been missing for almost a year and a half). However, the North Carolina vandal has been active tonight, making dozens of socks, attacking the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> article (how do I know? 1) he's obsessed with Danielle Cunio, which was his first sockpuppet name, 2) he's always active this time of evening, and 3) I just shut down his range of 63.19.128.0/17 for three hours at 03:14, and the vandalism immediately stopped). (If I'm wrong I'll unblock it at once, but I have a hunch I'm right).

<dd>Allowing one opens the door for incessant hand-wringing to allow others. "But you let User:SuperButchBitch in, so why can't I use User:StupidBitch? I'm just trying to reclaim the term!" And then we get to spend our time having to justify the few we allow to the majority we disallow, and explaining to the majority we disallow why they don't rate. Which would generate reams of angst and drama, and for what benefit? So that a few users get to be among a selected elite allowed to use a username most other people aren't allowed to?</dd>

<dd>There's no way to call someone "stupid" in a nice meaning of the word.

<p>Anything can be theoreticaly used affectionately by somebody. Many find lack of intellect or bitchiness charming, and others are masochists who might well derive great pleasure in being refered to as a "stupid bitch". We don't care about how this person ment it tho, because the policy is against usernames which are disuptive or offensive to us, not to the user themself. I agree that it would have been best to discuss the user name w the user, but its definitely not a big deal, or worth the blocking admin getting any more concerned than they already are. I am sympathetic w Selina's POV (well, not really, but at least she explained it well), but we shouldn't have queer or gay as a username either, much less fag or nigger, which are words also being "reclaimed". <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 14:31, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The doctrine of "offensiveness" is a tricky one to invoke. Let me just say that I am not bothered by this name, that it is important to apply sense of humor to such things even if it is not possible to induce it in others, and that the suppression of user names in itself raises serious issues, certainly much more so than the content, at least in this case.

<dd>I fully support this as an inappropriate username. While I usually don't block at first for not blatantly offensive usernames (such as ones insulting Wikipedia or Jimbo), this definitely falls under offensive. The word "bitch" is widely considered and regarded as both offensive and derogatory; if you're not offended, fine. But because it is considered as offensive and derogatory, then it's an inappropriate username.

<dd>Well, if there is no clear consensus I do not see why this accountname should remain blocked. I agree with the others here that it can (and is being) used as a term of self-empowerment, especially in this context. There does not appear to be any malign intent on the part of the user either, so an attempt by the administrator to talk about it first would have been appropriate at the very least, in my opinion. That said, I am only a sysop on <a href="http://ns.goobergunch.net/wiki/index.php" class="external text" title="http://ns.goobergunch.net/wiki/index.php" rel="nofollow">NSwiki</a> so perhaps not an expert on 'big wiki jurisprudence', however I was unaware that banning things in case they are contentious or controversial is standard wiki policy. --<a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnootoss_eb47.html" title="User:Knootoss">Knootoss</a> 01:29, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Without trying to make light of the issue, I'd draw comparisons to <i>Revenge of the Nerds</i>, where at first the jocks use 'nerd' as a derogatory phrase, and by the end of the film, the nerds have reclaimed the word, with Lewis stating that he's proud to be a nerd, and summons all other nerds to step forward.</p>
<p>And the parallels between this issue and the reclamation of 'queer' and and (here in Australia) 'wog' (for immigrants of South European descent) are obvious. 'Bitch' is considered an offensive phrase used towards women, but I'm all for those attempting to reclaim the word. <a href="../../../c/n/w/User%7ECnwb_9e49.html" title="User:Cnwb">Cnwb</a> 01:55, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It doesn't work and it imposes an undue burden on users, especially new users. I did the thing of installing a monobook.js, which is a burden for new users and a bother for experienced users. This caused a second menu to appear in front of the blank menu that recently appeared under the special characters list. When I select a language, nothing happens, and I still don't have the characters I need and that I used to have available when I needed them. There are other problems too.

I think this blog is clearly notable. A disappointingly small number of people voted in its AfD. I will also be very annoyed if W.bloggar is deleted. Thousands of people use this software to post entries to their blog; I used it in the past. GNAA made no attempt to assess the notability of this software, and there are several illegal votes in the AfD by users with no other edits. I see you voted to keep that article, and I'm glad that you're not just knee-jerk deleting. That's what they are doing.

<dd>Well, in terms of the Rottweiler article there is obviously geniune disagreement between admins over that one with the majority favoring deletion - plus the GNAA interference in that debate was somewhat minimal (indeed the debate itself was rather minimal). As for W.bloggar that will probably easily be kept, and even if it doesn't there are other high-edit and admins who wanted that article deleted also so it isn't really an open-and-shut case. While the pile-on votes from the new users are somewhat disruptive, as far as I can see it isn't much different then the old schoolwatch debate a while back - except this is even in userspace and not public space. In terms of nominations they actually provide at least some varafiable information (google hits, alexa rankings, etc.) and guideline arguments for most articles which is honestly more than most AfD nominations do, and this was due to criticism about earlier nominations so it seems like an honest attempt to contribute.

It is fine if you don't think a blog should have an article.

<li>User:NONCENSORED Popeye - few edits outside AfD, reincarnation of User:GNAA Popeye who was blocked</li>

<p>Since when do we care so much about the human bean and so little about the contribution? These protestations of "GNAA! Everyone look!!" seem a bit shrill. If the nomination is a good one (and I've tuned them up a few times about how to make good ones) and the closer isn't brain dead (we can only hope) this is a total non-issue. So, we've got a few people doing block voting... is this something new? *cough* school watch *cough* So we've got some off-site organisation... it <i>this</i> something new? *cough* IRC, mailing list *cough*. This thread started out reasonable enough, but has devolved. The time would be better spent presenting clear, verifiable evidence to AfD of a blog's notability.<br />

<li>Personally, I think that the bar should be set *very* high for BLOGs to be considered suitable topics for an entry on Wikipedia, and unfortunately we've generally been hurt by a lot of bars that *should* be higher having slipped. As unusual as the source is for this effort, I feel that it's likely to produce results that are good for the project. It is also worthy of note that some GNAA members, most notably <a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_637c.html" title="User:SPUI">SPUI</a> have become valuable members of the Wiki community (even considering his odd sense of humour) -- we cannot assume that people who are initially hostile to the project will remain so indefinitely or that their contributions are automatically without merit. --<a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImprov_b282.html" title="User:Improv">Improv</a> 07:10, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I can't see the problem either. Everyone knows Timecop, knows he has an agenda, and I for one take the time to check the ones I vote on; most of them really <i>are</i> blogcruft and seem to get deleted by solid consensus, with lots of names I recognise as regular AfD voters outside of the GNAA nominations. But then, I have never seen a problem with bringing articles to AfD - good articles should not get dleeted (and in my view generally don't). We're more likely to keep a crap article than delete a good one. I think it's absolutely right that someone other than a blog fan also runs through these lists. Of course, if Mr Ego were to take a back seat for a minute the bloggers and GNAA could work together to get the blog content down to manageable proportions, and cover the lesser but still moderately important subjects, like minor subgenres, without creating disporportionately vast articles on nonentities (can we say <i>merge</i>, children?). - <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid"> Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JzG_1e67.html" title="Special:Contributions/JzG">[C]</a></sub> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> <i><a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_AfD_78f4.html" title="User:JzG/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 17:49, 19 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This whole thing is silly. As an administrator, Curps, you should know that administrators are capable of making judgement calls on the veracity of an AfD vote before closing it. If they feel the vote has loaded by sock/meatpuppets who have barely made any edits, then they are able to make a decision. And both sides of this argument could do with consulting <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> a little more closely. Rhobite, if you dislike what the 'war on blogs' is doing, then perhaps you could try and present pertinent, researched, cited reasons during blog-related AfDs. Even if the GNAA mass-vote, if there is a good, researched reason to keep, then enough people will vote keep to ensure the article remains. If there is not, then the article will - rightly - be deleted. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto">Proto</a><small> <a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto">t</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Proto_c67f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Proto">c</a></small> 12:21, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The last few weeks, there have been a lot of rather important changes to MediaWiki messages that weren't discussed and were not necessarily a good idea.

<dd>Yes, there have been edit wars raging between usually the same sets of users on various MediaWiki pages. I wonder if the attraction is a kind of "bright lights" thing when you know what you do will instantly affect everyone everywhere. Whatever it is, it needs to stop, as I've said in several places. We should have a rule, yes golly some instruction creep, that admins, by convention <i>do not</i> edit those pages without discussing there changes on <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a> or <a href="../../../v/p/_/WP%7EVP_dc2f.html" title="WP:VP">WP:VP</a> or somesuch first, and <i>defintiely</i> never without providing a working test somewhere that people can hack about with in advance.

<p>Actually I think not even the devs and the board should change it without discussion unless they have a good reason since much of the edit warring on sitenotice was caused by the fact that certain unnamed people who may or may not have been devs and/or may or may not have had impromptu and definitely unnoficial board meetings decided to unilaterally add ugly notices to the sitenotice message and used the so called "will of the board" as an excuse to revert all changes to it.

<li>Yes, that's why I suggested AN or some other high-profile page.

Even if it did, it imposed a burden on new users and a bother to experienced users with the requirement to install javascript code into monobook.cs or similar. <a href="../../../h/u/_/User%7EHu_5903.html" title="User:Hu">Hu</a> 05:38, 20 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>AFAIK none of the versions required user interaction to get working (they only required Javascript to be enabled, which must be enabled in any event because <code>&lt;charinsert&gt;</code> utilizes Javascript to do its magic). I'll try and find your complaint regarding the split-apart version and perhaps address that seperately. —Locke Cole • <a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocke_Cole_92ea.html" title="User talk:Locke Cole">t</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Locke_Cole_6f88.html" title="Special:Contributions/Locke Cole">c</a> 05:44, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The instructions I was required to follow on the Edit Tools page (I think that was the page, but I don't remember I just followed the instructions that appeared where the characters used to be) required installing code into the monobook "page".

<li>That's fair enough... however could I request a prominent link to our site policies when people create an account? We shouldn't give them the excuse that they <i>didn't know</i> about what is expected on the site. I have added the link to appear after you login, but don't know about new signs. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 02:28, 20 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>I am aware of that: I put it there. We still need a link to the policies when the create an account. I just created one, and there is not a single link to inform new editors of our site policies. How can they be expected to play nicely when they don't know the rules?! - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 15:39, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
