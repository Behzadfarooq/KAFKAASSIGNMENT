<p>First things first I've never been here before, so I'm not sure what to do to explain this...In a nutshell I have gotten agreement from several members of <a href="../../../c/u/_/WP%7ECU_027e.html" title="WP:CU">WP:CU</a>(the page that takes care of the cleanup backlog), and approval to run on <a href="../../../b/r/f/WP%7EBRFA_d541.html" title="WP:BRFA">WP:BRFA</a></p>
<p>These activites have been proposed <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_Requests_for_approvals_904a.html#User:Gnome_.28Bot.29_requesting_trial_run_and_evential_bot_flag" title="Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approvals">here</a> and <a href="../../../c/l/e/Wikipedia_talk%7ECleanup_6158.html#Janitor_bot_proposal" title="Wikipedia talk:Cleanup">here</a></p>
<p>The reasoning behind this is, how do you "cleanup" a article that is so small. ---what the article needs is to be expanded (when the article is expanded all "cleanup" that has been done will be lost).</p>
<dl>
<dd>Also please remember we have a cleanup backlog of almost 14000 articles... The person who requested that I would create this bot resquested it to reduce the backlog...That way the articles that need only cleanup are on the list.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>By the way every stub belongs in the cleanup category...After all they are all small, some are not wikified, some have grammer problems... ect.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I will disable the function for now...but I believe that this issue needs to be debated in a more public forum. (looking at the merits of the idea alone), as I am not the only person who feels that this is a good idea.<a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEagle_101_bfb5.html" title="User:Eagle 101">Eagle</a> (<a href="../../../e/a/g/User_talk%7EEagle_101_4fc4.html" title="User talk:Eagle 101">talk</a>) (desk) 02:12, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also Zoe, will you be more specific next time you post to my talk page, or the bot...Which articles were you talking about??? I had to look in your contributions to find out that you had posted it on this page as well... Would have been nice to have a heads up...(than agian the block message might have pointed me here...but the bot shuts off as soon as you post a message on its page...So I will never know)</dd>

<p>Zoe--you blocked the bot because of the edit it made to this page...the reasoning for the block is "(inappropriate bot)"...You left a message on my talk page that said this "Why would arbitrary deletion of cleanup tags serve any function?"...YOu left a message on the bot's talk page that said "This bot has no purpose other than to remove cleanup tags which apparently were put there for very appropriate reasons. Please stop."</p>
<p>I just want to make sure that you realize that the bot does not "arbitrarily" delete cleanup tags, It only does it if the article is a stub or should be a stub. The reason why I mention this is because you reverted both the removal of the cleanup tag, and the addition of the stub tag. (now the article is only tagged as cleanup, but it is a stub (cleanup or not).</p>
<dl>
<dd>by your definition all stubs should be in the cleanup category????</dd>
</dl>
<p>Sorry if I sound rude... but I had to look in your contributes to find this page and to find out what articles you had problems with... and even then I had to read inbetween the lines, If it were not for joe, I would be in the dark.</p>

<li>I have to agree with Eagle, this feels a bit heavy handed. He has been trying to get GnomeBot ready for trial for some time and largely been ignored. Then, when he puts a tentative model up for trial he gets knocked back, hard. CleanUp needs CleanedUp and Eagle is trying to do something positive about it. I had a look at the recommendations that GnomeBot was making and found that I agreed with almost all of them, they appeared to be both sensible and desirable. I would suggest that this Bot is given the trial that was intended and then we can discuss the results.</li>

<li>"Cleaning up" does not mean random deletion of cleanup tags, it means actually going to the pages being tagged and trying to determine why and how it should be cleaned up.

<p>I've reblocked the bot for exactly the same reason that Zoe did originally (the original block seems to have been removed). There is NO justification WHATSOEVER for removing {{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup_258a.html" title="Template:Cleanup">cleanup</a>}} from stubs, and I am getting heartily sick of rolling back this bot's activity, which I've now had to do to over a dozen articles. A {{<a href="../../../s/t/u/Template%7EStub_4533.html" title="Template:Stub">stub</a>}} tag simply indicates that an article is too short and needs expansion - a {{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup_258a.html" title="Template:Cleanup">cleanup</a>}} tag indicates deeper problems, such as grammar, layout, wikification, translation, style, context or inapproriate language. The two are NOT interchangable, and freuqntly an article needs both tags. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 12:40, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hm...looking again, maybe I've just added a second block over the top of the first - both indefinite though, so it shouldn't affect anything. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 12:46, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

He has move protected approximately 50 high-profile pages in recent days, though they had no move wars and in few, if any, cases have ever exhibited any. In few cases have they ever even been moved. I recognise that <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Einstein_8441.html" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>, for example, is unlikely to need a move for some time to come, but we really don't want to go slapping protection on articles "just in case the apocyalypse comes". It seems to me to run directly counter to the spirit of open editing and trusting editors.</p>
<p>FoN cites the database troubles that might, hypothetically, be caused by a vandalistic move of such an article. This seems a weak justification for amending (by fiat) the way we do things that has worked fine and dandy for a number of years. My feeling is that these protections have no basis in policy, guideline, practise, precedent or practicality and that they should be reversed. If people don't want vandals in their work, they should be writing on paper. Vandals (or, more accurately, admins' nightmares of them) are not the biggest problem round here. Should we be mass-protecting pre-emptively? -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 15:12, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If it weren't so mind-numbingly easy to create an account and use it for pagemove vandalism only a week later, it wouldn't be a concern. If moving pages was actually as simple as changing which title pertains to a stationary stack of edits, it wouldn't be a concern. If it wasn't so easy to unintentionally delete a large stack of edits whilst performing a page move, perhaps if the software generated some kind of warning similar to that of an edit conflict, it wouldn't be a concern. If restoring 7312 deleted edits wasn't a task requiring developer access, it wouldn't be a concern. If this was some kind of Wiki-Utopia completely bereft of vandalism, it wouldn't be a concern. Unfortunately the sum of these conditions indicates that it is, in fact, a major concern. Even <a href="../../../r/u/n/RuneScape_dacf.html" title="RuneScape">RuneScape</a>, for example, an article about a video game that none of us would think to take seriously, now has more edits than <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> did on the day that it got moved to FUCK SHlT COCK WHORE SLUT PUSSY DlCK NIGGER CHINK and subsequently disappeared for an hour, before <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrion_VIBBER_bae4.html" title="User:Brion VIBBER">Brion VIBBER</a> was able to bring it back.

<dd>If you can't bear a bit of vandalism, then either write your work on paper, or use a different website. Here, we are open and welcoming, and not working on the assumption os imagined apocalypses to come. Less caffeine, less panic, and less protection. If people are going to go around slapping protection on anything that'd be edited a lot, then gradually there will be fewer and fewer things getting edited. I don't see any circumstance under which that is viable in short-, medium- or long term. Using move protection (somewhat under the radar, I add: no discussion, no announcement, no tags, no warnings, no notes anywhere) is just a rather quiet step in a profoundly wrong direction. If the servers have a problem, it is for the sysadmins and developers to fix it. It is not for admins here to lock the site down in quivering fear of a bad edit. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 15:49, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Should I take offense to such labeling, or is it being used affectionately? I can't distinguish sarcasm from seriousness in Splash's words anymore. For the record I stopped at the end of page one because I got bored, and, in the capacity of <i>thinking like a vandal</i> I assumed that an actual vandal would get bored at the same point and go back to whatever he was previously doing, be it playing <a href="../../../r/u/n/RuneScape_dacf.html" title="RuneScape">RuneScape</a> or watching <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_%28soccer%29.html" title="Football (soccer)">football (soccer)</a> on the <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television.html" title="Television">telly</a>. I assumed good faith from #51 onward? It's hard to say with any certainty. Seriously, though, a better solution would be to increase the threshhold of account age and experience required for an account to perform page moves. As it is, they sit and do nothing, until some kid with an index card logs back into the accounts and wreaks havoc. Perhaps establish a minimum number of edits, at which point we can reasonably assume that if a user hasn't yet been indefinitely blocked as a vandal, he probably won't be. Hopefully good faith and common sense won't always be mutually exclusive goals, and hopefully (in the absence of protection) <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion.html" title="Abortion">Abortion</a> won't be moved to Nine-months-after pill at the drop of a hat, no pun intended. — <small>Mar. 28, '06</small> <tt class="plainlinks"><b>[18:16] &lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakofnurture_92d3.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakofnurture_92d3.html" rel="nofollow">freakofnur<sub>x</sub>ture</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_freakofnurture_e7bb.html" title="Special:Contributions/freakofnurture">|</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" rel="nofollow">talk</a>&gt;</b></tt>

<dd>People do seem to emerge from IRC slightly vandal-crazed. Usually into #wikipedia in capital letters about needing a hundredthousand username blocks yesterday and all rollback buttons in action right now. Sitting in the anti-vandal channel for too long seems to give the impression that every edit is, with good probability, bad. It's not the full RC list, after all, by design it's only the dodgy stuff you get to see. This leads, I think, to a feeling of being taken over and needing to slam the doors (the horse having already both bolted and invaded doesn't seem to matter). I don't think you assumed good faith at any point (nor necessarily bad, though there has to be an element in preemptivity). I think you stopped probably unsure of whether you should carry on. If you do carry on, I will lift the further protections. Those pages further down have a few thousand edits, and the servers, I know for a fact, can handle that.

Assuming good faith is not the same as leaving ourselves vulnerable to quite predictable attack that will significantly eat up people's time to fix. The "oppenness" of the wiki is not seriously hampered by this action. Performing a page-move is not some kind of God-given right that every user must have for every page. I support establishing some kind of guideline as to what the protection-threshold should be. In the meantime, I see nothing wrong with FoN's protections. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 18:22, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yes, actually, I think it is. The wiki is fundamentally based on trust: that's why you can "edit this page", to coin a phrase. Preemptive protection is an explicit statement of distrust.

<p>Clearly I have to adjust my thinking somewhat. Whilst I do not accept that these move protections are either good or necessary clearly some people do. I won't lift them. But I do not think this discussion mandates any further widespread move protections without a discussion first. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 19:39, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The number of revisions in the database corresponding to a page does not factor into the page move operation, so moving a page with 1000 revisions is no different than moving one with one revision in terms of database server load. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobchurch_62ba.html" title="User:Robchurch">Rob</a> <a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobchurch_99c1.html" title="User talk:Robchurch">Church</a> 21:17, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks. So there being no technical basis for the blocks, nor any editorial basis and a move-revert being a single click (doable by any editor in most cases over a redirect), we can lift these protections unless someone's got a new reason. ("but they don't need moving" isn't really good enough.) -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 22:05, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well I think the technical explanation doesn't cover the actual issue suffered, which was as a result of the move United States ended up being deleted and restoring the large number of revisions required developer intervention. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User%7EPgk_d0c7.html" title="User:Pgk">pgk</a><sup>(<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk"><font color="mediumseagreen">talk</font></a>)</sup> 06:53, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I'll echo what Pgk said. If undoing a vandal move of <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> or <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Einstein_8441.html" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> with a single move-revert always worked, then we wouldn't be having this discussion. Unfortunately – unless I'm mistaken, developer comments welcome – articles with <i>extremely</i> long edit histories (which also often happen to be targets for vandals; many edits are reverts) tend to get mucked up when we try to put them back. With <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, I gather that fixing the problem required developer intervention. The result was that we were without an important and high-traffic article for a significant length of time.</dd>
<dd>I see the move-protection of these frequently-edited pages as a low-cost way to prevent a rather inconvenient and embarrassing sort of harm ("What do you mean Wikipedia doesn't have an article on <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a>?") that doesn't inconvenience regular, good-faith editors one bit. If the issue with the database/engine goes away to the point that we <i>can</i> reliably repair these large-history page moves, then we could discuss the philosophical reasons for unprotecting them.</dd>
<dd>While we wish to present a trusting, assume-good-faith, welcoming, open face to the world, we shouldn't be idiots about it. I'm usually a pretty open and trusting individual, but I don't leave my car unlocked. FoN has just closed off a potentially nasty avenue for attack.</dd>

<p>All the arguments against the protections here seem to be based on principles (It's unwiki, it assumes bad faith, yada yada yada). Think practical, will you.

Honestly? This only hurts the vandals. Therefore everybody who opposes it is a vandal. <i>Just kidding</i>. Seriously though, why argue over the principle when the fact is that the only way these articles would be moved in the foreseeable future would be because of a vandal attack. <a href="../../../w/e/r/User%7EWerdna648_4a6e.html" title="User:Werdna648">Werdna648</a><sup><a href="../../../w/e/r/User_talk%7EWerdna648_bc69.html" title="User talk:Werdna648">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Werdna648_26b2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Werdna648">C</a></sub>\<sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Werdna648_360a.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Werdna648">@</a></sup> 07:05, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Here are two important things we should strive for: Robustness and Efficiency. Allowing moves of these articles invites something to go wrong, as in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> example above - that harms the robustness of wikipedia. Undoing vandalism takes time away from other important tasks - that hurts the efficiency of the encyclopedia building process. Protecting these pages against willy-nilly moves is a perfectly legitimate step to enhance our robustness and efficiency. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 07:16, 29 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Ee could protect things against moves by default, but make it easy to have them unprotected. Or you could just ask an admin to move it for you, or we could protect <i>all</i> pages against moves. Practical harm: very low. Practical utility: not demonstrated, estimates vary wildly. Harm to paradigm: moderate. Thus, based upon lack of evidence presented that uility outweighs harm, unprotect. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#000000">brenneman</font></a><span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" rel="nofollow"><font color="#000000" title="Admin actions"><sup><b>{L}</b></sup></font></a></span> 01:39, 30 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Regarding my above statement, in case anyone comes along and says "What are you talking about?

Personally, I call the river the "Huang Ho", but that's probably just a reflection of my background as a geography and ethnolinguistics buff.

Fortunately, redirecting involves a mass-blanking, so it's caught by a few of the automated vandalism-watchers out there. I don't know how feasible a redirect-log would be, as creating a redirect is (currently, at least) done within the page's code while a move is done with the toolbar and can trigger other actions more easily.

<dd>difficult -- was there no arbcom ruling whatsoever? We need the arbcom to declare special measures (blocks, protection, rollbacks) for articles suffering from organized pov-pushing. As long as all editors remain polite, all that mere admins can do is help reverting and block for 3RR I suppose. Any ideas? <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 10:11, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Koot">Admin Koot</a> Abuse of admin privileges</span></h2>
<p>Admin Koot reverted <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chiropractic.html" title="Chiropractic">chiropractic</a> without discussion. Despite my request at the time, Koot has still not explained why he abused his admin privileges <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">3RR</a> states "Except in cases of spam and vandalism, an administrator should not block users for 3RR if they themselves have reverted that user's edits on that page. Instead, administrators in this situation should make a request at the administrators' noticeboard if they believe 3RR has been broken."</p>
<p>Could someone please remind Koot that he needs to think more carefully before he acts.</p>
<p>His bulk revert reverted good edits, including by Arbitrator Charles Matthews. This is not the first time he has acted inappropriately. By his own admission:</p>
<ul>
<li>21:35, 8 March 2006 R. Koot unprotected Al-Khwarizmi (i'm too closely involved to protect)</li>
<li>21:28, 8 March 2006 R. Koot protected Al-Khwarizmi (edit war [edit=sysop:move=sysop])</li>
</ul>
<p>The following Koot blocks need explanation. Their timing appears to confirm a tendency not to review matters carefully before blocking .</p>
<ul>
<li>19:07, 6 March 2006 R. Koot blocked "Arianitr (contribs)" with an expiry time of 8 hours (3rr violation on Gostivar)</li>
<li>19:06, 6 March 2006 R. Koot unblocked Arianitr (contribs) (shortening block)</li>
<li>19:03, 6 March 2006 R. Koot blocked "Arianitr (contribs)" with an expiry time of 24 hours (3RR violation at Gostivar)</li>
</ul>
<p>The recent block by Koot of <a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">User:tbeatty</a> repeats the pattern of acting too quickly.</p>

<p>I have unfortunately had a disagreement with user 154.5.19.185. I will admit, that the argument was concerning subject matter not particularly relevant to Wikipedia, and that I myself said inappropriate things to him/her that no doubt provoked him/her... My concern is with the final response that was left on my talk page (I have deleted it, but it's in my history). This is possibly the most demeaing, insulting and hurtful comment anyone has ever left me... by far. I make a habit of NEVER insulting or attacking other users, but admit that on this occassion, I was overly abrasive and came too close (he/she on the other hand, did not hold back). I admit that I said things which clearly sparked anger. I don't know what can/should be done, but I felt it necessary that I report it. --<a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArch26_4a1c.html" title="User:Arch26">Arch26</a> 02:46, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To clarify, clearly Mel Etitis has looked into the background of this more than I did. I saw the user posting {{bv}} tags to an admins talk page in response to that admin reverting the removal of warnings from his talk page. <a href="../../../t/a/l/WP%7ETALK_766c.html" title="WP:TALK">WP:TALK</a> states "Furthermore WP:VAND states: Removing warnings, whether for vandalism or other forms of prohibited/discouraged behavior, from one's talk page is also considered vandalism." Additionally the user was maintaining a "watchlist" on his page listing individuals as vandals, admin abusers etc. I consider this to be uncivil at best if not a personal attack. This <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Guanaco%2C_MarkSweep%2C_et_al_Proposed_decision_89b3.html#StrangerInParadise_is_uncivil" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Guanaco, MarkSweep, et al/Proposed decision">*proposed* arbcom decision</a>. anticipates similar behaviour as being unacceptable. Additionally the user had been blocked a couple of days previously for similar. As a potentially controversial block hence the posting here. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User%7EPgk_d0c7.html" title="User:Pgk">pgk</a><sup>(<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk"><font color="mediumseagreen">talk</font></a>)</sup> 17:57, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Frankly, I'm inclined to sympathise with Croatian historian; too many admins have looked at the page, seen a warning template being removed, and knee-jerked into attacks on the User, without bothering to check the validity of the template. It was a mischievous use of the template by another editor who has been harassing Croatian historian. "Vandal" may be the wrong word, but given the pressure he's been put under, and the many admins who have piled in against him without bothering to find out what's been going on, I think that he can be forgiven. I'm unprotecting the page, so that he can clear it of the junk that's been piling up. Ny advice to him is to archive the whole page, and start afresh. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 16:08, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I find it very disconcerting that a user can personally attack other users, including upstanding editors and admins, act incredibly rude and uncivil, threaten them, delete his warnings, ignore other warnings, and then get off unblocked.

<p>Since I see my name is mentioned several times, I feel I should comment on the issue. I would like to start by writing a Croatian historian quote:</p>
<ul>
<li>"<i>Not all nationalism is genocidal or aggressive expansionist/irredentist like the Serbian one.</i>" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ACroatian_historian&amp;diff=45570840&amp;oldid=45263227" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ACroatian_historian&amp;diff=45570840&amp;oldid=45263227" rel="nofollow">[13]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I'm a Serb. I find that very offensive. So, I posted a "<i>no personal attacks</i>" template on his page. He just deleted it. He claims that I'm mad at him because he voted against me when I applied for an administrator on English Wikipedia, but that is not the reason at all. We're all a little biased, some more than others. But this next quote by Croatian historian is too much:</p>
<ul>
<li>"<i><a href="../../../a/l/o/Alojzije_Cardinal_Stepinac_ae91.html" title="Alojzije Cardinal Stepinac">Alojzije Cardinal Stepinac</a> was perhaps the most honourable man in history of Croatia of the 20th century, also if compared to great statesmen like <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franjo_Tu%C4%91man_b3e8.html" title="Franjo Tuđman">Franjo Tuđman</a>.</i>" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ACroatian_historian&amp;diff=45764851&amp;oldid=45763614" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ACroatian_historian&amp;diff=45764851&amp;oldid=45763614" rel="nofollow">[14]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Doesn't that seem a little too biased. I would even dare to call it nationalist. This is an encyclopaedia, not a blog. I'd also like to mention some other edits he made to actual articles, which I find are extremely biased, and quite frankly should be considered as vandalism:</p>

<p>"<i>Attack is the best defense</i>". I'm not the perfect Wikipedian, but please, if you have something against me, don't discuss it here, we're talking about Croatian historian.</p>
<p>Also, Croatian historian did <b>not</b> add the word <i>accused</i>, and he didn't do it on purpose. If he had added that word, I would have nothing against the edit. But both of you didn't really comment on the more troubling issues, and you're obviously taking sides on this discussion, without rationally analyzing all aspects of the topic. --<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBormalagurski_75a9.html" title="User:Bormalagurski"><font color="#003399"><b>Boris Malagurski</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/o/r/User_talk%7EBormalagurski_8b57.html" title="User talk:Bormalagurski"><font color="#A61022"><b>₪</b></font></a> 06:59, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, the difference between me and Croatian user is that this is the first time I've accused someone of taking sides. Croatian user accuses everyone who is against him of taking sides with <b>me</b>, so if you don't like him, you're a Boris Malagurski supporter. I don't see how you can take that as a compliment, but if it makes you feel better, sure, why not... --<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBormalagurski_75a9.html" title="User:Bormalagurski"><font color="#003399"><b>Boris Malagurski</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/o/r/User_talk%7EBormalagurski_8b57.html" title="User talk:Bormalagurski"><font color="#A61022"><b>₪</b></font></a> 07:08, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I disagree on several points. Croatian history is being discussed here, however it shouldn't be all about his actions and only his actions; he isn't mass editing with no interuser interactions. I am not taking sides between the two of you, but I am going to note the shots between the two of you. I will also note not all of your shots have been 100% clean. Thus I come to the second point where I disagree. I am not taking sides here. I want to keep my hands clean. I do suggest finding an arbitrator though; any problems the two of you have with each other is not good for wikipedia. Three: This problem has more than one side and two users. If Croatian historian is a troll, then there are also people who feed the troll. I am not saying anyone, you and Croatian historian included, should be banned or any other admin actions should be taken though; such actions are up to the admins to decide, not me. I am saying though all sides need to walk away from this learning lessons and changing how we act, even if only a little bit.--<a href="../../../o/r/b/User%7EOrbitOne_44d2.html" title="User:OrbitOne"><big><big><font face="Brush Script MT" color="blue">Orbit</font><font face="Brush Script MT" color="green">One</font></big></big></a> <sup>[<span style="color:red"><a href="../../../o/r/b/User_talk%7EOrbitOne_a840.html" title="User talk:OrbitOne">Talk</a></span>|<span style="color:gold"><a href="../../../o/r/b/User%7EOrbitOne_Translations_7e87.html" title="User:OrbitOne/Translations">Babel</a></span>]</sup> 10:16, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Still, noone is commenting on the links I posted, and if that's not taking sides, I don't know what is. Could anyone say why Croatian historian should be a part of this Wikipedia, even though he writes stuff like that (honestly, read the links)? Once again, I'm not the perfect Wikipedian, noone is, and I've made a few mistakes, but I've tried since to correct them: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ACroatian_historian&amp;diff=46134752&amp;oldid=46059042" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ACroatian_historian&amp;diff=46134752&amp;oldid=46059042" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>But what Croatian historian has done, and what he is still constantly doing, is unacceptable. Unlike me, he will <b>never</b> change. So, if you still think that you're going to save this user from being blocked by attacking the edits I've made, think again, because the reasons I've given are good enough to block him, and you can't deny that just because I made a few mistakes in the past. --<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBormalagurski_75a9.html" title="User:Bormalagurski"><font color="#003399"><b>Boris Malagurski</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/o/r/User_talk%7EBormalagurski_8b57.html" title="User talk:Bormalagurski"><font color="#A61022"><b>₪</b></font></a> 20:30, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not sure what your point is here Karl; quit trying to make a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">point</a>. I personally can't answer that question for you. People put items of varying degrees of offensiveness on their userpages, and I have said nothing. If you (or others) choose to portray yourself as someone who is intolerant of other faiths and viewpoints, that is your prerogative. Just make sure that intolerance stays on your user page and doesn't extend to the rest of Wikipedia. I know there are many who are going to be quick to disagree with me, but I've seen people with pages devoted to nudity and others (such as Karl) who make a point to lambaste or insult religions. Until I see a crackdown on content on all userpages or a disturbance due to the page (which to this point, I have seen none), I fail to see the problem. However, I must point out that if your point here is to troll (as I suspect may be the motive behind the Scientology link), that is not condoned by me. <a href="../../../j/o/t/User%7EJoturner_23fb.html" title="User:Joturner">joturner</a> 00:00, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A couple of admins have been behaving in a disturbingly emotional way in attacking this user. His user page had been twice protected, and he has just been blocked for 48 hours, supposedly for personal attacks; the evidence for these appears to be:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nlu&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=46024018" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nlu&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=46024018" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mel_Etitis&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=46022908" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mel_Etitis&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=46022908" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mel_Etitis&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=46020789" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mel_Etitis&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=46020789" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lbmixpro&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=46020380" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lbmixpro&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=46020380" rel="nofollow">tells me to shutup</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Croatian_historian&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=46020453" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Croatian_historian&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=46020453" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>.</p>
<p>Frankly, this is absurd. Even if most of these in fact counted as attacks, there's something unpleasant about blocking an editor for attacking oneself; the case should have been placed before other admins, here. The other "crime" that Croatian historian has committed is to remove bad-faith and mischievous additions of warning templates from his own talk page — templates placed there by editors who are in dispute with him, and who are using the templates to attack him.</p>
<p>Admins such as <a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">User:Nlu</a> and <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester">User:Swatjester</a> are at best being overly sensitive, and acting without bothering to look any deeper into the situation than what is on the surface. Could other, experienced admins look into this, and help to sort it out? I've unblocked him and unprotected his page. Perhaps the two admins involved could step back and let others take over. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 16:43, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Here's my reasoning: The first warnings may or may not have been bad-faith. It doesn't really matter, the proper solution is to ask an admin to review and remove them. Hell, I've got a bad-faith 3rr warning on my page, I just struck it threw and kept it on there until the user retracted it. So a couple different users start reverting his blankings of the warnings, and he keeps on referring to us as "vandals" and claiming he has full rights to his talk page (which is not true as evidenced in WP:TALK). Deletion of warnings is vandalism per <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANDAL_b36a.html" title="WP:VANDAL">WP:VANDAL</a>. He was informed of this, he blanked again. He was informed again, he blanked again. It spread to another user's talk, where be was uncivil and referring to us as "kids". He was explained to AGAIN there, at which time he told me to "Shut up", an obvious personal attack. I added the NPA template to his page, just before Nlu protected it. I asked Nlu to add a spacing between my warning and the last one from rory, which had gotten entangled, that was the only "protected page editing" I can think of. From there on, Croatian begins accusing Nlu of admin abuse, threatening that their admin powers will be removed, and all sorts of other uncivil behavior. I don't care what kind of stress he's under: If he is that stressed, he needs to step back from the computer and not edit. Oh, and I didn't even mention that before any of this had begun, last night, I got a message from another editor to watch Croatians edits, along with 3 others, as he's been harassing them. It's still up on my talk page if you want to check. I fail to see how I'm being emotional and overly sensitive., and acting without bothering to look, especially when Mel thinks I'm an admin, and I'm not (doesn't bode well for standing to make claims that I bothered to look into situations). I feel I've maintained a professional and civil attitude. Ironically, I received an award from another user during all of this (up on my talk). I consider myself, Rory, and Nlu upstanding editors (and in nlu's case admin), and vigorously protest this categorization. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">⇒</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Iceland.svg_bd47.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/ce/Flag_of_Iceland.svg/18px-Flag_of_Iceland.svg.png" alt="" width="18" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Iceland.svg_bd47.html" /></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Swatjester_088b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Swatjester"><small><sup>Ready</sup></small></a> <a href="../../../r/s/t/RSTA_5dcc.html" title="RSTA"><small>Aim</small></a> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_United_States_Armed_Forces_74b7.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject United States Armed Forces"><small><sub>Fire!</sub></small></a> 16:51, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Let me just add one comment on this:</p>
<p>I find it absolutely mindboggling that Mel is claiming that Croatian historian's edits were <i>not</i> personal attacks. (See <a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">User talk:Nlu</a> on even harsher language that Mel used on my talk page.) As I've written lately with regard to an unrelated matter, <i>think how you would react if it were anybody else</i>. If we do not allow anonymous IPs and other users to make this type of personal attacks without being blocked, then it is hypocritical to not to block Croatian historian for this type of personal attacks. There is no justification that I see for Mel to further have removed the 48-hour block that I placed on Croatian historian. If there is someone who's abusing admin powers, I feel strongly that it wasn't I. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 18:50, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I feel I should comment on the issue. I would like to start by writing a Croatian historian quote:</p>
<ul>
<li>"<i>Not all nationalism is genocidal or aggressive expansionist/irredentist like the Serbian one.</i>" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ACroatian_historian&amp;diff=45570840&amp;oldid=45263227" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ACroatian_historian&amp;diff=45570840&amp;oldid=45263227" rel="nofollow">[25]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I'm a Serb. I find that very offensive. So, I posted a "<i>no personal attacks</i>" template on his page. He just deleted it. He claims that I'm mad at him because he voted against me when I applied for an administrator on English Wikipedia, but that is not the reason at all. We're all a little biased, some more than others. But this next quote by Croatian historian is too much:</p>
<ul>
<li>"<i><a href="../../../a/l/o/Alojzije_Cardinal_Stepinac_ae91.html" title="Alojzije Cardinal Stepinac">Alojzije Cardinal Stepinac</a> was perhaps the most honourable man in history of Croatia of the 20th century, also if compared to great statesmen like <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franjo_Tu%C4%91man_b3e8.html" title="Franjo Tuđman">Franjo Tuđman</a>.</i>" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ACroatian_historian&amp;diff=45764851&amp;oldid=45763614" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ACroatian_historian&amp;diff=45764851&amp;oldid=45763614" rel="nofollow">[26]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Doesn't that seem a little too biased. I would even dare to call it nationalist. This is an encyclopaedia, not a blog. I'd also like to mention some other edits he made to actual articles, which I find are extremely biased, and quite frankly should be considered as vandalism:</p>

<p>There clearly is a difference between Serbs and "Serb nationalism". Are you suggesting all Serbs are nationalists?

<p><big>Thats it!</big> I don't care what you do with Croatian historian, Mel is obviously always going to unblock him, and there is no point in discussing this with him.

<p>While the usernames created afterward look suspicious, this isn't the sort of username I would block without at least leaving a note on the talk page, and more likely not at all. Dakota is a pretty popular name, though more so for people who are just barely old enough to edit Wikipedia, and I wouldn't expect someone newly registering to check that their name doesn't clash with an admin's first, and "Dakota d" is somewhat far off to look like a deliberate attempt to confuse or impersonate.

<p>I've been trying everything I can to keep from getting in an edit war with <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfinity0_7a16.html" title="User:Infinity0">User:infinity0</a> on <a href="../../../a/n/_/An_Anarchist_FAQ_95c9.html" title="An Anarchist FAQ">An Anarchist FAQ</a>. To keep from getting into an edit war with him I put POV tag on the top of the article and have been engaging in voluminous discussion on the [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:An_Anarchist_FAQ" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:An_Anarchist_FAQ" rel="nofollow">Discussion page</a>] there. He keeps taking the tag off knowing full well that the dispute is very much alive (he knows because he's engaging in the dispute on the Discussion page). Whenever I put it back on, he takes it off: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=An_Anarchist_FAQ&amp;diff=46053297&amp;oldid=46016602" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=An_Anarchist_FAQ&amp;diff=46053297&amp;oldid=46016602" rel="nofollow">[29]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=An_Anarchist_FAQ&amp;diff=46053985&amp;oldid=46053674" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=An_Anarchist_FAQ&amp;diff=46053985&amp;oldid=46053674" rel="nofollow">[30]</a> Then, when I note on the Discussion page that he's taking off the POV tag he keep reverting my mention of the fact that he's taking the tag off: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAn_Anarchist_FAQ&amp;diff=46065543&amp;oldid=46065353" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAn_Anarchist_FAQ&amp;diff=46065543&amp;oldid=46065353" rel="nofollow">[31]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAn_Anarchist_FAQ&amp;diff=46066163&amp;oldid=46066031" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAn_Anarchist_FAQ&amp;diff=46066163&amp;oldid=46066031" rel="nofollow">[32]</a> --which amounts to vandalizing the Discussion page. It's just crazy. What he's doing is all very disruptive to the process at trying to arrive at a consensus. The article has a real POV problem and I am not the only one who thinks this. I don't know what to do in this situation other than to ask if someone can please put a block on him for awhile. Maybe that will force him to refrain from these antics. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 02:29, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If no one is willing to take any action over this, then what am I supposed to do? Is there a policy against repeatedly deleting someone else's messages on Discussion pages? (by the way, he deleted a message of mine from another article's Talk page today as well: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAnarchism&amp;diff=46038676&amp;oldid=46036521" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAnarchism&amp;diff=46038676&amp;oldid=46036521" rel="nofollow">[33]</a> )Is there a policy against repeatedly removing an NPOV tag from an article when the NPOV dispute is still going on and a consensus as not been reached?

<dd>The only way I can do that is to sit back and let him make the article POV and keep important information out of it. It doesn't matter if I go to other articles --he often follows me to them --puts things I create up for deletion votes just because I'm the one that created them, goes into an article that I edited that he's never visited before right after I make an edit and immediately deletes them, etc. Believe me, I'd like to stay away from him. But, I don't think I should be the one to allow him to get his way when he's the one that's obviously being disruptive. I'm just supposed to allow him to delete my messages on Discussion pages?

<p>RJII's version has one paragraph (half the section) on the issue: <i>"They say that they "social anarchists reject the individualists conception of anarchy, simply because it can, unfortunately, allow hierarchy (i.e. government) back into a free society in the name of "liberty" and "free contracts....However, while social anarchists disagree with the proposals of individualist anarchists, we do still consider them to be a form of anarchism -- one with many flaws one with many flaws and one perhaps more suited to an earlier age when capitalism was less developed and its impact upon society far less than it is now." <a href="http://www.infoshop.org/faq/secG4.html" class="external text" title="http://www.infoshop.org/faq/secG4.html" rel="nofollow">Why Social Anarchists Reject Individualist Anarchism</a>"</i> - note that this page is about 1/100 of the whole FAQ.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that he understands how fair use works on Wikipedia; it has been explained to him many times over. Regardless, in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:R.D.H._%28Ghost_In_The_Machine%29&amp;diff=41877230&amp;oldid=41876286" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:R.D.H._%28Ghost_In_The_Machine%29&amp;diff=41877230&amp;oldid=41876286" rel="nofollow">this edit</a>, he explicitly calls for the "challenge and defiance" of copyright law. Though copyright law may be unpopular and too restrictive at times, Wikipedia is certainly not the place to start his revolution.</p>
<p>After the user was given time to remove fair use images from his user page, but failed to do so, a number of editors have manually removed the offending images from his page. User page and fair use policy states that users are free to remove fair use images from others' user pages – especially after the user has been warned:</p>

<li>To be honest do you not think in disallowing the man to display his favourite album cover on his own user page is just being a teeny weeny bit over zealous. Is it actually harming anyone, is the copyright holder likely to say "Oi! Stop that now" or "Thank you good Wikipedians for stopping one of our fans displaying our album cover". No in short they don't give a stuff about that sort of thing. It's not as though he is claiming he designed it himself, is a member of whatever group it is, he's just one of millions of fans - nothing more - nothing sinister - and more importantly he is not deriving financial gain from the cover. There must be so many more important things you could devote your worthy time too, now why don't you just give him back his album cover and find something more useful to do with your time. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_dc9f.html" title="User:Giano">Giano</a> | <a href="../../../g/i/a/User_talk%7EGiano_a5ff.html" title="User talk:Giano">talk</a> 16:27, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, this isn't a negotiable policy. And it isn't about how we interprete the law. Ultimately, this is foundation policy and it is absolute. Now, we need to allow latitude for those who don't get it, and make mistakes, but not for a deliberate breachs. He is in violation of the conditions under which we may use this site, and if he will not comply, he cannot continue to use the site. We cannot all turn into lawyers and reach 'consensus' as to where this policy matters and where it does not. That way lies madness. And will those who say 'it doesn't matter' underwrite wikipedia legally if a liberal attitude to copyright gets the foundation into trouble? No. Anyway, there is also a moral argument. Copyright owners cannot go around this massive website checking where their rights may have been infringed. Their rights will often be infringed. The onus is on us to make sure we eliminate every violation we can. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><small><sup>ask?</sup></small></a> 16:51, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Are you quite sure though though that he is in in fact breach of copyright law? If he is - then under the licence template Albumcover were he to accompany the image with a few words describing the album then he would be 100% legal even in your eyes. Would it not be better to try and help him find a solution rather than keep issuing him with repeated "tickets" rather like over zealous traffic wardens, because at the moment it seems to me a rather unimportant action is being escalated and inflamed into what is an unnecessarily angry and hostile exchange. Something which wikipedia has quite enough of already. Administrators should remember they are here to assist and advise editors. At the moment he is being ordered around in an inflammatory way, when he should be being shown a way out of the problem.

<li>The problem is that he is in violation of what is apparently Wikimedia Foundation policy. If you would like to restructure Wikimedia policy, it needs to be taken up over there, not here on Wikipedia.

<li>Rebelguys and M.Kingston are <b>not admins</b>. And if I have anything to say about it they never will be. The only admin actions taken here, apart from Ashibaka's protection of my userpage, was undertaken by Reb's friend/roomie/frat brother Scm83x. Among whose first acts as a newly appointed admin was to remove most all the images from my userpage and not just the copyrighted ones. All because he thought I was being a bit "rude" to him earlier. I argued that at least my images were being used in a way that was related to the 'Pedia itself, for "community building" purposes and to illustrate subjects brought up on said page. Unlike PERSONAL images, which have nothing to do with either building the 'Pedia or the community and are perhaps better suited for a blog and/or personal photo album. I would not grudge them their pics at all, except they grudge me mine. First certain userboxes are verboden, now certain images. It is only a matter of time before personal pics are taken away too. This is clearly a case of petty vindictiveness, justified under the aegis of policy.

<li>It was not an "admin action" to remove images from your user page; our user page and fair use guidelines allow any user to do so freely if there is a fair use violation. In addition, only copyrighted images were removed from your user pages, of which there were four. No other images have been touched; I'm not sure why you believed others were. Please don't falsely accuse other users of ulterior motives and of actions they certainly did not undertake.

<li>I think that everyone should take a breath, relax, and realize what the central issue is here. We should simply recall that our fair use guidelines prohibit the use of fair use images outside the main namespace, save for case-by-case exceptions (i.e., templates for the main page). Any other arguments, such as R.D.H.'s false and bad faith assumptions of "petty vindictiveness," "petty bullshit," "Wikistalking," "harrassment," and collaborations with a "friend/roomie/frat brother," are moot; in addition, our allowance for personal images is in no way related to fair use. Issues such as these stem from Wikimedia Foundation policies, and discussion should be taken to channels there. It is unlikely that you will get anywhere hurling false accusations. — <b><a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebelguys2_63db.html" title="User:Rebelguys2">Rebelguys2</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../r/e/b/User_talk%7ERebelguys2_747e.html" title="User talk:Rebelguys2"><font color="#CC5500">talk</font></a></sup> 10:42, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Rightly or wrongly you have pushed him into a corner back against the wall. So you now have the problem how are you going to help him out. For how much longer is he to be prevented from editing his own user page? I cannot understand why this has been allowed to escalate into such a huge issue which seems to be going nowhere. I am wondering where the more senior and respected admins are while this has been going on. (Another reason for training inexperienced admins!) Were this particular copyright issue to be taken to a legal court the chances are RDS would be allowed to continue his limited use of the image. However, in the absence of a court case, you have to decide how zealously you wish to interpret and administer policy, bearing in mind, who has he hurt?- What harm is it realistically likely to cause? and finally, has anyone actually complained or made official protest over Ghost's actions and use of the image? Bearing those questions and their answers in mind one can then assess the gravity of this case and where you wish to take it.........Without doubt, as I know to my own experience, and you must know surely too, he can be a very belligerent, pig headed and irritating person, but would Wikipedia be a better place without him? I don't think so - He is not one of those non-page-writing editors who flit about the site distributing wise opinions and advice to those that seldom want it, he actually writes pages on encyclopedic subjects, and for that deserves our respect and some consideration given to his views. You appear to have him now back against the wall into a corner, and for some reason seem surprised he is barking and shouting. Calm down and help the poor man out of the mess you have all got yourselves into, exercise a little tact and diplomacy when dealing with difficult customers - and it will be a better place for all. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_dc9f.html" title="User:Giano">Giano</a> | <a href="../../../g/i/a/User_talk%7EGiano_a5ff.html" title="User talk:Giano">talk</a> 12:39, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>A number of us had been courteously explaining policy to R.D.H. for the course of two months to which he made no response. We're not "interpreting policy" – it is one of the few fair use Wikimedia Foundation policies that are explicitly stated and unlikely to be misconstrued. It has come up many, many times, and never have I seen such a response. Never have I said that he isn't a worthwhile contributor; never have I said that he should be banned. I don't understand why you brought the issue of his departure up. We have only repeated to him: whether right or wrong, the issue is that this is one of the most clear-cut fair use policies we have on Wikipedia – here's why – here's what you need to do. I have also told him that, in all honestly, he should just drop the issue, as people were coming in every week or two to ask him to remove the images. We have never retracted our offers for assistance, our guidance through the bureaucratic web of Foundation copyright guidelines, or anything else he needs. If that isn't tact and diplomacy, I don't know what else you could want. We can and still offer help, but it is up to R.D.H. to accept it. — <b><a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebelguys2_63db.html" title="User:Rebelguys2">Rebelguys2</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../r/e/b/User_talk%7ERebelguys2_747e.html" title="User talk:Rebelguys2"><font color="#CC5500">talk</font></a></sup> 16:34, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I bring up the subject of his hypothetical departure because if you bothered to visit his talk page you would see the way he is thinking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:R.D.H._%28Ghost_In_The_Machine%29#WP:AN.2FI" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:R.D.H._%28Ghost_In_The_Machine%29#WP:AN.2FI" rel="nofollow">[40]</a>. There is a whole world outside of "Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents" and perhaps some people would do well to explore it. It does seem very sad that one can't have the image of one's favourite album on one's own page (with a few words about it), and yet can write on a main page about it and use the image, I wonder what, or whose logic, that is? Life is complicated poor old RDS no wonder he's upset, I'm totally perplexed by it all. You see if one was writing about oneself as one should on that page, and that particular album had had a huge bearing on one's life, then, by your logic, were one notable the image would be legit wouldn't it, because that user page could then be a legitimate main page, so it all boils down to interpretation of notability. I wonder if RDS is in anyway notable?

<li>You misunderstand. I certainly do "bother to visit his talk page;" various editors have been dropped in and out for <i>two months</i> regarding this issue. Do you really think I don't understand his position, or that I have such a severe case of tunnel vision that I don't bother looking elsewhere? I'm not as ignorant of what's going on as you think. I've read through his talk page, my talk page, the messages you left on ALoan's talk page, and the rest. <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">Be civil, please</a>. I certainly understand his position. However, it's not my logic; I'm going by the logic of the Wikimedia Foundation.

<li>Frankly, the whole thing seems pretty stupid all around, but given that the Foundation has chosen to have a very strict policy about fair use images, and that policy includes a ban on fair use images on user pages, the matter, while stupid, seems pretty clear-cut. If you keep restoring them to your (or anyone else's) user page, expect zealous enforcecement of the (possibly misguided, but entirely clear) policy. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 20:59, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

I'm not sure why his talk page has been plastered with all kinds of hands and crosses and HUGE BOLD MESSAGES because it's unlikely to help. The AfD will be over in a day or so.

<dd>This aside, Portals are mostly built to guide the reader about the subject and directs them to the WikiProjects, which are the ones that deal with the editing of the articles and all of that stuff.

<dd>I take issue with the linking of the portal from the main namespace. The portal is built like a topic-specific version of the main page, but has been static for over a month.

<p>Hey, if I cared about the maintenance of a specific article of mine I'd wipe the portal boxes from it too.

<dd>On Template:User antiatheism, TfD doesn't make determinations on whether a template is a T1 candidate. Moreover the reference you gave appears to be for a block deletion of religious userboxes in mid-February, some six weeks ago now. TfD decisions are not "always and for all time."

<dd>Kelly Martin said "but just because of gang of ill-informed individuals on DRV and TFD have decided to keep it doesn't mean that it should be kept." This is a blatant personal attack and shows a complete disrespect towards the judgment of the community. Judging from this and numerous othe previous evidences, Kelly Martin seems to think that it is only her opinion that counts and all who disagree with her are stupid, ill-informed or incompetent (this also includes other administarators). She believes templates should be deleted just because she personally dislikes them even when the community consensus is overwhelmingly against her. This is delibarately disruptive behavious. An administrator is there to carry out the wishes of the community, not the other way around. <a href="../../../l/o/o/User%7ELoom91_0629.html" title="User:Loom91">Loom91</a> 08:06, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Regardless of the issue of "disruption", is there any reason to continue using that word in edit summaries when you know it causes offence to some? It's not as if you have to choose between offending some people by using it and offending others by not using it. There's no difficult choice to make here. And while it may be difficult to hold back a word that slips out in speech before you've had time to think, that's not the case when you're typing edit summaries. If it's possible to avoid something that offends others and that <i>is not in any way necessary</i>, why even have a discussion about it? <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 09:23, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't want to be too hard on SPUI here. It seems that type of language is often used in edit summaries, however it isn't good. Words placed on a page can be retracted if they later are found to offend, edit summaries can't. I'd happy see a tightening of what is acceptable in an edit summary - such should be CIVIL, informative descriptions of what you are doing, and not attacks, comments, dialogues or rants. Keep discussion to talk pages. And before anyone trawls through my edit summaries, I'm not taking the moral highground here, I'm just saying...--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><small><sup>ask?</sup></small></a> 09:31, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To answer the question in the header, using "what the fuck" in an edit summary, by and in itself, is not disruption. It may express legitimate exasperation at the preceding edit. People have varying standards of what they consider profanity. But yes, do try to be nice, also in your edit summaries. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 10:15, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not commenting on the issue here, but I've changed the section header to omit the phrase being discussed; by having it in the section header, it is included in the edit summary by default everytime someone commments here.

<p>Preemptive blocking for a repeated threat is just fine IMO, as one of those who gets to decide. Those after some wacky amusement may want to check:</p>

Once again, I request information as to whom this should be directly reported, or what the WIki policy is on its admins threatening those who had never even logged onto Wiki before the ADMIN threatened any action. If these are the sort of intimidation tactics that are used by Wiki admins, I think more schools and news services need to know about it.</p>

<dd>Gator1, I think an indef block is <b>way</b> too harsh. He's been blocked once for 24 hours for 3RR, and it's true that he started inserting the same type of thing again into the article, but the next step should've been to block him for longer, not to unilaterally decide that he's of no good to the project.

<dl>
<dd>Actually, I posted at your talk page first, then checked my watchlist and noticed that there was a related thread here. I'll repost my response on your talk page: The block log shows blocks for <b>one</b> incident; they appear to be several because both I and R. Koot blocked him for the same 3RR, then R. Koot rescinded and reapplied his blocks when he changed his mind about the time period for which the block should occur. This is all over the <b>same</b> incident. An indef block is way too harsh, and while I appreciate your willingness to have your decision reversed, that you don't see how this was a hasty action worries me a little. · <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0"><b>Katefan0</b></a><sup><a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKatefan0_4566.html" title="User talk:Katefan0">(scribble)</a></sup>/<small><a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_Poll_b43b.html" title="User:Katefan0/Poll">poll</a></small> 14:18, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, none taken on my end. Nothing personal at all. But indef blocking is not something to be done lightly, when an administrator does it in place of the arbcom it's justified under the "blocked by the community" portion of blocking policy, which means the action needs to be presented to the community for their comment, which I've given. Look, there are times when folks need to be indef blocked without going through arbcom because they're just that obvious, I fully support that as a practice and have done it myself. Maybe this one will end up being that way, too. I just thought an indef block at this stage was too fast; he's obviously knowledgeable about the subject and I feel should have at least one more chance to contribute positively.

Unblock requests via the IP talk page (by the IP, obviously) should be ignored, as the only activity coming off the IP in the last several hours has been the creation of attack/imposter usernames. <font color="#696969"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> <sup><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><i>Talk</i></a> • <i>Contact</i></sup></font> 04:23, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
