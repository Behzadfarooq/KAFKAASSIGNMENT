<p>I invite all administrators to view my closing of the most recent DRV on this now notorious template. After three times through DRV, I have tried to settle this matter, although I am by no means authorative. It simply seems to me that <i>earnestly religious</i> userboxes are the <b>last</b> group of templates that need to be drawn into the userbox conflict. I hope, too, to see the template space clear and purely encyclopedic one day, but there is no consensus on that matter yet. Until there is, this species of template -- the type most likely to tug at the hearts, and invoke the fiercest loyalties, of the greatest number of users -- should be left in peace. As I suggested in closing the DRV, I suggest here: speedy deleters of these templates should be considered disruptive. The userbox conflict will only become more poisonous if religion long remains one of its foci. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 16:17, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Now, I actually have no problem hosting that userbox in my userspace (hell, if it will stop the userbox conflict, I'll host them ALL), but I will point out it might have been nice to have asked me before putting something in my userspace. I can see why some people might think you're a bit intemperate and injudicious, Cyde. Do be careful to be polite. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 17:24, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Leaving no redirect at the old template pages with slightly over 70 red links in whatlinkshere is hardy "done." Once again, "problems" were created by an admin's actions. That "solution" wasn't <i>all</i> German by a long shot, just enough to serve a specific agenda. If <i>admins</i> would agree to a <i>respectful</i> migration process, it probably could go a bit smoother. If Cyde and Xoloz support it, I'll volunteer to put in a redirect, bypass it with AWB, and then replace the redirect with <span style="font-family:monospace;">{{<a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUser_GUS_UBX_to_b556.html" title="Template:User GUS UBX to">User GUS UBX to</a>}}</span>.

<dd>The one bit I added to Cyde's compromise was to soft redirect the template to my userspace. After consideration, I'm thrilled with the German Solution, so anyone may move <b>any</b> userbox he/she wishes to my userspace, conveniently created by Cyde, without having to ask. Yes -- any template: Star Trek haters, Republicans, even worse (only worse in the sense of being "less like Xoloz"), I don't care.

<dd>I would have preferred to see a hard redirect followed by some cleanup work to change all references. But I'm not going to quibble.

<dd>As you might imagine, I have no problem with a hard redirect either; however, there are those who vigorously oppose all new cross-namespace redirects.

<dd>I signed my name very clearly, there was no attempt to mislead anyone. The blocking admin could at least notify me on the block and comunicate with me on my talk page. He did not. There were several other violations of the blocking policy that had to do with that block and comunication (on my talk page) was the first step required by the blocking admin did not bother so I had to go to his talk page. <a href="../../../z/e/q/User%7EZeq_aaa9.html" title="User:Zeq">Zeq</a> 03:55, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>PS Anyone who is bothering to get up in arms about this one (I only left a meesage on the blocking admin talk page, it is not that I have tried to edit any specific articvle to circumvent the block) seem to be putting by far more emphais on "rules" than on common sense. Just one more part in vandeta against me. I suggest this complaint will be removed. I have done nothing wrong and caused no harm. <a href="../../../z/e/q/User%7EZeq_aaa9.html" title="User:Zeq">Zeq</a> 03:57, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Zeq <b>you are not supposed to edit when you are blocked except on your own talk page</b> it doesn't matter if you signed your name. Homey 05:15, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I tried using my talk page but the blocking admin did not respond.</p>
<p>Homey, Why don't you start by obeying the rules yourself&#160;? No harm was done by my actions above and you know it. All I did was comunicating (attempting to communicate) with a blocking admin who violated the blocking policy. Your complain here is a form of harrasment) . Read the blocking policy it is VERY clear - the blocking admin should have used my talk page but he did not.</p>
<p>You yourselfalso broken the same rules before (at least twice). As an admin you are supposed to know the rules and apply them. this was comunicated to you clearly here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Homeontherange&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=57078266" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Homeontherange&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=57078266" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Homeontherange&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=57078266</a> . Also let's not ignore tha fact that you yourself have edited (blocked people) while under a block and that you frequently edit under anon IP address (violation). Other abuses by you are investigated. <a href="../../../z/e/q/User%7EZeq_aaa9.html" title="User:Zeq">Zeq</a> 05:20, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>That is simply false and checkuser has proven that allegation false. Also, <a href="../../../s/c/e/User%7ESceptre_44d8.html" title="User:Sceptre">User:Sceptre</a> did not violate blocking policy, the block against you for vote-stacking was entirely justified. You just can't accept that any disciplinary action against you is ever warranted, instead you try to blame everyone else for your misdeeds. It's tiresome. Homey 05:26, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>What you say is false, here are quotes from <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBlock_3ef4.html" title="WP:Block">WP:Block</a>:</p>
<p>"Users should be notified of blocks on their talk pages."</p>

<dd>I do not see how Xed and Anittas's actions on the latter's talk page in any way constitute abuse and trolling. They simply discussed the fact that Wales's indefinite block of Anittas was unjust and discussed possible ways of rectifying this error in judgement on Jim's part. Are users not allowed to challange or at least discuss the decisions of administrators on their own talk pages? Anittas might have gone a bit too far at the end, but you can surely understand his anger and frustration and his impulsive block, but Xed truly did not engage in any form of abuse or trolling, he simply criticized some of Wales's actions and then criticized Sidaway's action of blocking the talk page which even to me appeared ridiculous in the extreme. <a href="../../../t/s/o/User%7ETSO1D_9399.html" title="User:TSO1D">Vox Populi (TSO)</a> 17:31, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Had he written that statement in bad faith solely in an attempt to blacken Wales's name, it would have been one thing. However, I am certain that he truly believes that the ban was inappropriate (particuarly in the case of Anittas where he posted the same statement) and that those users were banned not as much for their participation in other sections of Wikipedia, but rather for criticizing Wales, and he wrote a brief and concise message to that effect where the topic was being discussed. <a href="../../../t/s/o/User%7ETSO1D_9399.html" title="User:TSO1D">Vox Populi (TSO)</a> 17:43, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have very mixed feelings about this situation. I am quite unhappy that the page <a href="../../../a/n/i/User_talk%7EAnittas_d652.html" title="User talk:Anittas">User talk:Anittas</a> has been protected. I don't think that the remarks that Xed (with whom, to put it mildly, I have had my conflicts) and Anittas made there constitute trolling, but even if they did, trolling usually calls for "do not feed". Period. Anittas is a controversial contributor (and by "controversial" I mean much could be, and has been, said both for and against him). It seems to me to be odd to block precisely the page where those things might appropriately be said. Is there a different forum where discussion can take place, and where that discussion will not be perforce confined to administrators? - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 23:21, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK, Tony, it is clear where you stand, but none of this even begins to explain why you protected <a href="../../../a/n/i/User_talk%7EAnittas_d652.html" title="User talk:Anittas">User talk:Anittas</a>. In particular, if I understand correctly the way that blocks work, that is <i>the one page</i> that Anittas as a blocked user may legitimately access, and where he could state his case against being blocked. It is also the page where I would expect to have discussion of the block. At least two other Admins besides myself have, on that page, expressed doubts — and I think "doubts", not "opposition" is the right word — about the whether the block was appropriate. And for my simply raising questions and concerns about process, <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> has basically challenged me to go "lecture" Jimbo. I have no intention of "lecturing" Jimbo or anyone else. If it has come to the point where as an Admin and a major contributor (and, I believe, a good one; if someone thinks otherwise, I would welcome an RFC rather than cheap shots on talk pages) I am not welcome to ask questions, then it seems to me we've got a problem a lot bigger than whether this particular user should be banned. Again: I think the situation merits discussion. I don't think that discussion should be confined to Administrators. I would like to unprotect <a href="../../../a/n/i/User_talk%7EAnittas_d652.html" title="User talk:Anittas">User talk:Anittas</a>. (<b>Note:</b> to unprotect the talk page, not to unblock the user.)

Such discussions often confuse developers who find it harder to recognise what the users desire, than to <i>actually</i> do it.

<dd>The chance that a wikipedia reader searching for "Apartheid" is actually looking for "Sexual Apartheid" (for example) is infinitessimal. The link, therefore, is a waste of space from the readers' point of view. It exists only to steer them towards wilfully biased articles about unrelated subjects created in the service not of scholarship, but of political activism. Several of the articles on the disambiguation page appear to have been created only to justify the disambiguation page itself, and to provide cover for the central purpose of making the political statement, "Israel is a lot like Apartheid-era South Africa" - a cynical abuse of this encyclopedia. The removal of the link plainly improves this article, and Wikipedia.Timothy Usher 20:46, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The chance they are looking for "apartheid state" which has been used to refer to Israeli apartheid is reasonable as is the chance that someone is looking for apartheid applied to something to do with gays and lesbians without being clear on the term or some sort of apartheid dealing with the third world (global apartheid) without knowing the proper term. Homey 20:53, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The term "apartheid" refers solely to the practice of racial segregation in South Africa; even if the term was hijacked by left-wing activists for the purposes of vilifying Israel and the West. Disambiguation pages are not search aids; this disambiguation link is plain advertisement of articles started by Homey, articles that are nothing but political diatribes.

<p>I suggest you that you look at this from the perspective of rarely under stood wikipedia policy <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPoint_d154.html" title="WP:Point">WP:Point</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Homey's point, a political one (which is a violation of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7Enot_aa34.html" title="WP:not">WP:not</a>) is to use wikipedia to spread the notion that "Israel is an apartheid state".</li>
<li>Homey's has pushed this idea by creating an elaborate set of articles about apartheid (5 of them to be exact), at which point it seemed only natural to require a DAB page. (no doubt, Homey, an experienced admin, <u>knows how to game the system.</u>)</li>
<li>Once the DAB page created homey has placed a link to this page in the article about history of South Africa and now each person that comes to wikipedia to look for "apartheid" may click the DAB page leading him/her to an article about the so-called "Israeli apartheid" and... presto the propagation of political message have been suucessful: <b>Distributing political propaganda via wikipedia works&#160;!</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Since this whole effort is a clear violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPoint_d154.html" title="WP:Point">WP:Point</a> I suggest you do not join this blunt policy violation.</li>
</ul>
<p>BTW, the diff I placed above clearly show that Homey (the one edited the 4th diff) participated in an edit war to push his agenda - After Bert "exhausted" what he think of as "3 reverts per day" Homey jumps in the continue the edit-war. (This is also a violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPoint_d154.html" title="WP:Point">WP:Point</a>: See <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPoint_d154.html#Gaming_the_system" title="WP:Point">WP:Point#Gaming_the_system</a></p>
<p>I hope that in light of this being part of a bigger picture you would think of a better solution than to accept and support this policy violation. <a href="../../../z/e/q/User%7EZeq_aaa9.html" title="User:Zeq">Zeq</a> 21:31, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Zeq, I hope you do not misunderstand my involvment in this matter. It is not to support or disagree with either side of a conflict, but is simply to keep disambiguation pages running as they are supposed to. I do not hope to determine whether the existance of <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Apartheid (disambiguation)">apartheid (disambiguation)</a> is appropriate, but since it currently does exist (no concensus having been come to at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Apartheid_%28disambiguation%29_c32b.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Apartheid (disambiguation)">it's AfD</a>), it needs to be linked to from the primary topic.

<dd>There's a very important <b>may</b> in that wording. You seem to misunderstand the whole point of the npa warning: it's not a black mark to give out to naughty people; it's a device to make people aware of the policy as efficiently as possible.

<dd>Henry is, to be sure, correct; for new users, the templates do sometimes serve as more than edifying devices, as they allow other editors to see that a user has been apprised of our policies and guidelines, in order that, should he/she continue to flout those guidelines, further warning or blocking may occur. Here, the warning serves, at best, to inform EB that you took his comments to be personal attacks; once he has read the warning and apprehended your meaning, he may remove it. I think it's a bit untoward to remove warnings--or any commentary, really--from one's talk page, believing that one ought to reply to, rather than excise, comments with which he/she disagrees, but neither would I try to compel others to act similarly nor would I support a blanket proscription on removing warnings (which does not now exist). Finally, even as EB's comments were indecorous (although <i>Chuckwagon</i> seems a jocular, if unduly informal and perhaps patronizing, appellative, and certainly not a personal attack), I don't think they rise of the level of blockable <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a>; in this instance, you would be better served to leave an actual note on his talk page, to the effect that his edits bothered you and that you perceived them as personal attacks, the cessation of which you would, as you continue to collaborate with him and others, appreciate. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 21:22, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Having been one of the targets of <a href="../../../c/h/c/User%7EChcknwnm_ed3c.html" title="User:Chcknwnm">User:Chcknwnm</a>'s recent NPA tagging spree, I also think he's grossly misusing the template as a warning for those he thinks are being uncivil. Please try using your own works to discuss the concerns you have instead of lobbing templates.

<dd>I know this is long over (relatively), but I wanted to clarify that my spree consisted of adding the template to two people's talk, Shell and EB. I realize I should have said the comments were uncivil rather than PA's. I had made a mistake. However, removing warnings should still be discouraged/disallowed until they are discussed. <a href="../../../c/h/c/User%7EChcknwnm_ed3c.html" title="User:Chcknwnm"><b>Ch</b></a><a href="../../../c/h/c/User%7EChcknwnm_Esperanza_5bfc.html" title="User:Chcknwnm/Esperanza"><font color="green">u</font></a><a href="../../../c/h/c/User_talk%7EChcknwnm_2217.html" title="User talk:Chcknwnm"><b>ck</b></a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Chcknwnm_387f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Chcknwnm">(척뉴넘)</a></sup> 07:31, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have removed two instances of solicitation of funds for political purposes, through linking to an external donation web page, from each of Chooserr's user page and talk page. Chooserr had been editing but his response to requests by other editors that he remove the links was negative and defiant. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 14:39, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Everybody knows? Chooserr's had that link on his page for about six months, and nobody's ever said a word to him about it. How does he know that the "wide latitude" we allow in user space doesn't include what we've been allowing him for six months? It's not like an admin's never looked at his page. You think I'm being too charitable; I think you're being way too brash and disrespectful. Tony, you talk to people like they're misbehaving dogs and you're their master; it's disgusting.

<p>I think it would be nice if occasionally an administrator wasn't pilloried for removing blatantly unsuitable material from the site and warning the editor in question. Your own part in this was unfortunate; you restored the solicitation link after another editor had correctly removed it after the warning. Don't make it worse by blaming others. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 19:51, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have no problem with you removing blatantly unsuitable material. I have a serious problem with your apparent inability to maintain courtesy. You contribute a lot to the Wiki, and we all appreciate that, but you are not above <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>. If it's not readily apparent to you that you could have handled this situation much better, then I question your good sense.</dd>
<dd>As for my action, I explained it sufficiently at the time. Removing a link that had been sitting there for six months is <i>not</i> so urgent that it overrides our basic need to treat each other well. An administrator had left a warning, asking Chooserr to remove the material himself, and then acted on it <i>before Chooserr had even logged on again</i>, as least as indicated by his Contributions page. Then another editor vandalized the page by inserting different linkspam. Having a choice of which version to revert to, I chose the version where Chooserr still had a chance to remove the offending link himself, because what's the point in giving someone a chance to fix something for himself, if you're going to just do it before he actually gets that chance? I err on the side of respect, because it pays to maintain an atmosphere in which people treat each other excellently.</dd>
<dd>Again, to be very clear, you have mischaracterized my statements. I am not criticizing you for removing the link. I am criticizing you for talking down to other human beings. It's unnecessary, rude, counterproductive, and against policy.</dd>
<dd>Oh, another thing: I'm not "blaming" you for anything. I'm just saying be more respectful. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 20:00, 3 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Just a minor correction, GTBacchus. Timothy Usher did leave a request (I wouldn't call it a warning), but you're incorrect in stating that an administrator did. Timothy is not an admin. Jumping in to remove it before Chooserr had logged on was, of course, unfortunate, as it made it more difficult for Chooserr to do so without losing face. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 11:58, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For those of you just joining us, <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a> (<a href="../../../a/l/i/User_talk%7EAlienus_286a.html" title="User talk:Alienus">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Alienus_1d05.html" title="Special:Contributions/Alienus">contribs</a>) has been embroiled in a long struggle with this user; see his talk page. <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsopropyl_2165.html" title="User:Isopropyl">Isopropyl</a> 21:32, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If I've failed to maintain courtesy, GTBacchus, then you're right to reprove me. I agree that Alienus was very, very naughty and he's been given warnings by Nandesuka and (when he told me about that warning) me. There may be some minor details of timing here but I won't go into those, just observe that at the time I removed the links he'd been told about the problem and was being pretty stroppy about it. It really doesn't take an immense amount of thought to realise that what Chooserr was doing is absolutely prohibited, <i>anywhere on Wikipedia</i>, even on Chooserr's talk page and user page.</p>
<p>Chooserr has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Chooserr" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Chooserr" rel="nofollow">a pretty massive block log</a> and does seem to have a history of biased editing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Chooserr" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Chooserr" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>. Had he come here to produce unbiased edits but had only popped a fundraising link onto his user page by accident, then of course a lighter approach would have been appropriate. But Chooserr isn't about that at all. He uses his user page to advertise his pet causes, though he does so in a reasonably Wikipedian way:</p>

<p>Now Chooserr has been up to this for six months. Hooray! Let's allow him to continue to engage in political fundraising for another three weeks or so. Or should we just remove the bloody horrible thing and tell him not to abuse Wikipedia again? --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 00:21, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>First I was "pillorying" you for removing inappropriate material, and when that turned out not to be true, I'm suggesting that you put off removing the material for three weeks. Where will you go when that turns out to be false?</dd>
<dd>I'm actually quite familiar with Chooserr's history. I remember him new at Wikipedia, getting blocked left and right, and I watched him learn how to edit here, and how to use the talk page instead of revert warring, and how images have copyrights that we have to worry about, and I have seen him become a valuable member of the editing team on some articles that we both work on. He hasn't been blocked since the last time I blocked him in February, because he's improved, and he's helping build the encylcopedia. The linkspam on his page - you were right, it had to go - but I see a human being there, and I have no problem having a conversation explaining to him about why the links aren't cool. You know, changing the culture one person at a time? Apparently, you don't see a human worthy of respect, all you see is "abuse"; and who has time for a conversation or a civil interaction, when you could be bossy and contemptuous instead? It's efficient, that contempt stuff.</dd>
<dd>So apparently, I'm asking that we screw around for three weeks, and "allow abuse" or something; that's right, Tony. Christ. You really think the small effort of treating someone respectfully is a big waste? That's all I'm talking about. You're right about everything, of course, but you could treat people better, and you should, because it matters. Stop contributing to an atmostphere of combativeness. Play well with others. This is all I'm saying. If you want to blow a bunch of smoke about how I'm harassing you for removing unsuitable content, or what a "bad user" Chooserr is anyway, and how he was being "stroppy" (what a load of horseshit), I don't buy it, and I don't give a fuck either. None of that is an excuse for you to be a dick. Stop poisoning the well, because I care about this project a lot, and I don't like you marring it with your antisocial attitude. If I see you shitting on people, I will call you out on it.</dd>

<p>Chooserr had those links for months. I haven't checked the history to see how long exactly. I had noticed them before, and had found them inappropriate for a Wikipedia user page. However, I have seen user pages and user talk pages with pictures of penises (and I don't mean just the one recently reported at <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a>; I have seen user pages which attacked or belittled other users. I saw no reason to barge in and trample on another editor — especially when it involved an editor who might feel ganged up against. This has been discussed before at one of the admin noticeboards. Chooserr has been blocked (or had blocks increased) for doing things that were not against policy, but were disruptive (welcoming too many new users, saving his talk page every minute while blocked, in the hope that someone would see his unblock request on Recent Changes). I am quite sure that I could have stopped some of the problems without resorting to a block — just by asking nicely. Editors who have openly wiki-stalked him, reverting his good-faith edits with "rvv" or "mindless, incoherent troll" were never blocked. For those reasons, I prefer to be extra gentle and extra tactful when dealing with Chooserr. I have found, also, that he responds much better to people making polite requests than to people bullying or threatening him. (Don't we all?)</p>
<p>At 16:35 (UTC) on 1 June, Alienus removed the link from Chooserr's talk page with no prior warning or request. The edit summary said <i>this is offensive enough on a user page; it doesn't belong on a talk page</i>.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chooserr&amp;diff=56342696&amp;oldid=56308791" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chooserr&amp;diff=56342696&amp;oldid=56308791" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> Note that Chooserr did not edit Wikipedia between 31 May and 3 June, so presumably did not see it at the time.</p>
<p>At 20:01 on 1 June, Elliskev reverted, with <i>rvv</i>.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chooserr&amp;diff=56374670&amp;oldid=56342696" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chooserr&amp;diff=56374670&amp;oldid=56342696" rel="nofollow">[13]</a></p>
<p>At 20:05 on 1 June, Elliskev sent Alienus a {{<a href="../../../t/p/v/Template%7ETpv2_6788.html" title="Template:Tpv2">tpv2</a>}} message.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Alienus&amp;diff=56375233&amp;oldid=56333052" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Alienus&amp;diff=56375233&amp;oldid=56333052" rel="nofollow">[14]</a></p>
<p>There was some discussion then at <a href="../../../a/l/i/User_talk%7EAlienus_286a.html#Your_edit_to_User_talk:Chooserr" title="User talk:Alienus">Alienus's talk page</a>, and at <a href="../../../e/l/l/User_talk%7EElliskev_db08.html#AGF" title="User talk:Elliskev">Elliskev's talk page</a>. It later spread to Timothy Usher's talk page. At one stage, Elliskev removed Alienus's message (asking him to AGF) from his talk page. Alienus promptly sent him a {{civil}} message and commented on the rudeness of deleting a message, although he routinely deletes any message he receives from <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> using popups. Elliskev deleted the {{civil}} warning as well, though after discussion with Timothy, he restored these messages.</p>
<p>At 02:31 on 2 June, Timothy posted a message to Chooserr saying that the link was inappropriate, and politely requesting him to remove it.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chooserr&amp;diff=56430305&amp;oldid=56374670" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chooserr&amp;diff=56430305&amp;oldid=56374670" rel="nofollow">[15]</a></p>
<p>At 04:05 on 3 June, Timothy posted to Chooserr: <i>As you've not responded, I've done it.</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chooserr&amp;diff=56613240&amp;oldid=56430305" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chooserr&amp;diff=56613240&amp;oldid=56430305" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> Note that Chooserr had not edited at all since the request was made, and so had presumably not been online.</p>
<p>At 04:06 on 3 June, Timothy removed the link, but kept the words "Make Abortion History".<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chooserr&amp;diff=56613340&amp;oldid=56613240" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chooserr&amp;diff=56613340&amp;oldid=56613240" rel="nofollow">[17]</a></p>
<p>At 05:15 on 3 June, <i><b>Alienus vandalized Chooserr's talk page by linking "Make Abortion History" to the donation page of Planned Parenthood</b></i> — edit summary: <i>a link is fine, so long as it's not to anything partisan</i>.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chooserr&amp;diff=56619794&amp;oldid=56613340" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chooserr&amp;diff=56619794&amp;oldid=56613340" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> The page now looked exactly as it had looked before Timothy removed the link, but the link was to the donation page of a pro-choice website, rather than of a pro-life one.</p>
<p>At 05:23 on 3 June, GTBacchus restored the page to Chooserr's version — certainly not out of approval of the link (Chooserr and GTB disagree on article content), but presumably because he felt annoyed by the vandalism and harassment, and felt that the removal of a link which had already been several months on a page which visitors browsing Wikipedia would be unlikely to see was a less urgent matter than treating another human being with respect.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chooserr&amp;diff=56620532&amp;oldid=56619794" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chooserr&amp;diff=56620532&amp;oldid=56619794" rel="nofollow">[19]</a></p>
<p>At 05:51 GTBacchus pointed out that Chooserr had not even logged on, and that "respectfully waiting for a reply" was "more important than making [the link] be gone now".<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chooserr&amp;diff=56623034&amp;oldid=56620532" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chooserr&amp;diff=56623034&amp;oldid=56620532" rel="nofollow">[20]</a></p>
<p>At 05:53 on 3 June, Timothy posted, "Okay, let's wait until he's logged on."<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chooserr&amp;diff=56623289&amp;oldid=56623034" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chooserr&amp;diff=56623289&amp;oldid=56623034" rel="nofollow">[21]</a></p>
<p>There was also <a href="../../../a/l/i/User_talk%7EAlienus_286a.html#Chooserr.27s_page" title="User talk:Alienus">discussion on Alienus's talk page</a> showing that Alienus was defiant, unrepentant, and flippant.</p>
<p>Most editors who logged on to find all that in the page history would find it a bit galling to remove the link. Once again, I agree it shouldn't have been there, but for Alienus (who is in constant dispute with Chooserr, and who at the time had <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Alienus&amp;oldid=56333052#Welcome" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Alienus&amp;oldid=56333052#Welcome" rel="nofollow">offensive comments about three editors</a> on his own talk page) to barge in and remove it without request or warning, for Timothy to jump the gun by removing it before Chooserr had had a chance to respond, and for Alienus then to vandalize his page by linking to something that promoted the opposing POV must all have have contributed towards making Chooserr feel that he <i>didn't</i> want to remove the link. I saw the history of his talk page just before I went into work on Saturday morning, and decided I'd ask him myself to remove the link: I felt fairly sure he would agree, and it would all blow over. I have found that Chooserr responds well to being treated with ordinary human respect — something which unfortunately does not seem to have been tried by Alienus or Tony in this case.</p>
<p>In fact, at 06:50 on 3 June (his first edit in three days) Chooserr wrote to Timothy, thanking him for his comments, saying that they were obviously well meant, and that he might remove the tags.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Timothy_Usher&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=56628140" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Timothy_Usher&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=56628140" rel="nofollow">[22]</a> I wouldn't call that "negative", "defiant", or "stroppy". Nine minutes later, he posted a fairly mild message to Alienus, asking him not to vandalize his page.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Alienus&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=56628912" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Alienus&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=56628912" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> His next edit, at 07:25 was to his own user page, where he removed two links to external sites requesting donations for the pro-life cause, and kept the remaining one. I would call that a step in the right direction, not being "negative", "defiant", and "stroppy". I would also consider it to be evidence that reasoning with Chooserr would be better than bullying him.</p>
<p>When I got home from work, I discovered that Alienus had added <i>"Well, he's logged on and entirely unrepentant</i>" at 14:05<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chooserr&amp;diff=56661561&amp;oldid=56623289" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chooserr&amp;diff=56661561&amp;oldid=56623289" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> (No sign of any repentence from Alienus for his own trolling, vandalism, and insult.)</p>

That must have been especially galling for Chooserr since Alienus had not been threatened with a block. (He was subsequently threatened by Nandesuka.) Tony may have been unaware of the vandalism, but was able to make (false) statements here about Chooserr having been "negative and defiant".</p>
<p>At 18:28 on 3 June, Tony told Alienus that his edit (linking Chooserr's page to a Planned Parenthood donation page) was "out of order", and asked him "please" not to do stuff like that again.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tony_Sidaway&amp;diff=56694864&amp;oldid=56694059" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tony_Sidaway&amp;diff=56694864&amp;oldid=56694059" rel="nofollow">[25]</a> (No "completely out of line", no threats to block.)</p>
<p>At 19:07 on 3 June, Tony, in response to Chooserr's protest that he would have taken down the link himself if someone had shown him it was against policy, said <i>"You've been told now. Happy?"</i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tony_Sidaway&amp;diff=56700397&amp;oldid=56700257" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tony_Sidaway&amp;diff=56700397&amp;oldid=56700257" rel="nofollow">[26]</a></p>
<p>I have just two questions for Tony and Alienus:</p>
<ol>
<li>Would it have been possible to get that link removed without threats and vandalism?</li>
<li>Assuming that it was possible, would it have been <i>preferable</i> to get it removed without threats and vandalism?</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm quite, quite sure that I, or GTBacchus, or FreplySpang would have been able to get those links removed without trampling on Chooserr, without making him feel that someone who had vandalized his talk page was vindicated (note that Alienus claimed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nandesuka&amp;diff=56691597&amp;oldid=56648703" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nandesuka&amp;diff=56691597&amp;oldid=56648703" rel="nofollow">elsewhere</a> that his action had been redone by another admin), and without resorting to threats of blocks. Tony, you've managed to get that link removed, which is good for the project, so <i>you</i> probably feel that this has been a success, but in my view, the only people who could be happy at the way this was done are people who don't think that real human beings with real feelings matter. GTBacchus has come out of this extremely well. Nobody else has.</p>

<dd>I was unaware of Alienus' vandalism. In fact alienus later told me about Nandesuka's warning (which contained a block threat <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Alienus&amp;diff=56675668&amp;oldid=56675468" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Alienus&amp;diff=56675668&amp;oldid=56675468" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>). I told alienus not to do it again, feeling that a further block threat was superfluous as he'd stopped. Personally I would probably have blocked alienus without a warning had I been aware of the vandalism at the time. He is an experienced editor and should know better.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Alienus' vandalism to a certain extent explains and mitigates Chooserr's uncooperative and defiant attitude. I think it's <i>possible</i>, though it seems incredibly unlikely, that Chooserr didn't realise that what he was doing on his talk page and user page was quite beyond the pale. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 13:30, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I thought you probably were not aware of Alienus's vandalism at the time, and I agree that since he was unlikely to do it again, a further block threat was superfluous. My problem was with the block threat that you issued to Chooserr. If Jimbo came to your talk page to tell you that he'll block you if you vandalize his user page, there would be an implication that he suspected you of intending to, which would be unfair. Your non vandalism could then be seen by others as simply a result of that threat (that you knew you wouldn't get away with it), which would make you lose face, and would be undeserved. In my view, the threat of blocking Chooserr was also undeserved — much more so than a threat to Alienus would have been, as Alienus did something that was definitely malicious and definitely intended to taunt Chooserr, whereas Chooserr was simply linking to something unsuitable which he probably thought he <i>could</i> link to. As GTBacchus says, he had had it there for months, administrators had frequently visited his page, and nobody had said anything. Chooserr edits articles closely related to his own interests, and shows little interest in Project pages concerning policy. He may have heard that we allow a "wide latitude" concerning user pages. In any case, I don't agree that what he was doing was "quite beyond the pale". If it had been, someone would have protested earlier. I do agree it was inappropriate, but feel sure (and GTBacchus and I both have more experience of Chooserr than you do) that it was in good faith. I personally believe that putting images of penises and/or human excrement on one's talk page is "quite beyond the pale". And I think that what Alienus did was "quite beyond the pale".</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>What worries me, Tony, is that while you have acknowledged that Alienus's vandalism was a mitigating factor, you still use language like "Chooserr's uncooperative and defiant attitude", which ties in with your original language of "defiant", "negative", and "being pretty stroppy about it". You haven't offered any diffs to show that he was defiant, negative, or stroppy, and GTBacchus and I have both given diffs to show that his first post after being made aware of the objections was a polite one to Timothy saying "I thank you for your comments. They are obviously well meant, and I might remove the tag(s) . . . I'm not trying to cause trouble", and that he then removed two of the three links he had. He was probably still thinking about the remaining one. Nobody had shown him it was against policy. All he had been treated to was vandalism, taunts, and people taking the matter out of his hands while he was offline and before he was aware of any objections.</dd>

<dd>I recall as long ago as last summer I began to notice that you sometimes voted to support RfAs of people with whom you had been in dispute, and I thought, "that's decent of him; he's obviously fair." It wasn't just once or twice: I noticed it many times. And now I see you most unjustly (in my view) threatening someone with a block and reporting him as "defiant", "negative", "stroppy" and "uncooperative" without <i>any</i> justification whatsoever. Everything I've seen about you suggests that you care deeply about the project — but we're dealing here with a real human being who has feelings.</dd>

<dd>I used to have a Catholic user box on my user page, plus a pro-life one, plus a homemade one that said I was obedient to the Pope, plus another one that said I agreed with <i><a href="../../../h/u/m/Humanae_Vitae_bd70.html" title="Humanae Vitae">Humanae Vitae</a></i>. At that time, many people had user boxes. I was completely unaware that Jimbo didn't want it. When Jimbo made his very courteous request, clarifying how he felt, appealing for our cooperation, etc., I thought about it for a few days, and then took away all my boxes except the homemade "obedient-to-Benedict" one. I felt he'd find that less objectionable because it wasn't in template space, and I had made it myself, so it didn't encourage a "clubbing together" of editors. He never (as far as I know) specified his views on boxes in user space, and I watched to see if he would. Eventually, when redesigning my user page, I removed even the Benedict one. I think it would have been quite inappropriate to describe me as "negative", "defiant", "stroppy", and "uncooperative", and to have threatened me with a block while I was thinking about it. But the end of the story is that the boxes were removed, and nobody bullied me or took away my dignity. Chooserr's story didn't have such a happy ending.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>By the way, Alienus has continued to hassle Chooserr, by removing an extremely mild post from one of Chooserr's friends<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chooserr&amp;diff=56876838&amp;oldid=56876203" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chooserr&amp;diff=56876838&amp;oldid=56876203" rel="nofollow">[28]</a> and by sending him a {{<a href="../../../w/e/l/Template%7EWelcome_2ac1.html" title="Template:Welcome">welcome</a>}} message in its place, because the page looked "empty".<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chooserr&amp;diff=56876911&amp;oldid=56876838" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chooserr&amp;diff=56876911&amp;oldid=56876838" rel="nofollow">[29]</a> He's gaming the system, because he feels he can't get blocked for sending someon a welcome message, but it's pure impertinence, coming from someone in dispute with Chooserr, whose messages Chooserr definitely doesn't welcome, and when Chooserr has been here for over six months. He was then what I <i>would</i> call defiant and uncooperative, when GTBacchus asked him would it not be better to leave Chooserr alone, feigning innocence, pretending not to know what GTB was talking about, saying that he didn't see how the welcome message could be seen as any kind of insult etc. See <a href="../../../a/l/i/User_talk%7EAlienus_286a.html#Don.27t_you_think_it_would_be_better" title="User talk:Alienus">here</a>.</dd>

<dd>Anyway, the main point of all this is that in my view Chooserr was <i>not</i> negative, defiant, uncooperative, or stroppy, and should not have been threatened with a block. When it was brought to his attention, he answered nicely, took away two of the links, and was presumably still thinking about the third, at a time when nobody had shown him any policy that forbade it. It would be nice of you, Tony, if you could leave a message on his talk page telling him that you see that nobody had shown him the policy, that he wasn't refusing to remove the link, and that you shouldn't have threatened him. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 20:40, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think I could have misread Chooserr's attitude. It did seem to me that continuing to have that link up and continuing to edit without doing anything about it spelled deliberate defiance in very unambiguous terms, and what appeared to me as a patronisingly-worded "I'll think about it"-type response was very negative.</p>

<dd>Thanks, Tony. I wholeheartedly agree with your action, but also with Ann's description of your tone, and am really pleased to see this being resolved favorably on both fronts.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And Ann, as for no one looking good but GTBacchus - you've criticized me for removing it before Chooserr came back online, but the link violated policy - why should it have remained just because Chooserr was taking a wikibreak? I also condemned Alienus' gratuitous post-removal vandalism. Both were out of line. Though I don't, as you note, have the power to block for vandalism, I <i>do</i> have the ability to remove links that shouldn't be, and I used it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I personally don't understand the level of hostility towards pro-life here - it seems to me an issue upon which good-faith disagreement is natural and hardly cause for demonization - but maintain that it shouldn't be exacerbated by irrelevant (to wikipedia) statements in userspace. Since then, Chooserr has taken issue with another editors' user-page discussion of his transsexuality (pardon me if I've abused the increasingly arcane rules of jargon), which I personally (key word) find kind of disturbing as well, though as Tony rightly asserts, it's well within current policy. I honestly don't know why we need <i>any</i> of it. Who cares if you're pro-life? Who cares if you're Muslim? Who cares if you're transgendered? It's <i>all</i> off-topic and pointlessly divisive.Timothy Usher 06:02, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Timothy, I disagreed with your removal of the link while Chooserr was still offline, but if it was criticism, it was of the mildest kind. I didn't feel shocked or angry, just "I wish he'd left Chooserr to do it himself." People prefer to be asked to do something without the "and-if-you-don't-I-will" threat. I agreed with GTBacchus's remark that "respectfully waiting for a reply" was "more important than making [the link] be gone now", but I wouldn't push the point. There's room for disagreement there, based on how much we think the link violates policy and how urgent we think its removal is. Remember, it was there for six months, and several administrators (pro-choice ones as well) visited his talk page and didn't protest. You say it violated policy, so why should it remain while he's on wiki-break? Well, I'm convinced that such a solicitation is against what Jimbo Wales intends Wikipedia to be, and that's good enough for me; but I'm not convinced that it violates any <i>explicit</i> policy. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a soapbox</a> deals with what you shouldn't have in an article; it doesn't say what you may or may not have on your user page. POV edits violate policy, but you can't remove them a fourth time in 24 hours: you <i>have</i> to leave them there. I personally think it's more urgent to get rid of something that shouldn't be in an <i>article</i>, because visitors who look up something in Wikipedia are unlikely to navigate to Chooserr's talk page. I think that allowing Chooserr to do the right thing of his own accord would have been preferable to urgently removing the link. It wasn't as if the link was to a site that gave personal information about other editors. And it wasn't as if Chooserr had been gone for a month. Can we agree to disagree on this? My "disapproval" of what you did was so mild that I wouldn't have bothered mentioning it anywhere if the whole business of Chooserr's "negative and defiant" attitude hadn't been brought up here. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 14:14, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. For those of you just joining us, my name is Al, and AnnH has been talking about me here. Whatever her motivation, the net effect has been to shift the focus away from Chooserr's inappropriate advertisement and towards my response. Of course, this is a logical fallacy to begin with, as nothing I do can excuse Chooserr's prior acts.</p>
<p>I'll try to be brief, because this is Chooserr's incident report, not mine. What I'd like to state for the record is that any editor reading this would be unwise to take AnnH's summaries of my actions at face value. With all due respect, her descriptions are misleading in a negative fashion.</p>
<p>Now, I realize that, due to her rather strong Christian POV (which is coincidentally shared by Chooserr), she and I have a history of conflict. Coincidentally, she's acted a few times to encourage others to block me and extend my blocks, and has generally sided against me whenever we've interacted. I guess we disagree on a bunch of stuff. However, I don't believe that this is sufficient basis to excuse her violation of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, much less her apparent willingness to play fast and loose with the facts.</p>
<p>I'll give you one quick example and then walk away. As some of you know, there's a particular trio of editors who I've had much more conflict with than is healthy for anyone. The result has been a trio of blocks, after which I resolved not to repeat my error by continuing to interact with them. As a result, I put a short, polite message at the top of my page explaining why, to avoid confrontation, I would simply remove any comments from them rather than respond and further antagonize them.</p>
<p>If you read it for yourself, you can see that the message expressed some frustration, but was still quite civil <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAlienus&amp;diff=57115356&amp;oldid=56915829" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAlienus&amp;diff=57115356&amp;oldid=56915829" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>. Note that nobody, not even AnnH, ever complained that it was uncivil. More significantly, as that diff shows, the moment one of those three extended the olive branch, I immediately accepted it and removed the message.</p>
<p>That's the reality. In the world according to AnnH, I had "offensive comments about three editors on [my] own talk page". See what I mean? Similar distortions can be found in each and every case where she brings up my name.</p>
<p>With all due respect, I feel hurt by Ann's remarks and wish she hadn't made them. In the end, all I can ask is that you use your own eyes and judgement instead of depending on hers. I'm only peripherally involved in this Chooserr issue and don't wish to be drawn in any further, so I'm going to walk away now, as promised. Please don't be distracted by this silliness; the Chooserr issue still needs to be resolved, and no amount of focus on me will help.

<dd>Alienus, it is perfectly appropriate to bring up your vandalism of Chooserr's talk page in this section, where Chooserr's attitude was being discussed. You say that it's irrelevant because nothing you do can excuse Chooserr's prior acts. I think it has generally been agreed now that Chooserr was unaware that he was in violation of any policy when he put the link there, and your vandalism is <i>very</i> relevant to the discussion of Chooserr's attitude <i>after</i> he was requested to remove the link (an attitude which was Tony has now agreed he may have misjudged). If you don't want your feelings hurt by reference to your vandalism, I suggest you don't vandalize. I don't think there are many Wikipedians who will argue that changing Chooserr's MAKEABORTIONHISTORY link so that it looked the same as before but now linked to the Planned Parenthood donation page instead of to a Catholic Pro-life charity was not vandalism. If an Ulster Protestant puts <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Paisley_879b.html" title="Ian Paisley">Ian Paisley</a> on his user page in a list of admirable people, and I change it so that it links to Pope Benedict XVI while still saying <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Benedict_XVI_f9c4.html" title="Pope Benedict XVI">Ian Paisley</a>, that is vandalism, pure and simple. Nandesuka called it vandalism and threatened a block, Timothy called it vandalism, Tony called it vandalism and said he would probably have blocked you without warning if he had seen it at the time, and GTBacchus reverted it and told you that it was "not cool". I suggest that instead of edit warring at my talk page to put bogus {{civil1}} warnings there because of my post above, you explain why I'm mistaken in calling it vandalism.</dd>
<dd>By the way, I acknowledge that you did remove your reference to the three editors who were (according to you) responsible for your last three blocks when Nandesuka extended the olive branch. However, what I said was that at the time that you removed something from Chooserr's talk page on the grounds that it was offensive, you had something on your talk page that was offensive. You may not think it was offensive, but then Chooserr probably didn't think his link was offensive either. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 14:14, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm on UK time so have just read all this (one of the userboxes I think is useful) and I think it's sad to see so much stereotyping of other editors. One very interesting interaction I had on <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligent_design.html" title="Intelligent design">Intelligent design</a> brought it home to me how without realising it we do interpret other editors messages by guessing their intent. I have also seen <i>persona non grata</i> editors have their very valid suggestions ignored or challenged as other editors have chosen to disregard their edits no matter what. Tim was right that the link did not need to stand - this is a wiki so no one owns space. Ann is right that tact <i>always</i> works best and Al is right that this report is about Chooserr's inappropriate link. Unfortunately conflict does happen but we should be prepared to AGF and not always fall into the trap of viewing the edits of people we share a POV with favourably and those of editors we clash with as "attacks" or "vandalism". <a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESOPHIA_915a.html" title="User:SOPHIA"><font color="purple"><b>Sophia</b></font></a> 09:21, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I want to second Alienus' characterizations of AnnH's tendency to not simply report the facts relevant to the case, but to expand them against antoher editor with a bad faith spin that can be viewed as a distortion. This is not to say that AnnH is not reporting what she genuinely believes to be the case. I always assume good faith, but I note that this occurs only when she is commenting about editors with whom she finds herself on the opposite side of the ideological fence with (what she has called enemies). So, in her view, Alienu's message about his conflict with the three other editors could very well be, in her eyes, "offensive messages left by AI...," but she does not use NPOV language to state this belief of hers, but states it as if Alienus is guilty as a matter of fact of doing these bad things, being in essence uncivil by leaving offense remarks about other editors, etc. This is why Alienus feels attacked here, because he is being attacked. Its also true that this is supposed to be about a specific incident regarding Chooser, but AnnH felt the need to bring up other "evidence" to try to paint a negative picture of Alieus, which is not really related and which distracts from the issue. This is something that is also a common technique that AnnH uses. I've seen it many times. Therefore, I highly recommend that whenever AnnH comments about a user that she has direct POV conflicts with, take her views of the matter with great caution as you will need to shift through what is relevant and what is not, as well as to filter out the significant bias in the editorializing and spin that is sure to come from such a partisan editor.<a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">Giovanni33</a> 17:53, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I expand them "with a bad faith spin", and you "always assume good faith"? Hmmm. How would you describe my "bad faith spin" if you <i>weren't</i> assuming good faith? And is your reference to my bringing up unrelated issues something to do with the fact that I sometimes bring up the way you pretended to have no conncetion to BelindaGong (who was reverting and voting for you) until a checkuser exposed that it was the same IP, and that while you were blocked for puppetry, you were asked if you had any connection to any of the <i>other</i> new users who were reverting to your version, and you denied it — forgetting that you were logged on as one of them!<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AGiovanni33&amp;diff=39658698&amp;oldid=39658454" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AGiovanni33&amp;diff=39658698&amp;oldid=39658454" rel="nofollow">[31]</a></dd>
<dd>Giovanni, I won't bring up these "unrelated issues" except where:
<ol>
<li>We're working on an article, you run out of reverts, and an account that shows that its purpose on Wikipedia is to revert and vote for you (and that has the same linguistic idiosyncrasies and spelling mistakes which I won't alert <i>you</i> to, but which I'll e-mail to any admin who requests it) shows up and supports you; or</li>
<li>I'm dealing with a separate administrative issue, unrelated to you, and you turn up to tell all the other administrators about my history of bringing up unrelated issues. They might just be puzzled and want to know what you're talking about.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>It would be preferable to stick to what's relevant to the case of Chooserr, Giovanni. I don't know why you <i>want</i> to bring up past issues.

<dd>I don't see all that much ... whatever language it is. It seems to be mainly confined to one largeish section. But really, I don't think there is, or needs to be, any particular rule about confining user talk page discussions to English. Lots of our users are able to communicate in more than one language, and plenty of us edit articles on more than one Wikipedia. Judging from some of the remarks left on the page in English, though, it seems the user may not be aware of some of our policies. <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExploding_Boy_5421.html" title="User:Exploding Boy">Exploding Boy</a> 23:43, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is true that in the proper context even the stiffest amongst us can find a word or phrase lascivious. But the real thrust of the matter is that we should be careful to avoid giving good users the shaft simply because their name may be somewhat bushy. Now, it is easy to rectify the situation if a heinous blockage occurs, but hopefully we can allow the flow of good edits to emerge from our editors without the repeated blocking and unblocking beforehand, even if it is somewhat fun; remember that it can also be dangerous.--<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESean_Black_d709.html" title="User:Sean Black">Sean Black</a> 02:33, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Enough arguing. The reason why is posted on my talk page. Any admin can look there and read it for themselves. The question remains: Why did you senselessly transclude the main page onto your userpage. That's what Exploding Boy is asking, and that's what I'd like an answer to as well. Please stick to the question asked. I refer to two policies: <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a> a place to put your own personal homepage and <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">we don't own our contributions to Wikipedia</a>.

<dd>I have to admit, in this case I think the <i>first</i> step would have been to contact GeorgeMoney, rather than just editing it yourself (in particular if the "problem" is just one of annoyance, not of critical importance to the project).

<li>On the image, I think it was an excellent illustration, especially useful as there will be many younger people who will not have a clue what ejaculation is (and may be worried if it happens to them). Providing a good illustration of ejaculation would be of great benefit to the encyclopedia.

<dd>Tony, this almost seems evasive. First, hardcore pornography (apparently, "hardcore" is now the preferred spelling) is defined as the photographic depiction of explicit sex acts (and, neither a partner nor mutual activity is a requirement for a "sex act" IMO) so, in the context, I find the terminology identical. Second, The <a href="../../../g/e/n/Wikipedia%7EGeneral_disclaimer_3e44.html" title="Wikipedia:General disclaimer">disclaimer</a> is linked from the <b>bottom</b> of each page, long after this article would have shoved (porn/a "sexually explicit" image) into the viewer's face. <tt><a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadioKirk_a5db.html" title="User:RadioKirk"><span style="color: #161;">Radio</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RadioKirk_8f39.html" title="Special:Contributions/RadioKirk"><span style="color: #161;">Kirk</span></a></tt> <tt><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadioKirk_dc7c.html" title="User talk:RadioKirk"><span style="font-size: 9px; color: #161;">talk to me</span></a></tt> 17:16, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is a big deal, though, if we have admins regularly going around deleting stuff without stopping to verify whether it's actually a candidate for speedy deletion, or whether the page hasn't been manipulated so that it looks like a candidate when it isn't.

<dd>I've not always agreed with Cyde and Tony apropos of how admins ought to exercise discretion in speedying things, but Cyde (with whom Tony seems to agree) is wholly correct here; thorough checking, important for articles, is crucial with respect to images, which, as many note, can't be undeleted. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 18:44, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Agreed - however this seems to be a "delete as tagged" problem. If they checked the edit history of the uploader they would have checked the edit history of the image too. Speedy tags *are* used in edit wars - it's up to us to know what deletion policy is. All our images in sex related articles are contentious and we need to be extra careful with contentious topics when the potential for admin manipulation is higher. Everyone should be more careful with images because image deletion cannot be reverted. If in doubt always ask - IRC or any of our talk pages is a good idea. I wonder if we should start a voluntary mentoring project for new admins - people you can bounce ideas off if you want to. Lots of stuff is borderline but where the lines are drawn isn't always obvious as we basically work on something like case law. I'd happily handhold a new colleague - I'm sure others are the same. <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecretlondon_1805.html" title="User:Secretlondon">Secretlondon</a> 20:54, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't know that Cyde's "trusted" formulation is altogether appropriate; nearly every consistent contributor could, IMHO, be trusted with the power to delete things, even speedily, but surely those users who partake of the project for less-than-encyclopedic purposes (either to disrupt or simply to impose certain views) mustn't be permitted to exercise deletion deleteriously. Admins are not necessarily preternaturally infallible, and neither does some special brilliance entail from one's being approved as an admin. Adminship is, on the whole, not a discretionary task; admins act only to implement consensus, either as expressed in a specific situation or as codified in policy, et cetera. To say that "regular users can't be trusted with access to the 'delete' button", is, I think, fundamentally to misunderstand what adminship is and unintentionally to underestimate "regular users". <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 22:16, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If a page has a few thousand versions, having <a href="../../../w/a/t/MediaWiki%7EWatcheditlist_Check_all_da71.html" title="MediaWiki:Watcheditlist/Check all">the ability to check all boxes in one fell swoop</a> is a great help. However, when it's <i>several</i> thousand versions, it's best to go to someone with oversight powers. As far as I know, those people are <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrion_VIBBER_bae4.html" title="User:Brion VIBBER">Brion VIBBER</a>, <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>, <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindspillage_87a5.html" title="User:Mindspillage">Mindspillage</a>, and <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_Knott_a4ea.html" title="User:Theresa Knott">Theresa Knott</a>. There may be others. If the information is very confidential, I wouldn't leave a message on the user's talk page: I'd rollback the edit, and then check contributions so as to make a judgment as to which oversight users were most likely to be online, and would then send a private e-mail. Apparently it also helps the oversight user if <i>after</i> reverting the vandalism, you make another edit — even a small one like putting in a comma. Also, I think that an advantage of the oversight method is that the bad edit can't be accidentally restored by an admin who removes personal information from the same page six months later. For example, if someone puts User A's phone number into the article on Vitamin C on 14 March, and an admin deletes the page and restores all the versions except the bad one, and then someone comes along on 27 August and posts User B's real name, an admin who doesn't check the history of the page to see what edits have already been deleted <i><b>before deleting the page</b></i> will delete the page and restore it with everything except User B's name, so User A's phone number will once again be retrievable from the history. As far as I know, there's no way of knowing which versions were once deleted once they've been restored, or once the page has been deleted again, but I could be wrong. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 08:39, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>Sorry, much easier. If you see personal information, not even bother to rollback or revert. Do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Delete page (Foo) on sight.</li>
<li>Restore bad version (yes, the bad version)</li>
<li>Move bad version to Foo/Bad</li>
<li>Delete Foo/Bad</li>
<li>Restore remaining versions of Foo</li>
</ol>
<p>Advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>If there is a second time in which personal information needs to be removed, there is no change of accidentially restoring the removed personal information of previous times. All Bad stuff wil accumulate in Foo/Bad.</li>
<li>It is fast, regardless of the number of revisions, and it is effectively a ons checkbox operation.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think it might be actually a good idea to scan the database for partial restores and move the personal info (or other needs to stay deleted stuff) out of the way so that it stays deleted. -- <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimvdLinde_061a.html" title="User:KimvdLinde">Kim van der Linde</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/m/User_talk%7EKimvdLinde_a7d1.html" title="User talk:KimvdLinde">at venus</a></sup> 11:23, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm around, able to be pinged via talk page message (even if it's only "check your email, please") between twelve and fifteen hours a day, sometimes longer, basically between 22:00 UTC and 14:00 UTC. That covers much of the day, and does not constitute a "good chance" that nobody will be around. To be honest, Mindspillage and I cover most of the day; she is usually getting up and beginning work (online all day, everyday, working for Wikia, and just an email away) as I'm going to bed, and I'm already online as she's going to bed.</p>
<p>I've seen quite a few people say "nobody's ever around", but I'd like to see some evidence, as I *know* how much I'm around, and I know how much I see the others around. I've yet to see anyone able to produce a case where private information was discovered, and no oversight was online; I find it very hard to believe that there are many periods where an oversight is unavailable. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <font color="#7B68EE">(<small><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">Talk</font></a> • <font color="#7B68EE">Connect</font></small>)</font></span> 00:11, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi folks, I originally indef blocked the above user and then unblocked a while back. This user still can't seem to edit because it seems that the autoblocker is blocking him. I tried unblocking any IPs that get hit with the autblocker, and I even tried to unblock him again, but to no avail. Could an experienced admin please take a look and let me know what the heck is going on? Chud Manzier can't seem to edit because he keeps getting hit with the autoblock.

<dd>I said no the first time, agreed to one of them, reduced the block, then he continued to put them in. Your right that the first one is not for this block but it does show one of the reasons why he's blocked in the first place.

<dd>Gotten sick of the same accusations of admin abuse? I think thats pretty much whats happened here. JDoorJam falsely blocked Anoranza for 3RR. Anoranza contested it and it was lifted. Anoranza was then blocked for one week for not contesting it <i>humbly enough</i>. He made some insinuation about an admins counting ability and boom one week ban. Which amazes me because I've seen much more venomous things and I don't see many people getting one week bans. Frankly, I don't know what you wanted Anoranza to say in response to a faulty block; <i>"Thank you sir, may I have another?"</i> -- <a href="../../../m/r/2E/User%7EMr._Tibbs_efc1.html" title="User:Mr. Tibbs">Mr. Tibbs</a> 07:07, 10 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>He could of said nothing, he could have said "Don't do that again", he could of said "be more careful next time" he could of said <b>a lot</b> of other stuff. But he chose to insinuate that other users are idiots right during the brief period he was blocked and after. He also showed no consideration that he had done anything wrong showing he obviously will not respect <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> if we let him continue. Frankly, if he wasn't so combative I would have considered a block shortening but all he has done is insist that the other party is at fault and cry wolf over and over.

What I meant was obviously "You can recreate it and state the notability better using <i>the information provided in</i> your link if you want, and the stub will not be deleted."

<p>check out [[singular they]]. there's a recent IP user who's got a long contrib list, looks pretty legit, but the NPOV tag feels outt place- and a relative nube (sans userpage) placed it there. my understanding is there has been a good deal of battle on this page, some civil.

<p>Per a request on <a href="../../../d/e/c/Wikipedia%7EDeceased_Wikipedians_c96d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deceased Wikipedians">Wikipedia:Deceased Wikipedians</a>, I'm trying to find out if anyone knows what happened to <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid91_7ed4.html" title="User:David91">User:David91</a>. He stopped editing around April 12, 2006, when he was admitted to the hospital for some tests. He possibly lived in Singapore (likely in or near Ang Mo Kio, which he edited 3 times but with enough detail to suggest a strong familiarity with the place), and was probably the oldest Wikipedian at the age of 94 (based on a reference from 2003 when he said he was 91). Based on his numerous contributions in law it is possible he was a retired lawyer of some kind. He also contributed to linguistics, sociology, and science fiction articles. He was part of Wikipedia:WikiProject International law and he made nearly 5000 edits. He evidently also involved in other Internet communities during his retirement. Any information on David91 would be appreciated. Thanks,--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlabamaboy_1073.html" title="User:Alabamaboy">Alabamaboy</a> 14:28, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>One's curiosity on the vital statistics of an editor with whom one was familliar is not an appropriate reason to request checkuser (IMO). And even the best of intentions should not excuse an attempt at ferreting out the real identity, location, and medical status of a user. If he wanted you to know, he would have come out and said it. And if he's dead and you just don't know, then sorry to be cold, but his nmae needs to be moved to Missing Wikipedians, and people need to move on. --Jeffrey O.

<dd>The editors who knew David91 and admired his contributions to Wikipedia would no doubt disagree with you. As anyone who edits Wikipedia can verify, how we spend our time is up to us. Personally, I know of no better way to spend my time than to try and honor a Wikipedian who had an amazing impact on the legal articles here. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlabamaboy_1073.html" title="User:Alabamaboy">Alabamaboy</a> 01:36, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have no argument with what you say about checkuser. But concern over whether a member of our community has died is more than just "curiosity". It's a basic human interest that people in any community share. We do have the right to vanish, but we also have a reasonable expectation that people will care, a lot, when we die. --<a href="../../../a/m/c/User%7EAmcbride_b12f.html" title="User:Amcbride">Allen</a> 01:36, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Allen about the concern and with Jeffrey O. Gustafson that checkuser should not be used in such situations. While Wikipedia is not a social club and I'm not going to start hugging people, ASCII or otherwise, we should have a little concern for the well-being of other editors. However, no more information than was freely handed out by a user should be used to track him or her down and if a user seems to want to be left alone, they should be. Unless something occurred suddenly or they wanted to keep it private, it is likely that frequent contributors would leave a note on their user or talk page or tell someone else what is going on. Of course, they are unable to tell us of their death, except for a time frame for those with terminal illnesses. That's a limitation that I think we'll have to accept. Try posting on their talk page and sending them an email. If they have given out their phone number, address or place of work, you could try that (it would probably be best to wait a while before checking whether they are sick or dead by these methods unless there are reasons other than their absence to think so). If they cannot be found, we'll have to settle with adding them to the list of missing Wikipedians. If an editor wants to be contactable in such situations, they should put the relevant information on their user page or give it to a friend or two. I suppose contact information for those who wish to supply it could be made confidential, only available to bureaucrats and/or stewards, but that might be excessive. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 02:35, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. I'd like to survey opinion on the idea of blocking <a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E200.138.194.254.html" title="User:200.138.194.254">200.138.194.254</a> (<a href="../../../2/0/0/User_talk%7E200.138.194.254.html" title="User talk:200.138.194.254">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_200.138.194.254_0d4a.html" title="Special:Contributions/200.138.194.254">contribs</a>). The IP is being used to make a lot of formatting changes to music-related articles. This has been a source of some frustration for other editors, because the formatting changes are often idiosyncratic, contra-guidelines, or make the article more difficult to edit afterwords. I wouldn't normally regard this as a reason to block, but the IP's user absolutely refuses to respond to their Talk page, or discuss changes to articles on article Talk pages. I am considering blocking with a message that indicates that they need to start doing so, and that I will unblock when I get a commitment that they will enter into discussion going forward. Thoughts? Advice from similar situations? <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 23:54, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If their editorial behaviour is making it hard for people to continue normal editing of the article, then a proportionate block seems reasonable. Something that will expire within their interest-frame but enough for them to get the message that they can't carry on like that. All this as long as you're not materially engaged in a dispute with them, of course, but needing them to communicate isn't a dispute: you just happen to be the admin on the scene. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> - <a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">tk</a> 00:40, 13 June 2006 (UTC)
