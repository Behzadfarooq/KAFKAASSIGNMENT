<li>It seems to me to be a straightforward case.

If so, does ScienceApologist's edit fall inside or outside of it?</li>
<li>Likewise, does the inclusion of two of ScienceApologist's statements <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Immanuel_Velikovsky&amp;diff=100103892&amp;oldid=100099195" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Immanuel_Velikovsky&amp;diff=100103892&amp;oldid=100099195" rel="nofollow">described here</a>, fall within, or outside of WP:V and WP:RS as described?</li>
<li>Again, are ScienceApologist's accusations against me valid criticisms or not?</li>

Guy, I did notice your attempt to caution him, and that was appreciated, but perhaps more needs to be done. I for one thought we where making progress, at least on the plasma cosmology page, yet it appears that is just one of the places that battles are being fought with this user.

<p>I guess I am seriously confused by all this. You all mean to tell us that ScienceApologist is simply 'above the law' here on Wikipedia? That his very disruptive edits and intrusion into other editors attempts at improving articles, can go unchecked? The very light action taken towards him in the recent ArbCom case allows him to circumvent any further ruling against him? We must open the previous case to even have his detrimental actions considered? If that is the case, by all means, open it up again. Yes, I understand that also means a thorough investigation of all parties involved, and since I was not part of the original case, I assume that now an investigation into my edits would also become part of the re-opening. This certainly isn't abuse by Ian, if it was he would be the only person to have complained thus far, and so far I count 3 that I am aware of (2 officially, and 1 unofficially.) All we have asked is that proper blocking be placed against the editor in question. I for one am done engaging with him for a while, he has again demonstrated controversial and disruptive editing to the only article I really have any business editing here on Wikipedia. Excuse my slight change in demeanor, I had spent a few hours preparing an addition to the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plasma_cosmology.html" title="Plasma cosmology">Plasma_cosmology</a> page which ScienceApologist removed only 16 minutes after I had added the content, and am cooling off from a heated discussion over the disruption. I guess I'm done here, thanks for listening to my further complaint. -<a href="../../../i/o/n/User%7EIonized_5399.html" title="User:Ionized">Ionized</a> 03:26, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I went to the user talk page and had some difficulty in phrasing a proper notice regarding my Arbitration enforcement request. Deletion review has a form notification -- {{subst:DRVNote|PAGE_NAME}} -- that only requires the poster to enter the page name and add the template to the user talk page. See <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html#Steps_to_list_a_new_deletion_review" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV#Steps_to_list_a_new_deletion_review</a>.

<dd>Hopefully, enforcement is not requested until after ordinary attempts at communication have failed. It is certainly not needed to go through RFC, mediation, etc., with a user who is already on probation in a prior case, but the fact that someone is under an arbitration remedy does not mean that editors are relieved of all expectations of communication and trying to build consensus. If discussion has occured but not been useful, it should be simple to tell the other editor, "I'm sorry we couldn't work this out, I 'm posting this to AE for review." Formalizing it with a template might reinforce the mistaken idea that this is the <i>first</i> place to bring a complaint. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 03:58, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have had a Arbcom case against me in the past. I am now, I believe being harrassed based on it. Any dispute with a user, meaning disagreement involves a user threatening an Arbcom hearing against me. There is a page for enforcement that lets people complain about those who have had hearings, where do those who feel they are being harrassed because of them have to go? I was asked by <a href="../../../l/o/v/User%7ELovelight_bc72.html" title="User:Lovelight">User:Lovelight</a> to help with a template they were working on template:911cd. I added the events of 9/11 to the template, as the collapse of the World Trade Center is directly relevant to the theory that it was done by controlled demolition. That edit was removed by a user, <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">user:Arthur Rubin</a> with the following message <i>"Removing events which SHOULDN'T be in this template.

<p>I dont think this is the page for it but I fully agree with what you are saying.

<dd>Under the circumstances, I am forced to come to the conclusion that you are intentionally damaging the template. There is no way the planes are relevant to controlled demolition, unless you are restricting the template to those CD theories which deny the existence of the planes. <i>Intentionally placing something clearly inappropriate in a template</i> is an example of vandalism, and I see no reason to assert otherwise. It should also be noted that you have been reported three times in the main board within the past month, and there has been no assertion other than by you that you have <i>not</i> violated the Arbcom ruling, but you've only been banned from one of the articles that you have violated the ruling in. — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 21:42, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is the problem with you assuming bad faith. The articles on the planes best discuss the events of what happened, specific to those buildings. The idea of controlled demolition often involves the planes hitting the buildings being used as a cover for the rigged explosives, making the articles on the planes directly relevant. This is a perfect case in point of Assuming Bad Faith based on past sanctions.

<p>We seem to have lost the thread of this, IMO very importnat, conversation. This definitely isnt the place to discuss the details of the conflict between Nuclear and other users. Can we get back on topic please? <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 23:35, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree. I think users with sanctions should have a place to cite harrassment. Whenever you put some sort of sanction on someone, a mark on a record, its going to create an atmosphere where people feel they can take advantage of it. While its sad that is the situation. I think its necessary that since Arbcom rulings are not suppose to be <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scarlet_letter.html" title="Scarlet letter">scarlet letter</a>'s and that editors with rulings are expected to be treated just as editors with them, that they have a place to seek help as well. I am sure there have been others, but you can see from the many complaints brought against me, 1 acted against (I was wrong), 9 not acted against, and some even cited as attempts to use my Arbcom as a weapon, the problem seems exist and needs a remedy. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 23:39, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think it's productive to carry this conversation on at least three different pages, and this is the least-watched. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 04:10, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Albeit probably the most relevant (of the 3 pages this conversation is spread over). Without wanting to see things spread too much further dont know if this might interest you, Nuclear; <a href="../../../c/o/m/Wikipedia%7ECommunity_enforced_mediation_02a9.html" title="Wikipedia:Community enforced mediation">Wikipedia:Community enforced mediation</a>, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 04:42, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have a simpler question. <a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">User:NuclearUmpf</a> was placed on probation. Is this a permanent status? I would have thought that probation would have expired after a designated time. The ruling doesn't specify a time limit. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 05:32, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If it doesn't specify, then the time frame is indefinite. A few former parolees have been able to demonstrate that they have reformed and gotten their probation lifted by filing an appeal. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 05:36, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well I will give it time, I did mess up once with the Iraq War page fiasco. Out of the last 9 times I was complained about, its the only one that actually was correct and enforced. However I still wish there was a window, a place, for those with sanctions to report harrassment, is there? Do I have to pick an Arbcom members talk page randomly and hope they will look at the issue? And thank yuo for responding Thatcher131, last time we spoke you were in the middle of a large Arbcom case, hope this is not pulling you away. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 05:41, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
