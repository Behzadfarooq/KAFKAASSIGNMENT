<p>This user is constatnly rude, abusive and now he accuses me of being a sockpuppet of someone else.

<p>All the evidence for harrassment is there for the public to see. The cooling off period is requested in order to allow the new user to participate in peace with the Wikipedia community. The above user Tuxide seeks to make inflammatory statements however there is no evidence that the user is "strange." That would be personal opinion however it is not personal opinion that harrassment and vandalism of a user's, that is fact. This is the forum to resolve this not on content pages and we are all grateful that the users in question can be civil about this. Thanks and good luck. --Memejojo 00:25, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would like to make the suggestion that Tuxide refrain from editing posts from other user by adding the small font mini signature that targets specific users. This is clearly intimidation and harrassment and it is surprising to some degree that it continues here on the administrators page. Besides the user in dispute is <a href="../../../b/2/b/User%7EB2bomber81_4a7a.html" title="User:B2bomber81"><tt class="userlinks" style="1.3em">B2bomber81</tt></a> (<span class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../b/2/b/User_talk%7EB2bomber81_8abc.html" title="User talk:B2bomber81">talk</a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_B2bomber81_91bd.html" title="Special:Contributions/B2bomber81">contribs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">logs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../b/l/o/Special%7EBlockip_B2bomber81_1b96.html" title="Special:Blockip/B2bomber81">block user</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">block log</a></span>) but I respect and encourage any users making productive comments regarding this issue. --Memejojo 00:29, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>To state that new users have contributed to 1 article. Well isn't that something to be expected. How can one write more if they are dealing with harassment? Let's have some guidance about that from more admins. It is a healthy conversation to have and I am willing to spend as many months as it takes to resolve these issues as long as all involved also communicate in this forum in good faith. Thanks and good luck. --Memejojo 00:51, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I referred to Memejojo as a new user based on his creation log, not based on his count log. However, I don't believe that this user is new to wikipedia. I do suspect that he is a sockpuppet of blocked users Momoj and Jomomm (verified sockpuppets). My basis for this suspicion? Firstly, their names are quite similar. Secondly, Memejojo being a "new member" immediately started flaming other editors for editing his contribution to the Best Buy page. He repeated infers ownership of the article by "daring" anyone to make changes to his contributions without permission, or simply reverts the edits. I have already submitted a checkuser request for this user to determine if it is indeed a sockpuppet or not.</p>
<p>His last contribution included a biased comment that I requested be left out. He refused, and so I removed his contribution, asking that he refrain from reintroducing to the article until there was a consensus on the content of his contribution. I suggested he could either agree to leave his opinions out of the article or find a reliable source for his claims. I will note that Tuxide also recommended that an alternate source be used. Memejojo responded with another revert and said there is no lack of consensus.</p>
<p>Lastly, as Tuxide eluded to, this user is just plain strange. He refers to himself in a third person almost as if he is actually representing several people, as well as falsely representing himself as an administrator. At one point he tried to verbally impose a 24-hour cool off period on me until Tuxide reminded him that he was not an admin. He has also taken it upon himself to edit other users talk pages to remove threads that he feels aren't appropriate in his opinion. I appreciate the admins taking the time to look into this matter. <a href="../../../b/2/b/User%7EB2bomber81_4a7a.html" title="User:B2bomber81">B2bomber81</a> 02:02, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>In an effort to correct the course this is going and to clarify what this post is about. It is about the harrassment of a new user. It is not about what certain users wish were true but it is about what is actually true. I do not believe the admins who view this forum are swayed by false accusations. If there is concrete evidence for flamming, daring/taunting, sockpuppetry etc. let them present the evidence here and in the open. You'd think I was the devil or something. There is simply no evidence of this. One thing is for sure since opening this request for mediation B2bomber81 has ceased harrassment. I admit Tuxide used very colorful and passionate language but this forum should be reserved for facts and not rhetoric. --Memejojo 17:09, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So you add a new section to <a href="../../../b/e/s/Best_Buy_c40e.html" title="Best Buy">Best Buy</a>, only to come to this board when someone else wants your own edits to comply to <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOSHEAD_020f.html" title="WP:MOSHEAD">WP:MOSHEAD</a>, and labeling him as a vandal.

<p>I added more information under an already existing category which is of course fully compliant with all wikipedia standards. I am a new member and will continue to make contributions. I have found many editors inviting. Tuxide seems to be the only one confused by wikipedia standards but as a community we will help him/her become a more productive member. This forum is a good place to air out differences and I am very very pleased with the results which is a stop to the harrassment. I now feel like this community is worth my time and effort. I hope this shows that through civil discourse people online can come together to form a great product which is Wikipedia. --Memejojo 23:50, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The site does not contain a lot of advertising. It now has three banners, but, before that, the site operated for several years with absolutely no ads whatsoever. And, it should be noted, the ads in question are music related (it's a music journalism website). It should also be noted that Popmatters and Pitchfork contain far more ads than three. I only added links to tinymixtapes in the "professional reviews" catagory for albums, as the reviews on TMT are the hallmark of professional. I never just spam linked the basic site link. I only provided relevant content to specific albums. I deeply object to the association of Tiny Mix Tapes as spam. It is a professional music journalism website and should be allowed to be mentioned along side other professional reviews.--<a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangle_4f5a.html" title="User:Mangle">Mangle</a> 20:34, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not an editor for tinymixtapes, or any publication for that matter. And I fail to see how adding professional reviews under the professional reviews catagory is spamming.

<p>Mangle, the problem I have with linking to Tiny Mix Tapes is that you haven't shown it to be a notable web site, in accordance with our policies. I looked into it a bit, and couldn't find anything to change my mind. You can read our web site notability guidelines <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">here</a>. While that is specifically for articles about websites, in my mind it would also apply to external links of this type. If someone wrote a review of an album on a blogspot blog and linked to it in an album's infobox here, I think we'd all agree that most editors would object to including it. In the absence of evidence that Tiny Mix Tapes is a notable or respected website providing reviews, it should be treated the same way, I'm afraid. —<a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell"><b><font color="#555">bbatsell</font></b></a> <a href="../../../b/b/a/User_talk%7EBbatsell_7978.html" title="User talk:Bbatsell"><font color="#C46100" size="1">¿?</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bbatsell_a457.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bbatsell"><font color="#2C9191" size="3">✍</font></a> 22:45, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>As a photographer myself I appreciate your aggressive pursuit of copyright issues. Just a comment here, when I give permission to use my artwork, I send one of half-a-dozen form responses, and I send them from various names/websites, depending upon where the request originated. However, it appears you have handled this correctly by contacting the sites, rather than making an assumption, and erring towards deletion (they can be uploaded again if necessary). In the end, though, it doesn't matter, the user had already been banned from editing Wikipedia under another name. Again, I do appreciate your working to honor others' copyright by deleting all of the images uploaded by this user. People think a camera makes everyone a photographer, so pictures on the Internet are up for grabs--neither assumption should be part of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 22:19, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hmm. I don't see how you establish Jayjg as a Jew. His user page does not say that he is, so unless he stated it elsewhere, I do not know how you reach this conclusion.</p>
<p>What I do know from my experiences with Jayjg is that he doesn't usually AGF and can be somewhat uncivil ('snappy'). I can provide diffs for these problems if you need them, but looking at the archives for <a href="../../../m/a/h/Talk%7EMahmoud_Ahmadinejad_f6a0.html" title="Talk:Mahmoud Ahmadinejad">Talk:Mahmoud Ahmadinejad</a> may be easier &amp; more informative, since they are rather lengthy conversations. I'm no expert, but I think this won't happen if he becomes more respectful towards other users. He assumed bad faith by writing off other users as "apologists," and often justified his editing as counteracting these supposed apologists. While it is <i>possible</i> that some users may be apologists, to assume that that they are is not AGF, and acting based upon this assumption yield edits that are controversial to editors who do not agree with this assumption. I did ask him once to back up his "apologist" assertion. He provided some diffs, but the only example that made sense was for <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarastro777_95c7.html" title="User:Sarastro777">User:Sarastro777</a>, who barely edits there anyway. Even if some editors are apologists, that should not justify edits; as Jossi quoted, and I now paraphrase, 'address the edit not the editor'. Jayjg would also make insinuative comments (insinuative towards me as an editor), but when I tried to address this incivility, he would hide behind the "talk about the article content" line. It makes no sense that I should be attacked, but not allowed to defend myself, and that he gave me the whole "talk about the article content" thing is just hypocritical since I was simply responding to his not-content insinuations. So, in sum, he should simply drop this practice of making edits in response to perceived "apologists."</p>
<p>Also, Jayjg should try to reach consensus with those who he is in disagreement with rather than simply insisting that he is right for his own reasons, and then enforcing his own opinion on how the article should be. In other words, he should be more compromising when discussing with other editors.</p>
<p>Another point, that is minor but I found amusing, is citing "per talk" when there is no consensus on the talk page for the action <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad&amp;diff=109423296&amp;oldid=109401921" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad&amp;diff=109423296&amp;oldid=109401921" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>. The problem, of course, being that the consensus simply wasn't there. He had been against the 'Easter Egg', but should not remove it simply because he didn't like it, and he definitely should not edit per a talk page not authorizing consensus on the matter. It became clear that he did not like it, not for being an 'Easter Egg', but because it linked to the section that explained the translation issue. This is clear because he was willing to keep the link only if it pointed to a different spot.</p>
<p>While I am sure Jayjg is probably a great editor in general, he has had issues on at least the <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad_6e5e.html" title="Mahmoud Ahmadinejad">Mahmoud Ahmadinejad</a> page. <b>I urge</b> you other administrators <b>not to let him give "educational" bans</b> to the various editors who he has had conflicts. Obviously, they reached some conclusions &amp; expressed them inappropriately (as far as COI goes), but it would be unfair to punish them for their statements while leaving Jayjg 'uneducated'.</p>
<p>Calling other editors "apologists" is itself an accusation of COI, akin to those accusations against Jayjg that led to this ANI. For one, Jayjg should not give any of the these proposed bans himself. More importantly, <b>if the editors who have unfairly accused Jayjg of COI are given "educational" bans, Jayjg should also be given an "educational" ban of length greater than or equal to theirs for his "apologist" accusations</b> (and other AGF violations) because <b>they too were unfair accusations of COI</b> &amp; bad faith.</p>
<p>I hope Jayjg reads this &amp; considers improving his behavior in the ways I have touched upon here. Thanks. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 03:17, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>I hope he ignores all of it; it's a very out-of-place diversion from the original point, which is that of improper allegations of conflict of interest. Regarding the "educational blocks", handle it like I've handled other editor's allegations of vandalism: I first made it clear to him that unjustified accusations of vandalism constitute personal attacks; after a bit more of it, I said explicitly that the next time he called someone a vandal and I disagreed, I'd block him for 30 days (he'd already been blocked more than once for incivility and personal attacks, so the long period was justified.) The next time I saw him referring to other editors (in this case, <a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a> was one, as it turned out), I invoked the block I'd warned him about. He's whining and claiming abuse, but that's hardly surprising. Unjustified accusations of COI are not as extreme as unjustified accusations of vandalism, but they are still tantamount to personal attacks if not backed up with copious proof. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><sup><small><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a></small></sup> 03:59, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The issue isn't whether Jay is or isn't Jewish, it's that the editors harassing him think so. That is, unless you're suggesting that maybe they think he's a Christian Zionist. This seems unlikely to me. Being an "apologist" usually entails making excuses, and is not the same as a COI. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmon_3172.html" title="User:Armon">&lt;&lt;-armon-&gt;&gt;</a> 03:48, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't see where the Jew versus Christian Zionist dichotomy comes from. I have seen a dichotomy on the <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad_6e5e.html" title="Mahmoud Ahmadinejad">Mahmoud Ahmadinejad</a> page form that is basically "ZioAttackers" versus "Ahmadinejad Apologists" (to use each sides' disparaging description of the other). Anyway, "Apologist" is how he described us, and it is much more than simply making excuses. If we are "apologists" for Ahmadinejad, we have an obvious conflict of interest with the <b>neutral</b> editing policy, because as apologists we want to make Ahmadinejad look good &amp; refute/downplay criticism of him, which aren't neutral goals. This is the basic reason behind considering the accusation of "apologist" akin to the accusation of COI. And from there, it only is right that Jayjg be 'educated' for the same wrongdoing. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 04:00, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

As with all Wikipedians there are some areas in which he has greater expertise than others. But I have never seen a conflict of interest and I have never seen him push a particular POV - at most I have seen valid disagreements over what may constitute NPOV, a reliable source, or relevance to an article that can easily be resolved through discussion ... this is thus most mundane fodder of editing ... <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 12:30, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmm, seems that you are accusing <i>me</i> of trying to 'assassinate his character'. That is a very rude accusation, and of course that is not my aim. I haven't provided diffs or pointers to specific conversations because I felt that most of the editors who have been involved at this ANI post are well capable of going to the archives for <a href="../../../m/a/h/Talk%7EMahmoud_Ahmadinejad_f6a0.html" title="Talk:Mahmoud Ahmadinejad">Talk:Mahmoud Ahmadinejad</a>. My details are in those conversations with Jayjg, but he mostly ignored or avoided responding to the feedback. Am I mistaken? Would you like me to point you in the right direction?

<p>Hmm. I now see that <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> is much more specific in its scope than 'conflict of interest' is in general usage. I think that these people are improperly alleging COI because they don't realize that COI applies pretty much just to company &amp; autobiographical situations. In that case I definitely take back my conclusion that Jayjg is an 'improper COI alleger', though the situations I brought up still constitute <i>at least</i> a consistent violation of AGF without any regard to repeated requests to AGF &amp; be civil (on <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad_6e5e.html" title="Mahmoud Ahmadinejad">Mahmoud Ahmadinejad</a>). Perhaps this is a common mistake? I believe I have seen other people refer to the policy when describing 'general' usage elsewhere on Wikipedia. Anyway, knowing this, I think that the people should receive good explanations as to why they are wrong in their COI claims before something severe like 'educational' blocks are applied. Their problems with with Jayjg seem to be, in reality, about perceived POV/bias matters, so they should simply receive an explanation as to why they are improperly classifying their issue. Unless they actually think that Jayjg has some sort of autobiographical, corporate, government, etc affiliation. Then they should bring real proof or completely drop the charges. In sum, the COI allegations could easily be mistakes over the scope of COI, so the 'educational' block seems unnecessary, harsh, and will not actually fix the problem. And, if it is done by Jayjg, will be a blatant abuse of power. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 15:37, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Bottom line is that "conflict of interest" must mean more than "has an opinion about something". Else we are all barred from editing everything. If Jay's "conflict of interest" is that he generally supports Israel and dislikes Ahmadinejad, then the accusations are meaningless. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriangotts_6470.html" title="User:Briangotts">Briangotts</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBriangotts_9359.html" title="User talk:Briangotts">(Talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Briangotts_3847.html" title="Special:Contributions/Briangotts">(Contrib)</a> 15:30, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, they seem to be mistaken in confusing a bias claim with conflict of interest. How does this warrant 'educational' blocks? How do those blocks educate them? A good explanation is much better. Perhaps Jayjg is frustrated with their improper claims, but I simply do not see what a block will do other than provoke them &amp; cause more conflict. Of course, he'd win out in any such conflict (since he is 'important in the eyes of the community'), but the aim should be to encourage other editors to mend their ways rather than provoke them into a graver violation. Doesn't always work (<a href="../../../k/i/u/User%7EKiumars_2e7c.html" title="User:Kiumars">User:Kiumars</a>), but a better start than this apparently useless 'education'. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 15:54, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>To me, this seems like another example of when people cannot get their POV pushed across wikipedia (and rightfully so), they engage in trying to destroy the credibility of the wiki guardian in order to eliminate the obstacle to their attempted violations. I will agree that Jay, at times, has ben curt. But who wouldn't be if they were the target of as much improper accusations, allegations, <i>argumentum ad hominem</i>, name-calling, and other nonsense. I think we can all agree Jay is human, and has bad days as well as good ones. But looking at his overall prodigious wiki history (including ArbCom) there are FEW editors in wikipedia who have done more to KEEP the balance, the peace, and uphold the guidelines and policies of wiki than Jayjg. Unfortunately, the bigger the target, the easier it is to fling garbage at it&#160;:( -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 20:16, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am not expecting you, Humus and others, not to defend Jayig, however, editors have noted that Jayig routinely ignores the talk page, and edits the article as he wishes, leaving "per talk" in the edit summary. As an example despite most of the editors agreed that dispute on translation should be included, he removed it, citing "per talk". Although Avi and all others users and admins have a POV, but they never tried to use their admin status to intimidate editors of Ahmadinejad article, which is why no one seem to get in conflict with them. Also, while a POV and hence "conflict of interest" (general term, not WP:COI) is OK, one should ask why is it that only Jayig is always being accused of. Obviously its not his religion and ethnicity, as he might share that with Avi and others, but his constant defamation of Ahmadinejad, whom he sees as an obvious monster, not worthy of any "apologist".--<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerash77_a233.html" title="User:Gerash77">Gerash</a><a href="../../../g/e/r/User_talk%7EGerash77_2994.html" title="User talk:Gerash77"><b>77</b></a> 22:19, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Smee, you are the only one posting phony PA warnings on my page and this is not about me, this is about archiving a talk page prematurely and against the wishes of another editor during discussion of sanctioning an 3rd editor for actions associated with that article. <b>What is the world are you thinking?</b> --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 20:26, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>It's just common sense that editors are free to unarchive archived talkpage material if they have reasonable cause to want it kept on the live page.

That could be a sign of different users at the IP, but I don't think so. The vandalism isn't at the "poop" and "penis" level, it's actually a tiny bit clever; and twice when I've called him on it he's responded on my talk page in a light-hearted manner, essentially saying that his vandalism should be accepted because it's funny. In a way, this makes him a more dangerous vandal than the poop/penis crowd, or the X-is-hooooot crowd, whose vandalisms can easily be spotted.

<p>Howdy folks, I'm participating in a DRV and would like a quick sanity check on something. An article I speedy deleted on Jan 19 has been brought up for deletion review, and that's fine. We can't get 'em all right, and if it was an error, best it be resolved. But I'm perceiving an odd belligerence from another admin in the discussion, and I'd like to know if it's my imagination or not. The specific discussion is at <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_Log_2007_March_5_5a91.html#Young_Electric_Sign_Company" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review/Log/2007 March 5">this deletion review</a>, and the admin in question is <span class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Night_Gyr_910c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Night Gyr">contribs</a> <small>•</small> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_block_4a41.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_block_4a41.html" rel="nofollow"><font color="#002BB8">blocks</font></a> <small>•</small> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_protect_c66b.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_protect_c66b.html" rel="nofollow"><font color="#002BB8">protects</font></a> <small>•</small> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_delete_f5f8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_delete_f5f8.html" rel="nofollow"><font color="#002BB8">deletions</font></a> <small>•</small> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_move_02c8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_move_02c8.html" rel="nofollow"><font color="#002BB8">moves</font></a>)</span>.

<dd>Not quite as hostile as someone else who was similarly unhappy with a deletion of mine, but yeah, a little unnecessarily belligerent.

<dd>I think you're being overly sensitive. Perhaps you were a little overzealous with this speedy delete, perhaps not. In borderline cases it is a good idea to ask for a second opinion, one way of doing this is to tag the article and let some other administrator delete it. But I don't think you did anything that was clearly out of line - provided this is not something that happens to you on a pretty regular basis, in which case, I would invest some self-reflection, just to make sure you're not growing a bit "trigger happy" with speedy deletes. I also think that by insisting on justifying your actions to the other admin, you were acting defensive and not letting the matter rest, which contributed to the other admin putting his/her guard up. This is really quite a small matter, no harm done on either side, you should probably just let it be. --<a href="../../../w/o/g/User%7EWoggly_b7b8.html" title="User:Woggly">woggly</a> 07:26, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Fair enough, but for the record, I didn't post anything until the admin in question said "Overturn, invalid speedy. The article needed sources, but nothing was atrocious and it wasn't even tagged. Unnecessary unilateral action. Night Gyr (talk/Oy) 02:46,", so he established his tone before I made a peep, but I appreciate the feedback. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChairboy_157e.html" title="User:Chairboy">C<small>HAIRBOY</small></a> (<a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChairboy_882d.html" title="User talk:Chairboy">☎</a>) 07:36, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The user that was blocked has been unblocked by Zscout370, presumably pending pending a ruling by the Arbitration Committee on the status of their editing abilities. Note that this is neither an endorsement nor a disapproval on my part towards the block or the unblock, but merely procedural per the Arbitration Committee's expressed wishes.</p>
<p>If you wish to contest my actions in this case, again, can it please not be done here, but rather on my talk page. <s>I also respectfully request that, if an oversight/arbitrator deems it necessary, that the revisions prior to my edit that had the information in this thread be removed from the history.</s> I hope I have everyone's understanding in this case.

<p>Slightly more than a content dispute, actually. Bad behavior is evident -- but not in the way RichardBennett claims. Here's RichardBennett's entire article edit history for March. Note the single subject and note especially the language in the edit summaries:</p>

<dd>My comments on the reverts of Calton's edits are honest in nature and mild in tone compared to his: "Been there, done that, got the t-shirt"; "What's this weird obsession with Google?" "Too bad, so sad". I have made substantial contributions to this article, and Calton has done nothing except revert my edits.

<dd>I looked at the links ONIH provided, regarding on-going content and citation disputes with AstroTrain. While I'm not thrilled with the IRA sig, I do think that this is not a fully 'good faith' submission of a problem, but rather a way for AT to distract ONIH from the disputes. I think that the 1916 is a perfect compromise, and the two should both be focusing on content. This is pretty much a showboating case of system gaming, not unlike Astrotrain's argument that since he can't see a copy of a book to verify it, it's not a clear reference, and shouldn't count. I support the 1916 signature compromise. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 07:03, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'll explain this one, in case anyone is curious. AMiB removed a whole bunch (read: 90% of the article) from the article of <a href="../../../t/i/b/Tiberium.html" title="Tiberium">Tiberium</a>. I asked him a bit about it, and it got heated. I explained my personal policy on how I edit articles. There was a fairly-large <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edit_war.html" title="Edit war">edit war</a> on the article while he deleted and I restored and tried to add some ad-hoc sources before he'd delete it all again. Once I did that, AMiB checked my user history and removed or moved long-lasting articles I've had a part of. Check the histories on the following articles if you're curious. <a href="../../../r/a/v/Ravnica.html" title="Ravnica">Ravnica</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concerned.html" title="Concerned">Concerned</a>, All the articles in <a href="../../../t/h/e/Magic%7E_The_Gathering_sets_40ab.html" title="Magic: The Gathering sets">Magic: The Gathering sets</a>, <a href="../../../c/y/b/Cybran_Nation_fdd9.html" title="Cybran Nation">Cybran Nation</a>, <a href="../../../a/e/o/Aeon_Illuminate_42f6.html" title="Aeon Illuminate">Aeon Illuminate</a>...

<dd>Yeah, I know.

<p>Jayjg stated "I'm going to nip this process in the bud by applying educational blocks to editors who falsely claim WP:COI in the future." I was specifically named in this context. Once the block is in place, I will have no means of raising my questions here.

<dd>Once a user has been informed of their misconception/misunderstanding, I believe that improper warnings are considered vandalism, as is gaming the system. So while "educational" may be a poor choice of words, preventing disruptions in the forms of maliciously or conciously misapplying policy for the purposes of, for example, pushing a point of view, whitewashing a target, attacking an editor as opposed to content, would all be valid <u>preventative</u> blocks.

<dd>I feel your anger, but disagree. There are reasons for us to require unblock requests to use the form {{unblock|reason here}} and no other form. That reasons are, <u>one</u>, so that admins don't have to hunt through kilobytes of talk just to <i>find</i> the request; <u>two</u>, it facilitates the administration of unblock reviews because it provides boilerplate closure text; <u>three</u>, it makes several rejected requests (i.e., {{<a href="../../../u/n/b/Template%7EUnblock-abuse_7a53.html" title="Template:Unblock-abuse">unblock-abuse</a>}}) easy to spot; <u>four</u>, we can expect people who have been blocked for disobeying our rules to at least conform to <i>this</i> rule if they want to be unblocked; <u>five</u>, it compels the blocked user to actually write an unblock rationale.</dd>
<dd>In addition, I think your shortening of the block was out of line and discourteous to the blocking admin, whom I had already contacted for comment, proposing essentially the same result that you unilaterally imposed. Our blocking procedures require unblocks to occur by admin consensus, except in obvious cases. I'd expect more respect for procedure from an administrator. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 20:36, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nah, I don't buy this. I am a frequent enough requests-for-unblock patroller to know what use that template is for. So: <u>one</u> you obviously had found the request already, or else you couldn't have answered it in the place you did. And, if you respond to a standard unblock, are you not going to read its context? Are you not going to try to make yourself a picture of what happened before and after the block? If there's a posting by a third party commenting on the block, are you not going to read it? (there were three or four, in this case). And when a fellow admin politely asks you explicitly to consider the request despite the lack of the standard template, are you going to ignore that admin's work? I even pointed you to the place where the request was; heck, I even gave you a link to a version of the page where the request did have the standard box. <u>two</u>To have provided your own copy of the standard boilerplate closure text would have been less work than writing out the response you did write (let alone having this discussion now). <u>three</u> You spot unblock abuse by reading the page history. <u>four</u> He did attempt to follow the rules; he was having a technical problem with formatting. <u>five</u> He did write out a rationale, and I told you where it was.</dd>
<dd>As for deciding this unilaterally, well, I did feel it had become a special case requiring special action. Besides, people had actually tried to contact the blocking admin; he had failed to notify the blockee in the first place and then failed again to rectify that when notified by a third party; then this morning I must have missed him by three minutes (he was active editing until three minutes before I wrote to him asking about that block). <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 20:48, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, it shouldn't have descended into an edit war to begin with, and discussion should have been had on the article's talk page. But your understanding of 3RR is slightly flawed: it only applies when the <i>same reversions</i> are made. If edits are different (such as the 4th edit you cited), then it is technically not a violation of 3RR. Note that that doesn't mean that a block for edit warring cannot be made — 3RR is not a guarantee that you are entitled to 3 reverts. But you were edit warring just as much as Smee. Also, you complained that an anon had readded a link that Smee had been warring to keep in the article, then when Smee REMOVED the link that he had warred to keep in, you accused him of making a 5th reversion, which is simply untrue. If, for example, Smee had made that edit rather than an anon, our policy <i>instructs</i> him to self-revert. Under your characterization of his edits, that would have been the equivalent of a fifth reversion, which is simply not true. Conclusion: stop edit warring, and let's discuss. Thanks. —<a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell"><b><font color="#555">bbatsell</font></b></a> <a href="../../../b/b/a/User_talk%7EBbatsell_7978.html" title="User talk:Bbatsell"><font color="#C46100" size="1">¿?</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bbatsell_a457.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bbatsell"><font color="#2C9191" size="3">✍</font></a> 20:51, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you for your input. I appreciate the input. I must disagree, though, about your understanding of <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>. Different material reverted is most definitely counted. Here is the applicable line, the second line and set in (for emphasis, I assume):

<dd>An editor <b>must not</b> perform more than three <a href="../../../r/e/v/Wikipedia%7ERevert_d321.html" title="Wikipedia:Revert">reverts</a>, <i>in whole or in part</i>, on a single page within a 24-hour period. A revert means undoing the actions of another editor, whether involving the same or different material each time.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>So clearly Smee was 4RR edit-warring when it I reported it and the only reason I bring up the 5th was to underscore that Smee still thought he could carry on reverting. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 21:10, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I don't think I agree with the change, and it contravenes what in my opinion has always been the basis of 3RR.

<p>I'd like to chime in here quickly with some advice for the original poster. I noted with concern your following choice of language:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>as I was already at 3RR</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Please keep in mind that reverts aren't "credits" that can be spent. If I've misinterpreted your text above, I apologize, but if not, please keep in mind that, as mentioned above, <b>discussion</b> is the key to successfully resolving disputes and co-editing on the project. If you find yourself counting reversions, then you're missing an opportunity to repair the root cause of the issue. Lobbying cannonballs back and forth, looking for people to gang up, that's just a road to stress and grief, and in a world where Steve Gutenberg is a movie star, don't we have enough already? - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChairboy_157e.html" title="User:Chairboy">C<small>HAIRBOY</small></a> (<a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChairboy_882d.html" title="User talk:Chairboy">☎</a>) 21:53, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you, you make a good point. To be honest, I just want to edit and if someone has a dispute with my edit then we can discuss. Smee has asked for 3rd opinions before after reverting my edits, and has been proven wrong before but that has not seemed to dissuade him from continuing to go after my edits. I just want 3RR to act as the buffer between an editor and a reverter that it seems to me to be intended to be and it will not be that buffer so long as it is selectively applied with Smee somehow exempted. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 22:06, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>These were not personal attacks, but facts. I had warned Atabek before not to repeat his false claims about me. Yet, he ignored my advice and continued to repead those false claims.

The more sophisticated trolling would be "I am a law enforcement officer engaged in an investigation, and am using the Wikipedia reference desk for my investigation", but unless Nocternal is really <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clancy_Wiggum_f8b8.html" title="Clancy Wiggum">Clancy Wiggum</a>, I don't buy it. &#160;;) (Also, technically he said that Guy was threating a law enforcement <i>office</i>, not an <i>officer,</i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJzG&amp;diff=113121193&amp;oldid=113103234" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJzG&amp;diff=113121193&amp;oldid=113103234" rel="nofollow">[45]</a> so I guess he's claiming to be the Barbados police station or something). <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheronJ_75b8.html" title="User:TheronJ">TheronJ</a> 22:16, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As the originator of the original complaint, I thought at first that it was a legal threat, but it occurred to me that he might be claiming that the actions of the person he has been making his comments about in the RD question is guilty of what he is charging on the User's talk page, and is not claiming that the User himself is guilty of those items.

<dd>Please be aware that many editors have been working on this today to achive NPOV. The article was edited to follow chronilogical order and to refer to Ryan by name as little as required (and not at all in the intro). Concensus was reached that this would prevent the article becoming a bio and we felt that this is preferable as the news is more about Essjay the editor than about Ryan the individual. Please bear this in mind as many of these edits have been removed in the last couple of hours. - Regards - <a href="../../../m/u/n/User%7EMunta_c522.html" title="User:Munta">Munta</a> 01:49, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I placed a notice on the users talk page about an AfD discussion, perhaps I acted prematurely. Just had some bad Wiki times lately I guess. Perhaps you could leave this thread open in case, there are some pretty blatant vandal edits in the history, could just be a kid based on an article created about a fifth grade teacher (deleted this morning) but the edits to the Enron stuff speak otherwise.<a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_mcmurray_93f4.html" title="User:A mcmurray">A mcmurray</a> (<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_mcmurray_aaf1.html" title="User talk:A mcmurray">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_mcmurray_ce89.html" title="Special:Contributions/A mcmurray">contribs</a>) 14:30, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That's the thing, the contrib history looks really weird, almost torn between being a vandal and being a serious contributor. It's odd. I am going to post a message on the user's talk page.

<dd>I placed a message on the user's talk page. Can their talk page be deleted if it isn't corrected? I am not really sure how that works, the guidelines and such seem a bit ambiguous (on purpose I assume to leave plenty of leeway for discretion) The user, however is obviously not a brigadier general nor have they been a member since 2006 far as I can tell by their contrib history. Is there a way to verify that?</dd>

Note as well that Lobster Blogster has also edited the Watford talk page, with a very similar comment to one Pogsurf left on articles before he was banned.

<p>There is borderline vandalism going on at <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> for several days now, with a problem editor who repeatedly blanks out the Norwegian flag with the listings of Svalbard and Jan Mayen from the list of regions within Europe, but refuses to account for this action on the discussion. In his latest edit summary, he said there is no need for him to discuss or explain his views because he is simply right and all the editors who revert him are wrong, so with one party refusing to come to the table for discussion, the edit war just drags on and on. What else can be done? <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 00:07, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well I say borderline because he may have some content dispute, but he isn't making it on the discussion page. I had to do my own investigation, and found the same editor has proposed the article <a href="../../../s/v/a/Svalbard_and_Jan_Mayen_cc13.html" title="Svalbard and Jan Mayen">Svalbard and Jan Mayen</a> for a deletion, so that sems to afford some clues, but when I asked him (via edit summary) to wait for the outcome of that afd, he replied (via edit summary) that it was "irrelevant"... As best as I can piece together from his summaries, his beef seems to be that because Norway considers them sovereign and fully integrated parts of Norway, there is no need to mention them at all in a list of geographic areas found within Europe. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 00:43, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A less attractive but possibly necessary alternative is to seek full protection at <a href="../../../r/f/p/WP%7ERFPP_fba0.html" title="WP:RFPP">WP:RFPP</a>, since it's an edit war involving registered users. <a href="../../../x/i/n/User%7EXiner_4ce3.html" title="User:Xiner">Xiner</a> (<a href="../../../x/i/n/User_talk%7EXiner_ca85.html" title="User talk:Xiner">talk</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Xiner_41d9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Xiner">email</a>) 01:06, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>I became involved in this fairly recently, but here is what I have seen. The problem is with <a href="../../../d/a/g/User%7EDagnabit_4aad.html" title="User:Dagnabit">User:Dagnabit</a>, who has removed or altered a number of references to the <a href="../../../s/v/a/Svalbard_and_Jan_Mayen_cc13.html" title="Svalbard and Jan Mayen">Svalbard and Jan Mayen</a> article, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ISO_3166-1_numeric&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=110679859" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ISO_3166-1_numeric&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=110679859" rel="nofollow">this</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_NATO_country_codes&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=110679905" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_NATO_country_codes&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=110679905" rel="nofollow">this</a>. While some changes (such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_double_placenames&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=111030385" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_double_placenames&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=111030385" rel="nofollow">[53]</a> this) may have been justified, the bulk of them are not, as they specifically refer to the ISO designation (and UN identifier) <a href="../../../s/v/a/Svalbard_and_Jan_Mayen_cc13.html" title="Svalbard and Jan Mayen">Svalbard and Jan Mayen</a>, and linking to the two separate articles is incorrect. In the case of the <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> article, it is a content question whether there should be a separate entry for "Svalbard and Jan Mayen" on the table, but Dagnabit appears to have refused to engage in any constructive conversation, merely claiming everything to be "nonsense", "vandalism", etc. Recently identical reversions (with incorrect "minor" designations and "vandalism" summaries) have been taken up by anonymous IP addresses, with the obvious implications. The article appears to have been recently sprotected by <a href="../../../g/n/a/User%7EGnangarra_faa9.html" title="User:Gnangarra">User:Gnangarra</a>, but the last reversion was by new user User:Notable sam, a single-edit account created 4 days ago, and thus just able to bypass the s-protection. I don't think full protection is needed right now, although it will be interesting to see if any other "sleeper" accounts show up.</p>
<p>If you look at the <a href="../../../s/v/a/Svalbard.html" title="Svalbard">Svalbard</a> history, this appears to be an ongoing editorial battle by the same individual, previous using accounts named User:Tapir2001 (the signature phrase "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Svalbard_Treaty&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=42982770" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Svalbard_Treaty&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=42982770" rel="nofollow">stop making up facts</a>").

<dd>Wow. Sometimes I disagree with policy, but that's because (1) keeping up with policy can be a full-time job in itself, so I just use common sense, &amp; (2) if I've made a serious mistake, I assume someone will follow behind me &amp; fix things -- just like people correct my typos &amp; misspellings. Saying that I'm going to take on the Wikipedia community over disagreement about various policy (rather than explain why I think they are wrong), is not helping the project; it's just being a troublemaker for its own sake. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 23:17, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The bull is right. In <i>Bull Durham,</i> if you hit the bull beyond the wall at the DAP (Durham Athletic Park), you get a free steak. "Scumbag" is a pejorative at best and a profanity most commonly. Even though it no longer has condom as its primary meaning, it is still, even in popular imagination, sexual profanation.

<dd>Regarding the fact that ALM isnt very succesful in his attempts to get the images of Muhammad deleted, I believe that there should be noting wrong with pointing that out that he is obviously angry about it, considering the fact that he himself has mentioned that he is willing to get "permanently banned" over that issue. He seems to be very emotional about the whole issue, but fact is that he should realize that we should include images according to policy, and not according to what conservative Islam believe is acceptable and not acceptable to include in our encyclopedia. -- <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarl_Meier_d697.html" title="User:Karl Meier">Karl Meier</a> 09:37, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It needs to be pointed out that ALM was right in that last incident. There had been no personal attack, the warning was bogus, and repeated reinstatements of the warning together with vandalism warnings over its removal were even more bogus. ALM had used the "kettle-pot" saying and accidentally misspelled "kettle" as "cattle". Everybody could easily have seen that was an innocent linguistic mistake. Besides, everybody is free to remove warnings from their talkpage any time, and edit-warring over their restoration easily amounts to harassment. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 10:35, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

My position on this is very clear, all wikiprojects by their very nature should be inclusive - any attempt to say that wikipedians of good standing cannot imput into their development of a project that affects the community should be stamped on and stamped on hard. Projects do not exist outside of the regular norms of the community and should not be allowed to try and enforce guidelines that are not in line with the rest of the community.</p>

<p>The situation is getting ridiculous. Southphilly, realising that everyone else is in favour of scrapping a coordinator and my cleanup edits to the page, has taken to simply reverting the page without edit summaries (previously he kept insisting I needed to hold a vote on every change I wanted to make). I encourage anyone reading this to read the talkpage and notice my reaching of consensus of both issues with a variety of editors to that page: Southphilly instead accused me of vandalism, and has repeatedly reverted me, even as everyone else was expressing support for what I had done. Until Evrik took his wikibreak, he was also doing the same thing, and has also blatently canvassed people against me and other editors. I am finding this very wearing, and I would appreciate it if an uninvolved administrator could please take a good look at this, as not only I, but three other editors have expressed their concerns that evrik and Southphilly are trying to <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">own</a> the project. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDev920_f8f8.html" title="User:Dev920">Dev920</a> (Have a nice day!) 16:41, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Good grief. It's a project for putting little decorations on other people's userpages -- I can only assume the purpose of this is to increase general morale and 'wikilove' -- and you're quibbling about who will be in charge? Give each other some awards, forget your concern for your own titles, eliminate the various levels of membership, and then get to the business of increasing wikilove. If you find this an important goal, pursue it; it certainly does not require a coordinator. Internal bickering wastes the community's time and distracts from your project's purpose. — <a href="../../../r/d/s/User%7ERdsmith4_389f.html" title="User:Rdsmith4">Dan</a> | <a href="../../../r/d/s/User_talk%7ERdsmith4_959f.html" title="User talk:Rdsmith4">talk</a> 17:47, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>(edit conflict with Kirill below)Can I please ask an administrator to actually review the talkpage in question. Saying " This is stupid, just remove the membership" is all very well, but one may notice that there is a bloody-minded determination on the part of southphilly and evrik to prevent me from doing just that. If I revert one more time to the consensus version (read the page and one will find I am right) I will be breaking 3RR, and I'm fed up with southphilly just going "no, it's vandalism", even when I point out that three other people at least agree with me against southphilly. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDev920_f8f8.html" title="User:Dev920">Dev920</a> (Have a nice day!) 18:10, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Wow. Far be it from me to criticize the idea of coordinators in general (although, honestly, why a twenty-member project that doesn't appear to actually <i>do</i> anything needs one, I don't know), but the behavior here is quite unseemly. WikiProjects should not try to fight the community at large; if people are concerned enough about your behavior to actively complain, it's a pretty good sign that you're doing something wrong. Trying to silence such criticism, or to insist that non-members (a silly distinction, in any case) have no voice, is utterly inappropriate. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 18:08, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ahem. The <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Awards_d569.html#Coordinator" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Awards">original discussion</a>, in which I had no part, made it utterly clear that the role of a coordinator was a opposed, and furthermore, when southphilly put evrik forward as a candidate, every subsequent editor opposed. Evrik appointed himself coordinator anyway. That wasn't being bold, that was upholding consensus. However, after an edit war, southphilly tried to get around my quite reasonable assertion that the coordinator section main page beared absolutely no relation to the discussion it was based on by holding yet another poll. My change of the poll was also to reflect objections that the poll was closed to non-members, even though it affects everyone who ever receives an award. If Evrik wants to participate, he can contribute to discussions like every other normal member instead of reverting everything he doesn't like. I, and everyone else, have no objection to that, what we object to are his attempts to rule the project. (accusing me of "hijacking" for the crime of actually editing?

<p>This is... odd. I respectfully suggest to all parties involved that perspective has been lost, and that they should pause to reflect upon 1) what the purpose of this WikiProject is, and 2) how it benefits the encyclopedia. Personally, I see no need for any sort of bureaucracy here, with so few participants, and it seems to me that rules and procedures are being developed for, essentially, their own sake, which is not a good thing. The amount of discussion about who is a member of which category of members, and what that category means, is puzzling, at best. I would even say it's against the wiki philosophy, and suggest a straightforward list of participants until and unless some need for a bureaucracy is clearly shown -- but again, personal opinion. However... attempting to exclude participation by non-members is a serious problem, and perhaps an indication that the project's lost its way. All good-faith editors' contributions are of equal merit, in theory -- any structure that discounts opinions presented in good faith because those editors are "outsiders" is cliquish and reprehensible. I also agree with Proabivouac that removing others' comments is not acceptable behavior. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 20:58, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Trying to look at this objectively, despite what Dev920 says, there was a general agreement that some coordination was needed, but there was no consensus on how to do this. I was nominated to coordinate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Awards&amp;oldid=107812084" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Awards&amp;oldid=107812084" rel="nofollow">here</a>, which I then <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Awards&amp;oldid=107822736" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Awards&amp;oldid=107822736" rel="nofollow">accepted</a>.

Is that consensus?</p>
<p>The next month, Dev920 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:WikiProject_Awards&amp;diff=111945235&amp;oldid=111944043" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:WikiProject_Awards&amp;diff=111945235&amp;oldid=111944043" rel="nofollow">summarily removes me</a>.

<p>There has been a lot of opinion about this whole thing, but there has been almost no <b>recitation of policy</b>. So I have five questions.</p>
<ol>
<li>Is there a policy about how a wikiproject determines who will lead or guide it (besides consensus)?</li>
<li>Is consensus achieved from lack of opposition? If so, how long does a question have to sit?</li>
<li>Is there a policy on the removal of such a person?</li>
<li>Is there a policy about polling people?</li>
<li>Is there a policy about who can vote in a poll?</li>
</ol>
<p>I thought I was nominated to be coordinator, and was <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. My concern at this point is that rather than build consensus among the project members, Dev920 just acted, without even building consensus. If you look at the history, Dev920’s consensus to act was an agreement of two users. This started over disagreements on how two awards were handled. It should be obvious that I agree with South Philly about process and vote stacking, and disagree with Dev920 – but I’d like to get some objective answers to the five questions listed above.</p>

<p>that I agree with South Philly about process and vote stacking - are you accusing editors of acting improperly in saying that the role of co-ordinator should be removed? why are they stacking votes? Why do you feel that normal wikipedia policies and guidelines do not apply to this project? You accept that it is standard wikipedia process that ANY editor can have a say about a project?</p>

<dd><i>Is there a policy about who can vote in a poll?</i> the answer is summed up in one sentence "wikipedia, the encylopedia anyone can edit". People get confused what wikiprojects are, they are just another set of community pages with a specific function, they work by the agreement of the those who share the goals of the wikiproject. However this is sometimes confused to mean that the people within the project have some special powers over the project pages - they don't. Those are community pages and thus South philly has ZERO authority to try and prevent any wikipedian in good standing, offering suggestions or saying "no this post of co-ordinator is not required". Membership of a project might be desirable to some but it is NOT required for a wikipedian to comment, offer suggestions or take part in any discussion that impact on wikipedia policy or process. Any attempts to prevent wikipedians having their say will be strongly resisted - the concept that only <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Awards&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=112809422" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Awards&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=112809422" rel="nofollow">special people get to vote</a> seems to me to against the spirit of the community (ARBCOM occupies a different space and purpose so the same does not apply there), As for removing the post - well the community is quite clearly saying "no it's unrequired" - that's all the policy that is needed. --<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFredrick_day_9590.html" title="User:Fredrick day">Fredrick day</a> 21:55, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is nonsensical. This project should either shape up or be deleted. Just my opinion, I just joined because I like the barnstars but was wary due to the nonsense above. You would think that WikiProject Coordinator was something to be bestowed a place of honor on one's resume.

<p>This is a wiki. We don't have coordinators. If someone takes a key role in something it is usually because they have unceremoniously taken on a huge responsibility, and continue in the role because they have the trust of the community. They often ask similarly trusted people to help them in their efforts. These people rarely throw their weight around (and if so, usually for a very good reason) and don't claim any special rights or powers. They operate under the <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECONS_36b2.html" title="WP:CONS">consensus guidelines</a>. They are basically grunts with respect. I distrust anyone who claims to coordinate anything. I admire people who quietly get work done and don't claim any special role. So I'd suggest that this coordinator battle be solved by abandoning the entire idea of a coordinator. -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuelWantman_9090.html" title="User:SamuelWantman">Samuel Wantman</a> 08:55, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well said, Samuel. Kirill is coordinator for WikiProject Military history because he puts in a lot of work; acknowledging his contributions with a title is the least we can do. From reading this thread, I'm not clear about what they've done to make this WikiProject a success. How about they simply stop this fighting &amp; just make some contributions? -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 22:42, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>WP:MILHIST is huge. They essentially want someone to... um, blame if something goes wrong.

<p>...right. Because evrik isn't posting on the awards page right now, and didn't just archive two awards.

<p>Hi, I would like to bring to your notice the noxious effect the user <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">User:Dbachmann</a> is having on Wikipedia. This user is a known to hold deep-seated prejudices against Hindus and Indians. His run-ins with Indian Wikipedia editors are well known.</p>
<p>This time, this user has gone ahead and created three redirect pages that link to Indigenous Aryan Theory page. The titles of the pages are</p>
<p>Hindutva revisionism <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hindutva_propaganda&amp;redirect=no" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hindutva_propaganda&amp;redirect=no" rel="nofollow">[178]</a></p>
<p>Hindutva pseudoscience <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hindutva_pseudoscience&amp;redirect=no" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hindutva_pseudoscience&amp;redirect=no" rel="nofollow">[179]</a></p>
<p>Hindutva propaganda <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hindutva_propaganda&amp;redirect=no" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hindutva_propaganda&amp;redirect=no" rel="nofollow">[180]</a></p>
<p><br />
As any mature reader can see, terms like revisionism, pseudoscience and propaganda are inherently disapproving and dismissive in nature. They give out negative vibes about the value of a theory even when used in isolation. To understand the unease they give to an average Indian reader, please try to substitute “Hindutva” word with Jewish or Christian, and try to feel the impact. If Wikipedia does not have any page like Jewish propaganda or Christian propaganda, why bestow this honor on Hindus?</p>
<p>This user, who amazingly is also an admin, has a long and winding history of offending Indians, which includes hurling choicest expletives at them. I would be interested in knowing if Wikipedia has any ideas to rein in this person.</p>

<dd>I don't know how it's an incident either. The "one as a sample" diff (<b>from 2005</b>) is an old acquaintance, it's the same old everlasting diff that always gets trotted out and misread against Dbachmann by the resident propagandists. "Curses all Indians in general with deeply offensive abuses", "Wikipedia is not for them (i.e. Indians)" is a ludicruos reading of it. Dbachmann has explained many times to the determinedly reading-impaired what he's really saying there, so it's hard to assume any good faith on the part of Sisodia and his sampling, and his unwillingness to "scratch old wounds" (I can't believe I read that phrase). Dbachmann is an excellent admin and editor, and as he says, he has been left alone to deal with these problems and to be subjected to the kind of mob talk seen above—"noxious effects on Wikipedia", indeed. Dbachmann, I'm not sure what kind of involvement you're calling for, though. How can I get involved, short of going to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion</a>, which hurts my soul&#160;? <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 10:48, 7 March 2007 (UTC).

<dd>Just one suggestion dab... if they're calling you things like a bigot, and you them some things equally unflattering, why not just deal with any of the other many matters here and stop with the confrontations? If your emotions are engaged on anything in these pages so far that you're willing to resort to intemperate language, it's a sure sign you need to let that page or pages be watched over by almost anyone else. Certainly counter name calling is over the top, never mind how provoked. At least yell for help here and get a few others involved. They simply don't pay us enough to act in any less measured manner. Save the emotion for the tasks that pay the rent, buys the new wheels, nice vacations, and puts the kids through good schools, not something that isn't going to change your retirement fund, save in negative ways. Best wishes, but letting that patrol go to someone else would be 'way overdue', from the looks of it. // <b><a href="../../../f/a/b/User%7EFabartus_bae5.html" title="User:Fabartus">Fra</a></b><a href="../../../f/a/b/User_talk%7EFabartus_c63e.html" title="User talk:Fabartus"><font color="green">nkB</font></a> 15:23, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>I am the person who raised the RfC aginst DBachmann. I was forced into this action because Dab refuses to be reasonable. One mediation effort failed last month (because of him). Dab refuses to participate in another mediation effort currently ongoing. The reason for RfC is that Dab has no respect for WP:ATT, he is publishing original research on Wikipedia. Removes OR tag or Fact tags without providing citations and in last 4 months I have yet to see a single citation from him that checks out. What he quotes in Wikipedia is different from what citied material says. If anyone has views different from him, they automatically get hate labels. He uses derogatory terms for published authors[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Out_of_India_theory&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=85677077" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Out_of_India_theory&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=85677077" rel="nofollow">[182]</a>]. He starts edit warring and then uses his admin power to block users in content dispute. All relevent details are at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Dbachmann_ebd2.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Dbachmann">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Dbachmann</a>.</p>
<p>My question to other admin is that does Dbachmann have exemption from following basic policies like WP:ATT.<a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbhushan_3b43.html" title="User:Sbhushan">Sbhushan</a> 18:12, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
The reason that 2005 diff is still doing the rounds is that the last known position of Bachmann on the issue was that he “does not see any need to apologize”. Otherwise I would have buried the matter long ago.</p>
<p>Anyway, forget that incidence. The matter that is getting sidestepped in this din is that why do there exist article titles like <b>“Hindutva pseudoscience” and “Hindutva propaganda”</b>, when no such articles exist for any other faith. Is it fair standard for an encyclopedia? Is it fair behavior for an admin? And lastly but not least, are you sure it does not violate any <b>anti-discrimination or anti-racial laws</b> of every country which accesses Wikipedia? <b>I think the matter is more serious than most people are thinking it to be.</b></p>

<dd>I restored the talk page comment before I was aware of this ANI thread. I don't see the comment as a legal threat. I see it as an argument that Wikipedia is on shaky ground by hosting certain types of images whithout following US law on things like age checks. Warning us about what the user perceives (rightly or wrongly) to be the natural consequence of our actions is a good thing, it is not a threat.</dd>
<dd>The user does not say they are filing legal action and they don't ask anyone else to do so. I think if they wanted to file a legal action they would just do it.

<dd>I respectfully disagree.

The user is inviting an unnamed "someone" to take a legal action against Wikimedia. The user is not posting a reference to a law in furtherance of his or her position on the matter, but merely stating that if someone files a complaint with the FL atty general, Wikipedia will be screwed. This clearly falls outside the accepted form of dispute resolution on Wikipedia. Most importantly, it functions to chill vigorous talk page debate on the subject by implying that a legal complaint could be filed if the image remains.

Er, sounds kind of threatening, especially since the editor is using the warning to try to force a particular outcome to a content dispute. Even though I agree with the editor about the utility of the image in that article, he's going about it the wrong way. We're not designed or equipped to handle questions of law on article talk pages.

<p><a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuck0_00fb.html" title="User:Chuck0">User:Chuck0</a> has been <a href="../../../c/h/u/User_talk%7EChuck0_348d.html#Personal_attack" title="User talk:Chuck0">warned</a> for writing personal attacks on various talk pages including his own talk page done in association with the revert and edit wars between User:Chuck0 and <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">User:Anarcho-capitalism</a> in the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism_in_the_United_States_65a7.html" title="Anarchism in the United States">Anarchism in the United States</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_anarchism.html" title="Social anarchism">Social anarchism</a> articles, waged on the claim from User:Chuck0 that anarcho-capitalism isn't a form of anarchism argumented by the counter claim from User:Anarcho-capitalism that it is a form of anarchy.</p>
<p>Furthermore the above is a mere incident in a greater whole. Endless philosophical debates that doesn't present any new arguments are being written all over the anarchy related talk pages regarding the disagreement whether or not anarcho-capitalism are to be represented among anarchy related articles based on viewpoints from various users debating such in articles like <a href="../../../a/n/a/Talk%7EAnarchism_and_anarcho-capitalism_6bec.html" title="Talk:Anarchism and anarcho-capitalism">Talk:Anarchism and anarcho-capitalism</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/a/Talk%7EAnarchism_e72f.html" title="Talk:Anarchism">Talk:Anarchism</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/a/Portal_talk%7EAnarchism_3389.html" title="Portal talk:Anarchism">Portal talk:Anarchism</a> addition to the above.</p>
<p>It has from what I can distinguish become a sitution with no ending in sight, making every anarchy page on wikipedia a battlefield between people of either the viewpoint that anarcho-capitalism is an anarchy and should be presented on various appropiate anarchy articles or those who don't think it is an anarchy and it shouldn't be represented on anarchy articles. Many people including me has become involved in this battle of what can probably be seen as POV pushing from both sides because of the obvious bias. People can not let go of the strong emotions that politics in the same way religion brings forward and which have become a problem for further editing articles.</p>
<p>I am seeking help to resolve this situation by maybe an administrator could perhaps arbitrary decide on how to further develope the articles in the upcomming future. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELordmetroid_b969.html" title="User:Lordmetroid">Lord Metroid</a> 12:26, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Wikipedia,</p>
<p>I accidentally added my URL to the bottom of the links list on many horse related sites. I did not know that this was illegal. All of these were done on the same day so I did not recieve a warning message from you until I had posted all of these. I have stopped since I recived the first message (as a result I ask that my site please not be placed on the blacklist) I am realy writing because I have recieved a nasty email from one of your users that was absolutely uncalled for.

<p>(edit conflicts; conform <a href="../../../r/j/a/User%7ERJASE1_c81d.html" title="User:RJASE1">RJASE1</a>)The link mexicanfood.about.com was added by <a href="../../../m/e/x/User%7EMexicanfood_e99f.html" title="User:Mexicanfood">user:mexicanfood</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pi%C3%B1a_Colada&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=112849741" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pi%C3%B1a_Colada&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=112849741" rel="nofollow">example addition</a>).

As a further explanation; I believe that the information can be incorporated into wikibooks (using {{<a href="../../../c/o/o/Template%7ECookbook_6266.html" title="Template:Cookbook">cookbook</a>}} here), which makes all these links to recipes unnecessary. Moreover, <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> gives the possibility to link to a linkfarm ({{<a href="../../../d/m/o/Template%7EDmoz_e80e.html" title="Template:Dmoz">dmoz</a>}}), which would in this case be better (unbiased; <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;q=Aguas+frescas&amp;sourceid=opera&amp;num=100&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;q=Aguas+frescas&amp;sourceid=opera&amp;num=100&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8" rel="nofollow">a google search on Aquas frescas gives 536,000 hits</a>).
