Besides that simple fact, the only other thing he is notable for is an incident in 1994 in which he drove over a girlfriend's lawn, broke in through a bedroom window, and got in an argument with her father, after which he drove off across the lawn. The event was notable enough to hit The Smoking Gun and has between <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22george+p.+bush%22+%22december+31+OR+31st%22+OR+%2231+december%22+OR+%22new+year%27s+eve%22+1994+-wikipedia+-encyclopedia&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22george+p.+bush%22+%22december+31+OR+31st%22+OR+%2231+december%22+OR+%22new+year%27s+eve%22+1994+-wikipedia+-encyclopedia&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">130</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22george+p.+bush%22+1994+-wikipedia+-encyclopedia&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22george+p.+bush%22+1994+-wikipedia+-encyclopedia&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">1300 Google hits</a>, but an individual on the talk page tells me that if I dare to put it in the article, the user, <a href="../../../c/u/c/User%7ECuchullain_f14f.html" title="User:Cuchullain">Cuchullain</a>, will "request arbitration". The text has been in the article for quite sometime, and only now is this user repeatedly deleting it. The fact that so new a user would refuse to discuss it any further, and instead go straight to "requesting arbitration" is not suprising, but I'm not sure how to handle this.

<dd>Speaking as an arb, I would think it just about certain it would be rejected at this stage. He's not <i>that</i> new - he's been doing lots of work on the wiki since February. Probably time for a bit of applied diplomacy, if you can think of some. e.g. don't start with saying he's pushing an agenda even if you think he is&#160;;-) I've left a note on the article talk page to this effect.</dd>

<p>Greetings. A user is using multiple accounts (over a dozen so far) to make the same reversion to <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraqi_insurgency.html" title="Iraqi insurgency">Iraqi insurgency</a>. When he is blocked for 3RR violation, he creates another account and goes again. Check out the page history. I've previously filed complaints at <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_in_progress_33dc.html#Possible_Sockpuppets" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism in progress">Wikipedia:Vandalism_in_progress#Possible_Sockpuppets</a> and <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_3RR_dc8f.html#User:Hesketh_Fortescue_and_related_sockpuppets" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/3RR">Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/3RR#User:Hesketh_Fortescue_and_related_sockpuppets</a>. (Please read that second link before blocking me or anyone else for violating the 3RR when reverting this user's changes - other admins have determined the sockpuppets' changes to be tantamount to simple vandalism, so the 3RR doesn't apply to those that revert him.)</p>
<p>Anyway, this user is nothing if not enthusiastic and diligent in his cause. I'm an admin, and I've blocked many of his incarnations, but I could use some help.

It was not at all relevant to the article, so I reverted it. I looked through his contributions, and saw that he had added that particular website to several articles, but had made no content-edits. It seemed likely that he was the poet in question, or at least that he was trying to increase traffic to a particular website. I began to remove them all – a laborious task. After a while, I noticed that <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrever_0f7d.html" title="User:Trever">Trever</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/e/User_talk%7ETrever_dd67.html" title="User talk:Trever">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Trever_b99b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Trever">contribs</a>) was busy replacing them. His name had a red link, so it looked as if the account was very recently created. I looked at his contributions, and saw that he was not only replacing the spamlinks, but was going to pages I had recently edited, and was undoing all my edits – even on a talk page, twice, where I was answering a question from another user <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Terri_Schiavo&amp;diff=27303926&amp;oldid=27299421" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Terri_Schiavo&amp;diff=27303926&amp;oldid=27299421" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Terri_Schiavo&amp;diff=27304302&amp;oldid=27304234" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Terri_Schiavo&amp;diff=27304302&amp;oldid=27304234" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, and another talk page where I had simply added the {{unsigned}} templage and removed a blank line <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Marcial_Maciel&amp;curid=1793279&amp;diff=27304482&amp;oldid=27242109" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Marcial_Maciel&amp;curid=1793279&amp;diff=27304482&amp;oldid=27242109" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. It seems fairly obvious that Trever is a sockpuppet for Oldstylecharm, and that they are both in violation of Wikipedia policy.</p>
<p>I sent a message to both usertalk pages alerting them to the policy on spam. I also sent a message to Trever, and he replied that he wasn't Oldstylecharm – <i>Guess what my name spelled backwards is?</i></p>

<dd>Surely it makes more sense for a developer to rename the accounts in question to more innocuous names. I know we're short of developer resources, but this wouldn't take a lot of skill (and isn't particularly urgent, since the names have been there for a while). I wouldn't mind upskilling a bit to do this myself. Where would I go to apply? I assume what would be required would be direct database access, ie ability to run read-write sql statements directly on the database. I realise this would require the highest level of trust from the community. Alternatively, a developer could write a script to rename a user, which first checks that the user has no edits (is that the case for all these abusive usernames?) or only a very small number of edits, and permission to run that script can be given to only a very small number of users.-<a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadfium_9104.html" title="User:Gadfium">gadfium</a> 23:03, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I also agree with what you say, Tony, but must (yet again) correct Duks mischaracterization. I've contributed edits to Wikipedia for <i>less</i> than 5 months. Not only have I never, to my knowledge, inserted copyvios, but I've also gone to great lengths to work with Duk to remove and properly rewrite what he considered questionable -- despite Duk's unwarranted personal attacks. As for "inserting copyvios for the last fourteen months," I believe Duk can verify (through the evidence on his User Talk <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Duk#Copyvio_and_derivatives.2C_in_Winter_Soldier_Article" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Duk#Copyvio_and_derivatives.2C_in_Winter_Soldier_Article" rel="nofollow">page</a>) that such a description fits TDC to a tee. I would appreciate it greatly, Duk, if you would refrain from the personal attacks. I can't imagine what beef you might have with certain Earthlink users, but quit trying to make me a part of it. 165.247.202.196 11:17, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, you are right - its not fair of me to assume that all the EarthLinks IP's tormenting this article for the last fourteen months are you. So let me re-state that Tony's comment about TDC can be equally applied to the other party (a group of EarthLink IP's that act in a similar way). Also, you can easily avoid these arguments by editing under a login. --<a href="../../../d/u/k/User_talk%7EDuk_82a4.html" title="User talk:Duk">Duk</a> 16:12, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Although it may not be fair to assume that it is the same individual EarthLink user, its a pretty safe bet considering that the same article has been in dispute with EarthLinks IP's for fourteen months, and that it was only until Duk stepped in and put an end to the most egregious copyvio issues that it partially ended. If I am going to be singled out for an edit war on this article, I wish that you would at least take into consideration that this anon has not allowed one single user to contribute or modify that article in any significant way. I should also point out that the edit war is not for lack of discussion on the talk page. <a href="../../../t/d/c/User%7ETDC_c89f.html" title="User:TDC">TDC</a> 21:54, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(edit conflict) A quick glance shows several different people warning Benapgar on the talk page. I don't see that the block is "out of line" at all. However, I'm not going to block a user based on looking at 2 minutes worth of evidence. I also don't feel too keen to block a user without warning them myself to cut it out, but that might make me an involved party too. I do not think the block should have been removed. The block isn't because of a content dispute, it's because of disruptive editing, unless you're suggesting that <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> is being misleading in his reasons given above. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 21:00, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As I said above and you've correctly identified, Benapgar earned his 24hr block for 2 weeks of disrupting that article, personal attacks, and ignoring multiple warnings. I'm not going to challenge Mirv's unblocking of him. But now that Benapgar is out of the pokey and a free man, I have a feeling we'll know soon enough whether I was right to block him for being chronically disruptive. <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 21:15, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(via EC) When the dispute is over behavior in regards to the content of an article, the difference between a content dispute and a behavioral dispute becomes blurry. I'm concerned that an admin who was one of the major parties to the dispute lacks the distance necessary to distinguish the two; if someone who wasn't involved in the dispute thinks the behavior merits a block, they'll hear no objection from me. —<a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">Charles&#160;P.</a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User_talk%7EMirv_53de.html" title="User talk:Mirv">&#160;<small>(Mirv)</small></a> 21:16, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can live with that. If other's aren't comfortable that I'm objective or detached enough to make a rational judgment, who am I to tell them they are wrong? There's also the appearance of being vindictive, since I was the target of much of Benapgar's wrath, that is an issue too. My only concern is dealing effectively with chronically abusive and disruptive editors. If it troubles others that I'm involved, then someone else will need to deal with this situation or it will spiral out of control, as his edits since his unblocking indicate. <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 21:29, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Two things: involved admins should never block — even if the block is warranted, it creates the image of an admin blocking out of spite. (And I haven't reviewed this case.) Two: isn't there a current ArbCom case regarding this? Why not let them sort it out?

<dd>Why do so many admins in a conflict-of-interest situation like this insist on besmirching their own reputations by blocking people they're in a dispute with? It doesn't take too much effort to post a note here asking for someone else, someone <i>outside</i> the dispute, to examine the situation and impose a block if it's called for.</dd>

<p>My question about <a href="../../../b/g/c/User%7EBGC_d645.html" title="User:BGC">BGC</a> (<a href="../../../b/g/c/User_talk%7EBGC_52ff.html" title="User talk:BGC">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BGC_6339.html" title="Special:Contributions/BGC">contribs</a>) and his non-fair-use of fair use images was archived before anything could come of it. Kelly Martin posted agreeing that the use wasn't fair under fair-use conditions, but nothing else happened. As things stand, then, BGC is adding these images to a whole range of articles (as are others, I imagine). All that I can do is to remove them, but as BGC simply reverts my removal, I'm engaged in a slow-moving edit war with no obvious way out. The template that includes them (which hasn't been adopted by the Albums Wikiproject) was nominated for deletion, but there was no consensus (thanks to a large number of editors who had no interest in the fair use issue, but thought that the template looked pretty).</p>
<p>Someone managed to get him to stop him calling my removal of the images vandalism in his edit summaries, but that's purely incidental; could someone who knows what they're talking about speak to him about fair use, and explain the problem with what he's doing? As for <a href="../../../a/l/b/Template%7EAlbum_infobox_2_1549.html" title="Template:Album infobox 2">Template:Album infobox 2</a>, as it innvolves the non-fair use, what can be done about it? --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 18:53, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Fix the infobox to exclude the disputed stuff and put a request on <a href="../../../r/f/p/WP%7ERFPP_fba0.html" title="WP:RFPP">WP:RFPP</a>. When the infobox is protected, then he can be educated.

<p>I am a little perplexed. Clearly Mel feels strongly about this but the template with the images survived a recent attempt at deletion <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplates_for_deletion_Log_Not_deleted_October_2005_c234.html#Template:_Album_infobox_2" title="Wikipedia:Templates for deletion/Log/Not deleted/October 2005">Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion/Log/Not_deleted/October_2005#Template:_Album_infobox_2</a>. Even many of the "delete" votes said they were skeptical of the claim that the images violated fair use but were voting to delete the template for other reasons. Many commercial sites use thumbnails to send users to pages describing the product in greater detail. Although I'll admit that I did not get an "A" in <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_R._Miller_1d6e.html" title="Arthur R. Miller">Professor Miller's</a> copyright class when I took it many years ago, I have dealt with fair use for my clients a few times over the years and this does not seem to me to even be a very close question. Besides, I would think the record companies would be happy with the use even if it did exceed fair use. Whether <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> is right that this use violates the Wikipedia fair use guideline is a different question. We are certainly free to have guidelines that are more restrictive than the law requires. However, on <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">WP:FU</a> (which remember is a guideline and <i>not</i> policy) I could see nothing specifically prohibiting the use as a navigational aid. The most directly applicable provision under the section labeled "Policy" states "The material must contribute significantly to the article (e.g. identify the subject of an article, or specifically illustrate relevant points or sections within the text) and must not serve a purely decorative purpose." Although I would argue that the use as a navigational aid is by no means "purely decorative", the use also does not appear to "contribute significantly to the article". In any event, this doesn't seem so clear cut that Mel should be unilaterally deleting images in a "kept" template where there was no consensus on the position he sought. -- <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> <a href="../../../d/s/1/User_talk%7EDS1953_dfdb.html" title="User talk:DS1953"><sup>talk</sup></a> 20:47, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have just posted a message to User talk:BCG insisting that he refrain from this edit war for one week and I have told him he will be blocked if he does not. I take no position on which template should be used, but I feel since the <a href="../../../a/l/b/WP%7EALBUM_17fd.html" title="WP:ALBUM">WP:ALBUM</a> guidelines advocate a particular template, the burden is upon BCG to build concensus for a change to exisiting guidelines and address the concerns of those who disagree. He has also exacerbate the war through personal attacks and inappropriate edit summaries and made little substantive effort to engage in dialogue on this issue and related ones. This edit war has gone on long enough and should not be allowed to continue. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 00:59, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you go to its port 80, you can see a <a href="../../../c/p/a/CPanel_3fbf.html" title="CPanel">cPanel</a> page. It'a a webhost, which means that it's almost certain to be a CGI proxy. Unless you find the exact URL for the CGI (which is quite hard to do), you do not have a proof. The main problem is that such hosts serve a number of domains, and it's hard to find them given only the IP address (however, given the domain name, finding the offending CGI tends to be easier).

<p>This article may be inflammatory but speedy deletion is inappropriate. Funny how much anti-Americanism there is on Wikipedia, but the merest hint of anti-French sentiment causes such massive dismay. Put it on AfD and let the appropriate policy prevail. Let's see all of the inclusionists come out of the woodwork to support this. If somebody wants to list it on AfD, I'll vote delete due to it being an nn website, but speedy deletion because it's a vandal magnet isn't the right way to go. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 04:50, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>As admitted by himself, Ryan Delaney has willfully broken the protection policy because he dislikes me as a person. At the same time he made a personal attack: "To this, I plead guilty as charged; I did willfully ignore that part of the blocking policy, and I ignored it because I felt the situation called for me to do so. Rather than revert while protecting, I could have waited for someone else to revert, and then protect the article, and in so doing avoid all appearance of impropriety: but I feel that would not have been necessary. Ultramarine is one of the most stubborn, persistent, and arrogant Wikipedia editors I have encountered." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard%2FIncidents&amp;diff=27318647&amp;oldid=27311423" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard%2FIncidents&amp;diff=27318647&amp;oldid=27311423" rel="nofollow">[36]</a></p>
<p>He has now in addition twice protected without request and without giving an explanation<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticisms_of_communism&amp;diff=27755996&amp;oldid=27755572" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticisms_of_communism&amp;diff=27755996&amp;oldid=27755572" rel="nofollow">[37]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Democratic_peace_theory&amp;diff=27654517&amp;oldid=27646835" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Democratic_peace_theory&amp;diff=27654517&amp;oldid=27646835" rel="nofollow">[38]</a> <b>after</b> becoming involved in the RfA about the articles <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Ultramarine/Evidence&amp;diff=27254257&amp;oldid=27250095" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Ultramarine/Evidence&amp;diff=27254257&amp;oldid=27250095" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>.</p>
<p>He also seems to think that he owns articles he has protected. Other administrators must ask him before unprotecting an article he protected 8 days earliier <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Criticisms_of_communism&amp;diff=27755952&amp;oldid=27755073" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Criticisms_of_communism&amp;diff=27755952&amp;oldid=27755073" rel="nofollow">[40]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticisms_of_communism&amp;curid=2245681&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticisms_of_communism&amp;curid=2245681&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[41]</a>.

<dd>Android, would you consider multiple daily reverts for weeks on end without discussion or justification to be vandalism? (Also, many of the 'friends' are suspected sockpuppets, though I can't confirm that, and it may be a case of astroturfing.) POV warring with honest debate is one thing; this seemed over the top, but I wasn't sure I'd be justified in calling it vandalism, which is why I never blocked a logged-in user (except for 24 hours for violating 3RR).</dd>

<dd>Multiple daily reverts of the same material in the same article against consensus: that I would classify as vandalism, though others might disagree. Since 70.whatever appears to be a static IP (indeed, this seems to have been going on for months) escalating blocks are certainly in order (24 hours the first time, 48 hours the next, etc.)</dd>
<dd>In any case, since you appear to be involved in not only "policing" the <a href="../../../u/r/d/Urdu.html" title="Urdu">Urdu</a> article, but also contributing to it, it would be best if another admin handled the blocks for 3RR and for vandalism except in extreme cases. I'll add <a href="../../../u/r/d/Urdu.html" title="Urdu">Urdu</a> to my watchlist and help out when I can. (Who knows, maybe I'll learn something about the language.)

<dd>Thanks for helping out. I probably have been getting too close, though I had no personal interest in the subject, at least at first. If I remember right, I started out policing the article, but then tried making compromise edits to resolve the dispute. Almost succeeded, too - the only point in dispute currently is the classification, where an editor (JusticeLaw) refuses (or has been refusing) to accept the universal view held by linguists, but can offer no contrary evidence. He had been reverting daily until recently, though he has been engaging in some minimal discussion. <a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwamikagami_11b6.html" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> 06:31, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I considered unblocking when I saw that the user had been active for a bit over a week, but I'm leaving the block in effect because the user has found the need to criticize users for "violating NPOV", and had a "hit list" of sorts on his user page. I also question the need for a name like "NPOVenforcer", which is inflammatory at best, and makes it sound like the user actually has some sort of authority to enforce NPOV. If any admin disagrees, I have no problem with unblocking, but please make a post here or on my talk page indicating that you have done so. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> <a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315">(talk)</a> 06:06, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think in general it's a bad idea for users to play at invoking Wikipedia rules or principles in their usernames. Some time ago, there was a user who called him/herself User:I'm4aNPOV and set off some fireworks on the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology.html" title="Scientology">Scientology</a> articles. That user changed their name after being asked to, so it wasn't an issue of blocking. <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUsername_0c30.html" title="Wikipedia:Username">Wikipedia:Username</a> discourages people from choosing names <i>"such as</i> recent changes<i>,</i> Administrator<i>, or any other part of the interface or commonly used terms on Wikipedia."</i> But perhaps "NPOV" should be specifically mentioned ...

<dd>For example, I requested that you specify what was wrong with what was visible on the article, and instead of giving particulars, which would have been an appropriate response, you pointed to vague references to "improper capitalization, lack of linking, poor punctuation", which was an inappropriate response to a request for details.

<dd>Similarly, <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> asked you to be "more explicit than "poor punctuation"". Instead of doing as he requested, you demanded that, as he "cannot recognise what is wrong with the article as it stands" (sic), he return the <i>clean up</i> tag immediately and then that he "leave rectification of the problems and removal of the tag to someone who can" (sic). In this, you still gave no justification for your demands, but instead poured scorn on <i>Nunh-huh</i> for apparently not being smart enough to see what <b>you</b> could see. <i>Nunh-huh</i> then asked for a more robust explanation of what you thought was wrong with the article.

<dd>How are people supposed to know what you consider is wrong with the article, if you don't supply any explicit information? You seem to think that everyone should know exactly what you are referring to, without giving any examples. If you <b>have</b> seen faults with the article, why have you not tried to fix up the problems yourself?

<p>Can an admin please attend to <a href="../../../r/o/o/Rootkit.html" title="Rootkit">Rootkit</a> which either needs to be a redirect to <a href="../../../r/o/o/Root_kit.html" title="Root kit">Root kit</a> or, according to the consensus, <a href="../../../r/o/o/Root_kit.html" title="Root kit">Root kit</a> needs moving to rootkit.

<li>Indefinite blocking surely is out of bounds, but I don't see why short blocks for something which is clearly a violation of policy (of which he was repeatedly informed) should be any problem. I'd support a 24 hour block, when he repeats when unblocked increase the length to 48, etc. And keep telling what he should be doing to fix things. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 10:35, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>There are precidents for indef blocks (not perma-blocks) by admins in such instances. If a user is <i>continuously</i> engaged in a problematic action -e.g. mass creating non-vandalism but speediable articles, or, in the instance I recall, uploading massive amounts of orphan images with no obvious use. And if the editor is unresponsive to questions or requests to desist. I've seen admins block indef, not as a punishment but 'to get their attention', with a clear message on the user page that the block will be immediately lifted if the user <i>either</i> promises to desist, OR enters into a dialogue about the appropriateness of his actions. Such blocks do not seem to be policy, but they seem useful and rational - when we are met with continued problematic behaviour and a refusal to discuss (DR is pointless with a silent party). <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><sup>ask?</sup></a> 11:31, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>There's not pressure form me for these decisions to be reversed, just discussed. For my benefit as much as anything. Although I also notice notice now that the talk pages are empty, too.<br />

<li>I'd say it's a good call on all three of them. The Fisker deletion debate seems to have consensus for delete, but the rewritten version doesn't resemble (and is far better than) the stub that was nominated, so this was a good catch for the cleaner-upper. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 12:46, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'll second that. Diary- consensus delete (don't count the socks), Fisker- good catch on a cleanup, and NSBI- 66% (consensus, though it's borderline) delete. Good work.--<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScimitar_bbe8.html" title="User:Scimitar"><font color="navy">Scïmïłar</font></a> <a href="../../../s/c/i/User_talk%7EScimitar_c843.html" title="User talk:Scimitar"><sup>parley</sup></a> 14:51, 10 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>On Fisker, would extending the discussion or pinging the participants not have been a bit safer? (I've changed the title of this section as this was never a dispute <i>per say</i>. We should be able to talk about this stuff without it being a dispute.)<br />

<li>I think you should have closed the Fisker AfD with a <i>no consensus</i> rather than a <i>keep</i> outcome, but given that the action in each case is the same, it's a technicality. --- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 22:00, 16 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Since the outcome is keep where there is no consensus, it's probably misleading to distinguish keep from no consensus--it falsely implies that there's a material difference between decision to keep and absence of decision to delete. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 22:09, 16 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I believe it's misleading <i>not</i> to make that distinction. A "no consensus" should not be disguised as a consensus of any kind. Maybe there's little practical value in making the distinction, altho to me, a "keep" means the article probably shouldn't be Afd'd again, while "no consensus" does not mean that. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 22:14, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The truth is that "Moldovan" doesn't exist. It's about <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanian.html" title="Romanian">romanian</a> with a different name. The fact is that is identical with romanian. Romanian is a latin language like french, italian, spanish, portuguese. The Soviet propaganda and the russians experts since 1812 tried to make a difference on political reasons.

<p>User: Blasphemous was blocked a long time ago for a) using an offensive username and b) for being allegedly a sock puppet of a User Noah Peters who in turn had several Arb Comm cases for things I do not remember. I was the last one admin involved in blocking that particular sock puppet.</p>
<p>I initially protected the talk page documenting this, then blanked it at a "noahp"'s request and protected it again. I keep though getting increasingly annoying emails by said "noahp" who wants me to unprotect the (now blanked) talk page. I do not want to enter a dialogue as I prefer to keep my email address private, but I am also rather clueless now just what would be the rigt thing to do - and I am nowadays so infrequent on WIkipedia that I have no time (or even starting point) to figure what polices might apply. My bottomline is that the user Blasphemous was banned for good and his talk+user page should either be deleted (dt offensive username) quite irrespective of any going-ons of Noah Peters and sockpuppetry or not, but this might be a wrong understanding. Any advise by fellow admin's is welcome. <a href="../../../r/e/f/User%7ERefdoc_5ef2.html" title="User:Refdoc">Refdoc</a> 15:33, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

We are a wiki, and protection is harmful to <i>everyone</i>, even the ones being good.

<dd>Ryan Delaney violated policy by deciding which was the right version and reverting to it. This is the type of policy violation which gives the impression of abuse of powers, probably because it is an actual abuse of powers. Carnildo thinks he is clever by citing the dismissive and mocking "The Wrong Version", but this is just the type of abusive behavior that "The Wrong Version" implies doesn't really exist or is just a matter of point of view. Ryan's behavior is an outright violation of policy, that I doubt "The Wrong Version" intended to take lightly. His behavior is an embarrassment. I tried to find the archive of his adminship vote, to see if he pledged not to abuse his powers. Hubris and adminship do not mix well.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 09:32, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I never requested desysop'ing, and don't mistake persistance in pointing out hypocrisy and abuse for screaming. I wouldn't think more than a block for a couple days would be in order even if he refuses to correct his abuse. Protecting the article was a judgement call, I think it was unnecessary, but I can accept differences in such judgement calls. However, his revert was completely in violation of protection policy and was a POV prejudgement of the ARBCOM result. I'd be satisfied if he would put the article back in the version that he should have left it in. If he refuses to do so, then another admin should either perform the revert to the version that was in place at the time of the protection, or remove the protection completely and block Delaney, perhaps for 48 hours (this is more serious than a 3RR). Although if the admin just took the proper action in regard to the article, and did not block Delaney unless he put up a fuss. That would at least correct the violation that has been done. The only reason I can see for demanding more severe action is if Ryan resists attempts to correct his mistake in judgement, or if he himself stated when he was soliciting votes for his adminship that he would hold himself to a higher standard, such as never abuse his powers. While Ryan's actions represent an abuse of the powers entrusted to him, this does not approach the extent and severity of abuses that resulted in 172's last arbcom case for instance. What is really disappointing is the deference and failure to correct his actions not only by him, but by the admin community as a whole.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 13:51, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The article was reverted back and forth between the two versions 6 times in the 24 hours prior to protection. As such, I do not believe it was in the least bit relevant which particular version happened to be on top at the precise moment of protection. Delaney could have simply waited a few more hours until the next inevitable revert. Or he could have tossed a coin to decide which version to protect. For all we know, maybe he did. I am no fan of protection myself, but your request that Delaney must "put the article back in the version that he should have left it in" seems little more than a thinly veiled demand to see the article protected with The Right Version on top. -- Mihnea Tudoreanu 20:00, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're right, it shouldn't have mattered which version was on top, but it did to Delaney, so he should not have been the one to impose protection, and he should not have reverted to the version he wanted. He abused his powers. I take it from what you say, that you would have no problem if the page was reverted to the version that he should have left in place at the time he imposed protection.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 22:25, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Blocking is preventative, not punitive. Requesting a block for an isolated instance of behavior of this type is a non-starter, especially since so much time has passed. <i><b><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a></b></i><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="green">ndroid</font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="purple">79</font></a> 22:40, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm not really sure if this warrants a response, but just so it's perfectly clear to anyone who may be confused, here's why Silverback's objection about my violation of the blocking policy is entirely baseless. Silverback charges that I violated the blocking policy by reverting away from <a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltramarine_4c33.html" title="User:Ultramarine">User:Ultramarine</a>'s preferred version in a content dispute over <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticisms_of_communism.html" title="Criticisms of communism">Criticisms of communism</a>. This is the relevant point of the <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">Wikipedia:Blocking policy</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Admins should not protect pages which they have been involved with (involvement includes making substantive edits to the page or expressing opinions about the article on the talk page). Admin powers are not editor privileges—admins should only act as servants to the user community at large.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Silverback is perfectly correct in his assertion that admins should not use protection to preserve their preferred versions of articles in content disputes. However, I did not revert away from Ultramarine's version because I preferred the content in the other version: <b>because I have not read either version</b>. I have no idea which version has the better content, nor do I particularly care to. I have never edited that article for content and I haven't the slightest interest in doing so. It is quite literally impossible for this page protection to be anything but an effort to end a stale revert war of epic proportions. This brings us to the second point.</p>
<p>Silverback makes a more substantive claim, which is that I ignored this part of the blocking policy:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>In addition, admins should avoid favoring one version of the article over another, unless one version is vandalism.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>To this, I plead guilty as charged; I did willfully ignore that part of the protection policy, and I ignored it because I felt the situation called for me to do so. Rather than revert while protecting, I could have waited for someone else to revert, and then protect the article, and in so doing avoid all appearance of impropriety: but I feel that would not have been necessary. Ultramarine is one of the most stubborn, persistent, and arrogant Wikipedia editors I have encountered. I found no justification for protecting his preferred version simply because it was the version that happened to be up at the time. If another administrator feels that I was in the wrong about this, I welcome them to revert to Ultramarine's version, but I strongly urge you to leave the article protected. --<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_Delaney_f359.html" title="User:Ryan Delaney">Ryan Delaney</a> <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyan_Delaney_8333.html" title="User talk:Ryan Delaney"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 03:45, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Thanx 172, you make my point. Note, that the words you pick out as a personal attack, were mirroring the same words Ryan had used in the passage above. If Delaney keeps this up he may rival an abusive ex-admin in those qualities. And you're right, the situation is very similar to that precipitated the RfC and arbitration case. I try not to let abusive behavior pass without notice. Just as in my response to your abuse, I have made several attempts to resolve this dispute with Delaney. And just as in your case, instead of a mature acknowledgement and retraction, he has tried to spin his behavior, justifying his abusive means, in order to achieve his ends. --<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 09:22, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><i>(I'm trying to respond to Silverback's penultimate comment—Silverback, your moving Carnildo's post out of chronology isn't making it easier to keep this tidy.)</i> Oh, c'mon, why do you want two threads? What's the attraction? The heading of the second one was ridiculous. Please note that even the shortened heading I've retained remains the longest heading on this page. And please note that you posted both your threads immediately underneath the edit mode exhortation: "New entries go down at the *BOTTOM* of the page, not here."

<dd>I didn't move Carnildo's post, I had an edit conflict with him when responding to your post, and so I moved my post and maintained the cronology via indents as is my practice. The attraction is to make sure admins know that this is a second violation. I looked at the intro and didn't see any instructions on where to add it, and since some pages instruct to add at the top, that is what I did. I admit I was confused about that. --<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 03:08, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have deleted the page Brandy January. It appeared to be a lengthy diatribe directed against a Georgia high school teacher, levelling various accusations of deceit and inappropriate behaviour. I deleted the page because the content was defamatory and posted by anonymous editors, and because the individual in question appears not to be particularly noteworthy. Although I could probably stretch CSD A7 to cover this article, I've left a notice of my action here for review. (As far as I know no one has complained about it.)

<p>If there's an admin around at the moment, could he/she please take a look at TerrorMaker (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TerrorMaker_1383.html" title="Special:Contributions/TerrorMaker">contribs</a>) This may relate to a recent incident which I reported <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=27307278" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=27307278" rel="nofollow">here</a> As a result of that, <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldstylecharm_4f0b.html" title="User:Oldstylecharm">User:Oldstylecharm</a> was blocked indefinitely, and the two probably sockpupets were also blocked indefinitely. Oldstylecharm was, I understand, unblocked at the request of Jimbo. I don't know if he has anything to do with it, but this new account certainly seems to have been created for the purpose of harrassing me, and the message is identical to one that sockpuppet <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrever_0f7d.html" title="User:Trever">Trever</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/e/User_talk%7ETrever_dd67.html" title="User talk:Trever">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Trever_b99b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Trever">contribs</a>) sent me <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ann_Heneghan&amp;diff=27305811&amp;oldid=27213666" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ann_Heneghan&amp;diff=27305811&amp;oldid=27213666" rel="nofollow">[50]</a>. It could be someone new, copying an old message sent be a previous abuser, or it could be the same person. As far as I know, the reason Oldstylecharm was unblocked was because he apologized nicely. I've no problem with that.</p>
<p>I can live with a silly but non-threatening message on my talk page, and I don't really want to waste my own energy and Wikipedia server space by edit warring. But could an admin take a look at that account please? Thanks.</p>
<p>And on an unrelated matter, how about taking a look at No no (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_No_no_6443.html" title="Special:Contributions/No no">contribs</a>) (hint, Jarlaxle?) as well? Ann Heneghan <sup>(talk)</sup> 11:28, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><a href="http://www.geobytes.com/IpLocator.htm?GetLocation" class="external text" title="http://www.geobytes.com/IpLocator.htm?GetLocation" rel="nofollow">Geobytes</a> says that this IP is not a proxy. If it is AOL, can that be so?</li>

<dd>I've found that AOL, especially when using IP 172.......etc. that whenever they log in and out, they get a new IP...and it is not unlikely that that User:172.198.168.71 has had a series of vandalisms with an almost unlimited supply of random IP's available to them. That IP originates from Sterling, VA I believe so there could also be many thousands of users that log in anon with AOL and also get the IP starting 172.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 01:51, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>As one who sometimes edits via AOL, I can tell you that you get a new IP not just every time you log in or out, but with every separate URL you visit. Viewing two differetn pages uses two different IPs, and editing one of them will use yet another IP -- always the same IP for the same URL during a session, AFAICT, although this assocation seems to change after one loggs off AoL and logs back on. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 01:56, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

It was bad, but not so bad that it was clear whether it was vandalism. So I went to his contribs to see if he were engaging in actual vandalism. He'd made some edits after the one to ID, so I checked them and found a non-wikified copyvio. I cleaned it up and posted about it on his talk page, and added his talk page to my watch in case he replied to me there. When I saw edits by him on his talk page, I found something disturbing. There were no posts by Advonet, and when I checked the history I found he had made 3 edits to a post by User:Lucky_6.9, changing content, heading (title) and date stamp. I notified Lucky_6.9 via email, but have not received a response.

<p><a href="../../../r/o/k/User%7ERokeaj_db0a.html" title="User:Rokeaj">User:Rokeaj</a> keeps blanking his talk page, where I had written a warning after he vandalised <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> by moving it into Microsuck. He has since stopped his vandalism to the Microsoft article, but keeps removing the warning from his talk page, and when I revert his blanking, he accuses me of abusing my <i>AdministrativePower®</i>. Although the vandalism warning is no longer acute, I feel it should remain on his talk page, so that everyone on Wikipedia would be able to see what experience others have had with Rokeaj in the past. Removing comments from one's talk page (without archiving them) is, in my point of view, an attempt of altering history, and is thus tantamount to forgery or cheating. At the moment we're locked in a revert war. This can't continue forever, so I ask other admins' opinion here.

<li>That I disagree with. He certainly can't do <b>anything</b> he wants.

<p>Rokeaj has since moved my comments to User talk:Rokeaj/Trolls, where he calls me and <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESean_Black_d709.html" title="User:Sean Black">User:Sean Black</a> trolls. The reason why he calls me a troll is because I reverted his blanking of his talk page <b>after</b> he received my warning and stopped vandalising. The reason why he calls Sean Black a troll is simply because he also reverted Rokeaj's blanking. (I reverted the page four times - Sean Black reverted it once, and yet he also gets called a troll.)

<p>Archived a bunch once more. Would people agree that it's a good idea to use <b>subpages</b> for each issue on ANI, because this page is constantly over 100 kb in size. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 17:37, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>What I mean is WP:AN/Possible Scottfisher sock, WP:AN/Tmayes1999 blocked, WP:AN/202.50.90.10, etc. Then transclude those into the main page(s) AN and ANI. That way, it's easier to edit and to archive (which this page is always in need of) <i>and</i> you can watchlist particular issues. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 18:07, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Correction: and you would <i>have</i> to watchlist every single particular issue.

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The downside with transclusion is that you'd <i>have</i> to watchlist the subpages to see any changes. Right now, all I have to watchlist is AN, AN/I and AN/3RR in order to see any changes. If I'm offline for a while, I can check the history of any of those pages with one click and see what section was edited. I'm also concerned about newbies have difficulty posting a new issue. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 18:17, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Just archive more frequently. Move excessively long discussions to subpages if there is no strong objection from those involved to doing so. Transclusion for every issue would make watching ANI difficult. <i><b><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">a</font></a></b></i><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="green">ndroid</font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="purple">79</font></a> 19:24, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Okay, that is a good point. How would it be to have one subpage per day (listing all issues that <i>started</i> that day) transcluded all on the main page? We could even employ a bot to automatically unlist any day page that hasn't been edited in, say, a week. As a aside point I have never watchlisted ANI, I just assume it sees a heck of a lot of changes and visit it frequently. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 23:46, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>it was four in <i>just over</i> 24 hours. Not a 3RRvio. Since Angr brought the matter here, any admin reading this is free to unblock Nixer, no questions asked. If none does so, we can reasonably say the block has community support. Note that Nixer has a long history of trolling IE pages. Anyway, if you go ahead and unblock, neither Angr or I will reblock him. I didn't do the block myself because I have a strong inhibition of blocking where I'm involved, and I couldn't be bothered to run to an uninvolved admin.

<p>I would like to express my opinion that when one has not violated any rules, and administrators are not explicitly authorised to "invent" rules of their own after the "transgression" has been committed, a retrospective penalty cannot and should not be imposed.

Yes, it is not perfectly clean, Angr being involved, that's why we brought it here! If any uninvolved admin would like to unblock then reblock him, feel free. And again, if any admin at all feels that Angr was acting wrongfully, feel free to unblock him too.

<p>I see; I just wasn't aware that administrators are not bound by Wikipedia's policies and possess a right of <b>discretionary</b> blocking to be used against users who have not violated any rules. I was just pointing out how neatly everything fell into place: Nixer was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3ANixer" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3ANixer" rel="nofollow">blocked</a> at 15:22 and would ya look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Proto-Indo-European_language&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Proto-Indo-European_language&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">that</a>! The same administrator reverted the article at 15:24 (two minutes later) back to the version that the said administrator approved. <b>Who woulda thunk it!</b> Rex<sup>(talk)</sup><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Albania.svg_0582.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/3/36/Flag_of_Albania.svg/25px-Flag_of_Albania.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="17" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Albania.svg_0582.html" /></a> 23:19, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Of course, do forgive me. Could you please define "just outside"? I mean I have reverted 3 times on one article and then five weeks later I reverted it again. Does the rule apply? Of course it may if I were in disagreement with an administrator over that article. The administrator, acting out of the purest of motives would have reluctantly blocked me, not because he had anything to gain for himself, just because he was implementing policy. I'm just curious to the <i>real</i> reason behind the block; who benefited from it? Why the blocking administrator of course.

<li>I would call anything up to 1 (perhaps 2 hours) after the original 24 hour period "just outside".

<p>Could you clarify that a bit? Why wasn't it admin abuse? I realise that you are condemning <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikilawyering_a5b4.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikilawyering">Wikilawyering</a>, however you haven't explained why it wasn't admin abuse. It looks and sounds like admin abuse: an admin blocking someone and the result was a benefit to the selfsame admin and a detriment to his opponent who <i>stricto sensu</i> had not violated the rule. Perhaps it's impossible! Anyway, it's not for a humble mortal such as myself to comment on what motives individual admins had while acting, heavens forbid *smirk*! It's just so intriguing the way that the admin in question managed to arrive at such an... um... "impartial" conclusion. He would have deserved a round of applauds had he chosen merely to caution the potential offender as to the rule. That didn't happen though, did it? Using his administrative discretion, he arrived at the fairest of conclusions and then I have the sauce of accusing him of feathering his own nest. Naughty naughty me... I'm merely describing things as they appear to the objective outsider. I know neither the administrator/perpetrator, nor the offender/victim. I must admit that Nixer appears (from his edit history) to be a relatively infuriating individual, however it seems very fishy that his opponent in the edit war was able to utilise the "safety hatch" of the 3RR to such an effect.

That being said, he didn't. Everyone here has endorsed his actions, so Rex, I suggest you accept defeat and move on.

<dd>we can block for <i>consistently</i> being a pita. It's not like the guy was blocked for a week, or a month. The block is well within policy, <i>except</i> for the fact that Angr was involved with the article. I tend to strongly discourage "involved blocking" myself, but I think this is more wikiquette than strict policy. After Angr posted the case here, he is in the clear, as far as I'm concerned. This is <i>not</i> a content dispute.

<dd>Looks good to me. "Remington and the Rattlesnakes" is the "North Carolina Vandal". Curps remembers him, Joy Stovall, and probably a number of others too; I've made several posts about him on AN/I as well as ViP since at least June, though he's been active longer than that, and I've blocked innumerable sockpuppets of him. His editing style and target articles give him away. Look at <i>any</i> contribution from a 63.19.xxx.xxx IP on any North Carolina related article (for example, Stokes County, North Carolina: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stokes_County%2C_North_Carolina&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stokes_County%2C_North_Carolina&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[56]</a> --there's a list of some of his socks on a long vandalism spree), as well as <a href="../../../l/u/x/Luxembourg.html" title="Luxembourg">Luxembourg</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mississippi.html" title="Mississippi">Mississippi</a>, <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elitism.html" title="Elitism">elitism</a> (this gives it away, but there are hundreds of examples like this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elitism&amp;diff=20375081&amp;oldid=20156506" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elitism&amp;diff=20375081&amp;oldid=20156506" rel="nofollow">[57]</a>), as well as his obsession with "croboys" and so forth, all of which appears in his vandalism history, as well as on his current user page. He is really one of the most prolific vandals in the history of our project, if you count up all the 63.19 vandalism on dozens of articles, many of them places in north central North Carolina and adjacent areas. For a while he just played in the sandbox (look at all the 63.19 edits there in the last several weeks) but now he's come out, and he's trying being a POV warrior rather than a blatant vandal. I can accumulate a small mountain of evidence on him; it's easy, because he says the same things in all his vandalism. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_af9e.html" title="User talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a> 04:40, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
