<dd>If you were to do that, you'd have to ban him as well from articles about the games he created (Battlecruiser series, et al), because he'd likely take his aggression out there.

<dd>I think such a ban would be a good faith gesture rather than an outright Wiki wide ban.

<dd>Let me see if I get this straight. I get banned based on a consensus by the very same people who got me banned those past times? Not to mention that this was done in a secretive manner and none of the prominent editors of the <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derek_Smart_5ab0.html" title="Derek Smart">Derek Smart</a> were even aware of it, let alone get a chance to offer their opinions? Yet another example of what is so very - very - wrong with Wiki. You folks on a power trip think that Wiki is where you can get to display your power over someone. And to those of you who stupidly keep saying that I'm Derek Smart, you should be so lucky to think that he even gives a damn about what a bunch of nobodys are writing on a Wiki. <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESupreme_Cmdr_e687.html" title="User:Supreme Cmdr">Supreme_Cmdr</a><sup><small><a href="../../../s/u/p/User_talk%7ESupreme_Cmdr_7daa.html" title="User talk:Supreme Cmdr">(talk)</a></small></sup> 18:19, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>True, perhaps more time should be spent on this discussion, but I think it's clear there is already enough evidence that Supreme Cmdr won't stop this year-long edit warring, so even an indefinite block would be appropriate at this time.

<dd>None of these usernames appear to violate the username policy. SAPTAM HIMU has no contribs, and neither does MANOJSHETH, and therefore they can't be vandal accounts (there is also no evidence MANOJSHETH created the other account).

<p>This would mean more workload on others to monitor the 9/11 pages. I didn't come to Wikipedia to work on those pages, but won't tolerate undue weight amount of "nonsense" fringe theories. There are so many 9/11 pages here, which are attractive to the "truth" movement, who are extremely persistent and determined to spread the truth with their <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">non-reliable</a> sources. They like to use Wikipedia as a tool in their truth spreading. And, I've been on the Loose Change forums and do observe them often consulting Wikipedia in their "research". If you go on their forums and at all question anything they say or profess expertise, such as in engineering or as a pilot, they BAN you from their forum. I've been banned, but can signup again for another account. Not only do they go after folks like MONGO who insist on <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, and enforcement of other policies, but lately I've seen the "truthers" even go after 9/11 victims and their families. This shows how despicable their tactics are.</p>
<p>Examples of the tactics used by the "truthers":</p>
<ul>
<li>Charles Burlingame, the pilot of <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Airlines_Flight_77_728d.html" title="American Airlines Flight 77">American Airlines Flight 77</a> is a popular target for "truthers"... His sister, Debra, remarked in the USA Today about the <a href="../../../l/o/o/Loose_Change_%28video%29_a1f5.html" title="Loose Change (video)">Loose Change</a> video, "The only thing they (the filmmakers) seem to have gotten right about the Sept. 11 attacks is the date when they occurred...They aren't truth-tellers looking to save the world. They're con artists hoping to sucker conspiracy-theory paranoids or anti-government malcontents into shelling out their hard-earned dollars." <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-04-27-conspiracies-sept-11_x.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-04-27-conspiracies-sept-11_x.htm" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> His daughter, Wendy Burlingame came on the Loose Change forum and remarked "Reading the conspiracy theories regarding my father have made me and my family sick. We realize this is being done by sick individuals who need to deal with 9-11 in a different way than others. It does not make it any easier when you read your father was involved with the terrorists when you Google his name. I hope the people who write these things can sleep well at night." <a href="http://screwloosechange.blogspot.com/2006/07/loosers-yuck-it-up-over-box-cutters.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://screwloosechange.blogspot.com/2006/07/loosers-yuck-it-up-over-box-cutters.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> BTW, she died earlier this week in a suspicious fire in her apartment. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/06/nyregion/06fire.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/06/nyregion/06fire.html" rel="nofollow">[10]</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>They are also going after Lloyd England, the taxi driver who's cab was damaged by a lightpole when AA77 flew over the highway and crashed. See photo, <a href="../../../p/e/n/Image%7EPentagon_taxi_hit_by_lightpole.jpg_9089.html" title="Image:Pentagon taxi hit by lightpole.jpg">Image:Pentagon_taxi_hit_by_lightpole.jpg</a>.

They found out where Mr. England lives and came by unannounced with a video camera. They tricked the poor old 70 year-old man into talking with them. They are probably going to cherry pick bits from the "interview" and use it in the final cut of Loose Change. They have already been showing the video and amusing themselves with it. This google video is sick <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=891765309541526552&amp;q=loose+change+%2B+immortal+technique&amp;hl=en" class="external autonumber" title="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=891765309541526552&amp;q=loose+change+%2B+immortal+technique&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> Here's one of their blogs, which talks about their "interviews" with other Pentagon witnesses. <a href="http://blog.myspace.com/lytetrip911" class="external autonumber" title="http://blog.myspace.com/lytetrip911" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> (it's a myspace link, so okay to click on it w/o fear of being tracked) Who knows, some of this could be lies, but some of it is real and disgusting.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The truthers ("Killtown" in particular) have also gone after Val McClatchey, who took this photograph near Shanksville, moments after the plane crashed there. <a href="http://www.shanksvillememorial.com/endofserenity.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.shanksvillememorial.com/endofserenity.html" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> Here's one of Killtown's blogs <a href="http://flight93photo.blogspot.com/2006/07/val-mcclatchey-photo-more-smoking-guns.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://flight93photo.blogspot.com/2006/07/val-mcclatchey-photo-more-smoking-guns.html" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> (it's a blogspot link, so okay to click it) Killtown and others accuse her of having faked the photograph. Here's how Killtown has harrassed Ms. McClatchey, as reported in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06218/711239-85.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06218/711239-85.stm" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> "The real estate agent has recently become a target of bloggers calling themselves "9-11 researchers," They have visited Mrs. McClatchey's office and called her at home, posting satellite maps of her property and accusing her of digitally altering her photo to insert a fake smoke plume. The bloggers have picked apart her story, highlighting inconsistencies in different news accounts and questioning her motives. Others have described her as "surly," "hostile," "irate" and "defensive." People have called her at home, accusing her of being anti-American and of "holding the photo hostage." On a simple Google search, Mrs. McClatchey's name now pops up in the same sentence as "total fraud." ... This Killtown, whoever he may be, I find it very disturbing that this is a 16-page attack on me personally," said Mrs. McClatchey, who opened her real estate company a year and a half ago. "My business is named. That hurts me personally. It's pretty disturbing. My whole life is out there, a map to where I live, a map to my office. It's a safety issue for me. There's some crazy people out there."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>And the NY911Truthers show up every Saturday at <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Trade_Center_site_a91f.html" title="World Trade Center site">Ground Zero</a> to "protest" and harrass tourists and passerbys. I would care less if they showed up outside the <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_House_2f44.html" title="White House">White House</a> or some place else. But, find this highly distasteful.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's one thing for some kids in their parents basement to do all this from behind a computer screen, but when they show up at GZ and go out harrassing victims and their families, it can't be tolerated. I know that some of the truthers that edit on Wikipedia are some of the hardcore folks. Banned user User:TruthSeeker1234 is one of them.</p>
<p>I have done what I can to keep those articles in check with Wikipedia policies of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV#Undue weight</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, etc. MONGO has been invaluable, and with his experience writing featured articles, he knows the policies well and what it takes to maintain a reputable, good article. The <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11%2C_2001_attacks.html" title="September 11, 2001 attacks">September 11, 2001 attacks</a> article is always among the most viewed articles. <a href="http://hemlock.knams.wikimedia.org/~leon/stats/wikicharts/index.php?wiki=enwiki" class="external autonumber" title="http://hemlock.knams.wikimedia.org/~leon/stats/wikicharts/index.php?wiki=enwiki" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> If that article descends into a propaganda, conspiracy POV pushing article for the "truth" movement, it would on the whole make Wikipedia look quite bad. I doubt they will ever succeed, as there is no consensus for what they are trying to do. In the event they did, I would likely give up on Wikipedia myself, viewing it as a waste of my time. There would be no use working on articles relating to my main area of expertise, including <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criminology.html" title="Criminology">criminology</a> (sorely lacking on Wikipedia). It's my hope that Wikipedia has the mechanisms in place to support enforcement of Wikipedia policies that are essential to keeping 9/11 articles reputable, yet alone create a hospitable environment where we can work to further improve the quality of them.</p>
<p>It's not ordinary trolling we are dealing with, but rather some real hardcore folks. --<a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_5149.html" title="User:AudeVivere">Aude</a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/u/d/User_talk%7EAudeVivere_8a42.html" title="User talk:AudeVivere">talk</a>)</small> 18:12, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I can't speak for MONGO, but he's been caught up in both the Encyclopedia Dramatica situation (including extensive attempts to "out" his real-life identity) as well as attacks from editors on the September 11 and related articles. It really has been unrelenting. A recent proposal in an ArbCom case to desysop him can't have done much for his morale either (note that this is not a criticism of the arbitrator; I opposed the proposal, but the arbs have jobs to do, too). <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 20:02, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not aware if <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeabhcan_6ae7.html" title="User:Seabhcan">User:Seabhcan</a> is involved with ED. I don't think so, but could be wrong. But, he's been pushing the "truth". I have Seabhcan over on the Loose Change forum, as heavily involved. If that's what he chooses to do off-wiki, that's okay. We can have a place for <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_theories_6f05.html" title="9/11 conspiracy theories">9/11 conspiracy theories</a>, and present them for what they are. But, I don't accept folks pushing the "truth" here against <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV#Undue weight</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, etc. Furthermore, his mannerisms have been rather uncivil towards MONGO, <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorton_devonshire_9599.html" title="User:Morton devonshire">User:Morton devonshire</a> and others. It's a combination of this and the ED situation that tests our patience. Wikipedia needs to be firm in enforcing such policies. MONGO was trying to do so, sometimes taking actions into his own hands, thinking it often takes too long for other admins to respond to ANI posts. Though, MONGO does make note of his actions on ANI for review by other admins. Other admins concurred with the block of Cplot, for example. With the <a href="../../../c/p/l/User%7ECplot_8bad.html" title="User:Cplot">User:Cplot</a> situation, the trolling has been relentless and his socks need to be blocked on sight. This situation is frustrating me, as well as MONGO. --<a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_5149.html" title="User:AudeVivere">Aude</a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/u/d/User_talk%7EAudeVivere_8a42.html" title="User talk:AudeVivere">talk</a>)</small> 22:15, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't believe Seabhcan has anything to do with ED. Of course I speak from my own point of view, but I see the arbitration as mostly about Seabhcan's incivility. His opinions about who did 9/11 are peripheral, in my opinion. What he does off site is his own business, as Aude said above. A point I would add to Aude's about 9/11 "Truth" is the profit motive. Many of the conspiracist sites sell dvds and books, and solicit contributions. Granted we can't very well cite an article about a conspiracy theory without linking to the promoter's website, but these links and the google page rank that comes with them are an important part of some business models. I think that is a factor in some of the zeal to spread the "Truth." <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 02:13, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Also, obviously the ED trolls were relentless in outing Mongo's identity. Some evidence suggests Mongo himself may have even been involved with the ED initiatives. And how can anyone cope with another outing the most intimate details of one's identity, when the one outing oneself is oneself. It's truly invasive. The Cplot sockpuppets were relentless too. They actually demanded Mongo and other admins try to familiarize themselves with Wikipedia policies. Even worse these trollish sockpuppets expected Mongo to abide by those policies on certain occasions. It defies belief. The worst part is that now other admins will need to take up the slack: to try to enforce the opposite of WP policies to ensure that the articles related to 9/11 remain strictly Whitehouse propaganda. --<a href="../../../a/i/r/User%7EAirlineToHeaven_8318.html" title="User:AirlineToHeaven">AirlineToHeaven</a> 03:54, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think that both sides should calm down. While Oden's selective approach to tagging is not appropriate and inevitably leads to accusations of a personal vendetta, he should be encouraged to continue his RfU activities in an impartial way, like Carnildo and his OrphanBot do, giving the uploader time to find a free replacement and avoiding large-scale massacres of images. I urge Quadell, Irpen, and other people involved in the dispute to cool off and to stop accusing each other of vandalism.

<p>I agree with Piotrus here. If there is an ongoing discussion in search of concensus, the tag stays. If the tagger refuses to engage into discussion, tags an image, writes nothing at talk and leaves, this is not a discussion when the tag is stamped on top of the good-faith rationale. I asked the taggers to start discussing things many times to no avail.</p>
<p>Contrary to Oden's ascertion, I simply <i>request</i> my opponent to follow the policies, guidelines and common sense, not the other way around. His threats above are unimpressive as well as another undug edit not related to the matter. There is an abundance of opinions by many editors of Wikipedia about the attitudes of user Oden. I am not bringing them all here as we are discussing a narrow issue at hand. Questioning my ability to discuss the matter in good-faith disagreement would be found surprising by most of my opponents in many content disagreements.</p>
<p>I would like to thank Robth for the partial disagreeing regarding the suggested by Oden course of action. However, contrary to an opinion by Robth, I think the matters does need an investigation and an administrative intervention. Several users use tagging images as the way to harass editors with who they disagreed on unrelated matters. One thing is an overall image patrol, like the one done by the Orphanbot or users who go over images randomply, topically, alphabetically, etc. Quite another thing is picking on the contributors based on unrelated matters and dig through the months/years of their work looking for images to be tagged among those uploaded by these specific contributors. There is no other motive in this but harassment. <a href="../../../h/a/r/WP%7EHarassment_adc0.html" title="WP:Harassment">WP:Harassment</a> addresses the issue in detail. The evidence of aggressive and abusive stalking is abundant and this repugnant practice aimed needs continues. For evidence, see <a href="#Personal_attacks.2C_harassment.2C_baiting_and_pestering_by_user:Oden" title="">#Personal_attacks.2C_harassment.2C_baiting_and_pestering_by_user:Oden</a>, <a href="../../../o/d/e/User_talk%7EOden_5a6d.html#Stalking.2FReplaceable_fair_use_images" title="User talk:Oden">User_talk:Oden#Stalking.2FReplaceable_fair_use_images</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Abu_badali_b366.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Abu badali">Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Abu_badali</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Chowbok_02b2.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Chowbok">Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Chowbok</a>.</p>

<dd>I don't think that blocking <a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">User:Irpen</a> will improve his behaviour either. However, I do believe that there is a need to press home the importance of not vandalising good-faith tags. It is serious when a editor places a tag in good faith, and <a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">User:Irpen</a> removes it in apparent bad faith (childish behaviour that has been tolerated for too long). There is a need for a strong condemnation of this.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I also agree that some fair use images are arguably harder than others to replace, which is why a editor has the possibility of disputing the tag, instead of removing it. The involvement of an admin who decides whether or not to delete ensures that at least three editors have been involved in the discussion. Removing the tag disrupts this process, and <a href="../../../d/o/_/Wikipedia%7EDo_not_disrupt_Wikipedia_to_illustrate_a_point_f384.html" title="Wikipedia:Do not disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a point">disrupts Wikipedia</a>. --<a href="../../../o/d/e/User%7EOden_515b.html" title="User:Oden">Oden</a> 23:43, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think creating such a kind of entry while having a WP:ANI investigation going on borderlines on trolling and, worse yet, on stalking. Indeed, there is no other word to describe an editor picking another editor and stalking his contributions for many months or years exclusively with the aim to tag more and more images of his. And again, putting a no-source template (which incidentally goes to bottom and not to top) is clear-cut WP:POINT. I <b>really</b> hope that an <i>uninvolved</i> admin will intervene and sort this out.

<dd>As one of the other Wikipedians recently most vocal about what has been described as a "jihad" against Fair Use images, and especially against the persons that have spoken out against the current enforcement practices removing nearly all Fair Use images of living persons, I have little doubt that Irpen has been targeted, as have I, for scrutiny of every image I've ever loaded to Wikipedia. While in the case of Oden, we were able to work through a FUR tagging exercise of dozens of images, seemingly reserved especially for those of of that publicly disagree with said policy enforcement, and in my case Oden in fact made a number of helpful suggestions, unlike most of his contemporaries, other users who share the same general viewpoints about "free" images attacked dozens of other images I've uploaded, and so far I've lost 32 of 35 images challenged. It's very, very clear that those of use who dispute the "jihad" are targeted for extended periods and forced to jump through hoops few others are, which a number of people have indicated is a violation of Wikipedia policy in and of itself. As long as the present enforcement policies remain in place, I will not load images of any kind to Wikipedia, and have asked others who have been attacked to consider the same. There is absolutely no doubt we are being targeted and stalked in these instances. <a href="../../../t/v/c/User%7ETvccs_eb8b.html" title="User:Tvccs">Tvccs</a> 04:16, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>All of the comments above are good arguments for why there is no need to notify the uploader.</p>
<p>Images which can be fixed should be fixed without involving the uploader (I usually wait for the uploader to act before fixing missing rationales and try to make sure that orphanded fair use images haven't been orphaned by mistake).</p>
<p>If the image is missing a source then it might be necessary to contact the uploader. If the image is replaceable and the deleting admin comes to the same conclusion then the image should be deleted, and involving the uploader in such a case only causes alot of unnecessary aggrevation. --<a href="../../../o/d/e/User%7EOden_515b.html" title="User:Oden">Oden</a> 14:34, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry, I forgot not everyone watches wrestling and would understand this&#160;:) The issue is of the <a href="../../../w/w/e/WWE_United_States_Championship_3203.html" title="WWE United States Championship">WWE United States Championship</a> being a part of the requirements to the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triple_Crown_Champion_6570.html" title="Triple Crown Champion">Triple Crown Championship</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Slam_Champion_0b27.html" title="Grand Slam Champion">Grand Slam Championship</a>. <a href="../../../w/w/e/WWE_eb93.html" title="WWE">WWE</a> doesn't consider, or hasn't confirmed that the United States Championship is in fact a requirement for the Triple Crown or Grand Slam to occur. I tried e-mailing WWE, but I got no response. This issue was furthur stimulated when a wrestler made a rouge comment on WWE television about how he had completed the "grand slam of professional wrestling". Despite searching long and hard on the internet to provide sources for this statement, nothing pulled up as a reliable source. The <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> is inserted into a table format in the diffs, stating the United States Championship is part of the Triple Crown and Grand Slam championship status', but that's <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> because there have been no reliable sources for this claim outside that one comment on television one night, which can;t be taken seriously because of professional wrestling <a href="../../../k/a/y/Kayfabe.html" title="Kayfabe">kayfabe</a>. Vlh has been inserting this claim of the United States Championship since June, and has been reverted ever since, and no, his other messages on his talk page confirm that I wasn't the only one, and no I wasn't the only one reverting this, as other editors have reverted him too. <i>semper fi</i> — <a href="../../../m/o/e/User_talk%7EMoe_Epsilon_62b6.html" title="User talk:Moe Epsilon"><font color="#000000">Moe</font></a> 23:09, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The users 129.44.234.53 and 71.240.253.89 has now broken the three-revert policy by once again replacing the rumored information. I have reverted the article, once again, to remain neutral.

<dd>As discussed in a prior ArbCom case, <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> is the former webmaster and current <i>"Main Representative, Supervisor and Contact"</i> for the <b>largest</b> website on the internet opposing <a href="../../../s/a/t/Sathya_Sai_Baba_611f.html" title="Sathya Sai Baba">Sathya Sai Baba</a> (<a href="http://www.saisathyasai.com/wiki-arb/zz-webmaster-facts.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.saisathyasai.com/wiki-arb/zz-webmaster-facts.html" rel="nofollow">[33]</a>). Andries directly promotes, endorses and publishes Ekantik's Anti-Sai writings (under his name of Sanjay Dadlani) on his Anti-Sai website. When ProEdits/Robert Priddy (another Anti-Sai Activist who is Andries friend) divulged the full name of Freelanceresearch, not once did he object or complain about the publishing of personal information. Andries is trying to suppress the fact that Anti-Sai Activists, who have a keen agenda against Sathya Sai Baba, are editing the article incognito.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../e/k/a/User%7EEkantik_d4be.html" title="User:Ekantik">Ekantik</a> had every opportunity to choose usernames that would not identify him with the Sai Controversy. Unfortunately for him, he choose to use the name <i>"Gaurasundara"</i>, which <b>directly</b> links him to the Sai Controversy because he uses that very same name on the internet (which he recently changed then re-changed on one of his blogs in an attempt to suppress this fact).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Before discovering his sockpuppetry, <a href="../../../e/k/a/User%7EEkantik_d4be.html" title="User:Ekantik">Ekantik</a> was directly asked by Jossi if he considered himself a POV editor (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sathya_Sai_Baba&amp;diff=92251888&amp;oldid=92251323" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sathya_Sai_Baba&amp;diff=92251888&amp;oldid=92251323" rel="nofollow">[34]</a>) and <a href="../../../e/k/a/User%7EEkantik_d4be.html" title="User:Ekantik">Ekantik</a> said <i>"no"</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sathya_Sai_Baba&amp;diff=92252832&amp;oldid=92252665" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sathya_Sai_Baba&amp;diff=92252832&amp;oldid=92252665" rel="nofollow">[35]</a>). Needless to say, this response flies in the face of <i>"Ekantik's"</i> <b>numerous</b> blogs against Sathya Sai Baba and Sai Proponents (one even specifically attacking me and my edits here on Wikipedia) and <b>thousands</b> of highly defamatory, derogatory, sexually-explicit and grotesque accusations and comments against Sathya Sai Baba on various Yahoo Groups and forums.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Despite Ekantik's extra-Wikipedia online behavior and using a known name on Wikipedia that identifies him with Sai Controversy, he is attempting to suppress this information and portray himself as a neutral party who does not have a POV to push and that his interest in the Sathya Sai Baba article is innocent and without bias. Fortunately, his identity was discovered before he pushed forward his edits incognito. It is also important to point out that despite his self-professed neutrality, all of his edits revolve solely around the Sai Controversy.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you would like for me to support all of my above comments, I am more than willing to create a page that highlights Ekantik's Anti-Sai Agenda against Sathya Sai Baba on the internet, along with a list of all his blogs, public claims about a prime participant in Paul Lewis' newspaper article against Sai Baba and a sampling of his unbelievably vitriolic accusations and comments against Sathya Sai Baba on the internet. All I can say is that you won't believe your eyes when you compare his Wikipedia persona with his Anti-Sai persona on the internet. Needless to say, <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> defence of Ekantik is for a reason. He is attempting to suppress the fact that the most vocial opponent of Sathya Sai Baba is attempting to edit the article incognito. <a href="../../../s/s/s/User%7ESSS108_4443.html" title="User:SSS108">SSS108</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/s/s/User_talk%7ESSS108_8de2.html" title="User talk:SSS108">talk</a>-<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_SSS108_26a1.html" title="Special:Emailuser/SSS108">email</a></sup> 18:40, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just to clarify a few points: My sockpuppet is <b>legitimate</b> (see <a href="../../../s/u/s/Wikipedia%7ESuspected_sock_puppets_Ekantik_b599.html" title="Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Ekantik">Sockpuppetry allegations</a>). The name of my sockpuppet (<i>Gaurasundara</i>) is <b>not</b> connected with any Sai controversy because I do not use it in connection with said controversy. I use it in connection with matters of Hindu religion. As I have already discussed on the Sockpuppetry page, <a href="../../../s/s/s/User%7ESSS108_4443.html" title="User:SSS108">SSS108</a> is heavily biased in favour of Sathya Sai Baba and is also a noted defamer of critics and apostates of the Baba. He will (rightly) claim that I have a bias and make reference to extra-Wikipedia activites, but he fails to realise that extra-Wikipedia matters hardly figure in matters of article editing, especially since I am dedicated to NPOV and factual editing cleanup and maintenance in several other articles that I am involved. SSS108'S claims of bias refer to extra-Wikipedia matters and hasn't got a leg to stand on; my <b>one</b> edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sathya_Sai_Baba&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=91904630" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sathya_Sai_Baba&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=91904630" rel="nofollow">see here</a> on the <a href="../../../s/a/t/Sathya_Sai_Baba_611f.html" title="Sathya Sai Baba">Sathya Sai Baba</a> page was a cleanup of POV, correction of bad grammar and removal of a defunct sentence.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it has been pointed out several times that SSS108 is using Wikipedia to carry on a personal battle in violation of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, and continues to reveal my identity despite being requested several times not to do so by several editors (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sathya_Sai_Baba&amp;diff=93054753&amp;oldid=93033795" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sathya_Sai_Baba&amp;diff=93054753&amp;oldid=93033795" rel="nofollow">diff1</a>) (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sathya_Sai_Baba&amp;diff=93080399&amp;oldid=93073438" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sathya_Sai_Baba&amp;diff=93080399&amp;oldid=93073438" rel="nofollow">diff2</a>).

<dd>I hate to say this Bhai, but if you're going to leave, then just leave. This marks the second deletion of your userpage in just over two weeks, and it seems to be more about getting attention for your cause than actually leaving. You are free to defend yourself, but these pretend departures are not the appropriate way.

<li>This is a very interesting case. May I ask how often you are getting these emails? In your previous post you said 3 in a month, which doesn't sound like much. Also consider that the offender might not even be aware of what he's doing: sometimes social-network sites have people upload the address book from their email client, which can include everyone they've ever sent mail to. You might be one of hundreds or even thousands, who knows. It's also (sadly) possible that the user may have been the victim of a virus or trojan which harvested your address and is now being used for spam. Obviously it's upsetting you if you're posting here about it, so I'm trying to think of a good solution. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 17:52, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I got another one today, this one asks me for my birthday. The one yesterday asked me for my address. I've gotten 5 in the past month or so. And no, he's not been infected with a trojan because he's adding in a personalized message "Hello this is mohammed salim khan from dherai swat, pakistan", which fits in with he user pages. Morwen: I think it is a wikipedia problem, because he is using the email function on wikipedia to gain my response and then using it for unwanted personal contact. That's a huge potential loophole for phishers/scammers, to email editors here with a seemingly valid question, and then use the responding addresses and spam them. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">⇒</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Swatjester_088b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Swatjester"><small><sup>Ready</sup></small></a> <a href="../../../r/s/t/RSTA_5dcc.html" title="RSTA"><small>Aim</small></a> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_United_States_Armed_Forces_74b7.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject United States Armed Forces"><small><sub>Fire!</sub></small></a> 18:06, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Look, he's already got your email address, right? So if we ban him, and stop him from using the email facility, and indeed remove your email from the site, then he's still got your email address and can continue to spam you? I don't mean to seem unsympathetic here, but what sort of action do you expect us to take? If I am misunderstanding the situation, and you never replied to one, he <i>doesn't</i> have your address and is still sending these things through the wikipedia's "e-mail" function, then we may be able to do something. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> - <a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorwen_11fb.html" title="User talk:Morwen">Talk</a> 23:05, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't know exactly what action you're supposed to take. That's why I brought it up here, to get some sort of ideas. I can eventually get the spam filters to recognize his name and they'll block it out, but what's to stop him from doing it again through a different account? It's a policy issue that needs to be addressed because it's a potentially dangerous loophole. So I'm bringing it up here, because it's an incident, and it's something that requires administrator attention. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">⇒</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Swatjester_088b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Swatjester"><small><sup>Ready</sup></small></a> <a href="../../../r/s/t/RSTA_5dcc.html" title="RSTA"><small>Aim</small></a> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_United_States_Armed_Forces_74b7.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject United States Armed Forces"><small><sub>Fire!</sub></small></a> 23:54, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Do you want us to warn someone, block someone, delete something or protect something? If so, this is the right place for it. If not, then it needs to go to developers or possibly the community at large for discussion on what we want to ask the developers to do. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> - <a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorwen_11fb.html" title="User talk:Morwen">Talk</a> 01:44, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Morwen, I'm here because I don't know what the policy is regarding out of wikipedia harrassment. I think that an official warning at the minimum is in order, though it's up to the administrators which user it would go to, because he has something like 8 user accounts (which I've posted about here before). If there's a way to disable the Special:emailuser function for his accounts, that's actually the best way. However, I'm asking here what the policy is. This is an incident. It requires administrator attention. Hence, here. (Note, I think it should go to the developers as well, but that doesn't preclude action here). <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">⇒</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Swatjester_088b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Swatjester"><small><sup>Ready</sup></small></a> <a href="../../../r/s/t/RSTA_5dcc.html" title="RSTA"><small>Aim</small></a> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_United_States_Armed_Forces_74b7.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject United States Armed Forces"><small><sub>Fire!</sub></small></a> 06:36, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think SWATJester has a valid point here; if people are phishing via Wikipedia email, in any form, then we have a problem. Just because we don't have a policy yet doesn't mean that we should pretend that it's not a problem if it happens. I don't know what the right answer is; it could range from "be careful who you respond to WP email from" as a user warning, to blocking or banning any WP account found to be doing this, with quite a range in between. But it's worth starting a policy discussion about. This is probably not the right place, but figuring out where the right place is, and asking if there's an informal consensus for doing something on a preliminary basis, are reasonable here. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 06:31, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>User:Cool Cat has been frustrated for the last couple of weeks because a number of Star Trek-related articles that he respects have been put up for AfD, and I believe in a couple of cases deleted. In the process he has crossed paths with User:Elaragirl, a self-described "very aggressive" user and emphatic deletionist (who is currently blocked for 24 hours in an unrelated matter, see discussion above thread "Block of User:Elaragirl") and they have certainly rubbed each other the wrong way. Cool Cat's RfC filing against Elaragirl earlier today received, one could say, less than unanimous support which seems to have upset Cool Cat further.</dd>
<dd>Cool Cat has been talking about leaving Wikipedia, temporarily or permanently, for a few days now and probably could use a little bit of a Wikibreak. One possibility that occurs to me is that he's sought out a block as a means of Wikibreak enforcement, which I know is not permitted, yet is probably harmless for a couple of days in this instance. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 01:35, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I think the people questioning this are unfamiliar with how checkuser works so let me give you and example. Essjay's findings show that these two edits were made within minutes of each other using the exact same underlying IP address and no other users have used that IP address. There is no way this is more than one user, the IP isn't an open proxy.</p>

<p>This, combined with the diffs Glen has listed are pretty damming. Plus, I've no reason to doubt the checkuser results. Additionally, the fact that Wikipediatrix stopped editing about the time the sock became really active is even more proof in my book.

<p>Unfortunately yandman, whilst I applaud your ability to continue to assume good faith it the most dire of circumstances and look for any rationale that could explain this, I must invoke <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occam%27s_Razor_046a.html" title="Occam's Razor">Occam's Razor</a>; you are wrong. You are excluding one vital factor in your assumptions; The fact that I asked four or five direct questions this user regarding their previous experience, and they denied they had ever edited here, and learned by watching us for two years. (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive151#Yet_another_Scientology_sock.3F" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive151#Yet_another_Scientology_sock.3F" rel="nofollow">here for a reminder</a>) This would have been the perfect opportunity to tell use her roommate was an avid editor... or another such explanation. So, its Wikipediatrix, no question there. But, I do have some serious concerns that need answering about all this that havent been discussed.

<dd>Yes, that is a good point but what speaks against it is that wikipediatrix diappears and HFCS appears.

<dd>Guys, please look at the facts here: 1) They edited the same pages, and within minutes of each other. 2) Wikipediatrix stopped about the time that Syrup picked up, 3) There is no other activity from this IP, 4) Syrup immediately jumped into administrative level stuff. I know people don't want to believe she's capable of it, but gosh, to be a rather blunt: if it looks, feels, tastes and smells like sockpuppetry, it's probably sockpuppetry.

<p>I have to agree with Glen S above. A few people are tying themselves in knotts here trying to explain what is pretty clear to me. I think the burden is fairly on Wikipediatrix to explain the situation if we are wrong about the deception and sockpuppetry, and I highly doubt that we are. I still think a one week block is not long enough and would prefer to see it extended to two weeks, and even this seems like maybe not enough. This type of deliberate, willful deception is far more disruptive than your typical willy on wheels vandal, so my recommendation for a longer block is not for punative reasons, but to allow time for the damage caused to be undone and for the community to reflect upon this incident without having to worry that it is continuing. Note that I have had <i>no</i> interactions with either of these accounts, so there is no personal stake for me in my statements here. It is simply a reaction to the scope of the damage to people's trust in the community that behavior like this causes. I think perhaps an ArbCom case should be opened in this matter, but I will leave that decision to people more closely connected to the events. —<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Bell_8398.html" title="User:Doug Bell">Doug&#160;Bell</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoug_Bell_81b5.html" title="User talk:Doug Bell">talk</a></sup> 17:07, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>agree. Everything Fructose did was immediately reverted as blatant PoV, and everything trix did was accepted at the time.

I repeat that these actions are far more damaging than a blatant serial vandal, and I can't see anyone arguing that that doesn't cause damage. —<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Bell_8398.html" title="User:Doug Bell">Doug&#160;Bell</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoug_Bell_81b5.html" title="User talk:Doug Bell">talk</a></sup> 17:48, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Based on that response I think the current 1 week block is the appropriate response and it can end there. Regardless of intent, double voting, switching back and forth over short periods of time, and contributing with both accounts to the same articles without disclosure is disruptive. —<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Bell_8398.html" title="User:Doug Bell">Doug&#160;Bell</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoug_Bell_81b5.html" title="User talk:Doug Bell">talk</a></sup> 20:31, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Interesting. I was going to ask why the block because I did not see anything wrong with Fructose's edits and socks are not specifically disallowed. Changing your mind is also not disallowed. Then I checked and saw that she had voted keep on two of her own AfDs so that is somewhat disingenuous and grounds for some short block. Other than that did trix/syrup do anything really wrong other than torque people off. Hell, trix sure torqued me when acting the critic. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 20:33, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, regarding her explanation, I guess I'm kinda relieved. Was anything resolved regarding the block? My concern about what she did lies solely around <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. There were changes she wanted made, obviously, and it was her doing them via a new account with no explanation that caused all the edit warring, and, is the reason this whole section/checkuser was done in the first place. Take, for example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scientology_0-8:_The_Book_of_Basics&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scientology_0-8:_The_Book_of_Basics&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">this</a>. Now Wikipediatrix <i>started and in fact wrote that entire article</i> - yet, days later - marks <b>her own work</b> as a copyvio with the sock! Now if she'd done that with her main account, as the creator, no one would doubt her. But instead edit warring ensued. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:ScientologySeries&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:ScientologySeries&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">Here</a> Wikipediatrix was the last person to edit the template, and made some fairly big changes; the very next edit is her, as the sock, removing info... and again edit warring ensued. The socks intentions seemed to everyone to be to disrupt. Thus it effectively got nowhere. Wikipediatrix is respected enough to have mde those changes and for us all to AGF. But then I cant imagine Wikipediatrix making such sweeping removals, and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Stacy_Brooks_5b6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Stacy Brooks">nominating clearly notable Scientology critics for deletion</a> without discussing it first...

<dd>The reason appears to be that Domino theory thought it was a good idea, apparently pissing off the other editors mentioned. I'd have thought that the answer would be reeducate Domino Theory and revert everything to the way it was on November 29 or thereabouts. I'm not sure it's that simple; presumably Themightyquill, et al, would have done that if it was.

<p>Ken Avidor is a known opponent (with few scruples) of Dr. Anderson's lifelong goals. I scanned the article and found at least one case of taking a quote out of context. The article focuses on local Minneapolis politics, which is not necessarily appropriate to a discussion of Dr. Anderson's achievements. In order to prevent a minor recurrence of the Siegenthaler incident I suggest a rigorous review of this article. <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDunning_3955.html" title="User:Dunning">Bob</a> 04:47, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>TO be clear, I dont' know anything about PRT. I'm fine with deleting the whole thing. I'm only active on it inasmuch as I found it through my watch of AN/I, and thought it'd be interesting to really clean up and rehab a lousy POV filled article. Avidor continues to add to the article with loaded words, but I've AGF'd and asked him to be careful in the future. My only interest is in editing a bad article into good, not in supporting or opposing PRT. I'm a jersey driver.

<dd>I do believe it's a sock puppet of User:Mr Bullockx. I have no experience with sockpuppets, but the user User:MinervaSimpson seems to be acting the same way. The account was created only an hour ago and almost immediately began putting up articles for deletion, including some of mine (and on those the user has made what appears to be personal attacks). The user also seems to be behaving just the same way as the former user did, (stalking my edits?) and has recently posted copyright work (which has just been deleted). I think this could be a sockpuppet, but since I am not sure and since I also don't want to get into a serious confrontation or a serious bout of bad faith, I'd rather you look it over since I believe you have a little familiarity with this situation.

<p>Neither me nor <a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKitzke_eeb4.html" title="User:Kitzke">user:Kitzke</a> are involved with <a href="../../../j/y/l/Jyllands-Posten_Muhammad_cartoons_controversy_7433.html" title="Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy">Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy</a> in any significant way (I corrected a link, he reverted vandalism), and it seems we are intent on remaining so. VirtualEye comments (and general attitudes) are definitely worrying me, though. <a href="../../../c/i/r/User%7ECirceus_e372.html" title="User:Circeus">Circeus</a> 21:23, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes I was thinking that this user's message could be cause for concern as well. So far though there's nothing that would appear to need adminstrator intervention as this user has yet to be disruptive (as far as I can tell). <i>(<a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetscott_c779.html" title="User talk:Netscott"><span title="Leave me a message.">→</span></a><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott"><span style="background: white; color: grey" title="Go to my userpage.">Netscott</span></a>)</i> 22:02, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've been trying to get an editor over to the Vanessa Minnillo board to help with a dispute. In the most recent article of Maxim magazine, Vanessa Minnillo stated she was white and polynesian. People at her board are insistent on saying she is in fact filipino attaching it to sources that have never been identified as reliable. According to the rules of wikipedia, because the interview has proved to be the best source and is the most recent article with Vanessa's actual testements, it makes no sense why they are trying to force her as filipino. 71.138.141.230 21:34, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
