<dd>Well, you still can apply for a temp injunction, though.

<dd>I've already stated on the talk page of the proposed decision that that is totally absurd. That 90 day ban on that matter needs to be removed. I notice that I got a proposed 30 day ban for also removing a statement (which I didn't realise I did - I noticed the 30 day ban <i>after</i> I read the decision). Two things here: <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a> needs to be applied equally. It was only after Ambi and Jayjg noticed the ban and mentioned it on the talk page that Fred voted against it. And yet, CheeseDreams did the same thing for the same reason and she's getting a <b>90 day</b> ban? So much for the ArbCom being seen as neutral and fair. Secondly, if I did the same wrong doing as CheeseDreams, why the heck am I getting a lesser ban? Exactly how is that fair? That's ridiculous, and I'm <i>not</i> happy about it. Now we've got a possible cloud over the arbitration as CheeseDreams may say that the arbitrators are being unfair. And she'd have a point.

<p>I've been provided with the following evidence against Sam Spade. Since I blocked Adraeus for breaking 3RR on the same article, I should be consistent, but this is a little less clear as I'd like it to be. Can someone confirm I'd be correct in blocking Sam based on this evidence?</p>

<dd>The following is an edited version of an email I received. (It originally spoke of a 2RR based on the voluntary injuction I suggested).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Sam Spade has broken the 3 revert rule for the <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheism.html" title="Atheism">Atheism</a> article a number of times now. He insists on capitalizing all instances of <b>"god"</b> against all consensus. For the last 2.5 days now Sam repeatedly replaces any subsitute phrases <b>(diety/dieties)</b> entered in the article as attempts to compromise. He thinks that by re-editing the phrases he finds offensive and not actually reverting, he is able to side-step the 2/3rr at the Atheism article. You should also be aware that this particular point has historically been an issue for Sam, and the subject of a past RfC against his actions in promoting it, and so he can be considered already warned. We've tried reasoning with him, but Sam still insists on promoting his own POV on this point, and we feel that he's been given more than enough slack, and now he's crossed the line. If Adraeus' actions resulted in 24 hr ban, Sam's certainly qualify as well. Please take action to reign in Sam.</i></dd>

</ul>
<p>For those not reading the email list Sam has stated that he was not reverting <i>" AFAIK I made 2 reverts in a 24hr period, not 4"</i> I've been looking at the edits and I'm not convinced that Sam was deliberately trying to get around the 3RR. I'm going to investigate further, but at this moment I'm tempted to lift the block. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">(The snott rake)</a> 14:11, 15 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sam takes pain to adhere to policy by the letter (rather than by the spirit), and it is likely that he made a third revert within seconds of the expiry of a 24h period. It is also justified to apply sanctions legalistically, therefore, but obivously if it is not clear that he has broken the 3RR, the block should be lifted. otoh, a 24h block is not draconic, and he can obviously still make uncontroversial contributions anonymously. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 15:15, 15 Dec 2004 (UTC)</small></dd>

<p>I'm going to unblock him. I do not think that mgm acted maliciosly or that the blocking was any kind of abuse of admin powers. However this is a difficult one, and since there was no warning, I don't think it was fair to block Sam Spade. Having said that, i don't want anyone to think that I am endorsing Sam's edits, and I would caution Sam to strive to stay within the spirit of the rules as well as the letter of them. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">(The snott rake)</a> 15:38, 15 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't believe Sam violated the 3-revert rule, or that people are correctly understanding his point in wanting 'God' specifically mentioned in the Atheism article, rather than subsumed under 'gods' or 'deities'. It is not simply an insistence on having Atheism be treated as the denial of the Christian God. It may seem odd for an atheist such as myself to be defending Sam, but perhaps that will lend some additional credibility to my support.</p>
<p>First, regarding the reverts. It is true that Sam consistently takes the opportunity to change 'deities' or 'gods' to 'god or Gods', or sometimes just to 'God'. However, these are rarely simply reverts, or even just edits by themselves, at least not yesterday. He was doing other edits at the same time, generally edits that improved the article. Please study the alleged reverts more carefully. I was carefully following the edit history yesterday in the Atheism article, and I would be very surprised if Sam violated the 3-revert rule, either directly, or even with simple edits that amounted to reverts.</p>
<p>Second, while Adraeus and some others accuse Sam of simply being a "POV-Warrior" in making these edits, this is partly because they seem uninterested in (or perhaps incapable of) understanding Sam's POV. If they did understand it, they would realize that Sam's POV is not bizarre or weird and that the article does indeed need to reflect Sam's POV (as well as others, of course) in order to be NPOV. The point is that there are significant schools of thought in monotheistic religions such as Christianity, henotheistic religions such as Hinduism, as well as in pantheism, panentheism, religious monism and others, according to which God is not merely a deity or a god -- is not a supernatural being alongside other beings, but rather is the "ground of Being", "Being itself", "Existence itself", etc. Paul Tillich, a very well-known Protestant theologian said once "God does not exist" -- meaning God <b>is</b> Being, the ground of being, the power of being. So, when Sam insists that the Atheism article not include God as <b>a</b> god, he is not simply pushing a Christian POV, but trying to make the article more accurately reflect several significant schools of thought. You can say that he has not done a good job in getting this across to others, and it is hard because people constantly happen by and casually change 'God or gods' to 'deities'. And even the regular editors seem to regard the statement that "God is not a god" as bizarre, but it is not grounds for blocking --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 17:22, 15 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Pfui. I actually read the whole of <a href="../../../c/l/i/Talk%7EClitoris_d134.html" title="Talk:Clitoris">Talk:Clitoris</a>, and a few related pages besides, and my eyes were fairly well glazed over by the end. Frankly, I don't think it makes much difference that Schneelocke may have had some modest prior contact with the page - any admin who was brought in <i>de novo</i> would almost certainly have taken one look at that tome and protected the whole lot anyway, while a) they figured out what the devil was going on, b) the dust settled, and c) people chilled out and became a little less fixated on this.</dd>
<dd>And I'm not sure I agree with the assessment of "both sides .. have reached agreement" because clearly some people didn't agree, hence the revert war. I think a more accurate assessment might (I want to qualify this because of the afore-mentioned glazing-over of the eyes - I might have missed some things) that "some people on size A had changed their minds and agreed to a compromise with people on side B, but others on side A had not". Absent a poll, it's hard to say what the count is of A-switchers, A-stayers, and B's. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 04:29, 16 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well I <i>am</i> involved in the discussion, so you'll have to bear in mind that my viewpoint is not that of an outsider. As far as I'm aware Schneelocke has had no involvement with the page in question except as an administrator. I could be wrong, but I did search the talk and page histories pretty hard when this accusation--which if true I would take seriously--was raised. Other administrators are also alleged to have been involved improperly, but last time I looked the accusers were being extremely evasive about who exactly did something wrong. Frankly after making an honest attempt to reach an agreement with the minority who object to the picture, I am wondering if my actions were wise. By trying to broker an agreement in which the "objectionable" picture was replaced by a link for a few days, I seem to have provoked a revert war between admins and the minority users, which ended once again in the protection of the page. I remain optimistic, though. I'm that kind of guy. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html#Page_Footer" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 04:47, 16 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have no problem with anyone considering my past behavior with respect to my service as an arbitrator. The material CheeseDreams discovered is accurate enough and was a very difficult period in my life. I was unable to defend myself against a false charge and had to abandon my law practice. I serve as an arbitrator with a clear conscience and fail to see how not paying costs for transporting and housing a witness relates to my work here. It only relates to the Arbitration case concerning CheeseDreams because she happened to discover the matter. I understand her trying to use this information to shift the focus off of her case, but the underlying problems which landed her in front of the Arbitration Committee remain. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> 17:35, Dec 22, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Her statement, "admitted that they are a right wing POV warrier" is distorted. I have opposed left-wing POV warriors and they have labeled me right wing, but that is hardly the case. I' m just one of the few who have stood against them. But again, the connection with CheeseDream's Arbitration case remains tenuous. One might suppose, if it were true, that a conservative person would frown on characterising Jesus's saying and parables as <a href="../../../k/o/a/Koan.html" title="Koan">koans</a>, but searching my book inventory for "high" and "low" church books proves nothing. In short, while grasping for straws CheeseDreams found a cudgel. But flail as she might, unless she is willing to focus on her own behavior we get nowhere. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> 17:35, Dec 22, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sigh. Look, I understand where you're coming from. But try looking at it from the other side.

If I had had to give Wiglaf the exact same block as I gave Antifinnugor, <i>even though his actions were not equivalent</i>, I would have thrown up my hands and declined to become involved.

<dd>My apologies to Noel but this is exactly what we discussed, Theresa. I Admins interpret the policy and are not evenhanded. I don't think they should. If one "side" gets 12 hours, the other should get 12 hours. Then no one can feel aggrieved. The policy does not, so far as I recall, specify greater punishment for greater breach. I think a revert <i>is</i> a revert. The whole point of the rule is that <i>no one</i> does four. That's the sin; that's what should be punished. Interpreting the reverter's behaviour, deciding one is <i>worse</i> than the other (or as we discussed a "vandal" or a "troll") is precisely what I think shouldn't happen.</dd>

<dd>If I were Wiglaf, I'd certainly feel pretty darned aggrieved if I got the same penalty as AFU. The policy also does not rule out "greater punishment for greater breach" - and I'd love to see the discussion if you tried to get a prohibition of that added.</dd>
<dd>If it makes you happier, try looking at it this way: I assessed a penalty of 4 hours for <i>each</i> 3RR violation, to be served consecutively - and AFU, with more violations of the rule, wound up with a longer penalty. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 11:05, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Noel acted very correctly. He blocked Wiglaf, even though Wiglaf was re-instating the consensus version. (not 'even though he agreed with Wiglaf'; the blocks are unrelated to the content of the dispute, but entirely based on the page history (number of reverts)). Fact is that AFU reverted 7 times and Wiglaf 4 times. This is sufficient basis for making AFU's block longer. Both blocks were reasonably short, and have expired already. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 09:23, 27 Dec 2004 (UTC)</small>

<dd>I must have misunderstood the policy. I've already had someone suggesting that you are closer to breaching the "spirit" of it if you revert twice than you are if you revert once, which I couldn't find in the policy. I thought the policy was intended to prevent edit wars by banning reversion more than three times in a day. I didn't realise that the intention was to have a sliding scale of punishment for doing it more or less. Do you mind pointing me to the part of the policy that suggested that this would happen? And Bishonen, just because you warn one side but do not warn the other, does not mean the side warned should receive more punishment! This is precisely what I and I think others feared with this policy. Perceived <i>bad</i> users are punished more heavily than perceived <i>good</i> ones, for the same offence. This helps entrench them as <i>bad</i> users. If you did not also warn Wiglaf, BTW, you too were not evenhanded. Be fair, and be seen to be fair. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 01:03, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

I then warned him on his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Antifinnugor#Reply_about_Finno-Ugric_languages" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Antifinnugor#Reply_about_Finno-Ugric_languages" rel="nofollow">talk page</a>, repeating a link to the <a href="../../../t/h/r/Wikipedia%7EThree_revert_rule_7218.html" title="Wikipedia:Three revert rule">Wikipedia:Three revert rule</a> that somebody else had already given him, and asking him to please stop breaking the rules; he replied, thus showing that he had read my message, then reverted again, for the seventh time within the same 24 hours. After all that a 12 hour-block seems like a mild response. If any users still, after this information, think Antifinnugor's infraction's the same as Wiglaf's because "a revert is a revert," they must be mounted on some old hobby-horse.--<a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">Talk</a> 12:17, 27 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yes, that too, although I assumed that as a long-time editor Wiglaf knew of the 3RR, and just lost track of how many times he'd reverted. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 14:08, 27 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>of course. but admins should still 'blindly' block 3RR violations, purely based on page-history evidence. The alternative would be that each admin would have to dig into the details of each individual case before being able to determine appropriate action. A 24h block may take away some heat, temporarily, but it will not solve the problem. There will be ample opportunity to comment on AFU's behaviour once <a href="../../../d/b/e/User%7EDbenbenn_Antifinnugor_b1a0.html" title="User:Dbenbenn/Antifinnugor">his RFC</a> (still a draft) is submitted. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 13:34, 27 Dec 2004 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd>The <a href="../../../t/h/r/Wikipedia%7EThree_revert_rule_7218.html#Enforcement" title="Wikipedia:Three revert rule">policy</a> says "for up to 24 hours", not "for 24 hours". I.e. discretion to use lesser periods is allowed, I did so, reserving the longer 24-hour maximum for <i>vandals</i>, who are also, according to <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html#Vandalism" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">policy</a>, only supposed to be given 24 hours for a first offense. I personally don't think 3RR violations merit the same punishment as vandalism, and would again (see my comments to Theresa above) avoid acting rather than hand down such a block.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, someone said in the 3RR discussion something to the effect of "this is just a symbolic punishment anyway". That's absolutely correct - being blocked for a couple of hours isn't a real check on someone who's determined to make trouble.

<p>I'd like to point out that while Dr. Zen and a couple others expressed concerns during the 3RR vote that admins would not be evenhanded, there were others of us who expressed precisely the opposite worry: that admins would be expected to act like mindless robots. We are intelligent people here, and there is no reason to pretend we can't tell the difference between 4 reverts and 7, or between a user making a mistake and one who blatantly ignores the rules after being warned. <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsomorphic_e88d.html" title="User:Isomorphic">Isomorphic</a> 03:27, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>It's hard to know where to put a reply to Dr Zen's reply above, inlined above my original post, so I'll start afresh here for the sake of chronology. Zen, are you saying it would have been fairer to <b>not</b> warn a user in full spate of over-the-limit reverting, but just stand by and give him unlimited rope to hang himself with? Unless, that is, I set off those warnings by the pedantry of digging into the History tab to locate any other users who might have "used up" their three reverts (something people do all the time, and then stop, as I'm sure you know) and plant warnings on them too, against the remote possibility that one of them can't count to three (sorry, Wiglaf)? Coming in new to an old conflict, I was hoping to help AFU, even though I had to take the other side of the argument--to establish contact with him on a non-inflammatory level. Did you bother to read the talk page link I provided? You and I haven't met, you know nothing of where I'm coming from, so you just figure my motives have to be bad and flame me in passing. Nice going. But I apologize to other people for responding to flamebait on this page. Anybody who has anything more to say to me, I'd appreciate it if you'd take it to my talk page.--<a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">Talk</a> 12:23, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, I think it would be fairer to warn both and for both to receive the same punishment. You are forgetting that you suggested that <i>having been warned</i> is reason to give him greater punishment. That is what I take issue with and only that. I am not criticising the warning in any way, only the latter notion. I am not discussing your motives and I am sorry you feel you've been flamed. I am discussing the general point because I think it is important that breaches of the 3RR are treated evenhandedly, with all those who breach it in any given dispute getting the same punishment, regardless who does or does not agree with their views, regardless who has or has not been warned.<a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 23:56, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Dr Zen, you are apparently not aware that <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Wikipedia:Assume good faith</a> is one of our most fundamental principles, certainly more fundamental than the 3RR rule. Given the facts, it is possible to assume good faith on the part of Wiglaf. Noel chose to do so. It is <i>not</i> possible to assume good faith on the part of AFU, who deliberately chose to ignore warnings. That is the fundamental difference between the two cases, and it would not be "even-handed" to ignore it. <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsomorphic_e88d.html" title="User:Isomorphic">Isomorphic</a> 07:48, 29 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>On the user's fifth edit (and first day) on Wikipedia, he reverted to an old POV version of the article which another user had created and which he and the other user had spent many weeks trying to insert. The last copy of this version was buried 30 edits and 11 days in the past (one hoped, for good), yet somehow this neophyte user found it and reverted to it. As well, the day he joined Wikipedia he was already quoting Wikipedia policy. New users are rarely well versed enough in Wikipedia to do either of these things. Finally, the user had created a number of sockpuppets in the past for the purposes of reverting articles related to the Arab-Israeli conflict, as well as for the purpose of violating various Wikipedia policies. His last known sockpuppet was recently permanently banned from Wikipedia; hence, new sockpuppet. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg">Talk</a> 21:06, 26 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just out of curiousity, why does the history for that Talk: page show so many deleted versions (versions which I assume from the usernames who created them, without looking at them, are OK revisions)? <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 18:33, 29 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>good question. Also, why is there no deletion log?!

<dd>Probably because prior to 1.4, the system wasn't good about keeping that info; it had it for a while after the page was deleted, but seemed to lose track of if after a while. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 03:21, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The versions in the history jump from "00:42, 18 Jun 2004" to "05:10, 3 Dec 2004", which seems somewhat odd. Checking further, the deleted versions run from "23:23, 3 Jun 2004" to "05:11, 3 Dec 2004" (note slight overlap), but there's a version at "00:42, 18 Jun 2004" labelled "moved from MediaWiki talk:Wikipedialang" (note time match with start of gap). The deleted "05:11, 3 Dec 2004" version has a CSD notice on it for history merge. Sounds like the history merge somehow didn't get completed, or something? Anyone know of any reason I shouldn't undelete the versions that fit into the gap? <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 03:21, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)\</dd>

<dd>Just to round out the story, Jamesday advised me (on inspection of various technical details) that he is pretty much certain that all of them, as well as Jewjg, ThinkPink, Peter Phipps, and NeverAgain, are sockpuppets of <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlberuni_e425.html" title="User:Alberuni">Alberuni</a>, as I (and others) have been saying for weeks. (O.K., some of them like Peter Phipps, Crypto, Goines, Kosudo CONMEBOL, and 888 were surprises, but that was only because Alberuni hadn't gotten around to using them for mischief yet; the others, though, were obvious). By the way, just to understand the kind of inventively loathsome hatred that was going on here, have a look at his newest sockpuppet <a href="../../../n/e/v/User%7ENeverAgain_d78d.html" title="User:NeverAgain">NeverAgain</a>. The user page image, that of a famous Rembrandt painting of a Jew, is called "Jonah666". Jonah, of course, was the prophet who endangered those around him, and 666 is the number of the beast. The picture itself says "perennial" when you wave your cursor over it, an homage to Adolf Hitler's phrase "the perennial Jew". And of course, the phrase "Never Again" is one often used by Jews as regards the Holocaust. On top of everything else, the image may well be a CopyVio of <a href="http://www.kimbellart.org/database/images/jpg/AP1977_04.jpg" class="external text" title="http://www.kimbellart.org/database/images/jpg/AP1977_04.jpg" rel="nofollow">this</a>.

<dd>Well, with all due respect, I hardly think it's an admin issue. It wasn't until Jamesday told David Gerard that these were really sock puppets that we could actually <i>do</i> anything. I mean, I'm loathe to block suspected sock puppets on a whim and an instinct. I'd like to see some proof first. But now there is proof I have <i>great</i> pleasure in blocking Jewjg from EVER editing again. I actually asked David to let me have first crack at him. David is dealing with the rest. I'm only sorry that Jayjg had to go through all this: I've also been on the receiving end of Alberuni's abuse. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 14:42, 29 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>David, "I know it when I see it" can be a useful rule of thumb. The Wiesenthal/Alberuni abuse wasn't a borderline case, but was clear-cut, deeply offensive, and aimed at a specific ethnic group. Yet I was told that to block a user for personal attacks, the case would have to go to the ArbCom, but couldn't be dealt with in a summary way by an admin. I don't know whether that's true, but if it is, it seems wrong to me that someone can be blocked instantly and without warning for violating 3RR, yet can't be blocked for serious and sustained racial attacks without going to arbitration, especially when the user (Wiesenthal) confessed to being a sockpuppet. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">Slim</a> 22:42, Dec 31, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is a project page edit, not an article edit. You were trying to add new proposals to it in mid-stream and postpone the vote unilaterally, as per the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia%3AProposal_to_expand_WP%3ACSD&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia%3AProposal_to_expand_WP%3ACSD&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">history</a>. Reversion of such a move strikes me as entirely sensible. Reading WP:3RR, it says 'pages', not 'articles' ...

<dd>My understanding is that Arbtitrators should not participate in revert wars because, as Netoholic says, Arbitrators are meant to set a better example of behaviour. Bearing in mind the responsibilities of his new position, Neutrality's second revert - assuming there was not already a revert war on that page - was one revert too many. <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 17:44, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The 3RR obviously applies to articles. It was never intended to prevent the type of reversions that I did on the project page. It was a very sensible revert. Netoholic cannot be allowed to unilaterally add proposals and postpone votes against the express wishes of the author. He is free to <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_create_policy_4959.html" title="Wikipedia:How to create policy">try to create policy in a more reasonable way</a>. This was not a revert war.

No objections were raised at all, so I added it with no disruptive intent. When it became clear that some people objected, I proposed postponing the start of the vote, per <a href="../../../s/u/r/Wikipedia%7ESurvey_guidelines_ef72.html" title="Wikipedia:Survey guidelines">Wikipedia:Survey guidelines</a>. At no time did I do anything so "disruptive" as to warrant your actions.

<dd>Sigh. It's been a while since I looked at the history (since the changes to CSD were the kind of endless, silly Wiki-policy debates that I just can't stand, let alone have time for, so I hadn't followed them as they happened, and had to go read the history), so I'm going from memory here, but...</dd>
<dd>This whole thing struck me as really unseemly, and I was personally taken quite aback to see an Arbitator involved in this sort of thing - to basically echo what someone else said above, Arbitators really ought to have a "Caesar's wife" style when it comes to Wikipolicy and Wikiquette.</dd>
<dd>You are quite correct to point out that you had made your proposal on the Talk: pages some time before, with no negative comments. Alas, I'm not as up on policy about votes as I ought to be (and no time to read up now), but still, it seems to me that you certainly acted in the <i>spirit</i> of Wikiquette, in posting them to a Talk: page and letting a good period of time go by before acting on them, and in view of that, I personally would have found a rather different response to your changes more appropriate.</dd>
<dd>It is however also true that the 3RR page used the word "article" in one place, and "page" in another, before any of the editing started.</dd>
<dd>My suspicion for the lack of action is that there are lot of people here who feel the same way as I do - they don't like the way it played out, but can't put their finger on anything and don't want to get involved in what's already a big mess. Yes, that's not right, but alas it is human nature. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 16:26, 8 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think it has to be said that the 3RR is a total mess now, having become the favoured tool of POV groupings to eliminate dissenting voices on, for example, Christian and Israel related topics. It's easy to do, just keep removing any minority view until you wind someone up wnough to snap and break the rule, then get them blocked (I'm not saying that this is what happened here, but I am inclined to believe that there is at least one example further down the page and an Elememt of this in the CheeseDreams debate). My own view is that it is a bad law, and, as such, should just be scrapped, but I doubt I'll have much support in this, so I'd propose a debate on how to improve/refine it. Maybe pages where the rule has been broken could be protected for a 24 hour 'cooling off' period with nobody banned? <a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFiliocht_c3e2.html" title="User:Filiocht">Filiocht</a> 11:13, Jan 10, 2005 (UTC)</p>

The other complainant made no attempt at all but went straight to writing up his complaint. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 05:15, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not sure how to proceed on this one (and I'm about to be offline for 20 hours or so).

<p>So, I've been following up with him (see <a href="../../../j/u/g/User_talk%7EJugoslaven_9b8a.html" title="User talk:Jugoslaven">his talk page</a> and <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">mine</a>) and he seems to half get it. He claims to have permission for what he added at <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Civil_War_7a30.html" title="Spanish Civil War">Spanish Civil War</a>; I told him I wanted to confirm that, since he clearly did <i>not</i> have permission for some of what he added elsewhere; I let him know I was writing to the relevant site to confirm; he reinserted a bunch of this at <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Civil_War_7a30.html" title="Spanish Civil War">Spanish Civil War</a> while I'm still waiting to hear from the site in question. I don't really want to ban him -- I think he is well-intentioned but confused -- but it seems that a lot of what I'm saying is going right past him. Can someone else weigh in?

<dd>Life is short, and there are (as you note in your essay) large areas of knowledge we cover poorly that we really need to work on. Dealing with people who won't wise up counts (for me) as time lost. If they don't start listening (give them a blunt warning so they really should get the message), block them. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 05:44, 5 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've (long since) done that and haven't gotten an answer; meanwhile, Jugoslaven claims to have done that and gotten an answer in the affirmative and has been restoring the material. I have no specific reason to doubt his word, and since I have notified the site I assume I will hear from them sooner or later. I'll be a lot more comfortable about this after I get an answer one way or the other. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 06:31, Jan 7, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd warn him once and orphan all those images and put them on <a href="../../../i/f/d/WP%7EIFD_bb01.html" title="WP:IFD">WP:IFD</a>. If he persists, I'd block him. I don't think you're being squeamish: such images are fine for a family album, but not here. There is absolutely no need for an encyclopedia to show 3-year-old girls in diapers in articles on <a href="../../../l/a/p/Laptop.html" title="Laptop">Laptop</a> or <a href="../../../b/a/l/Ballet.html" title="Ballet">Ballet</a>, for instance. Neither is the 5-year old shown in <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diaper.html" title="Diaper">Diaper</a> appropriate: a <i>baby</i> might be, but 5-year-olds usually do no longer need diapers.

<dd>No, it certainly doesn't look innocent, and I never intended to say so. But things like this happen every so often on WP, and I cannot get really upset about it anymore. It's just annoying, and we have to get rid of these images somehow and preferrably quickly, too. Blocking the user is necessary only if he continues this behavior. If he stops it, the images will go anyway through <a href="../../../i/f/d/WP%7EIFD_bb01.html" title="WP:IFD">WP:IFD</a> (and be deleted). Unfortunately, they're not speedies, and I am not aware of any fast-track policy for deletion of content that may be potentially damaging to Wikipedia itself, such as harboring child pornography. Maybe we need such a process: then we could use it to fast-track delete these images. <a href="../../../l/u/p/User%7ELupo_5a34.html" title="User:Lupo">Lupo</a> 22:10, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>172 has aggressively and successfully asserted control over the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> article, supported by someone of self-identified similar political views RadicalSubversiv. I have been careful not to revert him, but to politely suggest well sourced edits to make the article neutral.</p>
<p>His request for others to do what he wishes to do and block me must be seen in the context of his previous conduct, which goes back a long time, where he has threatened other users, used profanity, distorted sources and in some cases just plain lied.</p>
<p>I have engaged in the Talk process as I thought appropriate. The Soviet Union article itself is protected. Now he wishes to assert control over the contents of the Talk page.</p>
<p>He has requested no fewer than a dozen times for users to block and ban me, in concert with left leaning associates like RadicalSubversiv. They have accused me of not being a real user, of being linked with discredited users I've never interacted with or hardly have, of using AOL IP's when I don't have access to them, you name it.</p>
<p>And why? Because I have a different perspective to 172 and his left wing associates and regard the article as failing even the most generous neutrality test. I have responded carefully to the arguments and to claims made by 172, I have said nothing about him personally and have no wish to do so. 172 has been the subject of an arbitration case where similar aggression was evident.</p>
<p>The archive of the Talk page indicates a level of abuse I didn't think was permitted at all, riddled with profanity and obscenity. His claim that I have engaged in such behavior does not withstand any scrutiny. 172 offered to withdraw from writing on the article and the talk page and I believe should be gently encouraged to do so. He has had a long time to enforce his will and some might think it's time to give someone else a chance.<a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertas_b65c.html" title="User:Libertas">Libertas</a></p>

<dd>I don't disagree that 172's editing on <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> has sometimes been territorial.

<dd>sure. I think you should just archive the whole ugly thing, wholesale, and see if you can write a short summary what you are arguing about. There seems to be a valid dispute at the core, and it just got out of hand. If Libertas and you agree to sort it out concisely, there is no need for intervention. And Libertas has shown prepared to start over, I think, by complying with rad's suggestion, even if this has temporarily added to the confusion. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 12:26, 5 Jan 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<p>I am not involved in that article but was recently blocked by an Admin who I was in dispute with. He blocked me without warning and without any reference to any rules. He resigned as a result.</p>
<p>I think this highlights a real problem. Blocking is a drastic penalty and except in very clear cases of vandalism should not be done without a disinterested party making the decision. That seems not to happen very much.</p>
<p>And while I am not at all familiar with the clitoris article and could just imagine the nasty pubescents running amok there, I found JFW's comments on this page disturbing.</p>
<p>JFW said "I'm not involved anymore (have given up), so I blocked both for 24h."</p>
<p>- Not what I could consider to be a disinterested party and in any event an outrageous basis for blocking them (maybe there was a better unstated reason)</p>
<p>and then when called to account by Fred Bauder responded</p>
<p>I was under the impression that the third revert was the blockable offense. I don't really care, I'll unblock these characters on your authority.</p>
<ul>
<li>If JFW doesn't know the rules, how can s/he be entrusted to enforce them</li>
<li>If JFW doesn't care about the situation, how can s/he continue to hold this authority over others.</li>

<p>I think the threshold for these unilateral blockings is too low. I think many people entrusted with the power are not coping well. And I hope some reforms are considered. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertas_b65c.html" title="User:Libertas">Libertas</a></p>

<dd>I know nothing about this other than what I have read here, but I have to say it reflects poorly on all concerned and the response to Fred Bauder beggars belief. We admins need to know the rules before applying them.

<p>Irate broke the 3RR and blanked an attempted solution at the clitoris (censored) article. Cookiecaper, I note, had not done four reverts and believe I miscounted there - apologies to him. The article needs sorted and while attempts have been made I find it shocking that the argument there has gone on for months without getting any closer to resolution. People continuing the edit war on the article itself need to be stopped, though in this isntance I see Cookiecaper as someone attempting to suggest a fix (though one that some do not agree with). I used to be involved in the discussion too but have now withdrawn, knowing that a solution isn't just around the corner. Do not be harsh on JFW as he too has been party to the ridiculousness of the discussions there. <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 11:00, 6 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>JFW should make very sure s/he knows the applicable policies before blocking someone. Especially in cases of "not being involved <b>anymore</b>" (in such a case I do not think <i>any</i> intervention is advisable). Otoh, admins are "not expected to be perfect", and honest mistakes will be corrected quickly by other admins. Admins <i>are</i> expected to have an above-average level of policy-adherence and civility, and are <i>naturally</i> expected to apologize to those affected by their mistakes.

<p>Yes, an adminstrator, but adminstrators are not summarily striped of authority should they make a mistake or two. Irate and Cookiecaper are the users who were edit warring.

<dd>I agree, frankly. It just means you have to do 5 diffs (one for the original edit, and then one for each of the reverts) - and then you usually have to do another 4 or so (if they have a single opponent), document the lot, etc. It can take quite a while (during which one cannot be doing the fun stuff - i.e. creating content). Alas, I doubt the rule will be changed. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 15:04, 7 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>oh dear an even more subjective judgement. Who defines "clearly edit waring"? The 3RR rule works as well as anything could and prevents revert wars from going critical. That is all you can do.

<dd>You've accused me, on this page, of breaking the 3RR. I have not done so, you seem to maintain that I have. Point me to the breach or retract your allegation. As for problems caused, I haven't caused any IMHO, it is you that have. That you consider me playing around with the letters in your sig offensive, compared with your antics, is laughable. I have no idea what the first phrase of your statment is about unless it a smoke screen to distract from the ensuing dishonesty.--<a href="../../../i/r/a/User%7EIrate_d7f6.html" title="User:Irate">Jirate</a> 22:27, 2005 Jan 7 (UTC)

<dd>I see your edits on clitoris (censored) as a violation of the 3RR, though you'll probably be pedantic about that. I wouldn't be saying you don't cause problems if you didn't - just looking at the way you handle comments on your talk page shows parts of that. As for my first statement, well clearly you are forgetting what you yourself have posted above. <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 22:38, 7 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Pedantic, you mean apply the rule as it is written down rather than in your own Violet World. The quality of you arguments in general is up to the level of your second sentence. I'm not forgeting what I posted, though I am capable of discerning from it, what is addressed to you and what is general comment, and your not refering to any bits addressed to you. That you don't like the way I handle my comments doesn't make me a bad person, though your behaviour here in my opinion is putting you on the way.--<a href="../../../i/r/a/User%7EIrate_d7f6.html" title="User:Irate">Jirate</a> 22:49, 2005 Jan 7 (UTC)

<dd>In all honesty I really cannot be bothered to discuss anything further with you and feel you can't say anything bad against me. Cut out the personal attacks and I hope to not have to come across you again. <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 23:13, 7 Jan 2005 (UTC)
