<p>I've deleted both Jo Fennessey and Jo fennessey that were created by User:203.220.116.223. They have just asked (<a href="../../../c/a/m/User_talk%7ECambridgeBayWeather_e92a.html" title="User talk:CambridgeBayWeather">User talk:CambridgeBayWeather</a>) me to email them a copy of the deleted page so they can print it out. However, the article was nothing but an attack piece on what is a real person and I don't think that it would serve any useful purpose to provide it. On the other hand perhaps this comment <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ACambridgeBayWeather&amp;diff=28894830&amp;oldid=28880929" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ACambridgeBayWeather&amp;diff=28894830&amp;oldid=28880929" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> is colouring my view.

<p>As I'm sure everyone is aware, images are very slow to load, if they load at all for the past couple of weeks. Would removing the images used by the stub templates make a noticeable difference or not? I've seen this done in the past when there was an image loading problem but haven't seen it recently. Probably would be a good task for an authorized bot to do when required. I don't follow any of the mailing lists on a regular basis so don't know if this has been discussed there. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedWolf_0f32.html" title="User:RedWolf">RedWolf</a> 02:31, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have noticed this as well. Also, many small images are just HUGE images scaled down by the X pix command, like the Stop-hand, CVU-icon, and other wiki-icons. This is just silly, because the server still has to load the larger file, only to make it small.

<dd>What Voice of All pointed out seems to be the biggest factor in my experience, however the current instructions seem specifically to recommend using better-resolution images in place of smaller ones. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherparham_ee3b.html" title="User:Christopherparham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopherparham_f0e0.html" title="User talk:Christopherparham">(talk)</a> 04:39, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I seem to remember having asked one of the developers about this issue the last time the image servers were overloaded. Unless my memory has gone, the software actually does generate scaled-down versions of images and load those at full size rather than the whole image at reduced size, so that isn't the problem. — <a href="../../../r/d/s/User%7ERdsmith4_389f.html" title="User:Rdsmith4">Dan</a> | <a href="../../../r/d/s/User_talk%7ERdsmith4_959f.html" title="User talk:Rdsmith4">Talk</a> 04:45, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Both seem to be in order. The hardware should be able to support whatever the software permits, and as such, if images in signatures are a massive server drag, they should be disabled; however, we certainly need more/better image servers to ensure that legitimate images are fully functional. (I get the feeling I'm stating the patently obvious, but it's been a long time since the issue arose and neither of these things has happened.) — <a href="../../../r/d/s/User%7ERdsmith4_389f.html" title="User:Rdsmith4">Dan</a> | <a href="../../../r/d/s/User_talk%7ERdsmith4_959f.html" title="User talk:Rdsmith4">Talk</a> 06:08, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>RDsmith is correct - the server generates a smaller image. These are supposed to be cached, of course. I think we should ask Brion and/or Jamesday to see if it's actually a problem; certainly, images in a stub template serve no purpose other than to look cute. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 10:17, 16 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As much as I like cute stub templates, if they are slowing useful images down, we should shut them down for the time being. But with so many stub templates out there, is there anyway to make it easier? Perhaps use standarise them and use a bot to turn the images on and off depending on server load?--<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font color="green">Talk</font></a></sup> 00:05, 18 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Perhaps all of the stubs should use a standard template.

<p>There is a GNAA disruption campaign underway to have any and all articles related in any way to <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blog.html" title="Blog">blogs</a> purged from Wikipedia. See User:Timecop/The war on blogs for further information. Every article on their list will at the very least need to have GNAA-sockpuppet votes explicitly disallowed from its AFD tally. It may even be appropriate to simply shut down the AFD discussions at once, since almost all of them were nominated by GNAA sockpuppets in the first place. But I'm not prepared to dictate that or enforce it by myself. How, if at all should we proceed? <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 11:13, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Looking over the AFD discussions linked from there, I see no evidence of sockpuppetry on <i>most</i> of them (I explicitly didn't say <i>all</i> of them). The effort in principle doesn't seem to be a bad thing; Wikipedia is not a web directory, and it wouldn't surprise me if many blogs create a linkspam article about themselves on Wikipedia, even if they would fail <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. I would certainly object to prematurely closing these AFDs. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 11:26, 16 November 2005 (UTC)

I'm not arguing whether Wikipedia should or shouldn't have articles on blogs -- what I <i>am</i> arguing is that it's not the Gay Nigger Association of America's right to decide what Wikipedia should or shouldn't have articles on.

<li>I am a legitimate wikipedia user. I've cleaned up some articles, fixed typos, and I keep a watch on a few articles that interest me. And I happen to dislike blogs!

<li>Perhaps you missed the part where I said I started this effort as a legitimate wikipedia user. However, you for some reason insist that this is GNAA related (it is not), and are turning this into a name-calling shitfest. --Timecop 12:40, 16 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If it's not GNAA related, then kindly explain that I've so far identified eleven different users who have <i>never</i> contributed to Wikipedia before suddenly voting on every blog AFD. If it's not GNAA related, then kindly explain why some of them directly link to your War on Blogs page on their user page. If it's not GNAA related, then kindly explain why you're not the one doing any of the nominating; it's mostly being done by <a href="../../../s/k/r/User%7ESkrewler_3446.html" title="User:Skrewler">User:Skrewler</a>, one of those users who never existed before your war on blogs started. (Okay, I take that back: before your war on blogs, Skrewler's entire edit history consisted of four edits to <a href="../../../m/e/t/Talk%7EMethamphetamine_f967.html" title="Talk:Methamphetamine">Talk:Methamphetamine</a> last December.)

<li>Reposting the gist of comments I sent to Bearcat directly: once nominations are up on AfD, they are open to the community as a whole to vote on them. Admins know enough to discount suspicious or SP votes. The fact that the nominations are part of an organized campaign to scourge blog articles from WP is irrelevant as I see it, insofar as the AfD process is designed to canvass opinions and let consensus develop. A better tactic is to state clearly why you feel such articles should be allowed to stay and let the force of your arguments sway other editors. I have voted against many of these articles, and I am not related in any way to GNAA. Is the position of the many of us who have voted to delete somehow soiled because they are voting on the same lines? <a href="../../../d/o/t/User%7EDottoreso_44ff.html" title="User:Dottoreso">Dottore So</a> 13:04, 16 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>LOL. I forgot myself and the diktat of WP NewSpeak! Last I checked, no one had objected to the majority of nominated articles. Those that prompted a legit and interesting debate about how to cover blogs/blogsphere and involved plenty of registered users. I think Bearcat's reaction - understandable given the folks involve - was premature in terms of portraying the extent of the problem. Anyway, point taken even if I disagree. <a href="../../../d/o/t/User%7EDottoreso_44ff.html" title="User:Dottoreso">Dottore So</a> 21:20, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>And as I replied to you, part of the problem is that once a certain level of sockpuppetry has been passed, it becomes impossible for an admin to even <i>figure out</i> what the genuine consensus of real Wikipedia users <i>is</i>. Speaking as an admin, I once (quite recently, in fact) actually closed a debate early and renominated it from scratch because it had gotten too out of control. And considering that the first person to reply to my initial comment here didn't even <i>see</i> some of the sockpuppetry going on, I think I can safely say that sockpuppets aren't always immediately obvious. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 13:20, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Since there are several sockcheckers active now, I'm sure that checking for actual duplicate accounts would not be a problem. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 16:31, 16 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Of the sixteen articles currently on GNAA's AFD hitlist, exactly <i>two</i> of the debates have <i>any</i> sockchecking going on, and on both of them the socks have been turning around and tagging <i>real</i> voters as socks in retaliation.

<li>You know as well as I do that a sockpuppet isn't always detectable through an IP check alone; some sockpuppets are distinct users who come along to support the campaign despite never having edited before. An IP check alone isn't going to detect that kind of sockpuppet — that kind requires manually reviewing the contributor's edit history, and so far only two of the sixteen debates currently active have had that kind of sockchecking occur. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 01:02, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

At the very least it will help clear up the crap. Incidently, I understand why Bearcat has concerns.

<p>There is a quite substantial vandalism problem -- at least 20 to 30 acts of vandalism a day -- on articles relating to the <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Revolution_970a.html" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a>: anything from that article itself to people involved in it to articles about particular documents, the causes of the Revolution etc. A handful of these article have been listes as most-vandalized pages, but the vandalism is scattered onto too many pages to make that a particularly effective tactic. Most of them are grafitti type vandalism; some are more insidious (uncommented anonymous changes of dates or numbers that waste a lot of someone's time determining whether this is a correction or vandalism). Almost always they are the sole edit from the IP in question. Does anyone have any suggestion what could be done about this? It wastes quite detectable time and effort, especially when it is the non-grafitti variety. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 06:16, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think this is a long term problem. Pretty much every student in the western world at some point has to do a project on the French Revolution, and this leads to a steady stream of immature vandalism. It increasingly seems like we need a technical or policy change to deal with the small, but growing, class of extremely popular articles that receive constant streams of vandalism. At a certain level of popularity, most visible with the <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> article, the current Wiki system is beginning to fray. Over the last few weeks there have been various ideas for what to do about this proposed at <a href="../../../g/e/o/Talk%7EGeorge_W._Bush_758a.html" title="Talk:George W. Bush">Talk:George W. Bush</a>. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 19:40, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nlu, it would be hard to make a list: this is scattered over at least 100 articles. Because I have about 10% of my watchlist devoted to this period, I noticed that there was a pattern. Some of this is doubtless semi-random student vandalism, but the fact that so much of it comes as single acts of vandalism from otherwise unused IP addresses suggests to me that this is something more systematic than that. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 20:34, 24 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Removing comments from userpages is not really vandalism, but it is sort of a no-no, and a red flag to most folks. There's not really much you can say here, except to remind him that talk pages are in fact for talking -- he's free to remove comments if he wants I suppose, but other folks are equally free to leave them in the first place, as long as they aren't running afoul of some WP policy. I don't think 3RR applies to talk pages, either, since users are free to remove comments from their own talk pages as they wish. · <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0"><b>Katefan0</b></a><sup><a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKatefan0_4566.html" title="User talk:Katefan0">(scribble)</a></sup> 05:23, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Note the contradictions in Jiang's own statements above: "I try to tell him that he (and myself as well) almost violated the 3RR". In fact, Jiang claimed specifically that I <i>had</i> violated the 3RR. On my talk page, he wrote, "you were in danger of getting blocked because you made three reverts within 24 hours on multiple occaisions:" However, the examples he cited included articles <i>other</i> than the one over which he and I disagreed, and his time stamps were incorrect anyway, making his claims dubious on that score alone. I considered this flailing, and a way of striking back at me because I was pointing out how he kept inserting POV into the article. He condescendingly kept referring (as in the above) to me as a "new user", which is incorrect and irrelevant. At no point did I ignore the content. And Jiang suggesting I "need some help" is disingenuous and offensive. I certainly recognize that in most cases, removing comments from talk pages is bad form, but in this case, his remarks on my talk page were inaccurate, inappropriately (and without basis) threatening, and basically just another way of striking back outside the discussion. I guess I'd say, "this user has a case of bad wikiquette and needs some help."-- <a href="../../../p/k/t/User%7EPKtm_9f50.html" title="User:PKtm">PKtm</a> 06:30, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've seen that there's often confusion about what our policies actually are, especially as most policy pages are rather long and tend to mutate over time. Such matters frequently come up at ANI, such as "can an admin unblock himself?" or "are multiple accounts allowed?" et cetera. Therefore, I have attempted to create a summary of policy on this page. We really don't have that much policy to begin with, after all. The intent of the page is not to <i>explain</i> anything (since the policy pages already do that) but to create a simple summary, and link to explanations.</p>

<dd>Without even looking into his contribution record, I can say this: constantly uploading copyrighted material, notably after being warned not to do so, is grounds for blocking and, in case of persistence, banning. Jimbo has made it quite clear about how he feels about people who upload copyrighted material (and I believe he's referring to this kind of behavior): they are jeopardizing the entire project, and ought to be banned (that's how he put it). About the images themselves: pictorials from magazines (adult or not) are copyrighted, and we cannot use them unless we have consent. Only a magazine's cover may be used under the Fair Use provision. If this user continues to upload those images, delete them on sight (maybe that'll get a message across).

<p>I'm sure I'm not the only one to have noticed that Wikipedia is becoming increasingly difficult to edit, with server errors etc. That would most likely be caused by server overload, I guess. Does anybody know if anything is going to be done about that? Are there any plans by devs or board to alleviate that? Or are we getting more money for more servers?

<p>I believe that the supermajority numbers for RFA, AFD, RM, if they do indeed exist, should be detailed at RFA, AFD, RM, and not on a page about consensus.

<p>Well this story has to begin somewhere so lets start back on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_7.html" title="September 7">September 7</a>. Some rather nasty language used by <a href="../../../m/c/f/User%7EMcfly85_4985.html" title="User:Mcfly85">User:Mcfly85</a> was used when he quit Wikipedia typing "I have retired from editing, thanks for nothing, fuckers." Well, on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_30.html" title="September 30">September 30</a>, I discovered the vulgar language he had written. I simply took off the word "fuckers". In the edit history, I made I typo in my speech and typed in&#160;:</p>
<p><b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Mcfly85&amp;diff=22755274&amp;oldid=22308503" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Mcfly85&amp;diff=22755274&amp;oldid=22308503" rel="nofollow"><i>fulger</i> instead of <i>vulger</i></a></b><i>. Remember this because its a key part in this vandalism account.</i></p>
<p>Two months later, on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_24.html" title="November 24">November 24</a>, <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">User:Titoxd</a> reverted some vandalism on my, <a href="../../../s/w/d/User%7ESWD316_5e06.html" title="User:SWD316">User:SWD316</a>, user page by the Anon IP addresses known as User:63.18.246.17 and User:63.18.172.52. Im supposing the IP addresses are the same person considering the vandalism was only 12 minutes apart. The vandalism was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:SWD316&amp;oldid=29105701" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:SWD316&amp;oldid=29105701" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:SWD316&amp;oldid=29106557" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:SWD316&amp;oldid=29106557" rel="nofollow">here</a>. In the first c ase of vandalism on my user page it said, <i>"reverted fulger language" Learn to spell, fuckface"</i>. I didn't realize my page was vandalized until I looked at the history of my page. I immediately recongnized the "fulger" part and contacted <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">User:Titoxd</a>, who reverted the edits previously and he suggested I go here. Also, on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_26.html" title="November 26">November 26</a>, McFly85 reopened his user page and resumed editing.</p>
<p><i><b>Proposal</b></i>: I think McFly85 and the 2 accounts above should be blocked permantly for vandalizing my user page and Wikipedia. Mcfly85 makes nothing but poor edits and choices on WIkipedia and now makes vandal IP accounts to insult users. Titoxd also suggested that we run a <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/CheckUser" class="extiw" title="m:CheckUser">CheckUser</a> on Mcfly85 to see if this is true.

<dl>
<dd>For what it's worth, I'm not sure this merits a checkuser. If he continues to vandalize, you can handle it from there; if not, let bygones be bygones. In any event, we never perma-block IPs unless they're open proxies, and it's highly unusual to perma-block users for vandalism without ArbCom intervention, or a clear community consensus for such a block.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On another note, <b>SWD316</b>, you shouldn't change a user page, unless in the case of vandalism. If he wanted to write 'thanks for nothing, fuckers', that's his right, and it's not your job, nor any editor's, to stop him from doing so.

<p>I'd like to urge my fellow admins: if you are involved in a dispute with somebody over substantive matters, or if someone is insulting you, it is really pretty bad form to block that person. I'm not saying it is never correct: if you contact a user with whom you have no "history" to give him/her an appropriate warning on a matter with which you are previously uninvolved and he/she responds with a tirade of abuse, and continues the behavior you were warning about, that doesn't put you out of the running for throwing the necessary block. But if you have a long history of conflict with someone, or if you are currently involved in a content dispute, or if he/she just insulted your best buddy, life would be a lot simpler if you took off your admin hat and asked for a block precisely as if you were not an administrator. If you are clearly in the right, someone else will presumably take action. If you are not, well, that's the breaks: being an admin is not supposed to mean that you decide unilaterally how to resolve matters in which you are a disputant. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 01:18, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Am I missing something obvious, or is there something wonky with image deletions lately? Of the four I've deleted today, three only hit the image description page, leaving the image itself and (when it was there to start with) the metadata. See, for example, Image:LVhouse2.jpg. They still showed up when I went to check their articles, too.

<dd>I've had this happen in the past. For reaons I won't pretend to know, it has previously been fixed by restoring the page, and then using the standard delete button (there won't be the usual "all revisions link", for some reason). This appears to make the image go away. I do not think it is a caching problem, since I too say the example image above, and had never visited it before. It's gone now, though and MediaWiki agrees. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 16:18, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

<p>Hi. I'm not an administrator; I'm looking for the attention/input of the administrators. If I shouldn't be posting here, I'm sorry; please let me know where I should have put this instead.</p>
<p>I'm just alerting you to the beginnings of a potentially sticky situation. You've read about "The War on Blogs" and how technically, everything that has happened has been in process so far. This is no different, but it looks like conflict will continue/be further inflamed.</p>
<p>A bunch of blogs, podcasts and other websites have now been deleted using XD2, completely in process, though sometimes shortly after a failed AfD on the subject. See, for example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=TechPhile&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=TechPhile&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">this edit history</a>. (I undeleted this one, because I felt strongly about it, but it's the only one I've touched and I actually agree with many of the deletions.)</p>
<p>If you check out <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecksiewolfie_cb6c.html" title="User:Secksiewolfie">User:Secksiewolfie</a>'s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Secksiewolfie&amp;offset=0&amp;limit=500|contributions" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Secksiewolfie&amp;offset=0&amp;limit=500|contributions" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, you will find that many of them are XD2s. (A couple are for voting in an AfD about the GNAA.) I had concerns that Secksiewolf may be a sock, but he has content on his userpage that helps allieviate my concerns. Nevertheless, I wish he would make contributions in addition to his deletions.</p>
<p>If you investigate further, you will also see that Haakon has reverted a number of the XD2s with the message, "rvt vandalism." It may be that Haakon has these pages on his watchlist. He doesn't appear to be stalking, IMHO, because he didn't go through all of Secksiewolfie's XD2s. However, the use of the term "vandalism" could be considered inflammatory. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Teh_Scene&amp;diff=28903053&amp;oldid=28900580" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Teh_Scene&amp;diff=28903053&amp;oldid=28900580" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=PuntBarra&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=28903101" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=PuntBarra&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=28903101" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=My_Way_%28Web_portal%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=28903016" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=My_Way_%28Web_portal%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=28903016" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pagat.com&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=28902927" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pagat.com&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=28902927" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Solar_Death_Ray&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=28902670" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Solar_Death_Ray&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=28902670" rel="nofollow">[10]</a></p>

<dd>Er, Extreme Deletion (1 or 2) just isn't the way that articles are deleted here. Blanking a page <i>is</i> considered vandalism.

<dd>Ouw. It's not my fault, but I do feel a bit sorry that that happened. It's ok for folks to try out XD methods, but they're only temporary. Once you've tried an XD, you're supposed to clean up after yourself.</dd>
<dd>Trying out XD on pages *AFTER* they've passed though AFD is probably not the way to go.

<p><a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBonaparte_0e16.html" title="User:Bonaparte">Bonaparte</a> contacted me asking that someone review <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a>'s block of him for "persistent uncivility without useful contribs".</p>
<p>Mikkalai, perhaps you could list some edits or edit summaries constitute incivility? I ask because the two of you have been in enough disagreement over matters related to Moldova and related topics that you are not a disinterested party here (nor am I).</p>
<p>I think that in the circumstances Mikkalai should either provide some concrete evidence of incivility (which may well exist, though I don't recall anything from Bonaparte that was particularly beyond the pale), or Bonaparte should be unblocked. And I think that, in general, individual admins should be very hesitant to block people with whom they themselves have been in conflict over substantive matters: on the rare occasion I've had this level of complaint against someone other than a vandal, I never throw the block myself. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 21:06, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I gotta agree. Bonaparte has been very civil in my dealings with him. He emailed me to ask for help, here's the message:</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p>Can you please unblock me?! I am blocked by <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">User:Mikkalai</a> a russian who had me blocked now for the third time only because I don't agree with his statements.

<blockquote>
<p>This is what I reply today:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Actually he just put fan on flames. He didn't block the user who labelled others as "knocenii- sperm". He was not cooperative at all and he just reverted the text without any explanation. Until Administrator Ronline told him to calm down he was just supporting and encouraging this kind of approach. Just look at his history. -Mark Williamson (User:Node ue) said:" Bonaparte, tu eshti koncenii!!! " -Mikka User:Mikkalai said: "That's a tough one for Bonaparte: if he recognizes this as an insult, then he will admit that Moldovan is not identical to Romanian, if he will not, then he does not know Moldavian.&#160;:-)" mikka (t) 00:12, 12 November 2005 (UTC) -Mark Williamson (User:Node ue) said: "Indeed&#160;:) that was the intention..."--Node With this kind of support from Administrator User:Mikkalai is no wonder that the things are going in this way that he continues to labelling others as "koncenii" like Dpotop, Anittas and others. They are continuing sabotagging this page. And still he was not blocked for a period of time to stop this kind of bad approach.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I agree to unlock the page since we are here a majority of people who supports the same one thing:Moldovan is identical with Romanian. The majority of users are: Bogdangiusca, Ronline, Dpotop, Bonaparte, Anittas, Jmabel, Dacodava, Constantzeanu, Mihai, Alexander_007, EvilAlex, Mihaitza, Duca, Domnu Goie, AdiJapan, Gutza, Vasile, Jeorjika and many others! Or we can vote to state our version of the page. Bonaparte talk &amp; contribs</p>

<dd>Now, without going into the ins and outs of it, I thikn he has a point, and that Mikkalai has been a bit heavy handed. This does not look to me to be out of control at this point, but if anyone is being unmutual then it is not Bonaparte, in this exchange at least. So let's have some conrete examples, and maybe a voluntary agreement not to block people in active dispute without reference to a neutral third party - it looks bad. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <a href="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" rel="nofollow">(W)</a> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 21:38, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I would like to thank the person who unblock me, if it was Mikka he repaired the mistake that he made. He kept a monopol of that page even when the majority agrees with my point of view. However I am asking for an adivice for me, how should I further react in case he will continue to make bias edits without any explanation and to continue to bias block other users. Anyway it will be inacceptable to warn me like he previous did like "you were blocked for the third time" and so on, and now to have a reason to block me, when he made actually an <b>illegal blocking</b>. <a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBonaparte_0e16.html" title="User:Bonaparte"><font color="#FFFFFF" style="background: maroon;">&#160;Bonaparte&#160;</font></a> <a href="../../../b/o/n/User_talk%7EBonaparte_ba39.html" title="User talk:Bonaparte"><small>talk</small></a> <small>&amp;</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bonaparte_0181.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bonaparte"><small>contribs</small></a></dd>

<p>Jmabel, I was not at particular disagreement with him. I came to the page amid the heated revert war with a dozen of occasional anon accounts reverting. I protected the page at a version which both sides of normal editors considered reasonably fair, with the exception of Bonaparte. The talk page was a mess, with people busy calling each other names rather than put forth arguments. I put a warning <b>in bold</b> on the page, reminding about the policy you know which one. After it was ignored, I blocked the first ones who violated after this warnig. I was also persistently blocking badmouthing and reverting anons (now they are gone). After that tyhe page retured to a reasonably civil debate. Only Bonaparte continued flaming. I blocked him for a week once more. He failed to control himself again and continued personal attacks: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Moldovan_language&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=29224050" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Moldovan_language&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=29224050" rel="nofollow">this was my reaction</a>. You don't recall anything from Bonaparte because all this disgusting quarrel has already been archived before you came to the page. If you are interested in it, take a look there, if you have spare time. Also feel free to inspect contributions of Bonaparte and see for yourself whether he made any contributions beyond pushing his opinion that Moldovans and Romanians are the same and Moldovan and Romanian are identical without producing any new arguments, only shouting and badmouthing.</p>
<p>If you want to unlock him, good luck. I already retired from the page, since it looks like almost all people behave in a civilized way. I have better things to do. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 21:39, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ah, "just this Guy", do you think I cannnot find a person who would happily block a person who is persistently badmouthing? Good luck with your new buddy. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 21:45, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>As for "third party", <b>I am</b> the third party. Until all this mess started I did not care about the Moldovan language. I equally resisted to ungrounded changes of node ue (as seen in the talk page) and added into the locked article the chages proposed by the opposite side that were <b>based on facts</b>. Right now I posted on the talk page three crucial simple questions, which would decide whether the page will be unprotected or not. In fact, it seems that the consensus is right here, beyond the corner, and pasionate shouts of Bonaparte are hardly helpful. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 21:54, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>One more remark: Bonaparte says about "huge personal attack". Read it for yourself: <a href="../../../m/o/l/Talk%7EMoldovan_language_b467.html#Not_helping.21" title="Talk:Moldovan language">Talk:Moldovan language#Not helping!</a> While it is written in a heated way, it addresses real issues. Compare it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Moldovan_language&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=29224050" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Moldovan_language&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=29224050" rel="nofollow">with this clean-cut attack</a>.</p>
<p>I am unblocking Bonaparte so that he can address them <b>in a civilized way</b> and referring to <b>facts</b>. Otherwise I will surely find a "fourth party", since looks like I am the main villain here. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 22:16, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Mikka, I don't think you are the villain, I just think that in this case Bonaparte has a point.

<p>I see Bonaparte is blocked again, following some intemperate references to Stalin (not quite a Godwin post, though, it was relevant in context, albeit quite likely a propaganda myth). Again, I think the block is excessively harsh, but again I think he is not without fault. I have suggested to him (again) that he try the proper methods for resolving the dispute rather than trading insults. I can see why Mikka has lost patience with him: to my untutored eye it looks like the bone of contention is the paragraph "Presently the Moldovan language, in its official form, is near-identical to Romanian. In fact, a number of high-ranked Moldovan officials declared in public that Moldovan and Romanian are the same. At the same time, there are differences in spoken language, most significantly due to the heavy influence of the Russian language in Moldova." Perhaps someone could explain to me why he finds that offensive, so I can help calm him down? It strikes me that the above paragraph is a fair statement. Am I right that the single word "near" is the root of his problem? And Mikka, you might have been the white knight to start with, but you do seem to have taken sides here, and that looks bad to an outsider. Others have insulted Bonaparte without being blocked; I think he is disputatious not malicious. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <a href="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" rel="nofollow">(W)</a> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 19:11, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Technically it seems you took the right action, however I believe this is a case of <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>, as the initial block was totally disproportionate (as far as I can tell anyway, I may be wrong if there is some history here or something). A few days ago I was autoblocked myself because my bot was briefly blocked, when I unblocked myself I was immediately re-blocked for violation of this rule, I think it was totally crazy and very un-wiki like, it was also extremely frustrating and a very quick way of losing good editors. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 17:09, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>You missed out the disruption clause, which I suppose would be Ed's justification (not saying I agree with that, just saying).

<dd>You can't use IAR and technically in the same sentence, it is a contradiction in terms. Unblocking when you have been accidentally blocked is obviously fine. Unblocking yourself because you disagree with the nature of a block is emphatically not. Such an action was part of Stevertigo's recent de-adminningish. It is not unwikilike, since we block all the time. And Ed Poor may well be crazy, so you have a point there. I trust the relevant talk page has been availed of before coming here? -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 17:18, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's fine to unblock yourself when you're hit by an autoblock meant for someone else (even your own bot - the point is to stop the bot, not you yourself, from editing), so it appears that whoever reblocked Martin was being overzealous. However, unblocking yourself when you and the person who blocked you are in disagreement about the validity of the block is wholly another matter, and is inexcusable as far as I can tell. — <a href="../../../r/d/s/User%7ERdsmith4_389f.html" title="User:Rdsmith4">Dan</a> | <a href="../../../r/d/s/User_talk%7ERdsmith4_959f.html" title="User talk:Rdsmith4">Talk</a> 17:17, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>There are over 600 admins here, with dozens (at a minimum) being active at any given time. If you believe an inappropriate block has been placed, there's several recourses. I'd suggest first posting a note on your talk page and emailing the blocking admin. If the blocking admin refuses to unblock, email the mailing list or visit IRC. Unblocking yourself is probably the worst way to handle the situation. With the number of admins we have, I'd expect very rapid action on any obviously inappropriate blocks. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 17:18, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Per Bluemoose/Martin, I'd say that it's appropriate to unblock oneself if the block is the result of 'collateral damage' caused by the autoblocker, a dubious block of an AOL proxy, or some similar case—that is, if the block clearly isn't <i>intended</i> to affect the admin in question then I see no reason not to let him unblock himself.</dd>
<dd>For blocks that were deliberately applied to the admin in question, the blocked admin shouldn't go unblocking himself. (At most, the unblocking should be temporary, and solely for the purpose of requesting a review of the block at WP:AN/I.) Even in cases where the block is inappropriate, it's best to let another admin do the unblocking. To do otherwise is to ask for block wars and all kinds of other trouble.</dd>
<dd>Given the abusive unblocking message left by Duncharris (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3ADuncharris" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3ADuncharris" rel="nofollow">the blocking log</a>) he probably needs a bit of time to cool off, and the reblocking by Asbestos should stand. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 17:25, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, it's really not. People take multiple edits to make an article - it's not at all uncommon to see a flurry of five or six edits at the start of an article's history page. To tag an article as a speedy within a minute of its creation is to assume bad faith in the creator - give them some time to finish their initial version of the article before you whack it. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Phil Sandifer</a> 17:30, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not disputing your unblocking, but why is it wholly inappropriate to tag an article within minutes of its creation? Isn't that the whole point of newpages patrol? Wouldn't it have been infinitely more productive for Duncharris to have expanded the article slightly and then removed the tag instead telling another editor to "fuck off"? Or perhaps he could have even began the article with the expanded version? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 17:30, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>It is appropriate to delete some articles on sight, and to tag them on sight. There is surely no disagreement over that, unless you're such a rabid inclusionist you need an inclusionectomy. I would suggest that an article whose first word is "sir" in the kinghthood sense should, however, be allowed more than 1 minute to form. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 17:38, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Indeed - I've never disputed whacking patent nonsense and the like on sight. Things that appear to be about people and plausibly notable subjects, on the other hand, do us no harm by sitting for a day before we kill them to see if someone wants to add the assertion of notability. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Phil Sandifer</a> 17:47, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>New pages patrol is important for catching patent nonsense, copyvio, and things like that. It's inappropriate to use it to zap pages before their creators have finished them. People, empirically, do not submit their edits in a single shot. It's very common to make a big edit in a series of five or six smaller edits. To make a claim of the form of "no assertion of notability" within a minute of creation is just unfair. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Phil Sandifer</a> 17:32, 21 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's why you need to do the asserting of notability in the very first edit. Even if you don't get around to editing the article after that, at least we won't be stuck with a crap article. The point of Newpages patrol is to get rid of crap. Creators should make sure their entries aren't mistaken for crap. We can only watch newpages that have been created in the last few minutes, if we don't act quick on something newly created, there's no real way to keep it in check apart from listing the articles on a user subpage for later checking which - to me - seems too time-consuming for something that should be quick and simple. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 23:33, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>When you tag an article as a speedy, you should have a look at who is creating it. That should be common sense. An anon, a user with no edit history...things like that.

<p>Whoa, deja vu. I once {{<a href="../../../d/b/_/Template%7EDb_645c.html" title="Template:Db">db</a>}}'d a stub Dunc wrote on a biologist, without realizing who the author was, and got an edit summary along the lines of "don't be stupid". If I had been an admin at the time, I wouldn't have even considered blocking him even if he had dropped the f-bomb on me, and a certainly didn't complain about it, even to him; I made a mistake, and it didn't bother me at all. Dunc probably shouldn't have unblocked himself, but the block was pretty silly in the first place. Since when can an admin block someone for a single instance of a personal attack? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a> 18:18, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, since when can one such comment warrant a block. I could see "FUCK YOU YOU GONNA DIE!", but a curse word by an angry editor would, and should, only warrant a warning. Interesting that an admin gets blocked for losing his cool(which I admit he shouldn't have), but vandals can't get blocked until after they put "FUCK BUSH" three or four times all over articles. And off course, I have seen people defend the vandals too. Personally I follow a 2 strike rule,...but thats another story...Anyway, lets try to respect admins/editors more than vandals/trolls. If vandals can't get blocked this easily, then admins/editors cant either.<b><a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoice_of_All%28MTG%29_f816.html" title="User:Voice of All(MTG)"><font color="blue">Voice</font> <font color="darkblue">of</font> <font color="black">All</font></a></b><sup><a href="../../../v/o/i/User_talk%7EVoice_of_All%28MTG%29_da05.html" title="User talk:Voice of All(MTG)"><font color="blue">T</font></a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Voice_of_All%28MTG%29_2563.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Voice of All(MTG)">@</a>|<a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="darkred">ESP</font></a></sup> 18:28, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I saw the "Fuck off" edit summary while I was checking articles marked for speedy deletion. I left a polite note about it on Dunc's talk page, which I felt more apropriate than a block for a one-off incident (I didn't know about any others at the time, and didn't have time to investigate further). Dunc emailed me at about 4pm this afternoon (UTC) asking me to unblock him and made another personal attack against Ed Poor in the email. I've been out all day and didn't see the email until about 20 minutes ago, so I did not get involved in the unblocking. I would personally have blocked him for 12 hours for unblocking himself and the personal attacks in the email and his unblock summary. With all the information that I've since seen on the subject, I believe that RfC is the apropriate avenue for this to continue. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 21:04, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Violating policy four times in a year? Not something we should celebrate, but nor is it a huge deal. Taken as part of Dunc's wealth of contributions, and the fact that he <i>does</i> deal with a lot of kooks and mischief makers, we should not be criticising him.

<dd>Well for starters, IAR is not technically <i>policy</i>, whereas the others are. Now whether or not this specific block of Dunc was warranted can be argued elsewhere.

<dd>While some of these do significantly violated <b>Civility</b>, things such as "crap" don't, unless it is used in every other word&#160;;0. Anyway, the violations deserve warning, but blocking over this is just inconsistant, as Android and I have pointed out, and too severe. I believe, that with such comments, he SHOULD NOT be an administrator, and I would vote him down if I had the chance, but its too late for that. Blocking is just going to far. If he makes a clear,severe, and direct personal attack, and you warn him, and he does it <i>right again</i> to you, then perhaps 6 hours will do, but 24 for what seem to be more scattered events is just over the top.<b><a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoice_of_All%28MTG%29_f816.html" title="User:Voice of All(MTG)"><font color="blue">Voice</font> <font color="darkblue">of</font> <font color="black">All</font></a></b><sup><a href="../../../v/o/i/User_talk%7EVoice_of_All%28MTG%29_da05.html" title="User talk:Voice of All(MTG)"><font color="blue">T</font></a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Voice_of_All%28MTG%29_2563.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Voice of All(MTG)">@</a>|<a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="darkred">ESP</font></a></sup> 23:05, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have unblocked myself several times. The reason? I share an IP with someone who is quite obviously a regular vandal. I was recently blocked for <i>three months</i> because of this vandal's actions. Given that in an average three months I make 12,000 edits to Wikipedia - of which, to my knowledge, none are vandalous - and also given that several other bona fide editors share the same IP and pester me by email when there's a block on this IP, I felt justified in unblocking after a length of time that was considerably less than three months (one hour, to be precise).

<dd>It seems to me that his support for intelligent design is notable and verified, and thus encyclopedic. I am, however, generally sympathetic to the removal of non-encyclopedic or marginally relevent information - things like the place of employment of webcartoonists and band members, which are perhaps verifiable, but not hugely important. We shouldn't intrude on privacy, nor should we whitewash things. This seems to me a clear case of the latter, but I wouldn't draw a general line against removing things on the subject's request either. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Phil Sandifer</a> 15:55, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>That's just it. We shouldn't remove encyclopedic info, because this is an encyclopedia. We should remove non-encyclopedic andor irrelevant information, again because this is an encyclopedia. The subject shouldn't have any influence on this judgement.</dd>

<dd>Although, I'm worried about the principle of ever removing something at the subject's request, I basically agree with Phil. Any idea why he wants this information removed?

<dd>I agree with Kevin and Phil - it makes sense to consider requests for the removal of information on privacy grounds, but removing verifiable information simply on the grounds that the subject of the article <i>doesn't like it</i> is a very bad idea, IMO. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 17:15, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

I suspect whatever I end up deciding, there will be people demanding my head. --<a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoySmith_da3a.html" title="User:RoySmith">RoySmith</a> 04:06, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've put in 4 nihilartikels into Wikipedia so far, with 2 being found and subsequently deleted, yet leaving 2 undetected as of November 25 2005. These nihilartikels have begun to appear less bogus, as they have been "wikified" by some other users (including a sysop).

<p>If true, quite a confession: deliberately creating false articles is pretty serious vandalism, in my view. I'd consider this a basis for a ban, unless he will identify the articles and remove them.</p>

<dd>Brutal. Anyway, Home-churching is one of them, if you view this as being worthy of some special category of speedy deletion.

<dd>However, with one thing to note going forward: I do not want to see this situation degenerate into one where editors become motivated to comb through someone's edits for the purposes of finding "dirt". This situation can be resolved in a much more amicable way - for example, why not let Wonderfool tag those suspicious articles and send them to AfD? We are also forgetting that perhaps Wonderfool's statement may not be entirely complete - there might be something contextual that is missing. Finally, it may be the case that these nihilartikels may not be so - even if Wonderfool might have create them, it is also quite possible that they are meaningful to someone else. We just don't know. So for these reasons and other reasons, let's just take this one step at a time. Understandably, if we do find out an editor is deliberately sprinkling false articles into Wikipedia, that is at minimum an euphemistic irritance and a degeneracy of a certain level of trust - however, I don't think we need to act on this so harshly on this point at the moment. --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> 13:59, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agreed - immediate blocks should be preventative. Is he carrying on doing this after being warned? Nothing to suggest this. We don't block for punishment, so if he promises not to do it again, then that's an end of it. If he refuses to explain himself in a reasonable time, I'd support an indef block until he does so, but give him 48 hours to reply.

<p>I've only scanned this section, but I don't see anyone mentioning Wonderfool's actions at Wiktionary.

Anyways, read <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>, you'll see something like 'don't test how well Wikipedia works by creating bogus articles'. That's a violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>, vandalism, it lowers Wikipedia's respectability, and I can't think of any excuse for it from an editor who should know better.

<dd>Actually, i think the length of the ban is irrelevant. This isn't about punishment and sentence, it is about preventing future damage to the project. I have posted on his talk page demanding that he 1) identifies all his vandalism 2) indicates he understands his error and will behave in future. If those conditions are met, and met soon, then I'd let him be, at least unless he does it again. If they are not met, then we don't want him on wikipedia, and he should be banned either by admin consensus or ArbCom, it makes not odds. If you block him for a set time right now what will it acheive? If he reforms then it will be unneccessary and if he doesn't, then it won't be long enough. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><sup>ask?</sup></a> 02:55, 27 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>If the process fails, and he makes no reply in the next (say) 48 hours, I still see no need for a 'sentence' whether timed or otherwise. The solution is simple: we block him until he indicates that he will behave and comply. The length of the block is then in his hands not ours. We don't need to say whether it is infinite, for a year or for another 24 hours, it is simply until he indicates a willingness to contrbute properly. Refer it to Arbcom if you will, but IMHO Arbcom is for judging and pronouncing on difficult or controvertial cases - there is no difficulty here, and no judgement to be made - either he is going to comply or he is not - up to him.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><sup>ask?</sup></a> 20:59, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree - a contributor 1% of whose contributions are unreliable is worse than useless. I say <b>give him 48 hours to unambiguously undertake not to continue inserting hoaxes into Wikipedia, and if he fails to do so then ban him permanently without wasting any further time on discussion.</b> Then go through everything he's ever edited to make sure whether they're accurate or not. -- <a href="../../../a/r/w/User%7EArwel_Parry_70fd.html" title="User:Arwel Parry">Arwel</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/w/User_talk%7EArwel_Parry_e253.html" title="User talk:Arwel Parry">talk</a>) 00:05, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Firstly, please can we stop the cookie talk. When some people are genuine concerned about a user's conduct, by all means say you think they may be over-reacting, but dismissing their concerns with trivial humour is extreemly patronising! It adds nothing to the debate and just gets folk's backs up.</p>
<p>To return to the substantive point, at no time have I suggested that Wonderfool be banned, much less that I or any admin should do so unilaterally. I suggested that we might agree a conditional block, with the perfectly reasonable demand that he agrees that he should adhere to basic policy in future (i.e. no more vandalism). His last contribution (above) effectively promised more disruption, and tht is in itself blockable. Arbitration committies are for arbitrating (and there is no inter-user dispute here). As I say, Snowspinner can refer this to Arbcom if he wants - but to insist that admins can't use common sense and consensus to protect wp against an unretracted threat of vandalism is bureaucracy, and smacks of a desire to keep all the power in one place. Arbcom have enough to do. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><sup>ask?</sup></a> 01:04, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I doubt you'd get anywhere banning him, blocking him, or making agreements with him. He's a little...odd. He was also an admin on Wiktionary until he got indef blocked for recreational vandalism. *SHRUG*. It doesn't take much to make a sockpuppet to edit with, so bans are only really useful for prevention. And arbcom? I doubt they'd accept the case at this point. --<a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhroziac_d326.html" title="User:Phroziac">Phroziac</a> <sub>.</sub> <small>o</small> º <sup>O (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhroziac_3a1f.html" title="User talk:Phroziac">mmm chicken</a>)</sup> 01:58, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I must say that I am surprised that the cookie talk was so offensive, but I accept that it was, and I apologize for my mishandling of the tone of the conversation. I do think that people are over-reacting here, to an extent that got my back pretty far up too. Many of the positions taken above are quite rigid, which disturbs me. I believe that using common sense would not lead to blocking Wonderfool. Maybe watching his edits for a while, maybe talking with him about it, but if his edits are mostly good he should be mostly welcome. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreplySpang_52d7.html" title="User:FreplySpang">FreplySpang</a> <a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreplySpang_a627.html" title="User talk:FreplySpang">(talk)</a> 02:01, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oddly enough, not very much. I'm sorry to see Phroziac's note about his history on Wiktionary, and I hope that he chooses to continue to make positive edits here. But right now, I think it's an inflamed situation, and my preference is to let it calm down a bit rather than inflame it further. I'm quite sure that people will be monitoring his edits for the next several days. If he starts a pattern of negative edits, then blocking him is appropriate.

<dd>It's my opinion that the wheel war that was already starting to brew would have continued, if not escalated, if we had not stepped in. It's clear that there is not community consensus to ban him, although it might have developed after a week or two of block/unblock games, which are bad for Wikipedia. Our action avoids a wheel war, and therefore was clearly something had to be done. This is precisely the sort of situation where the Arbitration Committee has no choice but to act.

<li>All right, I'll try to respond more specifically to your question (but this is about as much information as you are going to get). At 7:30 PM EST yesterday (Sunday), I posted a comment to the arbcom mailing list describing the situation, including the on-going wheel war. Following up on that email, 4 other arbitrators and one former arbitrator expressed extreme disapproval of wonderfool's actions, and the emergency decision was hammered out. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> 06:54, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Ok, no further information available... you don't see a problem with that? It's <i>not</i> ok for a full open and accountable discussion here to set up a block-until-apologises, but a group that apparently will-not-be-named can? Please don't give me TINC, it's not about that. It's about the fact that if decisions are going to be made, they should withstand the light of day. Saying things like "four other arbitrators" only makes it worse. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F">brenneman</font></a><a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(t)</sup></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aaron_Brenneman_1eac.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(c)</sup></font></a> 07:00, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>A one-time application of IAR to accomplish a clearly necessary action does not justify a change to Arbitration policy. It is not even clear that the community has the right to change Arbitration policy, and certainly you do not have the right to do so without discussion. <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">WP:BOLD</a> does not apply to policy articles, especially not to ones like the Arbitation policy, which is special even amongst policy articles. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 16:11, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I personally think the Arbitrators probably cut this one right, even if it did involve some IAR on Arb policy. (Is it precedented, out of interest?) Any further nihiledits are prevented until the immediate problem is fixed and that can be basically immediately if Wonderfool gets his act together. If he won't fix it, then there is no particular reason to assume any good faith with his would-be edits. It also doesn't (I presume) preclude full Arbitration, with this order among the evidence, if such becomes necessary, although Dmcdevit raises a pertinent point. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 13:54, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Arbcom ruling is welcome and sensible: an editor who has both vandalised an threatended to do so again is (non-punitively) suspended, until he agrees to abide by basic wp policies and play nice. There is no sentence, since the block will be lifted as soon as he indicates a willingness to comply. (Indeed, I flatter myself that it is the same common-sense remedy that I proposed yesterday). The only issue that remains unsettled is: is it acceptable for a consensus of admins to impose such non-punative temporary suspensions in future (a common-sense extention of vandal/disruption blocking) - or do all such cases have to be refered to Arbcom (as Snowspinner has contented)? --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><sup>ask?</sup></a> 17:02, 28 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>As I see it, the reason the ArbCom stepped in is not so much because admins don't have the authority to deal with problems like this, but rather because he had been blocked, unblock, and reblocked, which indicates a wheel war. Wheel wars are bad, and our intervention was as much to stop the wheel war as to deal with the underlying problem. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 19:38, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Every single moment that he spends editing under his username is a moment that we can monitor.</li>
<li>Every single moment that he spends editing under his username is a moment that he can't spend editing through a hidden/anonymous name.</li>
<li>Every single moment that he spends editing through one of the easily-available subversive methods is a moment that we can not monitor. (He will be able to easily edit through these means regardless of the block)</li>
<li>Blocking always makes the blockee more hostile.</li>
<li>The only purpose to such a block can be to send a message to the community that we do not tolerate such action.</li>

<dd><a href="../../../n/i/h/Nihilartikel.html" title="Nihilartikel">Nihilartikel</a> has a very clear definition. It means the article is fake. The content is made-up. Whether or not that's the definition Wonderfool uses, it's the definition everyone thought he was using. Also, Wonderfool's {{<a href="../../../d/b/_/Template%7EDb_645c.html" title="Template:Db">db</a>}} rationale was "author admits hoax". If this doesn't imply "fake", I don't know what does. Maybe he purposely created possibly non-notable articles as a cover, so that he could later say that he did not know what "nihilartikel" meant, but his usage of "hoax" here should clear that up: he was trying to have us believe he made fake articles. See also his <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Javanais" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Javanais" rel="nofollow">VFD for Javanais</a></b>, where he says, "I apparently made this a long time ago. And, here, I don't think it's a real thing." And, immediately above, he calls these 3 articles "nihilartikels". — <small><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><b><font color="black">BRIAN</font></b></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="gray">0918</font></a> • 2005-11-28 17:34</small>
<dl>
<dd>If I were to assume good faith here (I'm not sure I entirely can, but I'll give it a try), Wonderfool, under pressure to mark his nihils as such, took a quick pass through his changes, and thought "hmm, I vaguely recall something dodgy about this Hot Puppies one... better mark it as {{db|hoax}}." An hour-and-a-half later, he had time to check it out a little more, realized it wasn't a proper nihil, and changed it from {{db}} to {{afd}}. What the deal is with Javanais, and how it could fit into such a good-faith narrative, I'm not sure. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 17:54, 28 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Why would he say that of his 4 nihilartikels, 2 had not yet been deleted <b>as of November 25 2005</b>?? Did he suddenly forget what 2 those were??

<li>In that case I support this block. Calling non-nihil articles, nihil to get out of a block and admitting to creating such articles in the first place (when it's not April Fool's day) is disruptive and grounds for blocking perhaps even banning. Purposely inserting fake information in Wikipedia shouldn't be allowed period. No matter who is doing it. I would block Jimbo if he were to start a vandalism spree. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 10:45, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>What is going <i>on</i> tonight? I'm simultaneously dealing with one Protestant nutter vandalising articles to add in anti-Catholic attacks and turning sentences around to say the exact opposite of what they once said. On other pages a Catholic nutter deleting things that aren't pushing a Catholic POV everyone. Meanwhile George W. Bush is like looney-central with all the vandals.

<li>This does prompt a thought - are some times more-vandalised than others? I mean, I know our traffic fluctuates, and people have anecdotal evidence, but there may be <i>proportionally</i> worse periods. Might be useful to know. hmm.

<dd>Yes, there are dead times and hyper times. These times do not follow a pattern however it is generaly quiet when US and Europe sleaps which is a 2,3 hour time frame (due to time zones).

<p>One thing that might be interesting (but its original research!) just for fun would be to compare vandalism traffic with full moons. Sounds strange I know, but I know some people who work in jobs who deal with the public (taximen, nurses, people taking calls in call centres, bar workers etc) all of whom say that at full moons they notice that the numbers of people they come across who are (i) aggressive, or (ii) obnoxious, or (iii) hyperactive, or (iv) plain nuts goes through the roof. One London taximan I know refuses to work during full moons. He found that he was attacked four full moons in a row. People in call centres joke about the utter nutters who seem to ring in every full moon. Everyone I discussed it with said how they always thought the claim about full moons affecting people (hence the word <i>lunatic</i> from <i>lunar</i>) was a myth until they started noticing that the numbers of people screaming abuse down phones in call centres would jump by 25%, the numbers of abusive people taximen would face would rocket. Even the police privately say (though they always say "don't quote me on this. They'll think I'm mad but . . . ") that <i>something</i> seems to be different in human behaviour at full moons. It would be fascinating to see if full moons impact on vandalism rates on WP. (And yes I am sceptical but puzzled. I'd love to see a statistical analysis look objectively at numbers.) <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:#006666; background-color:orange"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 00:32, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>According to this <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/12/1218_021218_moon.html" class="external text" title="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/12/1218_021218_moon.html" rel="nofollow">National Geographic</a> article, which quotes Ivan Kelly, a Canadian psychologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, "The studies are not consistent. For every positive study, there is a negative study." One study showed that dog bites double around full moon in England, while another showed that they were not more likely at full moon in Australia. The one in Australia actually showed that there were less dog bites at full moon. The speculation is that people think the full moon has an affect due to selective memories. Something unusual happens, it is full moon, so they must be linked. <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvil_Monkey_6b08.html" title="User:Evil Monkey">Evil Monkey</a> - <a href="../../../e/v/i/User_talk%7EEvil_Monkey_65b0.html" title="User talk:Evil Monkey">Hello</a> 01:12, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To give an example: A friend of mine in a call centre observed how on average every 9th call was "difficult" (obnoxious customer demanding the impossible or looking to blame someone else for their own screw-up). She noticed that on two full moons in a row, from filling out ticks in a box (She is one of these forever curious types) that in a full moon period it became an average of one-in-four. On one occasion, she had eight colleagues who sit together suddenly realised that <i>all eight</i> had screamers on the phone, all with completely ludicrous complaints (one was complaining about a 'redesigned' bill that had actually been redesigned 11 months before. He just never noticed till that morning!) and all getting so obnoxious the people taking the call had to terminate the call. None of the eight had ever had the experience where all of them, simultaneously, had screamers. Yet that day (a full moon) was so bad two of the eight had to go home they were so upset at all the calls. My friend went home to find that her husband, a taxi-driver, had been assaulted at work (he hadn't been before for months), and her children who get on brilliantly normally and never fight were in the middle of a screaming match. That day my editor, normally the calmest man on earth, shocked us all by losing his temper over a minor thing. (He was shocked himself.) It was thoroughly weird. I am really fascinated by the whole idea of this 'full moon' thing. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:#006666; background-color:orange"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 01:34, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I wouldn't read anything into it. It's confirmation bias. Something weird happens during a waxing crescent and you see no connection. Something weird happens during a full moon and you blame the moon. Besides, we're at waxing crescent right now, about half a month away from the full moon. — <b><a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Phil</a></b> <i><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">Welch</a></i> <small><a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_Poll_b43b.html" title="User:Katefan0/Poll">Katefan's ridiculous poll</a></small> 02:14, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
