<p>Copied from <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a></p>
<p>How do we handle cases like <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">Jguk</a> (<a href="../../../j/g/u/User_talk%7EJguk_0f46.html" title="User talk:Jguk">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jguk_7b15.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jguk">contribs</a>)? This person appears to me to be carefully timing his reverts to <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem.html" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> so as to repeatedly make his change against consensus while refusing to discuss on the talk page. I was ready to block him with a warning before I realized he technically had not violated the 3RR, so I wasn't sure I had the right to deal with him in that way.</p>
<p>I've reverted him, and I'm going to warn him that repeatedly reverting an article against such a clear consensus while refusing to discuss the edit on the article's talk page is vandalism and that if he continues he will find himself in dispute resolution and his ability to edit restricted. Any other comments? Should I just block him anyway, maybe a shorter block, as a warning? <a href="../../../j/d/a/User%7EJdavidb_f8c2.html" title="User:Jdavidb">Jdavidb</a> <a href="../../../j/d/a/User_talk%7EJdavidb_d285.html" title="User talk:Jdavidb">(talk)</a> 19:52, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>And then he archived his talk page immediately after my warning. <a href="../../../j/d/a/User%7EJdavidb_f8c2.html" title="User:Jdavidb">Jdavidb</a> <a href="../../../j/d/a/User_talk%7EJdavidb_d285.html" title="User talk:Jdavidb">(talk)</a> 20:12, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

</dl>
<p>I'm assuming good faith and have placed my warning on his new, blank talk page. If he reverts again today I'll block using 3RR. If I see him revert again after 24 hours, I may give a warning block (assuming noone here hollers and tells me that's not appropriate), or I may try to bring it to attention through dispute resolution so we could have an ironclad case for action if he doesn't concede. <a href="../../../j/d/a/User%7EJdavidb_f8c2.html" title="User:Jdavidb">Jdavidb</a> <a href="../../../j/d/a/User_talk%7EJdavidb_d285.html" title="User talk:Jdavidb">(talk)</a> 20:35, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Oh, and if he finds some excuse to take the warning off of his talk page, I'll act on that, too. Probably revert him back until he's at risk of 3RR on that. <a href="../../../j/d/a/User%7EJdavidb_f8c2.html" title="User:Jdavidb">Jdavidb</a> <a href="../../../j/d/a/User_talk%7EJdavidb_d285.html" title="User talk:Jdavidb">(talk)</a> 20:37, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is a small number of disruptive editors going round trying to change date styles from BC to BCE in contravention of WP policy - I have been reverting them. It appears here that I erred and that the page (unfortunately for most of our readers who find BCE alien to them!) apparently was not originally BC. That's a shame - we should always use common terms over unusual ones, but I shan't revert this page again. Incidentally, where I know I have made at least one revert of any page, I always check to see whether a further revert would make me in breach of the 3RR (which seems a sensible approach). I'm not into gaming - I'm into making WP as useful a resource to as many people as possible, it's just a shame that a small number of users aren't, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 20:46, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><del>Resolved, then, mostly. Thanks for your good faith, here</del>. I do think you (and all of us) need to realize that the present status quo on BC/BCE/AD/CE is pretty shaky. You can't go wrong if you treat it on an article by article basis and let the regular editors of that article come to consensus.</p>
<p>I don't think you're trying to game the 3RR system, but I do think you should think a little more about the spirit behind the policy. From experience, I get changes made more effectively when I'm discussing more and reverting less. I'll leave further comments about it on your talk page. <a href="../../../j/d/a/User%7EJdavidb_f8c2.html" title="User:Jdavidb">Jdavidb</a> <a href="../../../j/d/a/User_talk%7EJdavidb_d285.html" title="User talk:Jdavidb">(talk)</a> 20:49, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Okay, he's repeatedly removed my comments from his page. By my count he has done this four times: once through immediately archiving (now the timing is more suspicious), once for when I replaced my original comment on the new talk page, once for my next comment about the spirit behind the 3RR, and then once more after I replaced both removed comments. Is this a violation of 3RR? <a href="../../../j/d/a/User%7EJdavidb_f8c2.html" title="User:Jdavidb">Jdavidb</a> <a href="../../../j/d/a/User_talk%7EJdavidb_d285.html" title="User talk:Jdavidb">(talk)</a> 21:31, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Meanwhile, check his edit history and note that he is still carrying the fight about era notation to other pages. Again I contend that this violates the spirit of 3RR when you are effectively carrying on the same revert on multiple pages. I rescind my above comment that this is resolved. <a href="../../../j/d/a/User%7EJdavidb_f8c2.html" title="User:Jdavidb">Jdavidb</a> <a href="../../../j/d/a/User_talk%7EJdavidb_d285.html" title="User talk:Jdavidb">(talk)</a> 21:33, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>He has removed my comments again. I consider this to be the fifth revert and a violation of 3RR and am blocking 24 hours. If anyone disagrees, feel free to unblock or otherwise admonish me. I think I'm doing right here ... but as a newbie admin I would like some feedback.</p>
<p>My understanding is that regardless of whatever control and latitude may be granted to you to control your user talk pages (which does not, according to any policy I can see, appear to be much) you don't get a free pass there from 3RR. <a href="../../../j/d/a/User%7EJdavidb_f8c2.html" title="User:Jdavidb">Jdavidb</a> <a href="../../../j/d/a/User_talk%7EJdavidb_d285.html" title="User talk:Jdavidb">(talk)</a> 21:38, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm bewildered by Jguk's attitude to this. <i>He</i> is the editor who's being disruptive by going around changing pages that have been stable around this issue for months, so far as I know. There <i>is</i> no policy on this. The MoS says both are acceptable and anyway the MoS isn't policy, but Jguk is going around implying that using BCE/CE is somehow forbidden. For example, a recent edit summary of his read: "I'm told the MOS mandates this copyedit," <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Khazars&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=25224757" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Khazars&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=25224757" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> which strikes me as less than honest, because the MoS, as Jguk knows very well, mandates nothing about anything. I really wish he would stop it because all it's doing is creating bad feeling. On top of that, he's archiving all the comments about it on his talk page, so people don't see that quite a few editors oppose him. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 21:58, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You can't hammer someone into making your comment stay on their talk page. 3RR is not in fact generally held to apply in this situation. If you put it there and he removed it, he saw it. It's not like the diff has vanished. This has been well established in many cases where annoying trolls were bugging people on their talk pages then tried to nail them with 3RR when they removed them. If he doesn't want to keep your comment there, that's up to him, not you, and you don't get to edit-war otherwise - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 22:13, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hm? This looks like a clear case of 3RR gaming in the article namespace. Add to that deleting warnings off his talk page and breaking the 3RR doing so. Kelly Martin said that 3RR doesn't apply to userspace, but that is wrong, it is just not generally enforced there. Here we have enough disruption in the article and talk namespaces, and clear block evasion using an IP and personal attacks in the edit summary when removing comments that I'd say a longer block would have been better. I would reblock, but I don't think that should be done without further agreement. (Although apparently Kelly Martin seems to think it was OK to unblock without any discussion. Don't we make people admins because we <i>trust</i> them?) <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 22:30, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You gotta be joking. He had a 3RR warning put on his talk page, then he removed it. So he was warned and can't deny he was warned. Then what is the point of repeatedly replacing the warning except harassment? That's <i>precisely</i> why 3RR isn't generally applied to a user in their own userspace - people harassing others with repeatedly replacing removed additions, then trying to nail them on 3RR - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 23:09, 10 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not sure if you were responding to me (because I guess my comment wasn't really a response to you but in general). But my point is that, talk page shenanigans notwithstanding, 3RR gaming in the articles, block evasion, and personal attacks are enough for me to add up to a block, and so I am especially worried about the quick unblock without discussion. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 02:55, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You left an important incident off your list; while his Arbitration case was on-going, during a period when he claimed to have "left" Wikipedia, in about 3 hours jguk astoundingly made over <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=195.40.200.222&amp;offset=0&amp;limit=500" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=195.40.200.222&amp;offset=0&amp;limit=500" rel="nofollow">300 BCE/CE date style changes as an IP address</a>.

<dd>I can't explain Jguk's "apologies" when the same misconduct goes on and on.

<p>All the articles Sortan refers to were stable in using BC notation until one editor changed it. I have stated quite clearly that I am not changing date styles, just reverting those who are. Compare Sortan's own edit history, which shows that it is a role account, probably created by a prolific WPian, that has just been used to troll the issue throughout. I have acknowledged that I got the wrong end of the stick on Jerusalem, but that is an exception. Will all editors accept the "no change of style" position, as I have, or not?

<dd>In his urge to impose the BC/AD notation, Jguk deliberately misconstrues the ArbCom decision by picking only the parts he likes, ignoring the requirement to be "consistent within an article" and "unless there is some substantial reason for the change". I don't have anything against British spelling or BC/AD notation <i>in general</i>, but just as <b>"it would be acceptable to change from American spelling to English spelling if the article concerned an English subject"</b>, in some cases it is inappropriate to use Christian-centric notation having a viable neutral alternative. <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens"></a>←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">←ну?</a> 22:03, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Tony makes some good points, and it is an issue that deserves attention. I've specifically been involved with <a href="../../../m/a/o/User%7EMaoririder_d00a.html" title="User:Maoririder">Maoririder</a>, and am undoubtedly one of those who has drawn Tony's ire for "harassment". In my opinion, a user like Maori <i>needs</i> a mentor. And, occasionally, he needs little 15 minute blocks to slow him down or get his attention. I had hoped that the RfC process would, but unfortunately he ignored it. I supported the RfAr in the hope that it would grab his attention, which it has, but had the unintended effect of scaring him off. As a RC/new page patroller, I simply don't have the capability (and I doubt anyone else does) to patrol when the page is flooded with a new nano-stub that needs to be cleaned up every two minutes! I'd appreciate alternate suggestions for dealing with the problems users like <a href="../../../m/a/o/User%7EMaoririder_d00a.html" title="User:Maoririder">Maoririder</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWiki_brah_9e73.html" title="User:Wiki brah">Wiki brah</a> present, because I just don't know the best way to respond- and they need some kind of response.--<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScimitar_bbe8.html" title="User:Scimitar">Scimitar</a> <a href="../../../s/c/i/User_talk%7EScimitar_c843.html" title="User talk:Scimitar"><sup>parley</sup></a> 20:47, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I can't see the point of "slowing down" maoririder since as far as I can tell he's causing no damage to the wiki, and certainly nothing that can be helped by slowing him down. If he's ever edit warred or vandalised, that's a different matter, and if that does show up in the evidence it'll be a different matter.</p>
<p>I do think Maoririder needs a mentor, pretty much to stop people getting into punitive mode on him and blocking him. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 01:29, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Tony makes some interesting points. From a practical standpoint, how are we in our day-to-day patrols supposed to tell the difference between a bona fide autist and someone merely ignoring the policies/guidelines/mos/conventions? I certainly do not want to be dismissive or flip towards anyone with autism, but at the same time it's very difficult to distinguish between who needs special attention and who needs <i>special</i> attention. <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 01:53, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't like this since we are diagnosing people over the 'net. Anyway, newpage patrolling is often tough as heck and a very slow process - the last thing we need is a couple of users on a one-sentence-article rampage. These users should be directed to some of the friendly admins around here and should maybe stop creating those substubs in rapid succession because they suck up the time of the patrollers. A block in this case is not neccesarily punitive - mostly its to encourage conversation rather then having the person focus his/her time on creating new articles. <small><a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">Ryan Norton</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/n/_/User_talk%7ERN_aed3.html" title="User talk:RN"><font color="#6BA800">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_RN_6d83.html" title="Special:Emailuser/RN"><font color="#0033FF">@</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RN_f224.html" title="Special:Contributions/RN"><font color="#FF0000">C</font></a></sup></small> 02:01, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I don't think <a href="../../../m/a/o/User%7EMaoririder_d00a.html" title="User:Maoririder">Maoririder</a> is a lost cause, though, and I think that if he's mentored he could eventually be quite effective- still contributing stubs, but in the neighborhood of four sentences, and formatted semi-properly. This to me seems an achievable outcome. However, I still believe we need blocks to do it, as Maoririder quite politely responds that he'll change, and then goes right back to what he was doing. The blocks wake him up. As for the reason there is a problem with what he is doing, his volume is so high that it makes New Page patrol virtually impossible. Most of his articles qualify for speedy deletion of AfD, and the only way patrollers can handle it is to stem the tide- i.e. blocks.--<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScimitar_bbe8.html" title="User:Scimitar">Scimitar</a> <a href="../../../s/c/i/User_talk%7EScimitar_c843.html" title="User talk:Scimitar"><sup>parley</sup></a> 14:49, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>no, we need admins who can see IPs. I have been saying this for a long time, and I think it is stupid to expect us to fight vandals without that capability. If not all admins are trusted with seeing IPs we need <b>at least</b> a substantial fraction of 'uber-admins' who can. Since we already have the rank, why not bureaucrats. This is an urgent requirement in my book; at least bureaucrats should be allowed to see IPs, and the population of bureaucrats should then be increased so that it is likely at least one is online at all times. Otherwise we are just shooting our own foot with a misguided notion of 'privacy'.

<dd>This is definitely necessary, as Wikipedia attracts more technically-savvy vandals. Could an "IP check log" be created so that usage of this ability is transparent?

<dd>I'm not sure. The point of hiding IPs is privacy, and the fact that we don't want people to (potentially) get in trouble for their actions on Wikipedia; and as admins are selected on the basis of on-Wiki trustworthiness, not real-world trustworthiness, they shouldn't be given powers with potential consequences off Wikipedia just by virtue of their adminship. ~~ <b><a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickptar_0554.html" title="User:Nickptar">N</a></b> (<a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickptar_0d70.html" title="User talk:Nickptar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nickptar_06b7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nickptar">c</a>) 20:40, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>If checkuser is made available to more admins (say, admins with a proven 2 year record of being responsible people, bureaucrats may decide), every lookup should be logged somewhere accessible for all the other admins (that a lookup of the username was made, not the result of it, of course). If a look-up log is open like this, it will help avoid suspicions of abuse and should keep everybody honest. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShanes_8450.html" title="User:Shanes">Shanes</a> 22:12, 11 October 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If this is implemented, there should also be limits on the number of people one admin can use it on over a period of time. However, you run again into the issue of how to determine responsibility - some real-world verification of identity and evidence of trustworthiness should be provided, not just a record of good Wikipedia behavior. We hide IPs for a reason. Logging can't reverse an abuse that's already occured. ~~ <b><a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickptar_0554.html" title="User:Nickptar">N</a></b> (<a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickptar_0d70.html" title="User talk:Nickptar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nickptar_06b7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nickptar">c</a>) 22:32, 11 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>There's not going to be a Taylorised formula for producing trust. It's more a scarcity of people who can read the stuff - telling what's likely to be DHCP, what sort of cycle the ISP in question changes DHCP IPs on, guessing as to the likely collateral damage, etc., etc., etc. I spent many years tracing net abuse (mostly on Usenet) and work as a sysadmin, so I know this stuff.

<dd>I suppose we frown on talk page deletions, but since Decius == Alexander 007 this is his own request and not vandalism by some other user. Should it be deleted? -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 11:12, 12 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for fixing {{<a href="../../../v/a/n/Template%7EVandal_ff98.html" title="Template:Vandal">vandal</a>}}. As to the Talk page, I'd defer to your wide experience, Curps, but if Decius has had a problematic past—and the posts up above suggest multiple suspected impersonations, possible socking, and some seriously abusive editing—I'm not sure I'd want to remove part of that record. As I understand it, the CSD provision <i>allows</i> User Talk pg deletion on request, but does not <i>compel</i> us to do it. There is also the additional issue that we have had no real confirmation, as far as I'm aware, of their unity—Alexander 007 has claimed to be Decius, and asked us to delete Decius' page, but AFAIK <i>Decius</i> hasn't posted anything confirming it. In cases like this it's probably best that two-way confirmation is safely in hand before any move is made to delete pages, etc. Kind regards <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000077">enceph</font></a><a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><font color="#666699">alon</font></a> <i>11:37, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</i></dd>
<dd><i>NB.</i> Just went through User talk:Decius. It's almost certainly him all right, although he should have done the re-direct while signed in as Decius, and written a clear note on Alexander 007's talk page saying he=Decius (while signed in as Alex007). So it's up to the admins, I guess. My preference is that User talk:Decius remain as it is: a redirect, but with the history available for inspection should the need arise. <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000077">enceph</font></a><a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><font color="#666699">alon</font></a> <i>11:58, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</i></dd>

<p>sigh: <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexandru_742d.html" title="User:Alexandru">User:Alexandru</a> is an unrelated user that made a few edits and left. User:Decius would have liked the username, and used the account's talkpage, that's all. Now following the events described further up on this page, Decius decided to settle for the new account User:Alexander 007 and wants the Decius account gone. This has nothing to do with sockpuppetry, it's a username change. Of course User_talk:Decius shouldn't be deleted, because its history contains edits by many people, but if the user so wishes, it could be blank-protected, I suppose. I think there can be no reasonable doubt that Alexander 007 is the same person as Decius, so I think it will be safe to go ahead and blank-protect Decius' userpages (you can still undo that should the 'real' Decius turn up, but I assure you they're the same). So, among the condemning summary "multiple suspected impersonations, possible socking, and some seriously abusive editing" the only thing that really applies is "abusive editing", but that also only in edit summaries, where it appears the user likes to vent when drunk. Bottom line, this is a very good user, but he can safely be blocked for a few hours when he is spotted doing empty edits with abusive summaries, because that probably means he is drunk, or just in a gloomy mood. That still makes him a much less problematic user than lots of edit-warriors I could mention. 12:02, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Hi User:213.3.64.145. Thank you for your thoughts. There is no reason a page with edits by many people cannot be deleted from WP; it's routinely done, daily. There is some reticence about deleting User talk pages, because these usually contain a record of the user's interaction with the community, and may hold information others wish preserved. That incidentally is the reason I think it shouldn't be deleted. I'm sorry that you found it quite necessary to term a phrase of mine "the condemning summary"; I merely listed problems administrators thought the Decius account might be involved in, and in each instance added a modifier because it didn't appear to me that these suspicions had been confirmed—with the exception of the abusive edits. With respect to that, note that abusive edit summaries are actually <i>particularly</i> frowned upon, as they cannot be removed (except by developers, in rare instances). I am not aware of a request by Decius to have his talk page blank-protected; I am aware of a request by Alexander 007 to have that page deleted. It currently redirects; this sounds to me the best solution. Regards <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000077">enceph</font></a><a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><font color="#666699">alon</font></a> <i>12:40, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</i>
<ul>
<li>that's right, and what I meant: we don't allow quitting admins to delete their talkpages, so I don't expect us to delete Decius' talkpage. I was trying to point out what's behind all this, and why it isn't sockpuppetry or impersonation, and I agree with your general evaluation. If Decius wants his talkpage protected, let him ask for it, as Decius. I hope now that the user has chosen a new name, this issue will be put to rest. How much weirdness in a user should be tolerated imho depends on that user's value as a contributor. An account that does <i>nothing but</i> empty edits with abusive summaries can safely be banned. A prolific contributor who every other weeks starts cursing in summaries of edits to <i>his own userpage</i> should be treated with some indulgence. 13:10, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Confirmation: User:Alexander 007 is me, at my new account. User:Decius was my former account. I have logged in as User:Decius, preferably for the last time, to confirm this. I would like User talk:Decius deleted and restarted as a redirect with a fresh edit history. I do not plan on becoming an Admin; there is no RfC filed against me; there are no serious charges against me. I would just like my old talk page deleted. I plan on being a more private user, with fewer edits made, and of course fewer obscenities spouted. Cheers, -Alexander 007 19:49, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

But <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">User:Curps</a> (?) restored the old talk page with the old edit history. So, perhaps, if in the future someone really feels compelled to read through the edit history of the old User talk:Decius, you can just restore it again. But till such need arises, I'd like to have it deleted. -Alexander 007 20:14, 12 October 2005 (UTC) (the fact that I first requested it to be deleted on October 6th, before I even got in trouble with the <a href="../../../j/t/k/User%7EJtkiefer_5ea4.html" title="User:Jtkiefer">Jtkiefer</a> affair, shows that I'm not just requesting this deletion to "cover-up" Wiki transgressions, if there be any, but just to clean the slate a bit)</dd>

<dd>I asked the devs for help during yesterday's attack. They weren't interested.

<dd>Can anything actually be done, though? We cannot protect the page from editing, clearly.

<dd>We need to do something about this vandalbot quickly.

<p>There's not a lot we can do in practice. It's a vandalbot. We could throttle new accounts from editing this page, and it would edit other pages. We had some success blocking the accounts from the new accounts page last time, and it ended it for a day.

<dd>Did we work out whether that was because it tripped the IP autoblocker by trying to edit from a preemptively blocked account? If it was, can we extend the autoblockers block manually since there don't seem to have been cries of collateral damage? I'm pretty sure it's been less than 24hrs though, so I suppose it's found another IP even if we did catch it. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 17:01, 12 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It may have been disabled (or broken), but I recall some past discussion of how there should be an account registration throttle of something like 10 per IP per day.

<dd>I also note that there are about 64 autoblocks associated with accounts in this spree.

<dd>I'm not sure that'd be a good idea even if we could (we can't).

<dd>I'm out of my technical depth here. But actually, this bot seems pretty amateur - and it doesn't take a techno-whizz to imagine far more destructive thinks that could be done (no, won't give it ideas). But, sooner or later we're going to run up against a really skillful opponent. As Wikipedia grows in fame, so it will grow as a target. I can't believe this hasn't occurred to someone at Wikimedia before, and perhaps we should not only be looking for a solution, but asking for advice. What does Mr Wales make of all this? What's to be done if it gets really serious. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 17:32, 12 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>This needs to be escalated, we need to know what the underlying IPs were. If open proxies, they need to be blocked, obviously. If AOL, then somebody high up (maybe even Jimbo himself) should contact AOL and tell them to "strongly caution" whoever their ISP customer is. We need enhanced vandal accountability and traceback capabilities. Developers ought to be encouraged to take an interest in this, or perhaps the next fundraising drive should be for a full-time developer's salary rather than for more servers.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The privacy issue perhaps be a moot point if the vandalbot accounts used a pool IP address, because then various collaterally-damaged users might come out of the woodwork and say they were blocked... those users will then helpfully supply the IP address and username mentioned in the block message. Add timestamps from the contribution history, publish it here along with the abuse contact info (e-mail and telephone) for that ISP (from ARIN or RIPE or APNIC), and then anyone who's motivated can contact the ISP to complain about their customer.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>In fact, I'm thinking of editing <a href="../../../a/u/t/MediaWiki%7EAutoblocker_5b06.html" title="MediaWiki:Autoblocker">Mediawiki:autoblocker</a> to add a message encouraging collaterally-damaged users to post the contents of their block message (with IP address information).

<dd>No, I don't mean the "block reason" that's entered by the blocking admin... that's limited to about 237 characters. I think I meant <a href="../../../b/l/o/MediaWiki%7EBlockedtext_22db.html" title="MediaWiki:Blockedtext">Mediawiki:blockedtext</a> rather than <a href="../../../a/u/t/MediaWiki%7EAutoblocker_5b06.html" title="MediaWiki:Autoblocker">Mediawiki:autoblocker</a>. The basic idea is, when a user is blocked they get a page back saying "You have attempted to edit a page...". Somewhere on that page, we should have text that says "please post the IP address and associated username that this block was for, to Wikipedia:Recent you-got-blocked messages". That way, we can gather IP address information, combine it with the timestamps from the contribution history, and publish it along with ISP abuse contact phone and e-mail information so that anyone who wishes to can act on it. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 18:19, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not really. The effort needed in uncovering the IPs behind the attack just isn't worth it. It's Wik, we know it's Wik, Wik uses proxies, Wik can and will keep doing this. Here's the weird thing about Wik, though - Wik believes in Wikipedia. Wik is not out to destroy the project. I would be very surprised if Wik targeted his vandalbot against article pages, or if he kept it running 24/7. He wants us to know we're vulnerable, and to accept that he's right about how to deal with problems on Wikipedia. But he doesn't want the project to fail.</dd>

<dd>One thing I suggested on Jimbo's talk page is for the next fundraising drive to pay for the salary of a full-time developer to work on enhancing Wikipedia security and integrity, or perhaps just a full-time IP-address-tracer and ISP-follow-up-er, who'd be on a first-name basis with the abuse contact persons at each major ISP. We need enhanced vandal accountability and traceback. We don't (necessarily) want to find out the vandals' identities, but their ISPs already know their identities, and in many cases it may be enough for them to get a phone call from their ISP.</dd>

<dd>In the meantime, I've suggested a "low-effort" way to gather vandal IP addresses, with or without developer cooperation.

<dd>Obviously we can't be certain that it's Wik, but A: this mostly matches the M.O. of his first vandalbot attack (see <a href="../../../v/a/n/User%7EVandalbot_d06d.html" title="User:Vandalbot">User:Vandalbot</a> and mailing list threads starting <a href="http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2004-June/013597.html" class="external text" title="http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2004-June/013597.html" rel="nofollow">round about here</a>) and B: it comes hard on the heels of the ban on his newest accounts.

<dd>I'm not sure what Wik (if it is him) hopes to accomplish, though. The last vandalbot attack was preceded by an ultimatum; no such threats have been made here, as far as I can tell.

It looked like an IP did an edit the same as the 'bot, so he perma-blocked the IP (for the time being).

<p>Looking at the recent changes, I found almost a dozen vandalbot accounts. I blocked them all, and in the time it took me to do this (less than five minutes), there were three or four more. If I were to continue this blocking spree, I'd be here all day. I have a civilian service and a job to do. And I have to eat. I can't spend 24 hours sitting in front of Wikipedia. This matter is too tough for admins, we need checkuser/developer assistance. Last night I thought of making Wikipedia editing more strict: Anonymous IPs couldn't edit, and to sign up for an account you would have to pass a CAPTCHA (sp?). To be <b>really</b> safe, <b>every</b> edit would need to pass a CAPTCHA, but that would irritate bona fide users to no end, and Wikipedia would stagnate. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP">— <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 06:41, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>To block this guy, you would apply a range block: 63.19.128.0/17 . As far as I know, there haven't been any reports of collateral damage when this was done in the past. Just in case he's trying to turn over a new leaf (we can always hope) and confining his edits to the sandbox, we might go easy on him this time despite his long and checkered history. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 01:14, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with Curps here. This is the "North Carolina Vandal" -- one of the most prolific vandals in the history of our project, as can be verified by counting the 63.19 vandalisms in any of the north central <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Carolina_5c52.html" title="North Carolina">North Carolina</a> Rambot articles, as well as <a href="../../../l/u/x/Luxembourg.html" title="Luxembourg">Luxembourg</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mississippi.html" title="Mississippi">Mississippi</a>, and everywhere else, since about May of this year. Charactistic of his editing are invention of fictitious places, minor changes in demographic numbers, and invention of fictitious characters in a cartoon universe reminiscent of <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_of_the_Hill_b7f2.html" title="King of the Hill">King of the Hill</a>. Look at <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stokes_County%2C_North_Carolina_c909.html" title="Stokes County, North Carolina">Stokes County, North Carolina</a> -- every vandalism is him, and it's an enormous amount. Maybe, just maybe, he's going to stop. By the way, I am yet to see a single identifiably different editor from the 63.19.128.0/17 range. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_af9e.html" title="User talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a> 01:23, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have never actually applied a block on a range of IPs before. Do I just enter that text you suppled above verbatim to do so? Also, if some of the IPs are 63.19.2XX.XXX, how would blocking 63.19.128.XXX help? Does the first bit of the binary representation of 128 somehow mask out all the other IPs? But this doesn't make sense to me...I just want to understand this a bit better. Lately, I've been leaving nice welcome messages for these IPs every time I see them experimenting on the sandbox. I've found that it's an effective method of saying "we know you're around, we're keeping an eye on stuff..." --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> 03:03, 13 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>While this may be connected, it is threatening to <i>spam</i>, not to <i>replace various Wikipedia namespace pages with SUPER COOL</i>.

<p>The spam filter is very unsophisticated, it's a very blunt and inefficient tool with high overhead. You can't really tailor the filtering in any way: for instance, you can't whitelist individual good sites at a hosting service that also hosts spammers (common in some parts of the world).</p>
<p>Also, the spamfiltering is done on metawiki (not here) and applies globally to all interwikis, which is far from ideal for a number of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>"one size fits all" doesn't: for instance, the collateral damage from spamfiltering a Russian hosting service is much greater for the Russian wikipedia than for the English wikipedia</li>
<li>response time: meta is a comparatively sleepy wiki and you might get action on a filtering request after half a day or so. Only a handful of meta admins work on filtering requests (Silsor was one of them, last I checked).</li>
<li>English wikipedia admins usually aren't admins on meta, which means our fate isn't in our own hands. We have to go hat in hand to get the attention of developers or meta admins, some of whom mostly work or edit on quieter interwikis that don't face the same constant background of vandal activity as English does.</li>
</ul>
<p>The way the filtering is applied is also rather clumsy and user-unfriendly: it simply prevents you from saving any article that contains a spamfiltered external link URL, with a cryptic message that doesn't even mention which URL it is. Many users faced with this probably simply abandon their planned edits, and articles affected can remain un-edited for months.</p>
<p>I wish Wikipedia integrity had a higher priority. The ideal thing would be a full-time paid developer to work on this (adding <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captcha.html" title="Captcha">captchas</a> and <a href="../../../s/s/l/SSL_ea52.html" title="SSL">SSL</a> shouldn't be that hard, for instance), as well as a full-time ISP liaison person who would track IP addresses and be on a first name basis with the abuse contacts at major ISPs, getting them to boot vandals and spammers from their ISP for violation of TOS. As things stand, admins are fairly limited in what we're able to do against concerted attacks. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 02:39, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You make a valid point, Charles/Mirv. If the creator of this bot really does have 10,000 IP addresses (which appears might be the case), there is no reason why he couldn't use them to destroy the whole encyclopedia.

<p>It's hard to believe that someone who controls a botnet would be silly enough to waste that "resource" on something so profitless as attacking Wikipedia. As an online target, we're relatively high profile but not exactly rolling in cash (with an annual budget of six figures instead of nine or ten). Given that the recent botnet-related arrests <a href="http://blogs.pcworld.com/staffblog/archives/000995.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://blogs.pcworld.com/staffblog/archives/000995.html" rel="nofollow">[33]</a> got lots of publicity (a strong motivation for ambitious cops trying to advance their careers), attacking us with a full-blown botnet attack is kind of high-risk and zero-reward... <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willy_Sutton_5728.html" title="Willy Sutton">Willy Sutton</a> would roll over in his grave.

<p>I will also note that the street address that User:JackSarfatti posted for DES is apparently an out-of-date work address; since DES doesn't seem bothered that it's still on the talk pages, I haven't worried about it either. Still, what JackSarfatti seems to have been <i>trying</i> to do was extraordinarily inappropriate.</p>
<p>With respect to Jack's threats to go to the media–regrettably, I haven't seen them–I would say that Wikipedia believes in openness and transparency, and any publicity can only further improve our collaborative project. I'm certain that journalists will accord Jack's remarks the level of respect and attention they deserve. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 18:02, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I just want to throw in my two cents. This behavior is obviously unacceptable and the block was entirely appropriate. I hope that if anyone thinks an unblock is called for, they discuss it first. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 18:28, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have spoken with Jack Sarfatti on the telephone (for the 3rd time now at 2:00 P.M. New York time), and I have explained to him Wikipedia's rule against making legal threats. I also let him know that he can edit <a href="../../../j/a/c/User_talk%7EJackSarfatti_e033.html" title="User talk:JackSarfatti">user talk:JackSarfatti</a> even while his account is blocked.</p>
<p>I denied his request to be unblocked, pending a public statemnt from him on his user talk page withdrawing his legal threats.</p>
<p>I do not believe in Sarfatti's views or disbelieve in them. My only concern with the article is that it be neutral: i.e., that it avoids endorsing the idea that his views are "kooky" or "ground-breaking", or that he is a "crackpot" or a "visionary". Wikipedia should not take sides in the dispute over whether Sarfatti or his views are good or bad.</p>
<p>I was hasty about using the rollback function one time. I won't make this error again. I plan to follow the 0RR rule from here on: I will comment on the talk page <b>first</b>, before undoing anyone else's reverts.</p>
<p>By the way, the man is 66 years old and does not know the rules around here. I would request that in place of indefinite blocks, we try 3 hours or 12 hours at a time. "Indefinite" has such an air of finality to it. <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 18:36, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Civility exists outside of Wikipedia; threatening people can't be blamed on not knowing the rules around here. I didn't really agree with your decision to unblock, but I hoped that it would work. It obviously didn't work and unless Jack shows that he can get along with other editors, I just don't see justification to unblock him again. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 18:45, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>He asked me to unblock him, and I refused; I insisted that he withdraw his legal threats first. He can do this on his user talk page.

<dd>I would be tempted to ask DES' and Hillman's opinion on the issue, too. They're the parties at whom User:JackSarfatti has directed the most grief. As Carbonite says, someone who is sixty-six years old ought to know that you don't threaten and rant at people with whom you disagree. Basic civility isn't (or shouldn't be) a concept that is unique to Wikipedia. Though I won't object if–in your best judgement, Uncle Ed–you think he should be unblocked again, he will be on a very short leash if he comes back.

<dd>I have been discussed negatively in the media before, and that in the town in which i reside. (That happens when you openly enter politcs.) I am not greatly perturbed at what listeners to talk radio may possibly think of me, assuming that any of them care about wikipedia. I do <b>not</b> concede that any of my comments on the page in questiion are in fact personal attacks, nor that they are in any way comensurate with <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackSarfatti_1fbb.html" title="User:JackSarfatti">User:JackSarfatti</a>'s level of vituperation in his responses. And I strongly suspect that he intended to frighten and harrass me by posting my address, although i don't know that for sure. If so, he failed -- but he might well frighten another wikipedian by similar posts. I chose to edit under my legal name, and i know that means any of my edits can be easily connected to may phyusical identity. Many others do not. If Jack Sarfatti choses to attack me on talk radio, that is up to him and the management of the radio station involved -- if i really feel injured by such actions I can take legal action myself. But even if i do not feel harmed or threatend, making legal threats and personal attacks on wikipedia is clearly against policy here, and IMO <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackSarfatti_1fbb.html" title="User:JackSarfatti">User:JackSarfatti</a> should remain blocked until he at a minimum acknowledges those policies nd agrees to abide by them in future. Apologies for past conduct would be nice, but it is future conduct which counts here IMO.

<p>Geez...I see he has been absolutely excessive, but the article is about him and he is obviously upset about it. I am worried that blocking an editor to keep him/her from being able to contribute to an article about themselves is the Wiki way. Temporary blocks, absolutely, but the perma ban thing is troubling. I also recognize anyone can sue anyone so his legal threats deserve serious attention...if we don't allow him to edit the article then how does that work against the enterprise legally? Or at the very least, what credibility do we risk by his banishment?--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 10:49, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>do you realize what these blocks do to performance? why would you block these? the vandal will just create another. At least block them only for 30 minutes or so, so they don't clog up the blocklist. You see, say a vandal has 256 IP adresses to burn. He creates 256 bots and keeps us busy for hours. The 'recently used IP' blocks expire and he can have at us with another 256 bots, while the original 256 blocks still clog up the ipblocklist. Alternatively, check the bots' IP and do <i>one</i> 24-bit <b>rangeblock</b> (duration depending on the nature of the IP, dialup or static). No more trouble for the duration of the block, no clogged up ipblocklist. does that make sense? <a href="../../../1/3/0/User%7E130.60.142.65.html" title="User:130.60.142.65">130.60.142.65</a> 12:12, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It makes perfect sense, and is what we would dearly love to do. But we don't have access to the necessary IP information. Those that do are, for reasons I do not understand, unwilling to help us out. So we have to do it the bad way, or not at all. Bug the devs or checkusers — that's the only way. In any case, there's a good chance they are using open proxies and/or highly dyanmic IPs that blocking would result in much collateral damage. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 12:22, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Okay, I just met the Super Cool bot (Programmer-X) and reverted him. Haven't bothered to block, per the above.

<dd>I've left him a message in his talk so maybe that will help? Anyway, the comments by Silverback are not that dissimilar to those he has to fight off from others, and has had to from time to time. The "insults" extend further back in time than that one above as well. A quick examination of his talk page and or his commentary in article talk indicates to me that in light of the types of articles he dallies in, with the liklihood that there is going to be much spirited and somewhat hostile debate, I think he does fairly well dealing with those that are in opposition to his evidence. I can also say the same for most of the users he encounters...I dunno, to me a personal attack is something like a death threat or calling my mom something bad, but that is my perspective.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 04:11, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I must protest, tangentially, against the idea that it takes an admin to do things like that. Anybody can remove personal attacks (<b>preferably</b>, anybody not involved in the dispute). For myself, I usually prefer to (vengefully) leave PAs sitting there embarrassing the attacker, but I'll remove them briskly if I become aware that the target wishes it. Anyway, I didn't give any thought to being an admin when I removed these. Rollback, mop and bucket, that's <b>it</b>, that's the whole adminship deal. We're all of us responsible for leaving this site the way we'd wish to find it. &lt;Exit complulsively muttering "mop and bucket... mop and bucket... no big deal..."&gt; <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 12:54, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem is that certain PAs are believed perhaps just as often as they embarrass. When attacks are cloaked as allegations against behavior, those unfamiliar with the details of what's unfolding will assume that they are reading factual descriptions of behavior. I have little doubt that the frequency and the intensity of the attacks on me right now stem from the fact that they work. If someone is suspected of "deleting evidence," "deleting comments," "supporting authoritarian regimes," supporting the Soviet Union, "abusing admin powers," abusing other kinds of powers, and 'immorality and deceit in real life', it will be impossible to continue working in a collaborative group project. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> | <a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.html" title="User talk:172">Talk</a> 16:33, 14 October 2005 (UTC)

<p>Hi, I need help with the Spanish version of WP. There are a number of people (mainly spanish)who insist on using the "Gibraltar" page to air their sour grapes over the fact that Gibraltar is British, and to insult, spout their propaganda, or just outright lie about Gibraltar. Even when they do get facts straight they are often as far fom NPOV as it is possible to be. WP, as I understand it is not a discussion forum, nor a place to blacken the name of another country just because you do not agree with their democratic decisions. Even some admins have joined in, abusing their powers to block me from making edits, i.e. Dodo, Ecemaml, Sanbec. As there are a number of spaniards using WP, but not many Gibraltarians they are "ganging up" and steam-rolling the page......of course any "consensus" decision is geared to put whatever they feel like, totally ignoring realitiy, truth and neutrality.</p>
<p>I simply do not know what can be done about this, as Admins are involved. If they wish to sound off their frustrations about Gibraltar, or just trade lies or insults, then they should find another forum for this....or just grow up and get a life. I am pretty sure this is not the purpose of WP.</p>
<p>Please help someone.</p>

<p>You might try asking simply for an additional paragraph or a note at the endo of the article entitled "Another Perspective", saying something like <i>This article in the Spanish Wikipedia presents a Spanish perspective on Gibraltar well. Many residents of Gibraltar and others in the United Kingdom and elsewhere might disagree with some of the facts and perspectives presented here.

<p>I've seen many independent suggestions in the above vandalbot discussions about using <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captcha.html" title="Captcha">captchas</a>, so I think there should be a section for discussion of this issue.</p>
<p>Personally, I am completely opposed to making captchas mandatory for anything. Excluding people with accessibility issues would be 100% pure anti-wiki. How about this: require a valid email address to register an account, and only allow 1 account to be registered per email per day. This would pose no accessibility issues, and would allow people to have more than one account (for e.g. bots); it would just throttle account creation independent of IP address.</p>

<dd>Nope, that will scare off lots of people (they need to give their email and they need to jump through more hoops) and will do absolutely nothing against vandals (anyone can get their hands on as many emails as they want). I doubt Captcha's will do much good either, but I see some use against spam bots. I think Tim or Brion is working on creating something that requires the user to solve a captcha if they want to add an URL to a page that's on the spam blacklist. --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 18:47, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Many, many, many sites require email verification - in fact, ones that don't are rare in my experience. Also, a lot of free email sites now use captchas, and if a vandal finds one that doesn't, writing code to automatically register an account and grab the email would be enough work to discourage most vandalic types. I can't see it discouraging anybody, as editing from an IP would still be possible, and people who don't have an email account would probably not be that interested in a WP account either. Regardless of whether email verification is implemented, though, captchas are still a bad idea (although the particular "blacklisted site" situation isn't that bad, because people needing to do that should be rare and they can always ask another user). ~~ <b><a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickptar_0554.html" title="User:Nickptar">N</a></b> (<a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickptar_0d70.html" title="User talk:Nickptar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nickptar_06b7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nickptar">c</a>) 18:55, 13 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Hmm. All three of these methods have unique accessibility problems (some users can't use captchas, some will be inconvenienced by providing an email, some will be unable to do hashcash due to a slow computer or inability to run software), so perhaps they could all be implemented and just one required.

<p>Isn't there some way to generate a random number or something through an applet or something that isn't copyable by computer on a webpage such that a human would have to type it into a form? Not quite like a captcha where the letters are all jumboed up in an image, but rather just straight text from a java applet that won't allow the copying of its text via computer only by reading the text and inputting it via keyboard?

<p>Can the Mediawiki software support billions of indefinite blocks? It should... the only limit should be database storage space.</p>
<p>An indefinite block should theoretically only have to be checked once, at login time: if you're blocked you can't log in. However, we have this twist that indefinitely blocked users can still log in, so we have to do a check with each edit, which may eventually become inefficient if we accumulate a very large number of indefinite blocks (dozens or hundreds a day, every day).</p>
<p>At some point, we may want to have two block lists: an edit-block list (the current one, checked on each edit) and a login-block list (checked only at login time). In this scheme, indefinitely blocked users would temporarily be added to the edit-block list whenever they log in, but then they would be automatically logged out after 24 hours (either individually, or with a daily or weekly <i>en masse</i> logout), and dropped from the edit-block list.</p>

We have 100's of obvious vandalbot names, and I'm not sure it's going to effect anyone seeings they're all indef blocked anyways. I don't mean to have all the <i>stupid names</i> under usernameblock deleted, just the random character ones that have little to no chance of recreation. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Who_d857.html" title="Special:Contributions/Who"><font color="#000000">∞</font></a><a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho_d957.html" title="User:Who">Who</a><a href="../../../w/h/o/User_talk%7EWho_fe12.html" title="User talk:Who"><font color="#FF0033">?</font><font color="#FF00FF">¿</font><font color="#0033FF">?</font></a> 21:38, 13 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It's fine by me, I think there was some plan to have a dev go through all accounts with fewer than 100 edits and an indef block and delete them a while back, which would be nice for neatness purposes. --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 00:02, 14 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah, there's no point in keeping usernames like User:Kd9dn38d9 or any other random permutation of characters that no one would ever use. Worse yet, if someone <i>wants</i> to use them (although I would recommend some sort of psychyatric examination if that were the case), they're used by a vandalbot. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">xd</font></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a>)</sup> 00:09, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>You don't have to delete accounts with fewer than 100 edits. Deleting accounts with zero edits would go a long way: we currently have just under 500,000 accounts, but only about 95,000 have made one or more edits. If space is really an issue, one could easily get rid of those 400,000 dormant accounts. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a><big><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkSweep_9d72.html" title="User talk:MarkSweep">✍</a></big> 06:53, 14 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>yea, I'm not sure I would want to delete the 100 contribs accounts unless they were blocked indef. As for zero edit counts, its a tough call, they may have created an account and forgot to sign in again.

<p>Guys, Curps is running a blockbot that is hitting every one of the vandal accounts. Don't waste your time blocking, it's being done. We've set up an emergency monitoring station on IRC at #wikipedia-en-newusers, where the feed displays every user account that is created and every account that is blocked.

<p>Sorry I slept through this wave, after about 13 hours of the first wave of attacks , i was pretty tired (I can't believe how many there were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;user=Who&amp;page=&amp;limit=500&amp;offset=0" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;user=Who&amp;page=&amp;limit=500&amp;offset=0" rel="nofollow">my block log</a>). I have been thinking about blocking IP's though. There is always the worry that we are blocking a valid user, but that's to say there are actually valid users using that IP range. Out of all the IP addresses, not every range is going to have Wikipedia editors. As for readers, it doesn't matter if they are blocked temporarily, not that we want them to be.

<p>Two fairly petty things, especially when compared to vandlebots, but life moves on, eh?<br />
While attempting to convince a user not to use a transcluded signature, I noticed that the signature template itself was protected:</p>

<p>While looking at that, I noticed that this same user had applied protection to another page:</p>

</ul>
<p>In that interval, he's made <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=St._Bartholomew%27s_Day_massacre&amp;diff=22543209&amp;oldid=22510150" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=St._Bartholomew%27s_Day_massacre&amp;diff=22543209&amp;oldid=22510150" rel="nofollow">changes</a> to the protected page somewhat in line with discussion on the <a href="../../../s/t/2E/Talk%7ESt._Bartholomew%27s_Day_massacre_ad39.html#Protected" title="Talk:St. Bartholomew's Day massacre">talk page</a>, while stating "this doesn't mean endoresment, etc" as is the standard.

<dd>This is petty indeed. Mkmccon is not the only user to use a signature template, nor the only one to protect it (see <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProtected_page_6ebc.html#Subpages_and_boilerplates" title="Wikipedia:Protected page">Wikipedia:Protected_page#Subpages_and_boilerplates</a>). As noted in the previous link, the appropriateness of protecting one's own subpages is disputed, and using a template for one's signature is also <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">discouraged</a>, but in the absence of a strong consensus for or against these things, they are generally ignored.</dd>
<dd>The protection issue would appear more serious, but it happened over a month ago and raised no objections from any participant in the edit war over that page. It may have been a technical violation of the rules, or it may have been simple ignorance, or it may have been a slip. In the absence of <i>any previous attempt at discussing the issue with Mkmcconn</i>, it's hard to tell.</dd>
<dd>It seems, from the invisible disclaimer above, and the visible disclaimer in the first sentence, that you knew full well that this might be considered petty. In light of that, why did you bring it here at all? Mkmcconn's talk page and edit history indicate that he is an exemplary user; I see nothing to indicate that actually trying to discuss things with him before shouting them in the town square might be fruitless. —<a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">Charles&#160;P.</a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User_talk%7EMirv_53de.html" title="User talk:Mirv">&#160;<small>(Mirv)</small></a> 04:45, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I brought it here because I was unclear as to the appropiateness of the action and expected calm and rational discourse thereof. Your slightly hysterical response is certainly not what I expected. My understanding of page protection was that it was to be a "last resort" and that editing a protected page was very bad form. You could have provided the link with a bit less finger-waving. Thank you.<br />

<dd>I was perfectly calm and rational while writing the above, and I do not think my tone was even slightly hysterical. It was sharp, but that was intended: it is also extremely bad form to complain about a user behind his back before even trying to discuss your problems with him. If you simply wanted an opinion on whether or not certain actions were appropriate, you did not have to name any names.

<dd>Sorry, but phrases like <i>"shouting [...] in the town square"</i> and <i>"behind his back"</i> really aren't perfectly calm and rational. Clearly you see this as some sort of attack upon an <i>"exemplary user"</i>, an appearance I attempted to explicitly avoid by stating the context of the question. All of our actions are up for review all the time, and asking for an opinon on another's actions should not result in castigation.<br />

<dd>I have no idea what fraction of server load comes through sig templates, nor how many are in use. But load <b>is</b> an issue, and such templates surely contribute to it for little gain. If soemone wants to use boilerplate in their sig (or elsewhere) why not use subst with it? In the sig, it doesn't even cost anything, as subst only has to be typed once, in preferences, <b>and</b> it makes the sub page a far less tempting target for vandals, because vandalizing the page would only screw up sigs after the vandalism and before it is reverted, not all past signed pages. Should we have a formal policy that if a tempalte is used in a sig, it must be used with subst? <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 15:10, 14 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Hmm. I guess it depends on why the person is using the templated sig. I never use one, but back when I had greek in my sig, there was a problem with one other editor who used a text browser that messed up the literal unicode. I considered permamnently using a template, but have always disliked the idea so I simplified my sig. (And then of course Curps solved the problem by getting the devs to list the text browsers in some kind of mediawiki fix.&#160;:)) But in that sort of situation, subst: defeats the purpose. The most common reason for using a templated sig is, I think, length. Substing defeats that purpose too. For folks like us, whose sigs are not more than a line, we're Ok just using straight text. But I've seen folks who've got 3, 4 even 5 line sigs. We could mandate against that, of course. But I guess I'm not crazy about the idea of forcing uniformity on one of the few expressions of individuality on WP—more so for people who spend enormous amounts of their time as volunteers on a project. <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000077">enceph</font></a><a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><font color="#666699">alon</font></a> <i>18:57, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</i>

<dd>I can see your point about sigs messed up by other editors accidentally -- that might be a vlaid reason for trascluding a sig. I hope the fix has made this largely a non-issue. As to the "length" issue do you mean lenght in the preferfences screen, or length in the wiki-code? on the preferences screen <b>"{{Subst:User:Foo/Sig}}"</b> is not really that much longer than <b>"{{User:Foo/Sig}}"</b>. In the wikicode length can be a problem -- but then so can it be on the displayed page. if a sig is really long enough that it makes a problem in the wiki code, then parhaps it is too long on the displayed page. I suspect the server burden from increaased length is less than that for an extra transclusion. On usenet the informal standard is a limit to a 4-line sig, and i personally think that is quite enough. Users' sig's generally link to their user pages, where thy can be pretty much as individual as they please. I wouldn't ban long sigs, but I would discourage them socially. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 22:22, 14 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Length as in the source code. Ie. as in what you see when you open up the edit box. If you have a user with a 4 line sig, requiring her to subst her sig template defeats its purpose if she made it to keep her messages easy to read yet display a sig she likes. I personally agree with you about having simple sigs; however, some of our fellows prefer, for whatever reason, to have long complex sigs with multiple links to talk, contribs, email, desk, clubs, blogs, and the vet—each in a different color and font type.&#160;:) I don't always understand it, but I'm quite happy for them to be able to keep it that way if they wish. For example, I know two guys with templated sigs, long established editors, unbelievably valuable: they've written an enormous amount, contributed magnificently as admins, and one of them has multiple FAs. Hugely beneficial to the project. They happen to like templated sigs; me, I'd gladly support their having a map of China in their sigs and continuing to do the work they do. Course, I'd probably take a less liberal view if I thought sig templates were doing harm, but I'm skeptical of that claim. The main reason we have such an enormous server load is basically this: our website has 800,000 pages, which are used by hundreds of thousands of people requesting millions of page returns. A reasonable solution in that situation is, keep upgrading the servers (and run drives to fund that). I suspect that reducing or eliminating templated sigs will hardly register a blip on the server load, but on the other hand may needlessly discourage some users who help form WP's single most valuable resource: dedicated volunteer editors.

<dd>Hm. You admit that you applied a block because you were irritated, for a time; this suggests you acted not by forming a clearly reasoned conclusion that a blockable offense had been commited, but rather by momentarily giving in to your emotions. This is the danger of the Dark Side, O formidable WikiJedi. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering. Suffering leads to irritation. But hey, nothing that a refreshingly honest attitude like yours can't fix. You realized the mistake, apologized, and even offered to help him set up a complaint.

<dd>No, actually I wasn't pushing a POV, quite the opposite, I was attempting to neutralise their POV. They have taken advantage of the fact they they outnumber me. Asking 20 spaniards and 1 Gibraltarian to reach a consensus on Gibraltar is like asking 20 wolves and 1 turkey what they would like to eat. The poor turkey wouldn't have much of a future. WP is not the place for them to spread their propaganda on Gibraltar.

<dd>No Geni, I haven't misunderstood the policy, perhaps you misunderstand me. By "neutralise" I mean "make it neutral", by adding things like "However Gibraltarians argue...." or "The governemt of Gibraltar points out....", or sometimes just editing it to neutral language. But there are also many things there which are either outright untrue, or purposely placed their to create mischeif. Some ppl there are acting like playground bully boys, and taking advantage of then fact that I am clearly outnumbered. They are not interested in truth or neutrality just in blackening the name of my hometown and it's people. It seems an obsession of many. Surely this is not the purpose of WP? Hispa in particular has no concept of truth and many of his "contributions" are just thinly veiled venemous attacks. --<a href="../../../g/i/b/User%7EGibraltarian_6c70.html" title="User:Gibraltarian">Gibraltarian</a> 18:47, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You should understand, Gibraltarian, that qualifying people as you do is not the best way to be listened. The problem with the Gibraltar article is that you insist on deleting the positions that you don't like (all of them qualified as the Spain's or Spanish Government's statements) in the name of a NPOV. Of course that blocking the whole Gibraltarian range is a extreme measure (unavoidable once you decided to vandalize the Spain article, the vandalisms alerts and violating the wikipetiquette). I think that the best way to solve this problem is just blocking <a href="../../../../es/g/i/b/Gibraltar.html" class="extiw" title="es:Gibraltar">es:Gibraltar</a> (maybe forever if you go on trying to impose you POV as the NPOV). BTW, all the statements in the article has a proper description on who support each of them. --<a href="../../../e/c/e/User%7EEcemaml_a689.html" title="User:Ecemaml">Ecemaml</a> 19:31, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, Ecemaml, again you distort the position. At the moment the .es article on Gibraltar is merely being used a a vehicle for spanish anti-Gibraltar propaganda. Much of it is purely spanish POV. You have deleted other edits which reflected the Gibraltar POV, and some parts have been deliberately written to create discord. It is indeed possible to write things in a manner which reflect simple facts, and do not reflect either position. If some have a chip on their shoulder over Gibraltar then they should find another forum for their frustrations, WP is not it. WP is an encyclopedia, NOT an anti-Gibraltar propaganda forum. It is meant to be a FREE site, which ALL can edit, not just when YOU think it convenient or when their views happen to coincide with yours. The block on Gibraltar (or a permenent block on the page) is totally unjustifiable. No matter how much people cry about it here, or vandalise or ignore NPOV on the Gibraltar article, Gib will still be 100% British. Some seem to think that they are getting some kind of childish revenge on Gibraltar by posting nonsense on the article. If that is what really hurts some.....then as I said before they should find another place to vent their frustrations. Neither you nor Dodo "own" the Gibraltar article. Posting alternative viewpoints or simply re-writing something so that it reads neutral in the first place is NOT vandalism.</dd>

<dd>Gibraltarian, you know that you're simply lying. The whole article states clearly what is a Gibraltarian statement and what is a Spanish statement. The problem is that you want that the article "prove" that the Gibraltarian position is correct (and, you know, that's not the NPOV). And you are actually recognizing that everytime you say "<i>No matter how much people cry about it here, or vandalise or ignore NPOV on the Gibraltar article, <b>Gib will still be 100% British</b></i>" or "<i>If that is what really hurts some.....then as I said before they should find another place to vent their frustrations</i>". I'm afraid that either the Gibraltar article or, if you go on vandalizing other articles, the whole IP address range will go on being blocked. --<a href="../../../e/c/e/User%7EEcemaml_a689.html" title="User:Ecemaml">Ecemaml</a> 14:07, 17 October 2005 (UTC) PD: and sorry to go on this discussion in the wrong place.</dd>

<dd>Ecemaml, I will not be called a liar by the likes of you! Just because you have no argument you resort to insults! The article is VERY POV, whether you like it or not. FACT! It highlights spanish propaganda, and even outright lies, and trivialises the Gibraltar position. Most of it is entirely unnecessary as many things can be written using entirely neutral language which invokes niether view point. But some has been deliberatley written with the intention of causing discord, and of insulting the people of Gibraltar. This is unnacceptable in WP. No matter how you try and twist the issue, the block remains totally unjustifiable. I have not vandalised anything. It is YOU who are the liar! It is clear from the comments of many that they have an anti-Gibraltar agenda, they are obsessed with it.....what upsets you is the fact that I have rumbled this. There are other places to slag off Gibraltar if that is your fancy, but WP is not it!</dd>

<p>Do not remove my comments to another position so you can keep having your argument (which should not be here) without it being interrupted to actually give pointers that are relevant to this page. Such a move is vandalism, and appears to be an attempt to get me to shut up (when all I have been trying to do is mediate and point out this argument should not be here) so you can continue your inappropriate argument about the POV content of an article from another wiki.

<dd>I'm not greatly offended by either, but I fail to see why a symbolic representation of "allah" would be more offensive than say the username "allah sucks" (being more descriptive in what and how allah allegedly sucks in that last username will make it more offensive should you feel the argument needs it). --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 05:38, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As to the other point, I don't agree with blocking non-ISO-8859-1 characters... perhaps non-Latin at most, although if we ever implement cross-interwiki logins, users on other Wikipedias will naturally want to use the same username here. However, there's no reason why eastern European characters shouldn't be allowed. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 05:34, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd be fine with keeping the combining accents, but that should be enough. This is the english wikipedia, so usernames should be readable and recognisable by people who speak/read only english. --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 05:38, 16 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The only difference between áàâäãå (ISO-8859-1) and āăą (non-ISO-8859-1) is an accident of history, a Cold War artefact. Really, any Latin alphabet name should be acceptable. Regarding non-Latin usernames, well, we shouldn't prematurely shut the door on the possibility of cross-interwiki logins. Also, we've long had nearly unrestricted signatures and many users such as <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">User:Mel Etitis</a> have put non-Latin characters there. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 06:28, 16 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah, as I said, I'd be fine with all the combining accents (ideally with usernames being accent-stripped unique, but perhaps that's too much to ask). The unified login system would be a fresh problem I'll admit, but since it doesn't look like we'll be getting that any time soon, let's cross that bridge when we get to it. --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 06:32, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am opposed to character set discrimination. A Chinese or Arabic or similar name is most accurately written only its original character set. Bastardized English tranliterations can be necessary for things like driver's licenses where it is impossible to write the proper character set, but if we do not have that limitation. The only argument for allowing things like áàâäãå but excluding other scripts is that accented characters can be read (more or less) by us poor English speakers. That problem is easily solved by asking people like இ and 음낭 to provide an English handle on their user page or sig. In my opinion, it is neither necessary or appropriate to limit logins to just latin-like scripts. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 07:35, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But what about article histories and such? I'd hate to have to puzzle out a 3RR violation with multiple users with similar names in a foreign (to me) script. And then there's the confusion of people talkin about their edits on talk and not being able to tell just by reading the talk page who they are. (Mind you, I'm not a big fan of signatures that don't contain usernames anyway, latin script or not). --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 08:54, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>This username clearly violates the policy that a username should not be the one of a famous historical or religious figure.

<p><i>Earlier today you blocked User:Flash Virus on the grounds of inappropriate username.

<dd>I agree. The new user log is useful, but let's not go over the top on blocking on usernames.

He cited <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>, but that's only a guideline and this is just a poll, not a disruption. He said he would allow any other user to insert the poll without blocking them, although he would (and already has) gotten into a revert war with other editors over it on the talk page. If it were a disruption, then it wouldn't matter who inserted it, so he's acting in bad faith and abusing the principle to censor it. He also cited the fact that I am /warned/ against ruleslawyering as part of an arbitration case, but how that applies to creating a poll and further how it applies to getting BLOCKED for making one is beyond me. Even people who thought my poll was stupid agree it should have still been allowed, so he is certainly not acting according to policy, let alone any sort of consensus.</p>

<p>Note snowspinner later <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=Snowspinner&amp;page=User%3ANjyoder" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=Snowspinner&amp;page=User%3ANjyoder" rel="nofollow">blocked Njyoder</a> for saying "Hipocrite seems to be voicing a vote only because of personal disdain for gator1. The guy seems to follow gator around.". I undid this block as snowspinner was rather strongly involved and it seemed like a very wide interpretation of the term "personal attack" to me. Both Njyoder and Snowspinner are handling this badly, and I'd second RN's sgugestion of a wikibreak for both of them. --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 00:16, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Don't be absurd. Njyoder is a pernicious troll every bit as bad as a dozen we've banned. Indulging him is idiocy. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 00:39, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Could the persons expressing concern over this terrible treatment of Njyoder please familiarise themselves with his modes of interaction on Wikipedia hitherto, so as to inform their opinions to a suitable degree in the hope of making them more apposite before posting them here.

<dd>How are those relevent? You're engaging in <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a> in an attempt to distract from the fact that he's not acting in accordance with any policy. "Because we think he's [insert insult here], we should be able to do whatever we want to him" isn't a valid argument. <a href="../../../n/j/y/User%7ENjyoder_568f.html" title="User:Njyoder">Nathan J.

<li>Yoder, what is the poll you wish to insert about? - 131.211.51.34 13:18, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Just to bludgeon the point home: Yoder's on a Really Short Leash personal attack parole. If an admin considers it a personal attack under that rule, it counts as one - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 15:11, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Under your misinterpretation I could say "hello, how are you doing?" and admin could block it as a "personal attack" and no admin would be able to reverse the block by the simple fact that they said that they "considered it a personal attack." I'll note, that you're also misrepresenting what the ruling actually says, which IS NOT that "if any admin considers it a personal attack, it counts as one." It says if an admin considers an edit a personal attack I _may be_ blocked up to 24 hours, so other admins are given discretion over whether or not a block stands. <a href="../../../n/j/y/User%7ENjyoder_568f.html" title="User:Njyoder">Nathan J.

<dd>any admin may block you, and any admin may revert that block if they think it unfair: The fact is that admins (i.e. people with some record of good judgement) are trusted by the arbcom to block you (a person with a record of insufficient self-control), and that Wikipedia is prepared to risk losing you as a contributor over a trifle at this point. If I was in your position, I would concentrate on writing a few brilliant articles, and lay off the wikilawyering for a while. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 16:18, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
