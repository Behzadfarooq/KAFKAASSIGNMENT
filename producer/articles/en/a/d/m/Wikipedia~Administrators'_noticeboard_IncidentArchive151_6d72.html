<p>As noted above, the ISP in question very much appears to assign IP numbers with significant persistence. Possibly this IP number could be blocked until the end of the present term at CSU-Chico, or until the end of the spring term. However, it may be that the editor can easily migrate to a different IP number, and a block past the present term (which will presumably end in less than a month) might obstruct other persons in the subsequent term or terms.</p>
<p>A {{sharedip}} at the top of <a href="../../../1/3/2/User_talk%7E132.241.246.111.html" title="User talk:132.241.246.111">User talk:132.241.246.111</a> asserts that “In the event of vandalism from this address, efforts will be made to contact California State University, Chico to report network abuse.” I don't want here to argue whether these edits were <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">“made in a deliberate attempt to compromise the integrity of Wikipedia”</a>, but simply to note that warning was given that CSU-Chico might be contacted in response to <i>some</i> sorts of edits.</p>

<p>I have had to warn this user of both 3RR and vandalism in the last 48 hours. Looking over the user's contributions, it is apparent that this IP has only been used by one person. This person tends to treat Wikipedia as the comments section of a blog, making clever comments about politics: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mike_DeWine&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=86865940" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mike_DeWine&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=86865940" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">lk</span></a> — 18:57, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>and I'm sure I saw another today. In each case an edit seems to have been completely garbled. The usual glitches I've seen with the site (other than those related to the server being busy) have usually been short-lived and restricted to weird <b>viewing</b> characteristics, not the actual informational content of the project.

Unfortunately, back through September, I have yet to find a time they edited simultaneously. In fact, when both accounts edit on the same day, one shows up approximately twenty minutes after the other one stops and vice versa. Both accounts also disappeared from Sept 13 to the 25th when they resumed editing the same day in the same pattern. The checkuser may have only been likely and not confirmed, but the editing evidence doesn't look good. Considering that these accounts were used to help reach consensus on the same article and have voted on the same AfDs, I can understand why one was blocked indef. <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShell_Kinney_fd26.html" title="User:Shell Kinney">Shell</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7EShell_Kinney_fbce.html" title="User talk:Shell Kinney">babelfish</a></sup> 20:17, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The evidence is circumstantial, and the user Elalan seems to have challenged these alleged inconsistencies on the sockpuppetry case page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Suspected_sock_puppets/Trincomanb" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Suspected_sock_puppets/Trincomanb" rel="nofollow">here</a>. In any case, his case is still open, and I don't think the admin that blocked him checked the points raised. And the reasons for the block have not been proven or explained. Neither has the "Likely" comment. In any case, like the <a href="../../../o/s/g/User%7EOsgoodelawyer_264a.html" title="User:Osgoodelawyer">User:Osgoodelawyer</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Essjay&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=91293688" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Essjay&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=91293688" rel="nofollow">said</a>, an explanation should have atleast been given.

<dd>When I logged on to my User Page a short while ago, there was an extremely inappropriate image at the top of the Signpost "front page" and below it was a comment by a vandal, something to the effect that "(X) rules!" I removed the Signpost template from my User Page and that solved the problem there. I subsequently looked at the Talk page of another user who I remembered has Signpost on her page (DakotaKahn) and the vandalism was visible there too. It is not visible there now, but the title "Signpost" is not displayed as it normally is which may be an after-effect of the vandalism. -- <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolaris999_f479.html" title="User:Polaris999">Polaris999</a> 08:28, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The RfA was initiated by Mr. Knodel, apparently as an attempt to freeze the article with his website linked from Wikipedia for as long as possible <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sex_tourism&amp;curid=113534&amp;diff=91712588&amp;oldid=91608006" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sex_tourism&amp;curid=113534&amp;diff=91712588&amp;oldid=91608006" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sex_tourism&amp;diff=90365651&amp;oldid=90213126" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sex_tourism&amp;diff=90365651&amp;oldid=90213126" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sex_tourism&amp;diff=90159692&amp;oldid=90133265" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sex_tourism&amp;diff=90159692&amp;oldid=90133265" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>.</p>

<p>Linking The Sly Traveller appears to be Mr. Knodel's driving issue. His other edits are probably intended to defend and promote traffic to his website. — <a href="../../../e/d/g/User%7EEdgarde_393d.html" title="User:Edgarde">edgarde</a> 00:30, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'll note that the concept of a 'hung' ArbCom doesn't apply here. The case had three 'accept' votes at the time this section was posted; a fourth was posted a couple of hours later, indicating that the ArbCom will definitely be hearing this case. Edgarde might not be familiar with the somewhat slower pace associated with formal Arbitration..</dd>
<dd>In any case, since this matter is now before the ArbCom, I encourage admins to handle it with caution. To Edgarde or anyone else who wishes to have some sort of binding resolution in place before the entire Arbitration is complete, might I suggest requesting an appropriate temporary injunction from the ArbCom? I would also advise and encourage anyone taking an administrative action that it would be sensible to report it on the appropriate Arb page, just to keep the ArbCom in the loop. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 15:11, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Currently the vote is (4/1/0/0). If I understand the ArbCom procedure (and I may not), a <i>net</i> 4 votes is required, and as there is currently 1 dissenting vote, there is nothing definite about this going to arbitration. Furthermore, there haven't been more than 5 votes on any Arbitration in at least a couple months. There are only 9 "active" arbitrators, and some ain't <i>that</i> active.</dd>

<dd>I think the case will either be accepted for arbitration or not within the next couple of days.

<dd>You can request an injunction in a couple of ways. Before the case is opened, I would suggest just making an explicit request in your statement.
<dl>
<dd><i>If this case is accepted, I would apply for an immediate injunction barring Mr. Knodel (or anyone) from adding a link to the Sly Traveler to <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_tourism.html" title="Sex tourism">sex tourism</a>/barring Mr. Knodel from editing <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_tourism.html" title="Sex tourism">sex tourism</a> or related articles/barring the involved parties from editing <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_tourism.html" title="Sex tourism">sex tourism</a> or related articles..</i> (Pick one or more and edit as appropriate.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>After the case is opened, there will be a place on the case subpage where you can request an injunction.</dd>
<dd>The four <i>net</i> votes thing is unusual. I'm wondering where it came from, as I can't locate any discussion about it. I'll ask about it on the RFArb talk page in a little bit, after I do some sleuthing. Frankly, I think it's an inadvertant error, because it raises the bar against accepting cases – in my opinion – far too high. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 17:14, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Here's what concerns me about this troll. First, the IPs don't match cplot's as confirmed by the usercheck. However, they're all from the same city (Chicago). Are we supposed to believe this guys supposed friends actuallky live in the same city. That strains all credibility. Second, even if it is a group of friends, they're clearly conspiring together to make us look like a bbunch of fools. Third, look at this trolls username: cplot. That expands to "communist plot". That could be what we're dealing with. cplot and all his communist friends have banded together to conspire and make us look like a bunch of assholes. But that's not all. They seem to pretend they don't k now exactly what's going on here: like there's some doubt in their mind of what the actual scenario they're combatting. That's the tipical MO for communists who have an inside man they're trying to protect. Now look at this evidence. C-P-L-O-T, that's five letters. M-O-N-G-O,that's five letters too. I think it's clear from this that the inside man must be Mongo. --<a href="../../../v/i/u/User%7EVIUlyanov_af75.html" title="User:VIUlyanov">VIUlyanov</a> 00:55, 3 December 2006 (UTC) {subst:spa|VIUlyanov}}</dd>

<p>This is a user with a litany of complaints logded against him. He has been caught lying about contents of reference and is generally just stubborn and uncooperative. In an ongoing effort to insert poorly sources information into <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudoscience.html" title="Pseudoscience">Pseudoscience</a>, KrishnaVindaloo has most recently left threatening edit summaries that can be summarized as "don't revert my edits or else..." I personally have just been asking him to supply us (the editors on Pseudoscience) with a means of accessing the source material or to merely give us a direct quote that shows us that the source states what he claim it states. While this isn't required, I was made weary of his source the first time he tried to introduce it and made it state something that the source did not state (I at least learned this from a summary of the source).</p>
<p>Anyhow, before I make your head spin with all of the details, let me get to the matter at hand. KrishnaVindaloo has now opted to take <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chiropractic.html" title="Chiropractic">Chiropractic</a> hostage to "teach us all a lesson". His last comment on the talk page there reads like a ransom note:</p>

While these topics we edit are heated and KrishnaVindaloo is on the other side of the debate from me, please don't think that this is my reasoning for bringing this up here now.

<p>I don't claim to know what action is appropriate. Perhaps a block is finally in order? Any help or guidance you can provide will be much appreciated. Thank you. <a href="../../../l/e/v/User%7ELevine2112_645e.html" title="User:Levine2112">Levine2112</a> 18:19, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I second Levine2112's motion here and share his concerns. Even though I often side with the POV that Krishna represents, I find his uncollaborative attitude to be abhorrent. He continually twists the disputes about his personal mannerisms to make them look like disputes about NPOV, RS, etc.. That is certainly part of the problem at times, but the underlying red thread that runs through all controversies involving his edits (and there are always controversies!!) is his uncollaborative attitude.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In connection with these disputes, I have repeatedly seen the following phrase used as a weapon by Krishna, who will not collaborate with editors who hold opposing POV, simply because he is convinced that he is right (and he may well be, but his attitude stinks....):</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"NPOV policy trumps consensus."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, but the nature of editing at Wikipedia means that an assumption of good faith involves collaborative editing. An editor who fails to collaborate, no matter how right and proper their edits are in relation to all policies, will not succeed. In practice,</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"Collaboration trumps all other policies."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Without collaboration between editors of opposing POV nothing functions as intended, and Wikipedia policies won't work in an uncollaborative environment. Krishna's editing here is doomed to fail until he learns this. His presence here does nothing but create severe irritation, edit wars, and lots of wasted time. Nothing has helped so far, so I recommend a block of at least a week. Shorter than that won't affect him at all. -- <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFyslee_abcc.html" title="User:Fyslee">Fyslee</a> 19:49, 1 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Concur also. I have seen him lie, posting a source and claiming it supports his edits, and upon investigating the source it in no way even mentions the topic! When confronted with this, he keeps adding the content anyway, repeating "NPOV trumps consensus" like it was a magical mantra to make all his edits unassailable - meanwhile ignoring that he has no source. He is incredibly hostile and self rightous, and I have never seen him actually work with other editors. He wasted my time and irritated me beyond expression.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a> (<a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_KillerChihuahua_bba5.html" title="Special:Contributions/KillerChihuahua">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<dd>KV may very well be one of the most tendentious, disruptive and dishonest editors I have ever had the displeasure of having to deal with. There's no need to magnify what has been said above: all of it is true and painful. KV simply refuses to cooperate, refuses to follow policies and guidelines, refuses to respect his fellow editors and refuses to take responsibility for his mideeds. On top of this, his tendentious edits and pigheaded attitude have caused good editors to leave either the pages he has worked on, or, in one case, Wikipedia itself. This simply must stop. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FF2400">•Jim</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#F4C430">62</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">sch•</font></a> 21:12, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>At this stage a block is unquestionably warranted, it's just a question of how long it should be.

<p>There seems to be a little bit of a quarrel that may be bubbling over, so I'm bringing it here in the hopes of getting more outside views.</p>
<p>Earlier today I asked a question of all ArbCom candidates (this is not unusual; many others have asked the same question of all candidates). My question was concerning whether the candidates would be voting on or commenting on other candidates. I think this was a reasonable concern, as it could get really ugly if two ArbCom candidates got into a large argument <i>during</i> the election and then they both ended up sitting on the committee together. But that is neither here nor there.</p>
<p>Another user objected to my view and thinks that ArbCom candidates should vote and comment on other candidates. That's a perfectly acceptable viewpoint to have. But I was not happy when he posted his response to my question on all 37 ArbCom candidate question pages where I asked the question. I wasn't asking the question of him, I was asking the question of the candidates. Also, threaded discussion is discouraged on these question and answer pages because it leads things to degenerate into arguments and creates a much larger volume of text for potential voters to have to wade through. It should be a simple question and answer format. So I went through and removed the other user's response to my question.</p>
<p>He is free to ask his own questions, of course, even on this same topic if he wishes, but I do not think the threaded discussion and commenting on my questions is appropriate. So, what should be done if these kind of situations pop up in the future? Should we maybe have some sort of neutral third-party watching over these question/answer pages making sure that they stick to the format and that candidates always get the first shot at answering questions, not someone else?

<dd>I'm sorry if my initial question was unclear, but I later went back through and revised it to make it obvious that I was asking the candidates' opinions on voting and commenting on other candidates. I was asking my question of the candidates, not of Mailer Diablo, and so I removed his response to my questions. If he would like to ask the candidates questions under his own section heading, he can of course do that, but I was not particularly looking for his (or any non-candidates') response when I posted my question. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 23:56, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not commenting on this. But I think there is broader question here (and since I'm a candidate, I won't try to answer it). Are the 'candidate question pages' simply for questions and the candidate's reply (perhaps followed up with a supplementary question)? Or, are threaded discussions with perhaps multiple parties commenting, also valuable. As candidates, we must bow to the consensus here, but it might be worth the uninvolved expressing a view.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 23:52, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Idealy question pages should be for questions and answers only. Third parties shouldn't really be commenting. While Cyde's question could be viewed as somewhat loaded he was free to ask it and it should be left to the candidates to answer or not answer as they will.<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 01:40, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Cyde's question is inherently divisive because it appears to encourages candidates to act rather than answering with a return statement. It is no different from the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_deletion_Log_2006_August_14_3e2b.html#Category:Administrators_open_to_recall" title="Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/Log/2006 August 14">admin recall controvsery</a> some time ago, whereby the question of "There's an admin recall category, admins in good standing have signed up, what do you think" have been inserted in all <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFA_4c83.html" title="WP:RFA">Requests for Adminship</a> applications, in which indirectly "peer pressures" candidates into signing up. In this case, it appears that the question, intentionally or unintentionally, is encouraging candidates not to cast their votes, and we never had this form of precedence. I was merely gently reminding candidates about the acutal potential cause of conflict amongst candidates, and I was reverted over on 37 pages. - <a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMailer_diablo_6ffa.html" title="User:Mailer diablo">Mailer Diablo</a> 23:56, 2 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You were also potentially biasing the responses to my questions. Arbitrators have to know how to deal with all sorts of situations that come up, including situations such as the "admin recall controversy" where a user states his own view before asking if another shares it. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 23:58, 2 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>For the record, I'll copy and paste the addeum in full&#160;: "<i>Hello, I'd say that you ultimately reserve the right to excercise your vote. It should be already understood by all respected and high-esteemed candidates that by the end of this election, there should be no hard feelings regardless of supports or opposes. As from my observations at the January elections, hard feelings usually come not from the votes, but from the comments that are associated with the votes. Henceforth, I think restraining to comment in your votes is the best way to go. - Good luck and best regards</i>" - <a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMailer_diablo_6ffa.html" title="User:Mailer diablo">Mailer Diablo</a> 00:01, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm not sure that Mailer Diablo's action was wise - afterall, Cyde was entitled to ask a question and the responses should have come from the candidates. But, wise or not, I think it was open to Mailer Diablo to suggest a response in the civil and thoughtful way that he did. I can't see any policy breach. For Cyde to revert out the comment 37 times doesn't seem very collegial. Remember, Mailer Diablo is a respected editor and admin, not a vandal or troll. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 00:25, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>The question is whether it is a good faith question or a question with ulterior motives. I had assumed that it was merely left field. Then a new candidate appeared just at the last second who has had a <i>tremendous</i> amount of bad blood surrounding, and, in particular, has had very bad dealings with several of the candidates.

<dd>Thats okay, no offense taken. I've made more embarrassing assumptions. Such as telling now defunct User:I Hate Drano Drinker that he was a jackass because I <i>thought</i> he was getting personal with me. Turns out, he had good reason to be angry. Apparantly he had some rare can of Drano from the 60's that he was going to sell on Ebay for a TON of money. Well, long story short, his roommate got drunk one night and chugged it. Now he has to continue working as restroom attendant at the Broken Biker Boozehouse.</dd>

<p>While they are probably the same person (hard to tell as neither has any non-deleted edits), if that person isn't abusing having two accounts, they are allowed to have them.

<dd>I never understood why the removal of warnings has been contentious. Yes, the warnings are still in the history, but no vandal-fighter is going to look in the history before issuing a warning. If vandal-fighters keep adding {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest2_cdb7.html" title="Template:Test2">test2</a>}} warnings, only to have them removed by the warned user, the user would never get blocked and continue vandalizing. Having warnings easily visible is beneficial to vandal-fighters and administrators, and so I believe the removal of warnings ought to be disallowed, unless the warning(s) in question is/are patently ridiculous. -- <b><a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETariqabjotu_f37f.html" title="User:Tariqabjotu"><font color="black">tariq</font><font color="gray">abjotu</font></a></b> 03:36, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hello Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I am a Wiktionary contributor, sysop, checkuser, and bot operator.</p>
<p>I responded to a query on <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/WT:ID" class="extiw" title="wikt:WT:ID">wikt:WT:ID</a> today, about List of idioms in the English language (A). Apparently, I've uncovered several major problems with interproject coordination.</p>
<ul>
<li>On the closed AfD page, right up at the top, it says:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The following discussion is an archived debate of the proposed deletion of the article below. Please do not modify it. Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or in a deletion review). No further edits should be made to this page.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, in order to get this artice transwiki'ed, I did the most natural thing in the world. I followed the link for "deletion review." I expected the entry to be restored to the main namespace and tagged with {{<a href="../../../c/o/p/Template%7ECopy_to_Wiktionary_891b.html" title="Template:Copy to Wiktionary">Copy to Wiktionary</a>}} so that my <a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECopyToWiktionaryBot_a3e4.html" title="User:CopyToWiktionaryBot">User:CopyToWiktionaryBot</a> could move the entry to Wiktionary, where it belongs, so that it can <b>then</b> be deleted here. To compose the "deletion review" I had to check back with the AfD.</p>
<ul>
<li>Looking closer at the AfD, I noticed several bizarre things. Nearly every "delete" vote suggested transwiki-ing. Most "keep" votes did also! Yet at no time did the article seem to get tagged for transwiki. Instead, a certain contingent claimed "victory" and deleted useful(?) content.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Looking closer still at the AfD, it seems some very convoluted arguments were being put forth for deletion, inexplicably. Not knowing any better, it seems to me (an outsider on this issue) to be some kind of vendetta. Even though <a href="../../../t/i/n/WP%7ETINC_0d39.html" title="WP:TINC">there is no cabal</a>, the group suggesting deletion certainly gives me the impression that there is.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>By the time I next visited Wikipedia, my "deletion review" had been "speedily closed" with non sequitur comments such as "as we don't have juristiction over Wiktionary." Additionally, the most ardent "delete" supporters were the only ones to comment there...but, there is no cabal.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The comment from <a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a4a9.html" title="User:Elaragirl">User:Elaragirl</a> was particularly concerning: "Endorse Deletion. SIXTEEN deletes. FOUR transwiki. Where do you see a consensus to transwiki? The article was a mess, the AfD was properly closed, and the only consensus I can find is that most people felt that transwikiing was the wrong move. Ask for a userfy. You are not following process, and quite frankly, deliberately misrepresenting a clear-cut AfD decision."
<ul>
<li>First of all, most of the "delete" votes suggested "dicdef" or "WPINAD" or "transwiki".</li>
<li>Next: adding the "keep" votes and the "transwiki" votes show no clear majority to delete. Have Wikipedia deletion processes changed that much recently?</li>
<li>Next: The AfD <b>can't</b> have been properly closed if it wasn't transwikied first.</li>
<li>Next: As of right now, I've never <i>seen</i> the entry, so I can't comment on the unlikely comment "The article was a mess." My only involvement here is to get it transwikied to Wiktionary. But if (A) is anything like (B), then you must be an extraordinarily picky person, to call it "a mess."</li>
<li>Next: A userfy deliberately invalidates the transwiki automation.</li>
<li>Next: I am following the directions on the page I was presented with, Ma'am.</li>
<li>Next: Elaragirl is deliberately misrepresenting the AfD and slandering me, why?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, I know that it is my personal choice to avoid Wikipedia. Did I really do something wrong here? Why was this onslaught so vitriolic? (Note: Elaragirl was not alone in his/her vehemence...just the most abrasive of the comments there.)</p>
<p>Do Wikipedians, in general, really have no clue whatsoever, as to how Transwiki works? The old-style copy of articles was abandoned as soon as the MediaWiki software allowed a GFDL compliant method. "Userfy" (if I understand your jargon correctly) is not a viable option.</p>

A transwiki was determined to be unnecessary because Wiktionary covers this topic to a much greater depth with hundreds more than what we had.

<dd>Comment. A transwiki was inappropriate. Does Wiktionary do lists? At any rate, it seems as though the exhaustive Wiktionary category for idioms covers this far better than a list would do. Transwiki to where? Per MER-C, the list self-evidently did not belong <i>here</i>, at any rate. Suggesting that there is a "vendetta" on behalf of Wikipedians towards any article is a clear violation of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. Your further hints at the existence of some cabal that pursues this vendetta are also objectionable. The "Deletionist Cabal" is nothing more than a joke page at Meta, I'm afraid. Complaining that the AFD was "disgusting" is furthermore a violation of the spirit, if not the letter, of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>. As far as I'm aware a "Transwiki" vote basically adds up to "Get it out of Wikipedia, but please do send it elsewhere". Both the AFD and the DRV were correctly closed. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoreschi_31bb.html" title="User:Moreschi">Moreschi</a> 15:17, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Everything about this situation is absolutely demented. You don't <i>need</i> a consensus for transwiki. That's a stupid idea. You don't <i>ever</i> refuse to transwiki when someone wants it. Would everyone please take a minute to think about this: <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiktionary.html" title="Wiktionary">Wiktionary</a> is a sister project of Wikipedia's. There, people just like yourself are engaged in the same broader project of collecting knowledge in a free format, only their category of knowledge is different from ours. If you've ever read a news article about Wikipedia that made you incensed, or even just a little bit mad, because the writer clearly wasn't even familiar with Wikipedia, (saying things like "there's no requirement for accuracy" or citing a vandalized revision that existed for two minutes as evidence of unreliability) then you'll know how you sound to a Wiktionarian. If you aren't a Wiktionarian and aren't familiar with the inclusion criteria, then you have no business specifying whether something should not be allowed to be transwikied, when someone from Wiktionary asks for it. It's very disappointing the way Wikipedians treat the other projects, and it's nothing new. If Wiktionary had an acceptable Wikipedia article, should we be subject to the whims of their deletion process: if they decide that transwiki is a bad idea, we shouldn't get it? If someone from Wiktionary comes here and tells us that his bot can't transwiki userspace items, the proper response is to lave aside the process for a minute and <i>help</i>; telling him to just do it manually is insulting. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 19:25, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think I made it <i>very clear</i> in my closing statement that if someone wants to transwiki it they only need to ask me. I have no issue with it, but the mandate wasn't clear enough for me to automatically put it on the transwiki backlog and expect it to be moved in two or three months. In addition the article was wholly unsourced, so keeping it in the article space was not an option. Connel, like anyone else, could've just simply contacted me on my talk page and asked for userfication, or even ask for a temporary restoration in article space to let the bot do its work. But seemingly his MO is to assume bad intent on the closer's side, misrepresent the outcome of the AfD and tie everybody's time up with unnecessary procedural discussions. <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> or <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> nowhere to be seen. With such an attitude Amarkov's unwillingness to jump up and help in any possible way is perfectly understandable. In any case it seems like the bot his done its work so I redeleted the article. For future encouters I propose people try to check back with the closing admin first before they bust a vein in their foreheads. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 08:37, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think you made that very clear in your closing statement (obviously.) What I needed was the entry restored to NS:0, you were clear that you would not cooperate with such a request, instead forcing the article to the useless userspace. I followed the links that were on <i>that page</i> that described HOW TO REQUEST AN UN-DELETION. How on earth should I reach the illogical conclusion that I should instead, search the deletion log, then contact the user listed there?</dd>
<dd>Anyway, AGF is invalidated by the previous demonstrations of violating that good faith - please, go re-read <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>! When I investigated the link supplied on Wiktionary, I saw numerous inconsistencies (such as the consensus to transwiki, but no clear consensus to delete, resulting in a delete!) I saw personal attacks and inexplicable side-taking. What good faith was left to assume? <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> was long since abandoned on that AfD page, by the way.</dd>
<dd>So apparently your MO is to not assume that I was just following directions, EXACTLY as the AfD page suggested, but instead to publicly slander me for pointing out that the original deletion did not have consensus in the first place? I got a wicked smack down immediately from your cabal, and I shouldn't be upset about it? You wouldn't get <i>just a little bit</i> defensive, in a similar situation? --<a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConnel_MacKenzie_91fe.html" title="User:Connel MacKenzie">Connel MacKenzie</a> - <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User_talk:Connel_MacKenzie" class="extiw" title="wikt:User_talk:Connel_MacKenzie">wikt</a> 04:45, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Folks, the whole reason we do transwikis to a Transwiki: pseudo-namespace is that the <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Transwiki" class="extiw" title="m:Transwiki">policy on meta</a> indicates that we do so in order to allow the other project to pick if they want it or not. So, if we do not want something, and it fits into another project, we send it, <i>and then</i> we allow the other sister project to decide whether they want it or not. It is not our call. I have half a mind to undelete it myself and poke Connel to run his bot, but it's too early in the morning to cause an edit war... <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">xd</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a>)</sup> 19:35, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Agree with Dmcdevit and Tawker. Let Wiktionary decide what to do with the information. I have moved this to the original article title so the transwikibot can run properly. It is tagged for transwiki and will dissapear soon so the righteous Wikipedians who are so offended won't have long to wait before they can sleep again. Sheesh.

<dd>There's absolutely no basis for these paranoid accusations, and I only began earnestly editing Scientology articles this very evening. For the most part I haven't even been editing per se, I've just been pointing out some POV/sourcing problems and trying to open it up for consensus on the talk pages. I don't think my use of tags was "spurious" and am happy to discuss the matter with impartial editors. I've been explaining my edits on every talk page, which is more than I can say for the editors who automatically revert without using the talk page. Finally, the claim of "provoking fights with other editors" is a just-plain lie, no other way to say it. This whole Scientology thing tonight has been quite bizarre. I've been on the receiving end of the fight-provoking, not the inciting end, and I can prove it with diffs if anyone really wants to drag this into a big debacle. I'd prefer to work on improving the articles, however. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighfructosecornsyrup_c20f.html" title="User:Highfructosecornsyrup">Highfructosecornsyrup</a> 06:28, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

He created an article immediately, used correct categories, sections, external linking, wikicode, stubbed and used an edit summary (big teller) and then signed correctly on his first ever talk page edit.<br />

You're also very knowledgeable about Scientology. You picked a copyright violation out straight away, and know the subject, well, like you have studied it for two years. Thats fine, so have I. But, what I dont believe, and nor do many others; is that you've been here, studying wikipedia for two years (your words) - with a clear point of view when it comes to subjects, like scientology. And, with all the unbsourced, bias artcles you seem to think we have = over that 2 year study period, you never tried to add a source, fix some POV, vote for something, for 2 years. Then you create an account one day, and all hell breaks lose.

Having looked through the talk history too I noticed several IP addresses that seem to be one in purpose with this user. Although my IP address shows up there too when I forgot to sign in, the difference is that I went back and signed my user name next to it. I know that it is not neccessary to sign in or register, but this user has utilized multiple IP address with the apparent intent of sockpuppetry, I know that he has been chastised at each IP for misconduct, is engaged at what can only be called vandalism at the aforementioned article, and has even signed his name (on the Strata talk page) so as to not show his IP address but rather redirect to the Wikipedia article "Blah." This seems wrong to me. I would like him to stick to either one username, or one IP unless he has a good reason otherwise because its deceptive. I think he edits under multiple IPs to give the impression that his content is acceptable to multiple people rather than the lies it is.

<dd>I strongly support Guy's block, even though I was about to give him another chance on the 3RR (having made absoloutely sure he knew about the rule). I support the block because of: the 3RR violation, the incivility (see talk page) and the disruption (serial reports to aiv, the constant arguing, editing/deleting guy's comments if he doesn't like them. I would welcome the input from other admins however, I just gave up trying to get him to calm down/see reason, there appears to be no point - at least at this stage. <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViridae_a0d4.html" title="User:Viridae">Viridae</a><a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViridae_b84f.html" title="User talk:Viridae"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 13:17, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

At first glance, both users are in violation of the 3RR. Fys claims that this doesn't apply since the removal is vandalism. However, the information is negative in tone, and sourced in a blog; Detox therefore claims it is in violation of BLP. They have discussed this on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Fys&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=91353093" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Fys&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=91353093" rel="nofollow">Fys's talk page</a>, where Detox explains why the information is improper, and Fys asserts that <i>"Until the site is removed from the internet, the reference stays."</i> Without knowing anything further of the circumstances, it seems obvious to me that this removal is not simple vandalism, and that Fys was properly blocked for revert warring.

<dd>Well, there's a clear violation of 3RR. The block is justified. However, the edit warring was about vandalism in fact. User:Detoxification was removing sourced content. The section in question is based on two sources and not solely on the blog link. I've just read the timesonline's article <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,19809-1573631,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,19809-1573631,00.html" rel="nofollow"><i>A strange case of espionage and warfare inside the commuter belt</i></a> which is referenced on the section. Maybe he was just furious that no one sees teh removal of the <i>sourced</i> content as vandalism. So i don't totally agree w/ you guys about Fys being that dispruptive and uncivil this time. -- <i><a href="../../../f/a/y/User%7EFayssalF_b498.html" title="User:FayssalF"><font size="2px" face="Verdana"><font color="DarkSlateBlue">Szvest</font></font></a></i> Ω <small><a href="../../../f/a/y/User_talk%7EFayssalF_f604.html" title="User talk:FayssalF"><font style="background: orange"><sup><i>Wiki Me Up ®</i></sup></font></a></small> 13:27, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Because of the attempts by Detoxification to talk about the issue I took it as a content dispute - wether that blog was appropriate to be mentioned in the article and not vandalism. <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViridae_a0d4.html" title="User:Viridae">Viridae</a><a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViridae_b84f.html" title="User talk:Viridae"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 13:39, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Precisely. And Fys has without question been an editor for long enough to know this even if it hadn't been pointed out to him several times. If this is a significant criticism then <i>there will be a better source than a political attack blog</i>. Blogs with articles describing the subject as a "dipstick" are not, I'd say, even in the same time-zone as a reliable source for a [[WP:LIVING|biography of a living individual]. Fys asserts that this has been covered in the national press. Fine: let him source it from the national press. A citation to the Times is unlikely to be anything like as controversial as a citation to an attack blog. As an aside, he is right that the other accounts are almost certainly associated with Milton's office, but that does not actually change matters at all, since if the subject of a biography has a problem with questionably sourced content, policy says we remove it there and then without making them find the Foundation's telephone number. Simple vandalism this is not, and the problem is much more with Fys' steadfast refusal to accept that fact - and by extension the deliberately strongly-worded terms of <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a> - than with his other behaviour. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 13:53, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>I note that Fys claims that a talk page consensus exists for his version. Examination of the talk page shows that this issue was first brought up in June, with a variety of editors arguing for and against the case. There does not appear to be a consensual resolution, and the last talk page edit was October 5th.

<dd>Frankly I find Fys' entire approach bloody aggravating. He is still arguing about how he was right all along (despite the fact that nobody else seems to agree), and is now producing sources which, had he provided them earlier instead of simply edit-warring, would have made some difference in the first place - and even that is missing the point because he has yet to acknowledge that <b>this was not simple vandalism</b> (per the judgement of every admin who's looked at it); he is also insisting that good faith be applied to him while assuming exclusively bad faith on the part of others. His past history of disputes on biographies of political figures indicates that this is a stable feature of his editing. He is wasting people's time with low drama when a more reasonable person would have fixed the problem by <i>not citing an attack blog in the first place</i> and certainly by not continuing to report it as vandalism after it had been pointed out to him that it was not. He cannot possibly be in any doubt that this kind of behaviour is disruptive and counter-productive, yet he persists. "Sorry, I'll source it better" or "sorry, I'll take it to talk" would almost certainly have worked - "unblock me now, I was reverting vandalism" when he's been told several times that it <i>isn't</i> vandalism was never going to work. As a desysopped former admin, he clearly has a working knowledge of policy, and cannot possibly be unaware of the issues to do with <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a>, especially after the arbitration case. The major problem then was edit warring instead of discussion, and that is <i>precisely</i> the problem again here, so I will endorse without hesitation any escalation of this block. It is quite a feat to make me in any way sympathetic towards a member of the Monster Raving Tory Party, but Fys has managed it; that much, at least, he can count as an achievement. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 17:27, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Christ knows. I despair, I really do. Fys is an idiot, and I have told him so in as many words. What on earth is the point of baiting people when you want them to help you, and demanding that you are treated as a <i>valued contributor</i> when you have an ArbCom sanction against you? He has behaved like a spoilt child from beginning to end, expecting us to take his word as a desysopped serial disruptor of political biographies against the removal of material based on an attack blog from a <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a> article. Oh yes, that was bound to work, wasn't it? Especially as he then decided to drip-feed the information he should have provided up front if he actually wanted to enlist any support. What a titanic waste of everyone's time.</dd>
<dd>He has undertaken not to repeat the behaviour and to take it to mediation, which is fine by me and I have unblocked him on that basis, but please, everyone, feel free to slap him with a 40lb Wikitrout if he even so much as <i>thinks</i> of resuming his edit war.

<p>Just because Fys shouldn't have been revert warring here doesn't mean that Detox is correct.

<dd>Of course, prior to applying a broad block an admin would need to investigate per Radiant's point above.

<dd>If the single-purpose accounts disrupt articles and refuse to engage in dialogue then they can simply be blocked. Tim Ireland obviously hates Anne Milton with a passion, and the feeling is quite likely mutual. Their views on each other may be notable, the specifics of their spat probably are not. But I leave that to the mediators and editors on those articles. What is clearly unacceptable is edit-warring by Fys, whose tendentious editing of political biographies has been documented by ArbCom and resulted in his desysopping and sanctions.

<dd>NB I thought JzG's change of mind between his first and second version here was significant so I've preserved it using strikeout.

<dd>I thought you would prefer the latter version, but am quite happy with either. You are a tendentious editor, that is, an editor with strong bias who edits aggressively and disruptively. Dress it up how you like. Incidentally, congratulations on using the word <i>censorship</i>, the reliable benchmark indicator of someone without a leg to stand on. As any admin knows, an allegation of censorship, especially when applied to the suggested removal of trolling, is without exception proof positive that trolling is precisely what's going on. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 20:09, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>hello,</p>
<p>we recently bought a new saab 9-2x aero and joined an excellent users forum: http://saab92x.com/ while doing a search on wikipedia for our car, i noticed that our forum wasn't listed as an external link, and edited the links to add our forum.</p>
<p>i posted my actions to our forum, and i was informed that two previous external listings to our excellent forum have been deliberately removed. i am bringing this to your attention as removal of valid links is clearly not consistent with stated wikipedia's policies.</p>
<p>please advise,</p>

<p>-edit conflict- To be clear again, I was supporting myself always&#160;:-) My internet provider DOES NOT give a fix IP to its users, and <i><b>I never denied that they are belonging to me</b></i>. Simply: I was not asked, since he never <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAITH_32f0.html" title="WP:FAITH">assumed good faith</a>. Never. You know, <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAITH_32f0.html" title="WP:FAITH">WP:FAITH</a> would be enough. Just a question before this. If I deny it is right, but <i><b>I DID NOT DENIED IT</b></i> no, never! This is why I also took the case as a personal attack. Because it is.

<dd>Just to clarify the situation, VinceB has a long record of vandalism, personal attack and trolling. He has been blocked several times. Now, he is simply lying as I can easily prove.

The "personal attack warning" templates have been placed by VinceB on my talk page. I will quote VinceB's reason: "<i>I know that I didn't used sockpuppets, beause I has a username here.</i>" Please compare it with the present version "<i>I nearly always do anonim edits instead of using this account</i>". In other words, after the CheckUser confirmed his/her sockpuppetry, VinceB's version of the events was changed from not knowing the 195.56...s into using them in a benign way.

<p>Ususal misinterpreting. I reflected to that User:Slovan or the IPs are sockpuppets of mine. Well, not, because IPs were me (if he would ever drop a question, I would confirm it, but this did not happened). IPs were a month before confirmed by me (see link above - sept 13? anyway september), when checkuser was made (oct 13? - anyway, october).</p>
<p>So In fact checkuser simply proved, that <i>I am not lying</i>, and what I state (for ex on my userpage) is true. Well, knowing this, this above is a personal attack, or not? See. And this line: "In other words, after the CheckUser confirmed his/her sockpuppetry, VinceB's version of the events was changed from not knowing the 195.56...s into using them in a benign way." is a LIE. Oops. Gotcha!</p>
<p>Oh, and whatever I say, Tankred says the same, I accused him POV pushing, he accused me of POV pushing, I accused him of trolling, then he immediately accused me of trolling, etc. The difference was that I always cited my statements, and gave diffs. --<a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVinceB_8193.html" title="User:VinceB">Vince</a> <sup><a href="../../../v/i/n/User_talk%7EVinceB_6f99.html" title="User talk:VinceB">hey, yo!</a>&#160;:-)</sup> 00:52, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>All right, again and more slowly: VinceB explicitly stated that 195.56.242.11 was not his IP and my suspicion that 195.56.242.11 was used by him as a sockpuppet was just a personal attack of mine.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ATankred&amp;diff=80330236&amp;oldid=80329449" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ATankred&amp;diff=80330236&amp;oldid=80329449" rel="nofollow">[73]</a> A CheckUser proved that he indeed used 195.56.242.11 in a disruptive way. Now, he is saying "IPs were me" and "The first [CheckUser] one was also trolling". Who is lying now? And as for the ongoing CheckUser, I do not understand why my request is listed as an "incident" here. CheckUser is a standard procedure. If VinceB is innocent, CheckUser itself will clear his name. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETankred_25cb.html" title="User:Tankred">Tankred</a> 01:16, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>I have always been open to discussion regarding these sources, and have provided reasons backed by Wikipedia policy why some of the sources are not suitable. The dialogue, sadly, is mostly one-sided.</p>
<p>I also requested a RFC on one of the sources<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Sahaja_Yoga#Comment_sought_from_The_Religious_Movements_Homepage_Project" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Sahaja_Yoga#Comment_sought_from_The_Religious_Movements_Homepage_Project" rel="nofollow">[77]</a>, to which other editors concurred with my view that the source in question was unreliable.</p>
<p>Each of the sources have been scrutinized, studied and discussed by the editors involved, and argument have been provided why to keep or discard these ources<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Sahaja_Yoga" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Sahaja_Yoga" rel="nofollow">[78]</a></p>
<p>I am in no way asserting ownership, and if I am concentrating more heavily on this article at the moment it is because many sources/external links which failed the WP:RL and WP:EL policies were being added, and because, being an "acknowledged" follower of the movement believe that I can add to information missing from the article. I have in fact been working on a large section on beliefs, which User:WillbeBack has commented on it's incompleteness.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Sfacets/Chakras" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Sfacets/Chakras" rel="nofollow">[79]</a></p>
<p>In response to "restoring unsourced defamation about other gurus" if I may direct you to the examples in question you will notice that one of them was reverted because it was uncommented, and the other because it had just been added, and needed time for editors to find sources to prove it, before removing it. I edit many articles, and never to push my POV.</p>
<p>I enjoy contributing to Wikipedia, and one of my favorite guidelines is "Assume good faith". I have been (and still am) busy in real life, and can only ask that User:WillbeBack understand that this is the reason I have been unable to answer his enquiries on the images he refers to above. Yes, 2 of them have incorrect copyright info, I will fix this when I have time (feel free to remove them until such a time, if you feel the necessity)</p>

<dd>Then, please post the diffs that show I am stalking Tajik, because the request is only reasonable IF I am stalking Tajik, and this accusation, as you should know, requires him to provide some evidence. He provided none. He didn't even attempt to provide any.</dd>
<dd>And I suspect you are supporting him simply because I have called you to task for protecting pages you have been edit warring in.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Khoikhoi&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88451181" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Khoikhoi&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88451181" rel="nofollow">[86]</a> And posted a comment about that. You are also personally involved in a lot of the edit wars that Tajik participates in, and because you are not neutral to the issue you should not have responded without evidence for your assertions. Like Tajik, you provided nothing. I am NOT stalking Tajik, cannot imagine anything more boring, and there is no evidence for my stalking Tajik, and never will be. He provided none, <i><b>you</b></i> as an <i>administrator</i> <b>personally involved in the issue</b> came in here and supported Tajik with no evidence of his stalking me and provided none of your own.</dd>
<dd>I am not stalking Tajik. If administrator Khoikhoi thinks it is civil for Tajik to falsely accuse me of stalking, then that's a new definition of civil that I'm not familiar with. If administrator Khoikhoki thinks accusations without proof are fine, let's hold this administrator to acting in the future upon my accusations without any evidence.</dd>
<dd>What the heck, let me make any request without any evidence or anyone else but Tajik ask Khoikhoi without evidence and let's see how far the request goes. I am NOT stalking Tajik.</dd>
<dd>Here are forty or so of my last edits, just show me where I am stalking <a href="../../../t/a/j/User%7ETajik_56da.html" title="User:Tajik">User:Tajik</a>, or stop making false accusation.</dd>
<dd>Administrators making false accusations against editors because of personal prefernces and biases is not appropriate. Isn't there any requirement that administrators at least pretend to be neutral? There should be.</dd>
<dd>Tajik will do anything to own the <a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghanistan.html" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> article from all other editors on Wikipedia, he should not be aided and abetted in this by a biased administrator who also doesn't bother to support baseless accusations. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 21:46, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

So, that is my high ground: there was evidence of Tajik's lack of civility, a comment on his talk page about edit wars, and his comment on mine about my stalking him without any evidence. What exactly is it that Tajik can accuse me of something without any evidence and I don't have the high ground? Why do I have to provide evidence, but Tajik provided none and Khoikhoi provided none, and the existing evidence, Tajik's talk page contradicts what Khoikhoi said? As to Tajik trying to own <a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghanistan.html" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, just look at its talk page, and the fact is, if he is accusing me of stalking him, I think they're the only edits we have in common for our last 500 or so, my half a dozen edits on Afghanistan, and the same number or so on its talk page. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Afghanistan&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Afghanistan&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[132]</a><a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 22:00, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>KP, you yourself are making a lot of baseless accusations about me. A look at your contributions shows that you have a history of reporting Tajik for everything he does. How were you able to gather all those diffs of him if you claim you weren't stalking him? He asked you to stop, and in a manner that wasn't really incivil at all. You're accusing me of being a biased administrator, but if you yourself want to be unbiased, you should try reporting people <i>besides</i> Tajik for personal attacks, i.e. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Afsharid_dynasty&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=90218347" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Afsharid_dynasty&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=90218347" rel="nofollow">[133]</a>. <tt class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">Khoi</a><a href="../../../k/h/o/User_talk%7EKhoikhoi_f6d5.html" title="User talk:Khoikhoi">khoi</a></tt> 22:27, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If Tajik does nothing reportable, I won't be able to report him, but that's not what stalking is, and one doesn't have to stalk Tajik to catch his diffs, simply wait for him to blow up the first time then go to his contributions page--he generally can't stop once he starts.

And I've seldom edited any of the pages he routinely edits, except for copyedits on probably 2 or 3, and that is what Tajik accused me of "following every step" he makes on Wikipedia. This requires evidence--like my editing his edits. I don't, I didn't, I'm not even interested in them. That's what stalking on Wikipedia is, and that's not anything I've done. I've never edited the page Khoikhoi posted, so it's entirely irrelevant, Khoikhoi hasn'et posted any evidence other than a page I've never edited.</dd>

Or stop accusing me. How is it bad faith on my part to ask for evidence when I've been accused of something? Tajik provided NONE. You provided NONE.

<p>Of course <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> is stalking. He is following every single step I make in Wikipedia. All of this started when I opposed his various edits in support of known vandals and sockpuppets (see <a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENisarKand_46f1.html" title="User:NisarKand">User:NisarKand</a>, <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKing_Nisar_3932.html" title="User:King Nisar">User:King Nisar</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPashtun_263a.html" title="User:Pashtun">User:Pashtun</a>, etc). He reported me to admins with refernce to the article <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Turks_24c7.html" title="List of Turks">List of Turks</a>: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard%2FIncidents&amp;diff=90547529&amp;oldid=90546665" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard%2FIncidents&amp;diff=90547529&amp;oldid=90546665" rel="nofollow">[136]</a>.

<dd>No, Tajik is the one stalking, and he knows it--he posted this without basis, Khoikhoi comes in and supports him without basis, a friend of Tajik's comes in and supports it without basis, acting as if he is an administrator, or this is an RfC. Tajik harassed me for editing the <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herat.html" title="Herat">Herat</a> article, when all I did was a copyedit. He falsely accused me of who knows what, demanding that I provide sources for a copyedit<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AHerat&amp;diff=87316440&amp;oldid=87238129" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AHerat&amp;diff=87316440&amp;oldid=87238129" rel="nofollow">[138]</a>, here is the copyedit<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Herat&amp;diff=87176917&amp;oldid=87156801" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Herat&amp;diff=87176917&amp;oldid=87156801" rel="nofollow">[139]</a>, which Tajik also said was my reverting or removing his edits.

<dd>It is a good laugh, though, as the user I was "spying" on was E104421, who, lives in Turkey, and is a naturalist and backpacker. I am a researcher in endemic plants of depauperate mediterranean ecosystems, with a background in geology and mediterranean endemics, and Turkey is home to quite a few interesting ones, and is well studied for members of the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brassicaceae.html" title="Brassicaceae">Brassicaceae</a> on certain <a href="../../../s/o/i/Soil.html" title="Soil">edaphic ecosystems</a>, as are many other countries of the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Mediterranean_Basin_fcfb.html" title="Mediterranean Basin">Mediterranean Basin</a>, and, like other major ecosystems I am researching is home to an important, well-researched, and major Tertiary sedimentary basin, that has very little information about it on Wikipedia. So, in spite of the ego deflation that will have to occur, the user I was spying on is E104421, who also has a sufficient science background that he will be able to, and hopefully will be willing to, provide <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_Domain_4d3d.html" title="Public Domain">Public Domain</a> photographs relevant to articles Wikipedia needs in natural history areas, in particular the natural history of Turkey. Pages I <i>do</i> edit, research, and/or monitor: <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plant.html" title="Plant">plant</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/t/Botany.html" title="Botany">botany</a> pages, mediterannean ecosystems, <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serpentine_soil.html" title="Serpentine soil">serpentine soils</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geology.html" title="Geology">geology</a>, and <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battleship.html" title="Battleship">battleship</a> pages.</dd>

<dd>Nice try, but does not work, because - whatever E104421 may be in real life - 99% of his edits, especially the ones in the last 2 months, have been ONLY about Turkish history and other Turks-related toppics <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;offset=20061008130138&amp;limit=500&amp;target=E104421" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;offset=20061008130138&amp;limit=500&amp;target=E104421" rel="nofollow">[145]</a>. He was even partly blocked, because there was some speculation about him having sockpuppets (such as User:Karcha).</dd>
<dd>So, since you <i>were</i> spying on him, you must have had a reason to do so. E104421 had no edits in plants-related articles. So the question remains: how did you get to know him?!</dd>
<dd>The only logical explanations are that you were either spying on me (= stalking) or that you were contacted by E104421 because he was spying on me and found out that you and me had some disputes going on.</dd>
<dd>In both cases, you are part of a <i>conspiracy</i> against me, and that's against the rules of Wikipedia. Whatever you have in mind: PLEASE STOP IT AND LEAVE ME ALONE!</dd>

And, until you find something on Wikipedia that says I can't edit Tukish articles or have interest in what anyone besides you is doing (as all you do is edit war and Admin shop, no one is as interested in what you are doing as you seem to think I am), then you're simply making this accusation of my activities on Wikipedia because you are stalking me, and no administrator is willing to tackle your horrendous behaviour on Wikipedia, maybe out of fear you'll stalk them, or because you have an administrator like Khoikhoi who is willing to bend all rules to accomodate you.</dd>

You're attacking me because you're still freaked out, it seems, about my copy edit of <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herat.html" title="Herat">Herat</a>, you can't tolerate anyone editing an article you own, and will drive every single editor of that sort out of Wikipedia.</dd>

<dd>It's rather more than disingenuous to ask me to just stop, when I asked this of you, <i><b>and because your biggest complaint about me is that I "vanish" or "disappear when things [get] out of control."</b></i> Of course I do, this is Wikipedia advice, which Wikipedia administrators didn't seem to support me in, and you don't seem to have read. You don't want to be left alone, as you are stalking me to do everything you can to continue to engage me by posting false warnings on my talk page, when you get blocked for your misbehaviour. (See [WP:PAIN] and [WP:Resolving disputes] which I have repeatedly pointed out to you, in particular the remedies, "Second step: Disengage for a while," which, apparently if editors disengage the will be attacked by users like you for doing so, then attacked in addition by administrators like Khoikhoi.) You're obsessed with me. Everything I complain about, you mirror--I ask you to leave me alone, and I back down, and you accuse me of stalking you. I left you alone, you complained that I did and started posting lies about me on my talk page.

<dd>If we are going to make an indef ban I'm not completely convinced be under the death threat criterion. It is not rare among <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charedim.html" title="Charedim">charedim</a> to make comments of the form "if the meshiach arrive then we would _" where _ can range from executions to animal sacrifices to whipping Jews who charge each other interest. Unless we think that the arrival of meshiach is eminent this isn't a threat in the traditional sense. It amounts to almost saying "if God came down and gave me permission to kill these people I'd do it gladly (but would never do so otherwise)" which isn't really a death threat. Still the comment is bad enough that I would think together with Daniel's earlier comments this merits a ban under exhausting community patience. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 22:46, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would disagree with the above. It is, indeed, rare among chareidim to make statements like that to non-Jews, or to secular Jews.

<dd>While I respect your words Joshua, a threat is a threat regardless of the religion. Saying that he would gladly kill someone else is a threat.

<dd>Actually, I think there have been precedents in some jurisdictions that comments like this one aren't treated the same way as conventional death threats. In any event, the real question is whether this type has the same comment as standard death threats. I'm not convinced it does.

<p>It is important in encyclopedias, in decision making and in teaching someone what they did wrong to clearly distinguish between related yet different concepts.

<dd>First off, I would say that looked like a death threat to me. Saying someone deserves death, and volunteering to bring about the death yourself is both racist and wrong. But I can (vaguely) understand if you guys want to have leniency (although the argument "the guy belongs to a certain Jewish sect so death threats are OK doesn't fly with me"). But in view of recent fracas with the {{NotJewish}} template, this has gone from ridiculous to sublime. His "opponent", who apparently has no civility either, was just indef'ed for ridiculous 3RR violation. I would say 2 weeks would at least be appropriate, in view of this awful comment and other nonsense with the template. But, as I said, I don't see how that could be construed as anything other than a bigoted death threat, orthodox Jewish or no. -<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatstuart_7fbf.html" title="User:Patstuart">Patstuart</a><sup><a href="../../../p/a/t/User_talk%7EPatstuart_e8fd.html" title="User talk:Patstuart">(talk)</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Patstuart_a3f0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Patstuart">(contribs)</a></sup> 00:45, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

A look at his contributions reveals as much. Joshua, I know you agree with some of his points, but this is out of totally out of bounds, and I don't see how a simple one-week block is justified, considering past behavior. Only a longer block may get him to consider that disruption, rudeness, and death threats are totally wrong. Statements like <i>Thank G-d the guy is dead and rotting, and if he weren't dead, I would kill him myself, with my own bare hands. I would tie his hands and feet, and beat him until he died. Get it?

<dd>It seems like it was closed a day early.

<li>(edit conflict) Opabinia is correct, I should have noted the perceived conflict of interest in the re-open.

<p>Reverting the close was not proper. There is no rule that non-admins may not close obvious keeps, which this was. This is a case of sour grapes on 152's part. He did not like the way the AFD turned out. The close was good, it was proper, plenty of time was given and it had already been through a DRV that decided to undelete. In fact, he only voted on the AFD to begin with not minutes after a user with a message about it gave him a warning about moving sections on this noticeboard. The bad faith is blatant here. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 01:47, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've closed this again. It probably shouldn't have been closed by a non-admin (things like unanimous keeps or speedy deletes can be), but that doesn't matter now. It's been open long enough, and after being on DRV has had plenty of time to attract attention, so there's nothing to be gained by putting it back on AfD for five more days. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a>&#160;(<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 02:17, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have no problems with it. I handed out a slightly longer than usual "first block" because I strongly felt this was a bad-faith user, so I'd be inclined to agree with you, but I suggest you post this to <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a> or <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> to find out if a wider range of admins agree with you.

<p>Just to provide context, the above was posted to my talk page because I originally blocked the above user for 48 hours for mass vandalism to a variety of random articles. Glen then extended the block to indefinite and let me know. FWIW, I <b>support</b> this block as I really doubt that Mas Ahmad has anything but vandalism in mind. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 14:29, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Let's see - in the space of 14 minutes, the user made about 39 edits - every single one was page vandalism and/or blanking. Straight out on his ass is the right way to go. let's not waste any more time on an obvious "one-handed" poster. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesknight_2ce5.html" title="User:Charlesknight">Charlesknight</a> 14:54, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sure. Don't even bother asking with cases like these; I've indef-blocked editors with less than a dozen edits if they're all vandalism. It's barely even worth the time of leaving an indefblock template on their pages, but it's good manners. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><sup><small><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a></small></sup> 15:43, 4 December 2006 (UTC)
