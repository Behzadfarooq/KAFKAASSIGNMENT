I then went through this page (and the <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Archive2_098f.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Archive2">archives</a>), and added all the things listed here.

<li>Admins not familiar with details can start helping out with the easy ones-- say any listings 10 days or older by an established user (anyone you recognize as probably not a troll). If there has been no challenge to the allegation of copyright violation either below the listing or on the article talk page, and the article has a copyright violation notice, you can go ahead and delete the article. To help further, you then can remove the listings for deleted pages from the WP:CP page. Such fairly straightforward cases make up a large part of the backlog, and if they are being taken care of, those more experienced can devote more time to the more complex ones.

<dd>Ooh, that's convoluted. It depends on wgOnlySysopMayMove which is a config setting that isn't defined or referenced elsewhere and which doesn't do what it claims to do. It in fact prevents "newbies" from moving pages, where newbies are defined as the newest (from account creation time) 1% of users. Not quite as good as by-edits as anyone can just register a new account without using it, which is entirely unnoticable and have it mature until they can vandalise with it. Still, it would be an improvement. --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 01:49, 2005 Feb 4 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, but it might give us a chance to notice him while he's still running up edits. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> suggested limiting page moves to one per minute over on <a href="../../../v/i/p/WP%7EVIP_552d.html" title="WP:VIP">WP:VIP</a>, which deserves thought, but if I were running a vandalbot, this would just get me to register a new user name with each edit to get around it.

<dd>There are situations where a rate limit on page moves would be very inconvienient.

<dd>Also, simple editing vandalism can be easily rolled back en masse by any admin.

<dd>The feature is already there and just set to 0? Cool, then there is no need for implementation, just to turn it on. While a bot could rack up 100 edits, it would be a bit of work, and make page move vandalism more difficult. Also, depending on the bot, vandalism could be spotted before the page move vandalism. I think page move vandalism looses its fun if the vandal has to spend 30 minutes beforehand to rack up 100 edits. Valid page moves can always be requested on the village pump, and since there are thousands of users with more than 100 edits, this should not really be a big burden for the 300 admins. I would start a proposal to turn this on, but I have to go now. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_73_2ea7.html" title="User:Chris 73">Chris 73</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChris_73_0282.html" title="User talk:Chris 73">Talk</a> 23:59, Feb 3, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, I think the discussion is starting to move in the wrong direction - the proposed solutions involving limiting numbers of moves are becoming more and more convoluted and difficult to implement. In my opinion, the only reason page move vandalism is the problem it is is because there is no easy way to revert it - nobody is bothering to write a vandal script that replaces article text with FUCKYOU because they know that that sort of vandalism can be reverted within seconds, but everyone familiar with the system here knows that page moves cause lots of hard work. I'd wager a guess that a rollback function for moves would make the bot attacks pretty much disappear (and the ones that still happened wouldn't be much of a problem anymore). -- <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFerkelparade_da80.html" title="User:Ferkelparade">Ferkelparade</a> <a href="../../../f/e/r/User_talk%7EFerkelparade_2c87.html" title="User talk:Ferkelparade">π</a> 20:18, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(Copied from Wikipedia_talk:Protected_page -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 18:16, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC))</p>
<p>I'm not sure if this is a security problem or not. Yesterday, the <a href="../../../h/u/m/Image%7EHumpback_anglerfish.png_727b.html" title="Image:Humpback anglerfish.png">Image:Humpback anglerfish.png</a> was featured in the <a href="../../../d/i/d/Template%7EDid_you_know_2dd7.html" title="Template:Did you know">Template:Did you know</a> on the Main Page. A local page was created, with some of the copyright info, but the image is actually on the Commons. The local page was eventually protected, but the page on the Commons never was.</p>
<p>Is this a security hole? I assume creating a local page, and protecting it, is sufficient to prevent someone from uploading a local image and thus overriding the version on the Commons (which was my initial concern). But it also looks like a persistent vandal could have just uploaded a new image over the one on the Commons, with the same effect. Would loading a local copy of the image, protecting it here, and then deleting the local copy when the image leaves the Main Page be sufficient?</p>
<p>Since I'm unregistered I have no practical experience with uploading images; I may be mistaken. But given the recent template vandalism and the current lockdown of the Main Page, if it is a problem a solution should be disseminated, at least to the handful of people involved with updating the templates and protecting the images on the front page. In keeping with the security thought obscurity precept, I deliberately didn't ask while it was still in the template; and I posted the question here, rather than on a more high profile page like Main Page talk, or the admin's noticeboard.</p>

<dd>The only solution I can think of is to coordinate <a href="../../../index.html" title="Main Page">Main Page</a> images with Commons administrators. I think asking Commons administrators to protect some images for a day or two is not an unreasonable request, given that en is the largest Wikimedia project. We'll have more Commons images in the future as more images are uploaded there instead of to en. --<a href="../../../s/l/o/User%7ESlowking_Man_5da9.html" title="User:Slowking Man">Slowking Man</a> 02:26, Feb 9, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, it's quite the other way round: local images override Commons images. However, if one creates an Image: page for an image that exists only on Commons (pasting the content from the Commons page is good enough) and then protects that page, it can't be uploaded over locally. This seems the best fix to me, and it's what I've done for <a href="../../../c/o/c/Image%7ECoccorella_atrata.png_2d8b.html" title="Image:Coccorella atrata.png">Image:Coccorella atrata.png</a>, which I presume you were referring to. — <a href="../../../r/d/s/User%7ERdsmith4_389f.html" title="User:Rdsmith4">Dan</a> | <a href="../../../r/d/s/User_talk%7ERdsmith4_959f.html" title="User talk:Rdsmith4">Talk</a> 01:21, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I believe they can be, yes. But there are a number of Commons administrators who are also active en: users, including Dan. As Slowking Man says, if there are enough active Commons admins it shouldn't be too hard to co-ordinate temporary protections; perhaps there could be a "Commons:Requests for image protection", although I have no idea if such a page is even necessary. More pragmatically, there could be a note on <a href="../../../d/i/d/Template_talk%7EDid_you_know_8ba7.html#The_Rules" title="Template talk:Did you know">Template talk:Did you know#The Rules</a> (under Images) to instruct users to do exactly as Dan did; crosspost the Commons image description over to Wikipedia so it can be protected. There could also be a suggestion to contact a Commons admin to protect it. I somewhat regret indirectly causing this trouble, but I suppose it had to be dealt with eventually. -- <a href="../../../h/a/d/User%7EHadal_a4d0.html" title="User:Hadal">Hadal</a> 04:53, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The Commons is a great resource; don't feel guilty for using it.&#160;:) But there seems to be a shortage of people updating the templates already, so coordination sounds like putting a task that's already in too few hands into even fewer. The advantage of uploading a local copy and protecting it is that anyone who can update the template can do it. <a href="../../../6/8/2E/User%7E68.81.231.127.html" title="User:68.81.231.127">68.81.231.127</a> 22:39, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Netoholic (although not necessarily with his choice of words&#160;:). There are lots of pages that don't need to be updated very often, but we still don't keep them protected. Protected pages scare off good edits. Are you absolutely sure the selected anniversaries don't have any typos or mistakes? You'll never find out if they're protected.</dd>

<dd>I admit a total lack of familiarity with how the selected anniversary stuff works (technically), but why can't whoever's in charge of the main page, etc simply check the next day's anniversary thing some hours before it goes live, to make sure it hasn't been vandalized, and then lock it?

<dd>The list was created to have a way of finding those votes. Oftentimes, a long-deleted page will be re-created, and someone will think "wasn't that a VFD?". They check for a sub-page, but find nothing. Moving these out of the template namespace (and deleting all the leftover redirects in MediaWiki namespace as well) is a great idea. It is a huge project though, which is why I made the page in the first place.

I think that mediawiki already has half a mechanism for spell checking, which unfortunately, appears to be currently half disabled. Here's how I use it on my own wiki:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>I wrote a bot that downloads a list of pages and feeds them to the unix <i>spell</i> program, which generates a list of potentially mispelled words.</li>
<li>I then pre-edit that list, removing word fragments and things that are obviously (to me) not mispellings.</li>
<li>I then add this list to the equivalent of <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_common_misspellings_7716.html" title="Wikipedia:List of common misspellings">Wikipedia:List_of_common_misspellings</a></li>
<li>Then I use a browser such as <a href="../../../w/3/m/W3m.html" title="W3m">w3m</a> with editor set to ispell, or similarly firefox with mozex extension and go to the <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Maintenance&amp;subfunction=mispeelings" class="external text" title="http://www.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Maintenance&amp;subfunction=mispeelings" rel="nofollow">spelling maintenance page</a> which appears to be currenly disabled, but you could just as well pick one of the mispelled words and feed it to the search engine. I notice on the word list page they've already linked them that way, so this is easy.</li>
<li>Then you invoke the editor (set to ispell or aspell or whatever) and manually decide on the spelling changes and save!</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>To summarize, I think your idea would be klunky and slow. Using a real spell checker integrated into a web browser I think works much better, the hard part is then just finding pages with lots of mispellings to make it worth it. (Perhaps a bot to generate a sorted list?) Of course, your suggestion would work great for any questionable cases that might actually need discussion. --<a href="../../../s/s/d/User%7ESsd_e9c6.html" title="User:Ssd">ssd</a> 13:43, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's why both AllyUnion and I suggested procecures where the bot would only <i>look</i> for potential mispellings. Where we differ is in how it notifies us changes are needed. I suggest making a list of pages with lots of mispelinlgs, and using standard software such as ispell or aspell to manualyl view teh changes. Ideally, this would be done with some kind of dictionary containnig both american and british spelinlgs, etc. Alternately, the potential mispellings could be listed on the talk page for the article for manual fixing. In neither case would the bot actually respell anything.

<p>Due to the deletion "bug", two pages have been requested to be unprotected in RFPP so they may be changed. It was at the request of the developers that any page that needs to be deleted be protected. Additionally, someone created a template, <a href="../../../p/e/n/Template%7EPending_deletion_490d.html" title="Template:Pending deletion">Template:Pending deletion</a>, to keep track of these articles.

<dd>Does "changed" mean someone wants to write a different article with that name? In that case, I think I'd move the old article to a different name, delete the resulting redirect, and let them start their new page from scratch. Of course, if they just want to <i>edit</i> the "deleted" article, the answer should be no. Basically, what I'm saying is "act as if the page really was deleted".

So what you did (re-upload, and delete the old one) is the only way to move an image.

<p>Sinne I haven't followed this closely, I don't know exactly how the 3RR went from being a half-baked concept to a means of blocking valued users, as seen in the recent hostilities involving 172, Snowspinner, Ed Poor and others.</p>
<p>I think 3RR and blocking are only appropriate where there is a fast-moving revert war, and a <i>brief</i> block provides a cooling-off period. Even so, I would rather see the article protected for a short period and the combatants shunted to the talk pages.</p>
<p>But 3RR in our contentious articles has a serious darkside, especially with this "within 24 hours" nonsense. There are articles in which both sides, acting in good faith, have an honest disagreement over a particular historical issue. Suppose an article is stable for some period of days, and then one person changes a section to give a different perspective, and lets suppose this perspective, honestly held, is POV where the previous wording was a better, more neutral presentation.</p>
<p>OK, I revert, then the writer reverts. After I've reverted the third time, the writer reverts a third time. Result: the new version stands. If I revert again, I'm blocked. This is not right in the circumstances nor is it good for the encyclopedia. I additionally view blocking responsible users in such circumstances as puerile. A better solution would be a lock <i>on the article</i> for a limited time and going to article talk.</p>
<p>I know I haven't followed the discussion on an editorial board for Wikipedia, but I think this is the best and ultimate solution. <b>Used sparingly</b> a handful of articles should be under the jurisdiction of such a board in which <i>portions</i> of articles are forbidden to regular editing once they have been ruled on. If someone edits that portion and <i>anyone objects to the edit</i> the edit reverts, the discussion goes immediately to talk and if agreement can't be reached, the editorial board rules bindingly. Under <i>those</i> circumstances, someone who persists can be blocked.</p>
<p>How to choose such a board? I would think a base requirement is that such members be active writers and editors, not "janitors". I would have some kind of base voting criterion more than the simple "logged-in user" of adminship. I would also want to see some kind of balance on such a board between more liberal/conservative/centrist editors, americentric/eurocentenic, etc., or a board could be a political "Ministry of Truth".</p>
<p>As to the 172 et. al. dispute, I'm not judging who was right in the article in question. I haven't seen it. Often I agree with 172's perpsectives, often I don't, but I believe his convictions are honestly held. I think a 3RR was the wrong remedy. In fact, in most cases I think 3RR blocks are the wrong remedy. -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> | <a href="../../../c/e/c/User_talk%7ECecropia_0e8d.html" title="User talk:Cecropia"><i>explains it all</i> ®</a> 21:03, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The problem with your senario is that you are thinking in a simular way to an edit warrior. In your senario you are in a very solid starting postion since your version really is NPOV. If it is on a major article you don't need to worry someone else will come along soon. If it is in a more minor article just request help from outside (an RFC if all else fails). One on one slugfests are always a bad move. You suggest shorter blocks. This means whoever breaks the rules wins the edit war since they revert 4 times get their version and a block of a few hours. Moving on the community has decided that responciple users don't break the three revert rule. Page protection is bad since it goes against the principles of the wiki has the eternal arguments about the wrong version (remember page protection can be abused) and risks spreading the argument to other articles. If you want to take the heat of an edit war then I suggest first trying the "everyone's gotta sleep sometime" method of conflict resolution (my personal favorite). I should be noted that a board that covers a limited number of articles isn't going to have much effect on the 3RR since the range af articles people feel the need to edit war over appears to be huge.<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 21:54, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The 3RR works great. It allows people to cool off when getting in to revert wars, and it sends an unambigious message that certain editing practices are <i>not</i> acceptable.

<dd>3RR gets you blocked for how long? One day. This means that even if you trick people into violating it (as seems to become a sport among edit warriors), you only own the field for a day, i.e. you don't win the edit war, it's merely slowed down. And that's the purpose of the rule, to slow down the wars, not to end them. We'll always have childish people on WP, why, an unknown percentage of them <i>are</i> children, so we'll always be dealing with childish disputes. What we are aiming at is making life <i>difficult</i> for those with childish approaches, while making life <i>easier</i> for people with a more mature approach and good sense of compromise. We may need <i>other</i> rules, but the 3RR is doing what it's supposed to be doing. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 12:12, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd>I think the problem here is that you're actually contemplating, as a matter of course, that you would get into an edit war. You should be discussing this on the talk page, not doing ping-pong reverts between you and another user. As <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> says, "If the edit really needs reverting that much, somebody else will probably do it—and that will serve the vital purpose of showing that the community at large is in agreement over which of two competing versions is correct."</dd>

<dd>WP:3RR is performing a very useful function even if it only forces revert warriors to recognise that the community regards their behavior as pathological. Indeed arbcom has clarified the original wording somewhat in recent cases, saying:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>The three-revert rule is not an entitlement, but an "electric fence".

It</i> does not <i>grant users an inalienable right to three reverts every 24 hours or endorse reverts as an editing technique.

<dd>Yes, this does seem to be some sort of "cached copy of the history not getting updated properly". I have now seen the same sort of behaviour Lupo mentioned - when the history after a restore isn't what you expect, select one of the other history lengths, and it shows up correct. Making a gratuitous edit brings the history back correctly too. Sounds like it's correct in the master database, but history copies cached in various places aren't getting updated correctly. Doing any one of a number of things causes the caches copies of the history to be flushed, and the master (which is correct) to be looked at. Will definitely have to file a bug report on this (if someone else hasn't done so already). <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 02:31, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Okay, so I'm a new admin as of late yesterday. I got a request from a user I've worked with to undo a page move for <a href="../../../w/2E/a/W.A.C._Bennett_c526.html" title="W.A.C. Bennett">W.A.C. Bennett</a>. The page was moved to a longer, less common name (<a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Andrew_Cecil_Bennett_f91b.html" title="William Andrew Cecil Bennett">William Andrew Cecil Bennett</a>), and the user could not move it back because the shorter name had two items in the edit history. After a little bit of looking around for policies/procedures, it seemed to me that the resolution would be to do a delete on the requested destination and then move from the longer name to the shorter name. The delete worked without incident, but then I guess I tried to do the move a little too soon because I got the usual conflict message. After a few seconds, I was able to do the move, but the edit history doesn't seem to be there from the page's longer name. The longer name's history only shows my move. Did I miss a step?

<p>Whoever organised this did a sloppy job. They're purporting to make policy, in particular item 10 mandates a new definition of simple vandalism, but they're using a 50% bar (ie if a proposal gets more than half of all votes it becomes policy as far as the poll organiser is concerned). The upshot seems to be that there may now be a faction that will be inclined to treat whatever they regard as the "wrong" spelling of a certain city name as <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">simple vandalism</a>, thus exempt from <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>.</p>

<dd>In retrospect I would have changed the wording of the vote #10. My goal was to have reverts that comply with community consensus excempted from the 3RR, and only persistent reverts against community consensus despite multiple warnings may require further action. My goal was not to label this vandalism, as was also expressed by many voters. I am currently working on the voting results, which will reflect this view.

<p>In general, administrators should not second-guess the application by other administrators of rules such as the 3RR. Even if one administrator would have been more lenient than another has been, he should refrain from stepping in and altering the penalty imposed by the administrator who made the decision concerning what penalty to apply -- for example, by shortening a block or lifting it entirely. Otherwise, people will play the administrators off against each other, like kids with parents. No administrator wants to be in the position of being thought of as the one who will "fix tickets" handed out by the others: an administrator who gains a reputation for "fixing tickets" will pretty soon find himself plagued with requests to do so, and will be accused of playing favorites when he fixes some tickets and not others. Other administrators will be reluctant to impose penalties, which involves some conflict and stress, if they know their penalties will be altered or cancelled by other administrators who are more friendly towards the offenders. The whole system will be perceived by non-administrators as corrupt, with penalties determined by "who you know" rather than objective factors. If an administrator imposes a penalty, other administrators should alter that penalty only if it is incorrect under the policies and rules that have been established. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 00:20, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am not arguing that administrators should "close ranks" and not reverse an erroneous decision by a colleague. That would be as bad as "second-guessing" a colleague. I am saying that if an administrator assumes responsibility for a case and imposes a penalty, the only person who should soften or alter that penalty is the administrator who imposed it, UNLESS the penalty oversteps or misinterprets the rules. No administrator should end a block or shorten it (or extend it for that matter) simply because he would have imposed a lighter or heavier penalty than the person who actually determined the penalty. Administrators should respect each other's decisions, and if they can't, then one of the administrators involved is not suited to be an administrator. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 00:45, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I support this whole heartedly. I'd like to suggest that no admin <i>unilaterally</i> undo the block/etc of another admin; before that could ever be done, it should be discussed here, and only if there is noticeable support for so doing (i.e. less than rough consensus, but enough to show that there is real doubt that the correct action was taken) for undoing an enforcement action should it be undone.</dd>
<dd>There's just too much potential for disagreement, e.g. about what constitutes an "edit" as opposed to what constitutes a "revert" (particularly for complex reverts). For the more borderline cases, that is just something that's inherently going to produce lack of agreement (when you pick two admins at random), since we'll never be able to completely codify it. Even worse, for almost any action, you can probably find one admin somewhere who disagrees with it. Hence my suggestion that nobody should unilaterally undertake to undo someone's enforcement action.</dd>
<dd>I think this suggestion has it about right - if something is excessive, or has widespread doubts as to its appropriateness, it can get fixed fairly easily. But we avoid "block wars". There's just too much "block warring" going on, and it's a lot more unseemly than edit warring. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 15:46, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The rules are pretty simple on block wars. If a block is disputed then the block doesn't hold. Recently there has only been one block war and that was due to an admin dissregarding the rules and unblocking themselves. Blocking users is not something to be encouraged. Admins do not own blocks any more than people own articles. Personaly I trust my fellow admins to do the right thing. If they decide I have made a mistake then I trust them to make the right descission. If If see an admin repeatedly taking what I view as the wrong descision I will draw this to wider attention. moving on their is the issue of sleep. Everyone has time away from wikipedia. What if the person wants to appeal about the block while you are asleep or at work (or in my case uni)? They are going to have to apeal to someone else.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In short from my point of view it boils down to three issues. First blocks are unilateral therefore unblocking should be. The second is the matter of trust. Currently there is only one admin who I would not trust to make the correct descission in undoing my blocks. Third who cares? One off unlbocks don;t matter much. If a negative pattern starts to appear it becomes the time to take action<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 16:32, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have only recently become more involved in writing about my local area in Wikipedia. I'm by no means a Wikipedia pro like Admins, but I hope to learn and be there eventually. I have found learning some aspects of Wikipedia to be very difficult. I was crushed today to learn that my IP had been blocked from making changes to articles I have created. This is because I am using as AOL IP and another AOL-user did something to cause an admin to block the IP. So, I decided to create a username, hoping it would allow me to go ahead and edit these articles I wrote. No such luck. Therefore, I would like to suggest that the blocking mechanism be improved, so that if an IP is blocked but someone is using a username, they should not be blocked, especially if the IP is shared for a large group of users. Also, the admin who blocked me doesn't have an e-mail, so I wasn't even able to ask for help in determing why I was blocked. If someone is going to be blocking people, shouldn't they have to have some lines of communication available? I am a new user, so I certainly haven't seen every nook and cranny of Wikipedia, so maybe I'm just ignorant and missing something. If I didn't love reading/editing Wikipedia so much, this experience might have turned me off for good. As it is, I'll probably just try again tomorrow and hope my IP isn't blocked.

<dd>(<i>First bit directed at Lupo</i>) Yes I did read the page. Please don't assume every lowly Wikipedian who comes to humbly petition the administrators' noticeboard is an idiot. The point is that it's supposed to be a bit of introductory text to inform people about Wikipedia. Encouraging its use as a sandbox is not the best idea, particularly when we have a perfectly good sandbox already. People continually deleting the template is all very well in the sandbox, but if we have graffiti of the "fcwrpm,tw59tcpotep0 JOHN IS GAY!!!!11" kind all the time instead of what is meant to be an introduction, this doesn't look too good. Why not just put a link on the intro page directing people to the sandbox where they can edit to their hearts' content? — <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrilobite_212d.html" title="User:Trilobite">Trilobite</a> <a href="../../../t/r/i/User_talk%7ETrilobite_e418.html" title="User talk:Trilobite">(Talk)</a> 13:24, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

(From the block log: <i>06:23, 8 Mar 2005 Ahoerstemeier deleted Image:Autofellatio.jpg</i>). For those of you who don't know, <a href="../../../a/u/t/Image%7EAutofellatio.jpg_1467.html" title="Image:Autofellatio.jpg">Image:Autofellatio.jpg</a> was listed on IfD a while ago and kept, although it was linked from <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autofellatio.html" title="Autofellatio">autofellatio</a> following a number of polls and voluminous discussion.

<p>We have a user going by the name of Earl Turner, making some racist edits. Just so everyone knows, Earl Turner is the protogonist of the <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turner_Diaries_f8e3.html" title="Turner Diaries">Turner Diaries</a>, a piece of white supremacist hate-lit. I'm curious if you guys think that our offensive user name blocking policy covers this. THe name itself is subtle enough that only a tiny, tiny fraction of people would know enough to recognize it for what it is.

<p>I strongly disagree. When we start defining some "politically suggestive" usernames as unacceptable, we open up a whole new arena for trolling and wasteful debating about degrees of offensiveness about political POVs. I would be very narrow about excluding this category-- maybe would only exclude something as offensively extreme as user:killthe___s on the basis of name alone. A name like adolph or osama is just a name, not a demon to be summoned by using it. It actually serves as a potential warning to pay attention to the edits. Don't you think there might be an advantage if our POV warriors were required to wear identifying t-shirts, so to speak, until they broke enough rules? <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 12:01, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree with alteripse that the username by itself is no reason to get seriously upset; if we decide to judge a name as (comparatively) harmless as that as inappropriate, we are indeed moving on a slippery slope and inviting lots of future controversy about what names might be offensive to someone. The user's edits, however, clearly indicate racist tendencies, so he might be worth keeping an eye on regardless of his name -- <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFerkelparade_da80.html" title="User:Ferkelparade">Ferkelparade</a> <a href="../../../f/e/r/User_talk%7EFerkelparade_2c87.html" title="User talk:Ferkelparade">π</a> 13:09, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Note that I said I found the combination of racist edits with this particular user name offensive. Similarly User:Adolph might be fine as a name, but if that user starts deleting sections on the holocaust from articles, then I no longer consider it acceptable. All these things must be judged in a context. <a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFiliocht_c3e2.html" title="User:Filiocht">Filiocht</a> 13:41, Mar 10, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Having had another look at his edit history, it's pretty clear he's a POV pusher without any intentions of working constructively and his misleading edit summaries border on vandalism, but I still think that if any action is taken against him, it should not be based on our "inappropriate usernames" policy. In the context of his edits, of course his username is not innocent, but the context of his edits gives us enough reason to warn (and, if he persists, eventually block) him without invoking that policy -- <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFerkelparade_da80.html" title="User:Ferkelparade">Ferkelparade</a> <a href="../../../f/e/r/User_talk%7EFerkelparade_2c87.html" title="User talk:Ferkelparade">π</a> 15:16, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>In cases where a username is offensive only within the context of its editing behavior, the behavior is probably inappropriate enough that we can address it without worrying about the user name. (Hypothetical User:Adolph would be warned and possibly blocked for vandalism even if his username were something different.) -<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranel_6303.html" title="User:Aranel">Aranel</a> ("<font color="#BA0000"><u>Sarah</u></font>") 15:20, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>agree with Aranel. it the recognition value of the name is practically zero, it is not offensive in the sense that people will be outraged by the username alone. It would be poorly invested time to do detective work on every pov-pusher's username that might conceiveably be a subculture reference to something offensive. These people will get themselves blocked over their <i>edits</i> anyway, and then just pick another username (signing up is cheap...) <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 10:43, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<p>I'd like to ask for any feedback on the process I've outlined on this page. I understand that this is a controversial issue, but I also see that we have no consensus-based way of removing sysop status. Indeed, it seems that the only method that has been done in the past is via the dispute resolution process. Certainly, gaining adminship should be "no big deal", and removing it <i>should be</i>, but it should not be impossible.</p>
<p>I am concerned that as certain admins come to understand that there is no easy way of removing their access, those which have a disposition toward conflict and policy violation do not have a "compensating control". The process I've outlined mirrors very closely the process for gaining adminship, requiring a consensus for support of the request. I've also proposed a petition system (requiring at least ten signers) to prevent gross abuse of the de-adminship process. I welcome comments and suggestions on the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_de-adminship_3349.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for de-adminship">talk page</a>. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 19:07, 2005 Mar 14 (UTC)</p>

Also, the text he pastes in is often in archaic grammar: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Blackheath%2C_London&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=11138924" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Blackheath%2C_London&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=11138924" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Naples&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=11138931" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Naples&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=11138931" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, and often breaks other formatting.

<dd>The PG restrictions on editing are: If it contains the Project Gutenberg header, the body of the text must not have been changed from the version released by PG. If the body of the text is edited, the edited version must not have the PG header. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> 22:08, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah... In this case the user is pasting the text unedited, without the PG header. Also, shouldn't we at least require that they cite the book that the passage came from in the "References" section? Even so, I'm not so much worried with the legal status. I'm more worried because I don't find these edits to the wikipedia to be particularly useful. For the most part they're just an unlinked mess, usually written in somewhat archaic grammar and with strange formatting conventions. Some of his edits contain very unencyclopedic passages on topics only peripherally related to the topic he's editing. I'm not sure if anything has to be done at this point, but it maybe useful to keep an eye on him. --<a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDropDeadGorgias_33d3.html" title="User:DropDeadGorgias">DropDeadGorgias</a> <a href="../../../d/r/o/User_talk%7EDropDeadGorgias_66ce.html" title="User talk:DropDeadGorgias">(talk)</a> 22:42, Mar 14, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>People often confuse copyright concerns and plagiarism concerns. If you paste someone else's work into an article - even if it's public domain - you must cite the work. And unless it's written in concise, explanatory paragraphs it's probably not suitable for Wikipedia.

<p>Hello. User:Gumba gumba was blocked indefinitely, as "all edits vandalism". He had been blocked earlier for 24 hours and came right back. However, he seems to be using a shared IP, so the username should be blocked, but not the underlying IP.</p>
<p>According to <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">Wikipedia:Blocking policy</a>, the thing to do is wait for an "autoblocked because you share an IP" notice to appear at <a href="../../../i/p/b/Special%7EIpblocklist_2536.html" title="Special:Ipblocklist">Special:Ipblocklist</a> and then unblock that. However, I've done that half a dozen times now (see <a href="../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_block_4a41.html" title="Special:Log/block">Special:Log/block</a>, and new autoblock notices keep appearing. Does this work as advertised?</p>
<p>Can someone look into this? Unfortunately I have to step away from the computer soon. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 22:29, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Apparently this user is using a shared proxy IP. Waiting 24 hours is really not an option. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">User:Tony Sidaway</a> and I unblocked about ten IP autoblocks over nearly 45 minutes, but they just kept coming, and finally had to unblock User:Gumba gumba.

<dd>His IP gets auto-blocked for 24 hours every time he logs in, so blocking him and then unblocking the auto-block works, unless he keeps trying to edit under User:Gumba gumba, as each time he does that the IP gets auto-blocked again. --<a href="../../../w/e/y/User%7EWeyes_aab8.html" title="User:Weyes">Weyes</a> 23:12, 2005 Mar 24 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So a vandal user on an ISP that uses shared proxy IPs <b>can carry out a <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denial_of_service.html" title="Denial of service">denial of service</a> attack</b> against fellow Wikipedia users on that same ISP, just by repeatedly trying to edit under their own username?

<dd>It was there at day one, but at a certain point auto-blocking was introduced, and getting that up and running was deemed more important than making it optional. Ask for someone to hack up a fix at wikitech-l, and in the meantime advise those who are affected to disable the proxy in their browser settings, or, if it's a transparent proxy and cannot be disabled, to use one of the many available public proxies. --<a href="../../../w/e/y/User%7EWeyes_aab8.html" title="User:Weyes">Weyes</a> 00:34, 2005 Mar 25 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I find myself puzzled by an apparent lack on consistency on what is considered a "revert" according to policy pages and what is considered a "revert" here. Comments here such as "If you want to present evidence for a 3RR you should give the diffs which show that the violating user has not actually added anything in", "Two real reverts, one complex revert", "the 3rd suggested revert is just about "complex" enough to get away with it" -- perhaps I'm not seeing something, but I thought <a href="../../../r/e/v/Wikipedia%7ERevert_d321.html" title="Wikipedia:Revert">Wikipedia:Revert</a> was fairly clear on what constitutes a revert. Neither that page nor <a href="../../../t/h/r/Wikipedia%7EThree-revert_rule_1a38.html" title="Wikipedia:Three-revert rule">Wikipedia:Three-revert rule</a> contain any reference that I can find to a distinction between simple/real/complex edits for purposes of the three-revert rule. I'm a little confused therefore that some administrators are apparently regarding "adding anything in" as a way to accomplish three reverts without being blocked for it; if anything, making an exception for "complex" reverts seems even more damaging, since it would encourage bad actors to make "red herring" changes of no actual value. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 19:02, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ok welcome to the fun world of the 3RR. It seems simple. This is the problem it is very easy to game. So we come to the issue about what to do about people gaming the rule. The current consensus amounst admins is to treat cases where the person has been gameing the rule to avoid triggering it. So how do we decide if someone is gameing the rule? My personal standards is that it must be clear and for preference the user has a history of this type of activity. The term complex revert refers to a revert that is aimed at gameing the system. Repeated false 3RR claims is a bad idea since it doesn't look good if an RFC is field about you<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 00:55, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"Complex reverts" happen when an editor doesn't simply revert to a previous version, but also makes a number of simultaneous other changes in order to restore his preferred version, while claiming that it is not a revert. As has been pointed out by a number of admins, had the editor simply reverted, then added the other changes, it would have clearly been a revert, but the additional changes mask this. "Red herring" changes are an example of another way people attempt to get around the 3RR. Complex reverts are treated as any other revert, though the ingenuity of editors in gaming the system means it's not always completely clear when someone is doing this. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 02:03, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well, the problem I'm having, then, is that you say complex reverts are treated as any other revert, while some of the administrator comments that I quoted above seem to be treating them differently. What does "If you want to present evidence for a 3RR you should give the diffs which show that the violating user has not actually added anything in" mean, if not "show the diffs for a simple revert, not a complex one"? -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 02:26, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>they are only treated the same if the user is gameing the system. There is some inconstancy on how this is decided.

<dd>It seems to me that user TDC is a serial gamer, and he freely acknowledges it. After I listed him here last night, he wrote under the listing: <i>Nice way to try and trap me with a lefty pile on, too bad I am too smart for your tomfoolery.TDC 21:45, Apr 18, 2005 (UTC)</i> and on my talk page, under the heading "3RR": <i>Awww, someone failed to entrap me. Nice try and what'n, but try harder next time, I am ,after all, a fucking pro at this by now. Ciao. TDC 21:50, Apr 18, 2005 (UTC)</i>. After a fifth revert, it was obvious, at least to Geni, what he was up to, and he was given another 24-hour block, the fourth by my count in a month. For the most part, I don't feel he acts in good faith, since he doesn't really engage other users on article Talk pages while reverting.

<dd>It's really a pity, because TDC knows quite a bit, and has a lot to contribute, but he seems more interested in slanting articles toward a particular POV than in building good articles, and he uses process entirely as a weapon rather than as a matter of facilitation. I have literally never seen him make an edit that wasn't POV-pushing, and I intersect with him on at least a dozen articles, probably two dozen. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 05:38, Apr 20, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

So then my next question is: suppose an administrator blocks someone indefinitely, and I then block the same person for 24 hours (SlimVirgin and I blocked the same person during the same minute). I check the log and see that she was first—how do we restore the indefinite block?
