<p>I'm sorry, but to me as an American this is just bizarre. Of course our states don't change boundaries (except rarely), but except for minor annexations/successions, out county boundaries don't either. Our voting districts do on various schedules, perhaps this is why you must do this so often? As an aid to foreigners like me, could someone put a general explanation of why this is needed at the top of the article, before the wonderfully well researched but rather dry "Under the Baldwin government, boundaries in counties to the north of Newcastle where adjusted three rods to the north and east just to confound visitors from the Continent and provide challenge to the Ordnance Survey" bits?

<dd>It <i>is</i> bizarre. My personal explanation is that the British government has always been deeply unhappy about the 'unfortunate necessity' of delegating power downwards, and thus messes with local governmental boundaries on a regular basis to keep things disorganised. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorven_1e3d.html" title="User:Morven">—Morven</a> 07:58, 20 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was confused reading the Shire county paragraph. Berkshire is included in the list of Shire counties, but then the use of the term 'Shire counties' is to exclude Berkshire.

<p>Well as a German I'm very confused about the English administration system with all its counties, caeremonial stuff and god knows what else. I always thought that German administration history is confusing, especially since Germany's Borderlines kept changing through the centuries, (well, especially in the 20th)...but these changements are nothing compared with the British administration changes. Counties appear, vanish again or ar divided up...Foreigners really get the impression that the English/UK governments don't have anything else to do than drawing lines on maps.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Agreed, it is exceptionally confusing and there is so much mis-information around even most British people can't figure it out; so I have little hope that anyone else could. Hopefully Wikipedia will explain all the different types of county in a non-biased way, but this does require authors who favour one system over the other to compromise their positions somewhat&#160;:) <a href="../../../o/w/a/User%7EOwain_2b8c.html" title="User:Owain">Owain</a> 09:49, 9 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just to say reading this 1) British law and history is messy, and cornwall is a case point. 2) people who are not experts on cornish history/ status beware of allowing the modern view of cornwall to confuse you, it was widely considered seperate from england at least until tudor times, even by the english administration. The decline of this as a popular view (i think) came with the decline of the obvious symbol of the language. And yes there has been a continuous (variable size) portion of the population who consider it not part of england.</p>
<p>However... I think its fairly clear it is an <i>administative</i> county at present and we don't want this article becoming a replica of the constitutional status of cornwall one. If possible I think complications should be referred to as briefly as possible and then refered to another article. <a href="../../../1/3/1/User%7E131.111.8.104.html" title="User:131.111.8.104">131.111.8.104</a></p>

<p>Is not and never has been a shire county that is why i have removed it from the list of shire counties. If you wish to return it then you will have to provide evidence of it being historically described as a shire or administered as a shire (of Wessex).</p>
<p><i>Whence county was gradually adopted in English ( scarcely before the 15th century ) as an alternative name for the shire, and in due course applied to similar divisions made in Wales and in Ireland, as well as the shires of Scotland, and also extended to those separate parts of the realm which never were shires, as The Duchy of Cornwall, Orkney and Shetland.</i></p>

<dd>I think you misunderstand the meaning of the list. Cornwall is included because of its style of local government (i.e a county council and districts), not because of any historical reasons. <a href="../../../g/-/m/User%7EG-Man_797a.html" title="User:G-Man">G-Man</a> 19:26, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why use a silly, inaccurate lable like 'shire county', then, particularly as the Oxford English Dictionary, <i>the</i> authority on the correct use of language (the adherence to which goes without saying in an encyclopaedia), disagrees with it? Using the term <i>administrative county</i> to describe two-tier systems and <i>unitary aithority</i> to describe everything else is far more sensible. All the remaining two-tier administrations are basically modified versions of the <i>administrative counties</i> created in 1888, so the term is accurate and has legislative precedents. Furthermore, the legislation also uses the term <i>unitary authority</i> to refer to single-tier administrative entities. The fact that it uses the word "county" to refer to both and more, willy-nilly is neither here nor there, because it's imprecise and ambiguous. "Counties in the context of this bill" has meant all sorts of completely different things in various pieces of legistlation; 'county' is not an 'official' term; just a handy descriptor which, in legislation, has no single meaning. <a href="../../../8/0/2E/User%7E80.255.html" title="User:80.255">80.255</a> 23:01, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It is not a term I have invented, it seems to be a common term used for counties with a two-tier system of government, as opposed to single-tier counties like <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herefordshire.html" title="Herefordshire">Herefordshire</a> and <a href="../../../r/u/t/Rutland.html" title="Rutland">Rutland</a>, or counties without county councils like <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berkshire.html" title="Berkshire">Berkshire</a> or the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metropolitan_county.html" title="Metropolitan county">metropolitan counties</a>. Also where exactly does <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_London_d0dd.html" title="Greater London">Greater London</a> fit into that definition, the London boroughs are not proper unitary authorities, and the Greater London Authority is not a proper county council. <a href="../../../g/-/m/User%7EG-Man_797a.html" title="User:G-Man">G-Man</a> 20:14, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> maybe you could contribute to the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitutional_status_of_Cornwall_8779.html" title="Constitutional status of Cornwall">Constitutional status of Cornwall</a> article as well.</p>

<p>Are you really trying to contend that there was <i>anybody</i> in 1888 who considered Cornwall not to be an English county? 1911 Britannica calls it "the south-westernmost county of England." It mentions none of these novel constitutional theories respecting the Duchy, either. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 02:12, 10 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Administrative Counties and their divisions were abolished in 1974 and replaced by Metropolitan and Non-Metropolitan Counties.

<dd>Calling something like the <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_of_Milton_Keynes_fd09.html" title="County of Milton Keynes">County of Milton Keynes</a> a post-1974 county is confusing because it couldn't (and didn't) legally exist until 1997. But the main source of ambiguity by dropping the word 'administrative' would be by confusion with other types of county that also existed 'post-1974'. The ceremonial and traditional counties exist 'post-1974', so they are all types of 'post-1974 county'.
