<dd>First, may I say, please don't troll. El_C is a responsible admin and there is no evidence of vandalism, therefore your misusing the warning templates. 216.78.95.229 23:13, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There is no unqualified right to hand out warnings at will. Many people consider removing warnings inappropriate, but not in all circumstances. AFAICT, this was an ongoing dispute about the contents of your userpage, and there was existing discussion about it here on AN/I (which seems now to have disappeared?) in which several administrators were already involved. Given these circumstances, the appropriate course of action would have been to engage in the discussion here, or initiate the <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">dispute resolution</a> process, not issuing a warning. Labelling someone a vandal is not helpful, and will likely antagonise anyone who would otherwise be sympathetic towards you. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 00:43, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Attempting to dig up dirt on me (not the subject of complaint) is not going to distract from the fact an Administrator bypassed all procedure and deleted a warning tag, completely against the rules (above). This Admin was blanking my userpage and I was not informed of this incident board until later by an entirely different user. Again, if Admin disagrees he is vandalizing then there is a procedure to remove the tag which does not involve deleting it himself 17 minutes later. Don't attack me because HE broke the rule which is very explicit above. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarastro777_95c7.html" title="User:Sarastro777">Sarastro777</a> 04:50, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is not an isolated incident. El-C have done this to me as well (removal of my attempts to resolve disputes with her). She has hard time dealing with critism in a comunicative way.

<dd>The 'context' is that Sarastro777 is irate that his 'manifesto' was removed from his userpage, and is now working at a block for disruption and trolling. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 19:28, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agreed. This guy is a master of double standards. In that 'manifesto' he blatantly implies that I am an Israeli government agent, but doesn't say it outright, obviously in a weak effort to avoid being blocked for personal attacks. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchrodingers_Mongoose_7c1d.html" title="User:Schrodingers Mongoose">Schrodingers Mongoose</a> 02:36, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The only part on my userpage that mentioned 'rogue admins' was not added by me, but by OiBoy. I did document several very insulting and inappropriate personal attacks such as the one above made by you. Obviously the people catalogued were not proud of their behavior or the page would not have been censored. Quoting two news sources and excerpting from logs gets twisted into a "manifesto" and a "conspiracy theory." Rather than address the vandalism, which is the subject of the notice, opponents smear me personally to distract from the real complaint. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarastro777_95c7.html" title="User:Sarastro777">Sarastro777</a> 20:47, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>After advice from other admins, Azskeptic has already removed that threat, and rightly so, making threats such as this sets a poor example for other users. However I will not take any further action; Azskeptic was not acting out of malice, but (over)reacting to the most despicable trolling that I have ever encountered. Any rational user would forgive Azskeptic for this transgression. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 01:01, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's not actually a <i>threat</i> you know. He's jocular, although angry, and saying that the fellow needed psychiatric help. That's help, not incarceration.

<dd>It looks like <a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpike_29ff.html" title="User:Spike">Spike</a> has been banned, and quite properly so. This person has shown a sick mentality, and I understand the extreme provocation; I just don't think we should ever be too quick to dismiss statements of intention to interfere with someone's personal life as being mere jokes. There have been too many cases where it has actually happened. In the circumstances, I'm not saying any action should be taken against Azskeptic, who obviously realised quite quickly that s/he'd done the wrong thing - just making a general observation to my wise colleagues. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 07:43, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Regardless of the actions of Spike I see no excuse for this behaviour. There is never an excuse for threatening someone off wikipedia regardless of what they've done. You stop talking and report it on the proper pages if you can't remain civil and within the policies. I don't know the history but the IP has indicated this has happened before, and I don't see any blocks on this person. That is something that seems highly inappropriate about this situation.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 23:30, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why should it be closed? Crossmr brings up some excellent points. Regardless of the situation, what this user did was not something that can be swept under the proverbial rug. Doing nothing sends the message that this kind of behavior on Wikipedia is okay in certain situations. Is this the message that wikipedia wants people to get about how to interact here?

<dd>&#160;: I'd say let the user keep it. The edits have been harmless and/or helpful, many people have various political statements on their user pages, as long as the user continues to make useful edits we shouldn't be too worried. I'm more concerned that the user initially claimed it was a concidence and then acknowledged that it was deliberate. Lying and taking up our time as a result is disruptive and will inevitable make further work with the user difficult.

<p>POV edits notwithstanding, PEAR has a pattern of disruptive edits.

He later altered a welcome message on a user's talk page, changing it slightly and removing the original editor's signature and adding his/her own. — <a href="../../../e/r/c/User%7EERcheck_559a.html" title="User:ERcheck">ERcheck</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/c/User_talk%7EERcheck_91c5.html" title="User talk:ERcheck">talk</a>) 22:55, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Regularly, ads icons are inserted in front of external links, that make it look like Wikipedia treats them special, promoting or endorsing those sites. This gets worse now with the templates used for external links to IMDb, MusicBrainz, etc.</p>

<p>We really could use a specific, explicit point of policy against this (and a direct WP:ICONAD or WP:SPAMICON or something), that could be immediately cited in the edit summary for removing or reverting this spam without long discussions with each "new user" doing the spamming for those sites. We could also mention it in bold as a NoInclude warning in the related templates, so as to remove plausible denial to future offenders.</p>

<dd>We should get rid of these even if the MusicBrainz project wants to keep them. We would not insert Apple logos all over Wikipedia even if there was an Itunes project that wanted to keep them.

<dd>Respectfully, Dab, we priviledge the good ones by inclusion or by classification within the article. The question raised here is, I think, wider than a particular article, as it is asking for policy on the use of graphical elements with links. In the absence of policy we do what? That seems to be the crux of it. My version would be "in the absence of policy, we make an article look like all the others and do not use graphical elements in links, whether the links are good or bad." We can, in text body, say, "See Linktext for more information," or, in the links, "Linksite: An excellent review of the subject," but I would suggest that inserting graphical elements is a bad idea. It is a bad idea for a variety of reasons, but the chief one is the one the questioner brought up: it makes the link special on a universal basis and without explanation. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:13, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>With the caveat that this is indeed the wrong place for this, I'd be against any sort of icon propogation in links. It's decoration (which is avowedly against fair use, as we all now know), and even if it's a free-use image, it's tacky and prejudicial. -- <i><a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae</a>'<a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">blis</a></i> 15:00, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I'm not aware of any of those templates (e.g. <a href="../../../i/m/d/Template%7EImdb_b0cc.html" title="Template:Imdb">Template:Imdb</a>) including icons. This spewing of Musicbrainz icons might be an example of BEBOLD but should be reverted as BRD. They are a departure from existing practice that's existed for a good reason. There's nothing wrong with a VPP policy discussion but the initial state of that discussion should be with the icons gone, not with them presented as a fait accompli to possibly be reversed. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 15:17, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't think we should be putting icons in front of links. They're just reference external links, they should be treated the same as any other. Images should really only be used in an article as necessary, not gratuitously for decoration. Remember, we are making an encyclopedia that is to be as freely and widely redistributable as possible. The excess images might get in the way of that. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><span style="color:#ff66ff;"><b>Cyde Weys</b></span></a> 15:16, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's the insidious thing, the rationale for these icons is that Musicbrainz has made the icon itself GFDL.

<p>Excellent summary, <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">User:Geogre</a> @ 12:13, 14 August 2006 (UTC). Sorry if I wasn't very clear about two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have nothing against MusicBrainz, or against external links to MusicBrainz, or against templates for external links to MusicBrainz (and IMDb, etc.).</li>
<li>I am only very concerned about the Pandora box of those little spam icons that keep getting added to external links, and thus make some sites look special and endorsed. And the templates just make it easier to spam (the spam icon on the MusicBrainz template stayed for 10 days until I reverted it, and is already on display on 400+ articles).</li>
</ul>
<p>Also:</p>
<ul>
<li>To answer <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">User:Phr</a>, it's not a matter of BEBOLD (because of the persistent additions after some debates), but the lack of an explicit point of policy against it: those icons keep getting added or sneaked in -- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:MusicBrainz_album&amp;diff=69493239&amp;oldid=69470674" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:MusicBrainz_album&amp;diff=69493239&amp;oldid=69470674" rel="nofollow">today again it was sneaked in</a> for the 3rd or 4th time by CyberSkull who just sneaks it in every time he works on the template, and just shrugs that MusicBrainz is nonprofit when called on his sneaking it again.</li>
<li>Besides, after all those putting back the spamicon, isn't there ground for a <a href="../../../c/h/e/Wikipedia%7ECheckuser_1b24.html" title="Wikipedia:Checkuser">Wikipedia:Checkuser</a> of the false newuser User:Preacher Bob against <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberSkull_302c.html" title="User:CyberSkull">User:CyberSkull</a> (sneaked it 3 or 4 times) and <a href="../../../c/p/a/User%7ECparker_63ee.html" title="User:Cparker">User:Cparker</a> (asked for it on the talk page)?</li>
</ul>
<p>Last but not least, <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">User:Dbachmann</a> is right about my posting here, of course: all my apologies for forgetting to mention here that this message was actually crossposted for</p>

Just becuase someone decided that creating a sockpuppet tag with an autoblock feature was 'disruptive' doesn't mean that I'm a sockpuppet of anyone, and I wasn't removing sockpuppet tags, I was replacing them with the now deleted template. I got tired of getting hit with collateral damage from YaR GnitS so I created a template, someone didn't like the template, so block, and delete, nothing about that is sockish. If you care to do a checkuser you'll see I wasn't even logged in from an AOL proxy range, rather from a 172, which is not the least bit anonymous. So, if you wouldn't mind....--172.148.239.154 21:50, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

Perhaps he does not understand the full impact of <b>community consensus</b>, especially when it applies to controversial subjects.

<dd>I've had similar problems, so I can endorse this (minus the incivility). Cyde has spent alot of time deleting templates without discussion, without a TfD, and with no better reasons that unclosed polls such as GUS. When questioned, Cyde barely says two words. Since then, a template I use for a WikiProject has been moved to another namespace. This leaves me with the notion that it was done so an admin can get his/her way, and be done with it. <a href="../../../s/y/n/User%7ESynergeticMaggot_5ec3.html" title="User:SynergeticMaggot">SynergeticMaggot</a> 14:55, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I don't like templates very often. I don't like userboxes at all. I don't like tags, except procedural ones. I don't even like categories all that much. All of that, and yet I've been surprised and unhappy to see the way some people have been speedy deleting these things without using existing structures. Use the process, Luke. Use the process. When we don't use the policy, we establish a two tier site, where admins do what they like, and regular users are at their mercy. That's not our structure, it has not been our structure, and it should not become our structure, lest we empower all the administrator-paranoiacs. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 15:21, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>It's easy to say, very hard to do in practice. You want me to file 40 new TFDs <i>everyday</i>?! It doesn't make sense that anyone can create this stuff en masse, but then we have to go through the whole rigamarole of <i>process</i> just to get rid of them when they shouldn't have been created in templatespace in the first place. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><span style="color:#ff66ff;"><b>Cyde Weys</b></span></a> 15:23, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I understand, and I'm no more enchanted with these things than you are, but, pending an injunction or something clear about what they can and cannot be, we really don't have much <i>choice</i> in the matter. Whenever I've gone to a longtime problem user's page, it has been lit up like a pachinko board with boxes, and having more than one "joke" box stops being funny and crosses into juvenalia, but we don't have the bones yet for doing anything about it. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 19:05, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I agree. Where is the process? A large portion deleted by Cyde did not fall under the speedy criteria. Cyde says it goes against the <i>spirit</i> of GUS. I dont seem to see this under CSD either. This appears more like an admin's opinion rather than policy.</dd>
<dd>Cyde: Maybe if you took your time and didnt rush into things, they would end up so complicated? Whats done is done I suppose? I'm asking for them to be undeleted as well. If you feel so strongly that so many templates need to be deleted, maybe you should request for a speedy be added to CSD, or some other more valid reason to one of the policies. Instead of what appears to be abuse of adminship. <a href="../../../s/y/n/User%7ESynergeticMaggot_5ec3.html" title="User:SynergeticMaggot">SynergeticMaggot</a> 15:28, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Abuse of adminship? <i>Sigh</i>. If you want these things preserved, just userfy them. It's that simple. That's really all there is to it.

<dd>What else should I call it? You have gone against a poll, which is not closed, and has current consensus to remain in template namespace.

<dd>The difference between the letter and the spirit of <a href="../../../g/u/s/WP%7EGUS_633c.html" title="WP:GUS">WP:GUS</a> is probably worth remembering, as is <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a>, since I would suggest that this also applies to editors venturing into a new area. Obviously, informing people of what's happening via leaving them a message in their talk page would prevent so much hassle - with a polite enough notice, people would probably appologise and move it themselves.

<dd>Additional - surely Cydebot could be made to automate the entire process of notifying authors, changing templates on userpages and moving the userbox? Since then their pages will be without red text, most people would be non-the-wiser, and the author would understand why.

<dd>No, of course not. I am, however, suggesting a compromise.

<p>This is all very, very simple, and I'm really sick of everyone on both sides bickering over userboxes to no end. 1) <a href="../../../g/u/s/WP%7EGUS_633c.html" title="WP:GUS">WP:GUS</a> does not justify the deletion of anything except resulting redirects. 2) The <b>deletion</b> of userboxes in templatespace that are not divisive and inflammatory is not justified without a TfD. 3) Nonetheless, WikiProject affiliation userboxes make a hell of a lot more sense in project space than in templatespace. So the solution is very simple: Stop creating the userboxes in templatespace, and, Cyde, when you come across such a userbox in template space, use the nifty little move tab to put it in project space and then delete the resulting redirect. Then we can stop having these annoying and pointless discussions about absofuckinglutely nothing and get on with work that actually benefits the encyclopedia. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 20:32, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry, I'm not certain if this is the correct procedure for this kind of thing, but here goes. User:Webville appears to be here solely to add links to <a href="http://www.isurvived.org" class="external text" title="http://www.isurvived.org" rel="nofollow">isurvived.org</a>, and add material to articles reflecting the site's viewpoint. This site, from what I can tell, represents a minority viewpoint, a claim made by User:130.39.232.221, who provided <a href="http://www.newhousenews.com/archive/tilove072006.html" class="external text" title="http://www.newhousenews.com/archive/tilove072006.html" rel="nofollow">this link</a>. Some of his contributions seem to confirm this, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hiram_Bingham_III&amp;diff=65696446&amp;oldid=65590153" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hiram_Bingham_III&amp;diff=65696446&amp;oldid=65590153" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> to <a href="../../../h/i/r/Hiram_Bingham_III_1074.html" title="Hiram Bingham III">Hiram Bingham III</a>, which claims he is a "bigot and racist of the first order" based on one letter he wrote, and goes on to call his son <a href="../../../h/i/r/Hiram_Bingham_IV_b043.html" title="Hiram Bingham IV">Hiram Bingham IV</a> - a hero of the Holocaust, who, according to his Wikipedia article, helped 2500 Jews escape the Nazis - "a hater of Jews and a Holocaust denier." He has persistently made POV edits to <a href="../../../h/i/r/Hiram_Bingham_IV_b043.html" title="Hiram Bingham IV">Hiram Bingham IV</a> (such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hiram_Bingham_IV&amp;diff=62574804&amp;oldid=59742138" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hiram_Bingham_IV&amp;diff=62574804&amp;oldid=59742138" rel="nofollow">this</a>), which made both the POV statement that he was "no hero," which is not the prevailing viewpoint, and the statement that he "was not a rescuer of Jews by and stretch," which contradicted material already in the article, without reference. On <a href="../../../h/i/r/Talk%7EHiram_Bingham_IV_fe13.html" title="Talk:Hiram Bingham IV">that article's talk page</a>, he paid little attention to my explanation of the problem with his edits and made some borderline personal attacks. He also removed Bingham from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_who_assisted_Jews_during_the_Holocaust_c2e4.html" title="List of people who assisted Jews during the Holocaust">List of people who assisted Jews during the Holocaust</a> without explanation. He has also been warned by <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">User:Dahn</a> for making vanadalous deletions at <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Jews_in_Romania_6aa6.html" title="History of the Jews in Romania">History of the Jews in Romania</a>, and appears to be a single-purpose account with the sole purpose of advancing the viewpoint of isurvived.org. I am not sure what the procedure is in such incidents, and I admit I am not personally familiar with this site - it could be mainstream and legitimate, but many indications point otherwise - but I think at the very least his contributions need to be closely watched and scrutinized. -<a href="../../../e/l/m/User%7EElmer_Clark_37e1.html" title="User:Elmer Clark">Elmer Clark</a> 23:33, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think the point Uncle G was trying to make was that you cannot delete an article if you have merged any content from it. It must remain as a redirect to the article the content was merged to in order to preserve attribution, even if it was a POV fork (I have no idea). Pointing you to the policy was his way of saying this, in my opinion. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 07:23, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Just to be pedantic, it <i>is</i> possible to take information from a deleted article and put it into another one. GFDL doesn't protect facts or sources. So if someone takes (for instance) a single paragraph, goes and looks up the source, and types it into a new article in their own words we <b>can</b> delete the source article. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="black">brenneman</font></a> <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" rel="nofollow"><font color="black" title="Admin actions"><sup><b>{L}</b></sup></font></a></span> 07:32, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Just to be correct&#160;;-), nothing was said about putting things in your own words and I said "merge" not using information (as opposed to content) that is in one article in another article. In that case it would not be a merge, anyway. It would be using the article as an example or template to write another article or something else besides a merge. I do not know about legal requirements, but it does seem dishonest (claiming you (generic you) wrote it) and like stealing (denying recognition to the authors) not to give credit to the authors of the original content. They found all of the sources, identified the relevant information and presented it in an intelligible and possibly persuasive manner, depending on the type of content. All you are doing is reverse engineering it. It would be even worse if you are rewriting their words and crediting their sources instead of them. I had a tenured English professor who would insist on it being disclosed if even you just read/watched a work and did not use it as a reference. This would be a much greater usage of a work, so I think it should be noted. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 10:31, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

I would not be the least bit surprised if Tyler and Jason were the best of friends, and Tyler, who I have reason to believe is aware of his article here, maybe even asked Jason to post the links here.

<p>Is it possible that we can please have the sussex downs college page protected, or at the least semi protected as the ammount of criticism that has been posted by vindictive staff members is not representative of the positive reputation of the college. As a former student and now staff member I and the majority of my collegues feel that the vandalism is damaging both to the reputation of the college and the mentality of present students. The vandalism has been posted on several occasions by whom we believe to be one staff member under different alias's so this will prove to be an ongoing problem if not solved.</p>
<p>This is what we would like the page to read “<a href="../../../s/u/s/Sussex_Downs_College_4ea8.html" title="Sussex Downs College">Sussex Downs College</a> is a large college in the South East of England. It has campuses in Eastbourne, Lewes and Newhaven. It was formed from the merger of three smaller colleges in the region - Lewes Sixth Form College, Eastbourne Vocational College and Park Sixth Form College. Although there was primarily some speculation over a successful merger Sussex Downs College has since proved itself of exceptional standard, achieving CoVE status (Certificate of Vocational Excellence) an award that very few other colleges have managed to attain. Offering 16-19, Adult, and International or Higher Education courses the range attracts people from all walks of life. Although functioning as one college the ethos of the individual campuses remains the same giving the students an individual choice as to how they learn, yet the security of a vastly equipped support network. Set in the heart of the South Downs, Sussex Downs College provides an inspiring and relaxed environment in which to study”</p>

<p>Hello, Sara. Protection of an article is a last resort and articles are protected for vandalism rather than criticism, although inserting unsourced criticism over and over could be vandalism. The only edits I found that had anything negative to say were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sussex_Downs_College&amp;diff=44874274&amp;oldid=34885778" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sussex_Downs_College&amp;diff=44874274&amp;oldid=34885778" rel="nofollow">this</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sussex_Downs_College&amp;diff=69095397&amp;oldid=66353119" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sussex_Downs_College&amp;diff=69095397&amp;oldid=66353119" rel="nofollow">this</a>. The article was started in December 2005 and has only had two edits that inserted criticism that was not to the point where it would be called vandalism, so the article does not meet the standards we have for protection. I suggest removing negative comments if they are unsourced. Of course, if negative information is accurate, sourced and stated in a neutral manner, it should stay. It is expected that there will be some negative information about any institution. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 10:55, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I appreciate your intentions, and I fully understand your logic in wanting to make the changes. But the problem is that you are failing to acknowledge the logic of those opposing you. You are automatically assuming that those who disagree with you are vandalising, or disrupting Wikipedia. This is not good, particularly when they have valid concerns. You are the one who changed the template without discussion, so it's unfair to play that card! You need to be at least acknowledging the validity of those opposing you are saying, and not automatically dismissing them. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_JPS_fb9e.html" title="User:The JPS"><font color="purple">The <b>JP</b>S</font></a><sup><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_JPS_6a61.html" title="User talk:The JPS"><b><font color="purple"><b>talk</b> to me</font></b></a></sup> 12:43, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I do ackknowledge them, but it needs to be there until at least the discussion is over as it is being used in litteraly HUNDREDS of articles. I've even volunteerd to remove all instances my self after the discussion is over if its decided they should be gone. Also about teh discussion part.. i was unaware i had to ask permission, but if you notice Ed [the one who warned me i had to ask and said my change was major] went and made a real major change 5 minutes later (bolding text, recoding and aligning to left -- which also happend to break the ifbx) he did not ackknowledge this as major at all and it took him time to fix it, the fact that he thinks he does not him self have to ask is bias. <font face="Tahoma" size="1"><small><b><font color="#000000">Matthew Fenton</font></b> (Talk | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MatthewFenton_0db4.html" title="Special:Contributions/MatthewFenton">Contribs</a>)</small></font> 12:47, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is a particular element of this I find quite bizzare. Reading the talkpage for the template, AMIB tells you in quite explicit terms that he does not support your changes and wishes you to stop, other editors share his point of view. You tell those editors that you take this as SUPPORT for your changes! I will assume good faith and assume you have some form of learning difficulty that affects your reading comprehension - the only other explanations involve bad faith. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesknight_2ce5.html" title="User:Charlesknight">Charlesknight</a> 12:53, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok I'm moving from finding your behaviour "bizarre" to downright disturbing. AMIB Quite clearly says he opposes your changes, you QUITE CLEARLY state that you take this as support ". This now goes beyond wiki-lawyering (which you have been accused of in the past), you seem intend on creating a false impression of a situation when anyone reading the talk page for the template can see what you actually said. I am baffled why you try such a gambit.

<p>The easiest way to avoid this whole mess would have been to discuss <i>before</i> making a major change to a widely used template. Since that didn't happen, the next best option would have been to discuss the matter rationally as soon as someone opposed the change. Arguing that someone's obviously opposing opinion was actually in support because of some arbitrary section break is absurd. I've seen matters involving Matthew pop up around the Wiki over the past few weeks and they all seem to be minor issues becoming major ones. In my opinion, it usually stems from Matthew's insistence that he is <i>right</i> and others are not only <i>wrong</i>, but their actions will harm Wikipedia. Yeah, this is all a bit blunt, but this behavior needs to cease. <a href="../../../a/r/e/User%7EAren%27t_I_Obscure__6bd1.html" title="User:Aren't I Obscure?">Aren't I Obscure?</a> 13:09, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>When this matter spilled onto ANI, the focus shifted from the template itself to how you reacted to opposition. With the huge number of editors we have, disagreements over changes (major or minor) are inevitable. It's essential that editors are able to handle opposition in a rational and calm manner. This includes taking to steps to prevent conflicts from escalating. Sometimes it even means backing down and letting a matter drop. However, instead of picking your battles wisely, you seem to want to fight every battle to the bitter end. Just in this section, you've managed to argue with every editor who's posted an opinion. Is it really the case that you're right and everyone else is wrong? My advice is back away from the template for a while and edit your favorite articles. Also, it wouldn't hurt to reread your RfC with the understanding that the majority of these editors are raising valid points. <a href="../../../a/r/e/User%7EAren%27t_I_Obscure__6bd1.html" title="User:Aren't I Obscure?">Aren't I Obscure?</a> 14:12, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A very reasonable way of implementing the colour coding was proposed by Ed near the start of the discussion. It is a /much/ better solution than manually handcranking the colours and not considering accessibility at all. When things are specified via a style sheet users have the freedom to turn off "daft colouring" and actually see the content (consider colour blindness). It's a shame Matthew did not seriously take this on board. His later behaivour and attempt to get mob rule to decide the issue (as in it's far to early to vote - discuss first) is bizarre.</p>

<p>Recently, socks of VaughanWatch have repeatedly blanked my talk page and/or replaced it sock puppet warnings, due to the fact that I have block two VaughanWatch IP addresses and a user account, <a href="../../../u/p/%26/User%7EUp%26Down_b061.html" title="User:Up&amp;Down">User:Up&amp;Down</a>, who all seem to be VaughanWatch.

<li>His style of discussion is very similar</li>

<dd>I feel I should wade into this mess since I missed most of the earlier discussion. I am strongly opposed to considering Homey to be under an indefinite community ban. He has unquestionably gone way beyond the pale of acceptable behaviour in recetn weeks, but this does not negate the fact that he has made several tens of thousands of valuable edits and several years of good behaviour. In the Canadian areas Wikipedia, where I am most familiar with his work, he was for a long time considered a pilar of the community. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 00:58, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is also my view. Looking through the edit histories of his alternate accounts they, for the most part, have done little disruptive and almost all the contributions have been totally legitimate.

<dd>SimonP. Could you give me some idea what you think the proper sanction is for abusive sockpuppets made to break rules, harass perceived advocacies, and avoid sanctions being handed in several arbitration cases on Homey's main user account?</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Seems like your buying into Homey false assertion that his block is punitive when in reality it was preventative. And you therefore look like you are giving him a get out of jail free card. In reality Homey was blocked for refusing to follow dispute resolution by instead fake leaving and coming back and engaging in deceptive and abusive editing with sockpuppets. Knowing his recent history, I think blocking his accounts and forbidding editing outside arbitration pages is prudent. Preventing future disruption in the face of his past disruptive editing should be our purpose. I think limiting him to the arbitration case pages is the only way to make it happen.</dd>

<dd>I don't understand why this is even being raised, at this point. He's created all sorts of sockpuppets, many for the purpose of harassing, deceiving, or confusing other editors. He's still pretending some of the sockpuppets aren't him, and he's using his active sockpuppet to try to spread as much <a href="../../../f/u/d/FUD_f18b.html" title="FUD">FUD</a> as he possibly can, including making various false and arguably defamatory claims. When faced with an ArbCom case, a responsible editor would not pretend to leave Wikipedia, then create a dozen sockpuppets and harass other editors with them.

<dd>These arguments would hold more water if the majority of the new accounts and IP addresses had done anything remotely disruptive. Even if you look at his ArbCom case, which tries to bring up every poor decision over the last several months, I have to agree with CJCurrie that "most of the evidence presented in the case is extremely dubious." Certainly any account that is being disruptive should be blocked, but blocking one that is only making goods edits is purely vindictive. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 12:46, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a>. This user has made over 35,000 edits in a period of several years. This is not a user you block through a community ban, this is a case that requires the arbcom. Homey has already indicated that he will appeal a community ban, and I support him in that. People claim the many abusive sockpuppets, I would like to see the evidence for the many abusive ones, and equally about the remaining accusations. As the tenstions between groups have gone to high, I think this needs to get away from the discussion boards.-- <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimvdLinde_061a.html" title="User:KimvdLinde">Kim van der Linde</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/m/User_talk%7EKimvdLinde_a7d1.html" title="User talk:KimvdLinde">at venus</a></sup> 16:50, 13 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>I think it is rather odd that some people's reasoning for not banning Homey is basically "but some of his sockpuppets are making good edits!". The idea that we should only pay attention to the example's of one's best behavior seems kinda odd. I would also argue that Homey's recent behavior has been worse than that of <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlu_Aardvark_ff0c.html" title="User:Blu Aardvark">Blu Aardvark</a>, think of what he has done in a matter-of-fact way: Harrassment, vote stacking, malicious sockpuppetry, abuse of process, and continuous incivility, plus all sorts of behavior that cannot simply be explained in terms of wikipedia policy. He has caused a huge amount of disruption by pretending to leave and then acting as if his account has been "hacked into" for the sole purpose of getting out of an arbcom sanction, and then he tried to launch an RFA against two admins because they called him on his recent behavior. I don't really see how all of this is canceled out because some of his sockpuppets have not yet engaged in any violations of policy.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 18:29, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I haven't seen evidence of maliciousness from Homey.

<p>Moshe, there were no sockpuppets. I recently had a few alternate accounts, none of which were used to edit the same articles or vote stack in AFDs or do anything opposed to WP:SOCK. Several of the accounts were single purpose accounts that made a handful of edits before being discarded because I didn't want to be drawn into anything on an ongoing basis - I will not be using such accounts in the future. No one has pointed to one edit made by these accounts that is at all worthy of a saction - the closest was SV pointing to a request for a 3RR that was made feigning ignorance of how to do a 3RR. Only one of those accounts was blocked initially and that was because someone wrongly suggested it of being a Wordbomb sockpuppet because it asked for the checkuser results of Mantanmoreland to be posted. Without the erroneous Wordbomb suspicion there would have been no grounds to block.</p>
<p>As for the supposed Sonofzion sockpuppet, I deny having used that account and checksuer did not "confirm" that it was me, rather it produced a "likely" response. There is evidence that Sonofzion was in fact <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDervish_Tsaddik_4360.html" title="User:Dervish Tsaddik">User:Dervish Tsaddik</a> using a Toronto are proxy or zombie computer since other posts signed "Sonofzion" originated from Sweden as did one signed "Daughterofzion".</p>
<p>According to the ruling on the Saladin 1970 appeal:</p>
<p>"The touchstone of an appropriate "ban by the community" is that there is no administrator who after examining the matter is willing to lift or reduce the ban."</p>
<p>This is not the case here as per Fred and SimonP's remarks as well as several other admins who have either spoken publicly or sent me emails. There are no sanctions against me, there have been no findings against me thus there is no reason to harass me with a witch hunt or arbitrary blocking.<a href="../../../e/x/-/User%7EEx-Homey_391b.html" title="User:Ex-Homey">Ex-Homey</a> 20:28, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>CJC, perhaps you haven't been following this closely. Homey used the accounts for the purposes of deception and harassment. He turned up at articles his "opponents" edited a lot and tried to start trouble on them; he filed at least one false 3RR report against one of them; he tried to interfere with the election to the medcom of another; he pretended to be another banned user in order to cause confusion; etc. It has been the worst disruptive behavior from a former regular user that I've encountered in my time here. Anyone who wanted to create a new account simply in order to contribute to the encyclopedia could have done so without interference, and would not have engaged in any of this behavior. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 04:53, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>CJCurrie, please don't post here and on my talk page. I don't want to waste a lot of time discussing Homey. You used to engage in what Homey would call "tag teaming" with him (note: this would be Homey's term for it, not mine), so you're well aware of the trouble he used to cause. Then you stopped editing with him so much, which I can only hope was a recognition on your part that he had gone beyond the pale, so please don't start up again. That Homey denies something is no reason not to believe it. He is disruptive, malevolent, and disingenuous, and is thoroughly enjoying causing this fuss. If he had wanted to edit the encyclopedia quietly, <b>there was nothing stopping him</b>. But it's not what he wants. What he wants is THIS. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 05:10, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I acknowledge that he's made some mistakes in recent times, but I do not believe that anything he's done merits punishment on the level of a community block.</dd>

<dd>My intepretation of recent events is that Ex-Homey's decision to recategorize the "Sockpuppet" pages may have been unnecessarily provocative under the circumstances, but it was not disruptive (ie. it did not jeopardize the integrity of the project; designating these alt. accounts as "Sockpuppets" was always questionable). In any event, I don't believe that it's sufficient procedural grounds for a block. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 05:33, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't know how you distinguish between "unnecessarily provocative" and disruptive. Using your def of disruptive, almost nothing would meet that standard. Look, the situation with Homey is sadly very simple. He has lost the confidence of almost all the editors who edit the pages he inhabits. More than "lost the confidence of": he is strongly disliked and not trusted by them. Even you, his staunchest ally, are forced to admit that his behavior is "unnecessarily provocative." Therefore, his editing of those pages is going to cause misery and trouble. That is a fact that nothing will change now, because he went too far, and there is now no way to repair those relationships. I tried very hard to get formal mediation started in order to avoid that total breakdown in relationships, but several others, including Homey initially, scuppered it, and then his sockpuppetry (or whatever you want to call it) started, and things went downhill from there. Therefore, in a case like this, it's not a question of deciding whether someone has lost the confidence of the community. He simply has. It has gone. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 05:43, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>SonofZion turned up as soon as Homey was blocked for 3RR and started reverting to his versions of articles, then edited articles Homey had edited a long time ago under different names, and the check user evidence was consistent with it being him.

<dd>If I may interject, I have watched this situation looking from the outside. My personal belief is that this is a clique war, and Homey became the casulity. Putting that remark aside, I see no point placing Ex-Homey under a block. This only encourages Homey to re-enter Wikipedia under an assumed name, and after his treatment, I can't blame him. It is better to know who your enemy is, rather than not knowing, there is nothing to gain from his ban. If he chooses to change the template of his banned accounts, so be it, I do not feel there is any harm done. I feel as though the Admin who revert those User page edits, are just spiting him, and incorrectly asserting their power. I think the behaviour of most the Admin invlovled here, really looks poorly on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete_Peters_7b3c.html" title="User:Pete Peters">Pete Peters</a> 05:24, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What do you mean by "where Homey often edits from?" I graduated and left Kingston in 2003 and have been back only once.

<p>SlimVirgin, as you are very involved with the disputes regarding Homey, you should undo your denial for unblocking as that should be done by an uninvolved admin, as you repeatedly has indicated yourself towards other admins.

<dd>Please read my post above. Homey could be unblocked a thousand times, he will always be reblocked eventually, because the confidence of the community has gone. KimvdLinde, you are in large measure responsible for this total breakdown in relationships that occurred, because you encouraged him. What was needed was formal mediation and a complete end to wikilawyering in order to get Homey back into the fold, as it were. In your wisdom, you forced the situation in the opposite direction, and now the editing relationships are beyond repair. If you want to stop making things even worse, you might consider staying out of the situation completely. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 05:50, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have read your posts, <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">stop assuming I do not</a>. He is continuosly reblocked by the same small number of admins, most who had conflicts with him, or have made their opposition towards him more than clear. As such, neither of you is uninvolved, and neither of you should block him. If the community is so fed up with him as you claim, there should be sufficient number of uninvolved adimins who want to block him. Your accusation that I encouraged him is beyond the pale, but I have gotten used to your wrath by now. I suggest that you finally proof your accusation that I am to blaim for the breakdown of the RfM, you have made the accusation now so often without any evidence. And I suggest you stay away from homey completly, because it is very clear to me that your continued emotional involvement causes the situation to escalate time and time over again. -- <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimvdLinde_061a.html" title="User:KimvdLinde">Kim van der Linde</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/m/User_talk%7EKimvdLinde_a7d1.html" title="User talk:KimvdLinde">at venus</a></sup> 06:01, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have no emotional involvement. All I know is this: things around Homey were always tense, because he got into a lot of conflict. But they were manageable. Then you came along with your craving for trouble, your insults, your wikilawyering, and your process fetishism. You got involved in his disputes, made them a thousand times worse than they would otherwise have been, and destroyed the remaining trust that some editors still had for him. Then you scuppered the formal mediation which might have saved him. What you forget (or never knew) is that I have known Homey a lot longer than you have, and he and I used to be very supportive of each other, so I didn't particularly want to see him go down the tube. It was in order to save those long-term editing relationships, which you neither knew nor cared about, that I tried to arrange mediation. I asked your permission to reproduce your e-mails — in which it is clear that you scuppered the mediation — for the first ArbCom case involving Homey. You refused, and said not only could I not reproduce them; I should also not mention their existence!</dd>

<dd>If you are so affraid to make things worse, I suggest you take a few steps back yourself, and let uninvolved admins deal with the issues. You are very deeply involved now in this extended conflict, but you still try to maintain that you are not, resulting in making admin decisions even with regard to homey. This is very troublesome because of your strongly expressed opinion that admins that, when they are involved even marginally in a dispute, they cannot make decisions. Apparently, you use two standards for that and that is a clear indication that you should take a step back and think some things over before telling other people not to be involved. -- <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimvdLinde_061a.html" title="User:KimvdLinde">Kim van der Linde</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/m/User_talk%7EKimvdLinde_a7d1.html" title="User talk:KimvdLinde">at venus</a></sup> 14:15, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm going to weigh in here to point out two key things:</p>
<ul>
<li>The fact that an admin has taken action against an editor (through blocking, requesting checkuser, tagging socks, etc) does <i>not</i> mean that the admin is somehow "tainted" and not permitted to deal with user conduct problems with the same user in the future. This is a misconception that comes up frequently in the project's dealings with tenacious troublemakers who game the system. Policies such as <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>, <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBLOCK_89b0.html" title="WP:BLOCK">WP:BLOCK</a>, and <a href="../../../p/p/_/WP%7EPP_1ffd.html" title="WP:PP">WP:PP</a> only discourage admins from intervening in users <i>with whom they have an editing dispute</i>, that is, a content dispute. Were it not so, we would constantly have to rotate admins in dealing with a conduct problem, which is burdensome to the project because of the time it takes to understand the history behind a particular individual, as well as the very human tendency of admins to give second chances to anyone whose misconduct they have not witnessed personally.</li>
<li>Given that there is widespread consensus that Homey has edited with a considerable number of sock puppets, thus making it difficult for the project to track his activities, there is no need for proof or even necessarily strong evidence that any particular sock puppet is either (a) homey or (b) disruptive before it can be blocked.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">The Uninvited</a> Co., <a href="../../../u/n/i/User_talk%7EUninvitedCompany_4866.html" title="User talk:UninvitedCompany">Inc.</a> 14:49, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>My reading of this situation is a bit different. JayJG had been involved in numerous content disputes with HotR prior to the "sockpuppets" controversy, and his actions have created (at minimum) the appearance of a conflict of interest. To your second point, I don't believe there is a widespread consensus that HotR "edited with a considerable number of sock puppets". He has acknowledged creating one-day alternate accounts <i>after quitting the HotR handle</i>, and has specifically denied the most significant sockpuppet accusation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Given the contentious nature of this controversy, we should be especially wary about jumping to conclusions not supported by the facts. I do not believe it's appropriate to list "Barbamama" or "Fluffy the Cotton Fish" (for instance) as socks, when the evidence clearly points in a different direction. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 04:30, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>"Numerous content disputes with HotR prior to the "sockpuppets" controversy?" Hardly. I barely edited his Israeli apartheid article, and we haven't been in "disputes" in months. There was no "conflict of interest", and you and Homey constantly claiming this will not make it true. In addition, I can't understand why you talk about "not supported by the facts", when you are completely unaware of them. The evidence (which you have not seen, and therefore should not have commented on) points specifically and solely to Homey (or perhaps, the aliens that took over Homey's computer) being the sockmaster of "Barbamama" or "Fluffy the Cotton Fish" . <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 23:36, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Readers should note that HotR and JayJG were involved in a bitter dispute on the New anti-Semitism page shortly before the present controversy began. I'm standing by my comments as to the existence of a conflict of interest. To Jay's second point, I'm not certain that seeing the evidence would make any difference: HotR has <i>acknowledged</i> that he used "Barbamama" as an alternate account, and has also indicated that a housemate was the primary user of "Fluffy the Cotton Fish" (although he also posted from that account a few times). Unless Jay has some magical device that can distinguish housemate from housemate and alternate account from sockpuppet, his evidence would seem to be superfluous. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 04:55, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First of all I really don't see how you can state that the evidence doesn't support Barbarama and Cotton fish being socks of Homey. They edit in similar ways (although the negative characteristics of Homey are even more pronounced in those socks), they either seem to carry grudges or edit the same articles as Homey's "enemies", and as far as I know checkuser seems to all but confirm who the puppeteer is.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Second of all, Homey has gotten into multiple disputes with almost every administrator who touches the articles that he frequents. I really don't think we disqualify all these people based on your notion of "perceived conflicts-of-interest".- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 08:03, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The above statement by Moshe about getting into conflicts with every administrator who touches articles he frequences is incorrect and misleading. There are a select number of administrators he had issues with - SlimVirgin, Jayjg and Humus Sapiens.

<dd>Just to clarify: Barbamama was created for the sole purpose of stalking and harassing me and Zeq but mainly me, as can be seen by reviewing its seven hours of existence.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Barbamama" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Barbamama" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> That gave it all the apperance of the psycho stalker Wordbomb.

<dd>CJCurrie, in a previous post on August 4 to AN/I about his sockpuppetry, Homey explicitly denied being Fluffy the Cotton Fish.

<dd>I don't believe FtCF was a sockpuppet <i>or</i> a meatpuppet. HotR has said that the account was used primarily by someone else in his co-op, and that he made use of the account a few times. Neither of these assertions strains credulity -- and since HotR had stopped using the HotR account at the time, neither 'puppetry charge is applicable to the situation. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 05:10, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>SV's obsession with me (or perhaps more correctly her obsession at this point with undoing SimonP's upbraiding of her on her talk page) is impressive in all its tragicomic proportions but not terribly productive. This matter is at an end. I will now follow the advice of SimonP and Fred made in this thread several days ago and fully expect Slim and the gang to follow it as well. Given all the self-justifying nonsense from SV, Jay, Moshe and now Mantanmoreland I will repost it below in case it's been forgotten:</p>
<p><i>If another account like <a href="../../../f/l/u/User%7EFluffy_the_Cotton_Fish_23d9.html" title="User:Fluffy the Cotton Fish">User:Fluffy the Cotton Fish</a> appears and starts making a stream of productive edits, I see no reason to not let Homey quietly work under the new name. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 01:23, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</i></p>
<p><i>More to it than that, but based primarily on SimonP's position I am relieving Ex-homey from the condition I imposed on him. He says he may create another account to edit with quietly.

<p>Or it could just be the airport vandal impersonating Karmafist. Let's not rush to conclusions. This latest string of edits actually seems kind of unlike Karmafist. For instance, the bit on my talk page was poorly formatted. Karmafist used Wikipedia long enough to know wiki syntax; would he really have started off his first line with a bunch of spaces, thus throwing it into an ugly pre block? Now, of course, I think Karmafist should be indefinitely banned for a variety of other reasons, but I don't necessarily think that airport vandalism is one of them. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><span style="color:#ff66ff;"><b>Cyde Weys</b></span></a> 03:01, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sad to see it come to this, but I think an indef ban is the right thing here.

Ok, I'm taking a bit of a risk here but I just hit the unblock button.

<dd>Whoa, balls. Big ones. I think that while Karmafist has the potential to be a good editor again, if he keeps getting bird-dogged by the same people we'll very rapidly spiral into another indefinate block. The most recent block for incivility was stretching a very long bow, for instance. So, is it <i>at all</i> possible that we let someone unbloodied handle any potential problems with Karmafist from now on? - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="black">brenneman</font></a> <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" rel="nofollow"><font color="black" title="Admin actions"><sup><b>{L}</b></sup></font></a></span> 07:12, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've always managed to keep Karmafist at arm's length, but I'm not hopeful on his prospect for improvement. He bears grudges against the project as a whole and boasts of vandalism. If I thought that he was likely to go back to editing, I'd welcome Tawker's unblock. As it is, I'm worried that it will simply give him a further opportunity to spread ill will. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 17:15, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Thanks for your help with my question, I am still trying to resolve the issue.

<dd>Hm, I actually don't know how to deal with repeat offenders, but I imagine a warning of some kind might be appropriate. Perhaps you could try leaving a note on the <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">administrators' noticeboard</a> so an admin can take a look and leave the appropriate warning?

<li>You're pretty much taking the proper action now. If someone is serially uploading unfree images, then a short block with progressive durations is generally in line (by that I mean 24 hr, 48 hr, 72 hr, and then ArbCom in an RFaR action). It depends upon whether the user is misunderstanding copyright or simply too obsessed with <i>Playboy</i> bunnies to care. If the former, we educate. If the latter, the person is a liability. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:36, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>Why is this image copyright infringement? The picture is a magazine cover, and the article using the cover specifically discusses the contents of that issue, as well as the cover in question. Doesn't that fit the fair use guideline? Not being snide, just honestly confused. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 03:37, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree. I'm one of the biggest fair-use complainers around and this image seems perfectly reasonable to me (though missing detailed fair-use rationale). It's a magazine cover used in an article that specifically discusses this cover. The license is correct. It really needs a blatant source (though this is implied) and must have a detailed fair-use rationale for its use. But it's not a copyright violation. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 03:47, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>
<ul>
<li>Delve deeper into the licensing statement. It says: <i>It is not acceptable to use images with this tag in the article of the person or persons depicted on the cover.</i> This magazine cover image is not to illustrate the playboy magazine, but to illustrate Paris Hilton. So, once again. Let's get this fixed. <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawilkin_0dc0.html" title="User:Lawilkin"><font color="LightCoral">Lau</font></a><a href="../../../l/a/w/User_talk%7ELawilkin_c984.html" title="User talk:Lawilkin"><font color="green">ren</font></a> 10:44, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Not acceptable..."unless used directly in connection with the publication of this image." As such, this one seems kosher, since the relevant section of the article in question discusses Hilton's article within the magazine and the magazine's decision to use an actress portraying Hilton rather than Hilton herself for the cover. The passage you're citing is meant to prohibit the use of magazine covers to illustrate the cover model for articles that don't discuss that model's appearance on/in the magazine, a completely different kind of usage, and one that's obviously not fair use. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 12:45, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The usage of the cover is correct in this case; the cover is being discussed in an entire paragraph and is not just there for pure decoration.

<li>Actually, his last image upload was March 2006, and he has uploaded a LOT of playboy cover images. When I started this discussion, I didn't realize how many of these images he had uploaded. At this point, I am not worried about future violations, I am focusing on whether or not all these images are acceptable for use. I might be misunderstanding the policy. The <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a> page says: <i>Here is an example of uses that would almost certainly not be acceptable as fair use: An image of a magazine cover, used only to illustrate the article on the person whose photograph is on the cover. However, if</i> <i><b>that magazine issue itself</b></i> <i>is notable enough to be a topic within the article, then fair use may apply.</i> I still think that these cover images do not fall under fair use. <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawilkin_0dc0.html" title="User:Lawilkin"><font color="LightCoral">Lau</font></a><a href="../../../l/a/w/User_talk%7ELawilkin_c984.html" title="User talk:Lawilkin"><font color="green">ren</font></a> 21:46, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Playboy covers are obviously not licensed and must be used according to wikipedia's fair use policy. The cover you raised initially at <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris_Hilton_9740.html" title="Paris Hilton">Paris Hilton</a> seems to be a borderline or slightly-over-the-border-on-the-acceptable-side use, since the article discusses not only the fact that Playboy named PH the sexiest whatever, but also because the cover photo is alleged to be a fake and that is part of the article. Other Playboy covers as used in other articles may or may not be acceptable.

<dd>Unlikely there socks, both naems are common ("mark", "taylor") and both seem to be good standing users. Likely Mark Taylor was taken so he subst. with Mr, which to me is acceptable as "Mark Taylor" is likely also his name.

<dd>I've had quite a bit to do with Eddie, right back to the original Exicornt article; reverting his edits, helping compile the Eddie sock category, etc. He has also emailed me a few times over the last year. I do not believe User:Royalistlane is really Eddie. I believe it to be a (very bad) imitator. Firstly, the account's edits are not typical of edits I've known Eddie to make (he is relatively consistent in tithe type of edits he makes and general type of article he targets). Also, Eddie has always been very offended by sock tags, always denied it is him, edit warred to get rid of the tags, etc. I don't believe that Eddie would announce on his fourth edit the account is one of his. And I don't believe he would voluntarily tag his own account as "a sock puppet of Eddie Segoura." This person's MO is, in my opinion, completely different to Eddie's. Sarah Ewart (Talk) 13:16, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also, not sure if the IP posted on the account's talk page is correct, but if it is, it wouldn't seem to be constant with Eddie's location and previous IPs. Sarah Ewart (Talk) 13:22, 16 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I believed it was Eddie due to the fact "EXICORNT" was mentioned in a pagemove - <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Exicornt_9cb6.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Exicornt">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Exicornt</a> - isn't that now <a href="../../../s/a/l/WP%7ESALT_ca07.html" title="WP:SALT">WP:SALTed</a>??

<dd>Yes, that is correct, TheM62Manchester. Eddie is obsessed with getting the word "Exicornt" recognised on Wikipedia. But that's common knowledge and an easy thing for an impersonator to drop in to an edit summary. I'm certain Eddie was editing from various AOL IPs yesterday, but the edits from that account aren't consistent with Eddie's edits (other than dropping the word exicornt). I'm as certain as I can be that it is an impersonator, rather than a sock. I personally don't see much point in checkusering it given the account is blocked indefinitely for vandalism.

<dd>Vary, I would block if I was an admin; is that enough endorsement for you to do it anyway? I am now thinking of a 48-72 hr rangeblock but allowing logged-in editors to edit.

Alternatively, try <a href="../../../r/p/p/WP%7ERPP_5127.html" title="WP:RPP">requests for page protectcion</a>.

<dd>That's exactly the problem, my boy, no one can postively state what her reasoning is for the tags because she hasn't provided any evidence.

<p>Material is sourced, documented and has been modified to meet all objections except Isarigs and Inangibles. They object because they are Israel apolologists.

<p>Why try to push the envelope of what is allowable? Even if some of the material was original to you, it's not good to leave it to us to try to unscramble what is and what isn't legitimate.

<p>If it doesn't qualify for speedy, you can always list it on AFD and close it early after it gets dogpiled (as it probably will since it's a copyvio). After that, it's easy to speedy as a repost of deleted content.

<p>The heading of the discussion of "Zionism" states nothing about the neutrality of the article being disputed. When the discussion of Zionism does not contain a statement that the ideology calls for a state of Israel AND the expulsion of Arabs from their land it is not a definition, merely propaganda. It states this clearly in their charter regarding Arabs, as do Zionists if you ask them, which is a large contributor to why UN resolution 3379 states that Zionism is equal to racism. The entire planet voted yes to this definition. The only nays being of course USA and Israel. Your discussion of Zionism is far fetched, neutrality disputed, cuddly, intellectually dishonest, and out right misleading to all who read this "definition".

<p>I am normally the administrator who patrols <a href="../../../s/s/p/WP%7ESSP_fb6b.html" title="WP:SSP">WP:SSP</a> as such, and have already blocked a previous sock of SqueakBox, which I later blocked him because of his Arb Com ruling.

I would highly appreciate it if another administrator would review the case and judge best whether or not this is a sock.

<p>The above users are the same. Originally this fellow got very upset with me for including a translation of Catullus 16 in a rap style on the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catullus_16.html" title="Catullus 16">Catullus 16</a> page, removing it and dismissing it as "retarded and offensive." I've left it out, as he desired. Since then, he's made numerous backhanded compliments but more insults, such as "maybe your high school teachers can set you straight." He has a history of highly insulting edit summaries, such as "Meizhou (→Culture - Took out some bullshit. This article is a disgrace." and "Chinese hip hop (Cui Jian is not a fucking rapper)" and "Roman legion (→Early history - removed bullshit put in by some stupid teenager)." These are some of the most egregious ones. I've warned him, he's been nothing but defiant. He baited me with another message to my talk page again. I'm not interested in continuing fighting with him. He looks like a fairly troublesome and belligerent user, and I'd like him off my back. He's gotten exactly what he wanted from me, but still he harrasses me. Please, help. I don't want to be uncivil. I've already told him to go away, but he still wants to initiate argument. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBilly_Blythe_7728.html" title="User:Billy Blythe">Billy Blythe</a> 14:26, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I gave a warning to him, but as so often happens with these things you don't seem to be have been completely civil, either, in dealing with people involved in debate about Catullus. I don't see anything from you as egregious as what he has said, but it's hard from a quick look to sort out the rights and wrongs of the history. Try to be polite to everybody even if you feel provoked. Let me or another admin know if you encounter any further attacks like this, but don't reply in kind. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 15:15, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>From <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_moves_b0bd.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested moves">Wikipedia:Requested moves</a>, where it had been for 8 days and when there had been no more Talk comments for 5 days, I moved this page (over a redirect) to its more common, applicable name based on the reasoning in the request at <a href="../../../w/e/l/Talk%7EWelsh_self-government_00a8.html#Requested_move" title="Talk:Welsh self-government">Talk:Welsh self-government#Requested move</a>, on reading the article, and on a search of Google Scholar and the Proquest academic and journalistic database. The two oppositions to the move did not really apply: one was only because of bad capitalization in the original proposal ("Welsh Nationalism"), which was corrected, and the other was a general comment in favor of standardizing all similar articles to consistent names (rather than having <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_nationalism.html" title="English nationalism">English nationalism</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornish_self-government_movement.html" title="Cornish self-government movement">Cornish self-government movement</a> and <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_independence.html" title="Scottish independence">Scottish independence</a>, etc.). Therefore, I moved the page.</p>
<p>Less than a minute after, the user who moved the page from its original position in February, at "Welsh nationalism", who did not express an opinion in the move discussion, suddenly opposed it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Welsh_self-government&amp;diff=70038948&amp;oldid=70038714" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Welsh_self-government&amp;diff=70038948&amp;oldid=70038714" rel="nofollow">[41]</a> and contacted me at <a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html#Page_move" title="User talk:Centrx">User talk:Centrx#Page move</a>, soon after which he added that he thought it was an issue that warranted mention here as an administrative incident <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Centrx&amp;diff=70040426&amp;oldid=70039219" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Centrx&amp;diff=70040426&amp;oldid=70039219" rel="nofollow">[42]</a>; so I have added this here. He also moved the page back to "Welsh self-government". There is an IP 'vote' which he accuses of sockpuppetry, but rather than counting numbers, I gauged consensus by looking at the reasons in each opinion; while, if true, vote-stacking would warrant administrative action (and I don't know the history alluded at the denied Checkuser request at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_checkuser_Case_Normalmouth_752e.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Normalmouth">Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Normalmouth</a>), but this is not a straight vote, and what is relevant is the reasons for and against, which I evaluated carefully. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 16:44, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>You did not close the discussion before you moved the page!</i> I thought that this was <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENormalmouth_757b.html" title="User:Normalmouth">User:Normalmouth</a> using yet another sockpuppet. I did not realise that it was an Admin closing the discussion.

<dd>It is very, very important to note that I moved the page back because I thought it was vandalism. <i>There was nothing on the Talk page to say that an Admin had closed the debate.</i> And further, I would like it noted that I spent so long reporting Normalmouth to CheckUser for sockpuppetry that I clearly had fortgotten to vote in the Requested move discussion myself. --<a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">Mais oui!</a> 16:59, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am not accusing you of a bad faith revert, but immediately threatening anyone with administrative reports does not help anything. Regardless of whether a user is an administrator, it is not appropriate to assume bad faith, especially when the move had a reasonable edit summary and the user's talk page is evidently not that of a newly registered or weird user. I closed the discussion a minute after I moved the article, not a big deal (closing before would solve this sort of problem, but there are, perhaps pedantic, reasons why I haven't in the past). The article was moved based on support of the nominator and myself in light of strongly prevailing reasons, when all expressed opposition was contingent on corrected problems or was vague and not relevant to this particular move. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 17:15, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

At this time, and based on this evidence, I would not yet be willing support an indefinite block.

<dd>Not sure. His actions convince me that he should never be an admin, and any future RfAs should be speedily closed. He should also be limmited to one account.

<dd>Hi, everyone. I must say that I disagree with a community ban. I know I'm not an admin, but I have just finished looking over the situation out of my own curiosity, and I don't believe that he's actually <i>harmful</i>.

<dd>Doc is, I think, quite right, and his suggestions seem roughly orthogonal with those of Cyde infra. Jtk should be limited to one account, of course, with the provision that his creating a sockpuppet for the purpose of disrupting projectspace will be strongly disfavored; his mainspace participation seems to be altogether fine, and I don't think there's any risk of disruption relative to work on articles. I'm not certain that a year-long ban from RfA is in order—his only sockpuppeteering at RfA seems to have been relative to his own RfAs, and I can't imagine that he'll be requesting adminship anytime soon—since he may have particular prescience apropos of the judgment of prospective admins, but I don't think such a ban would be particularly wrong. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 17:44, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There's a lot of ugly in that RFA, but <b>if</b> he can agree to having only one account, there's a possibility he can still be a useful editor (though not an admin or anything with additional trust, apparently).

<dd>Indeed. Jt, I don't believe you would dispute that your actions have been less than appropriate. People are responding to them differently, and at this point the community has not come to any kind of decision -- and I don't suppose that it would be reasonable for you to expect that all of this be forgotten at the drop of a hat: if you want this to be let go eventually, the first step is to own it, that is, accept responsibility for the mistakes made.<br />
I don't have a crystal ball, of course, but if I had to guess, I'd say you are not likely to be banned, but you are equally unlikely to become an administrator, or to hold any kind of special position in this community. If you can settle for being an editor (and doing it from a single account), who knows, in the future (granted, it would take a lot more time than "usual"), you might even arrive at a point where the community will we willing to trust you with Admin tools again. But if you up and leave now, nothing gets resolved, and the last memory of your participation in the project would be this debacle. Would you say that's fair? Be patient; accept responsibility. And don't get angry because people are having a hard time digesting what has happened, since that's not fair either. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 18:16, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As I've said I am going on a self imposed Wikiban from this account and the other 2 have already been blocked and I fully agree to a community enforced one account probation, however due to the strong feelings in this case I am loathe to do it on this account and once this discussion has died down I will be scrambling my passwords on this and the other two accounts to long letter/number combinations to prevent abuse by myself or others. Considering that if my one account would not have a fair shot of being a good editor I would not publicly reveal what the nick is (when I have created it) however if a few trusted Wikipedian's would come forth and swear secrecy I think that having them as oversight would be a good idea, that way the needs of the community knowing what I'm doing and the needs of me being able to make a fresh start under one account would be met.

<dd>I would agree to this, on the one additional proviso that, if you ever want to seek RFA on the new account, you must publically reveal the link in the process. This may result in it being impossible for you to ever get adminship back, but I'm afraid that that would have to be part of the consequences for you actions. For you to ever seek adminship again, it must be done in the public light.

<p>I'm bringing this back out of the archive to bring a final resolution. It seems there is consensus for a one account limitation for Jtkiefer and he has agreed to this. Because the issue was already more or less decided here, the arbitration request was declined. The only outstanding issue is for Jtkiefer to disclose to a number of people what new account he is editing under so they can prevent future abuse. While Jtkiefer wants that to be permanently secret, he has abused that in the past, so it seems reasonable to keep the identity secret unless he tries to do anything irregular (such as supporting the positions of his sockpuppets or anything else in <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a> or tries to stand for adminship or another position of importance. There has been a checkuser performed, and it looks like another would need to be run unless Jtkiefer voluntarily discloses his new account to at least a few members of the arbcom and a couple bureaucrats. I'm willing to be one of the bureaucrats the account is disclosed to, but I'm also fine if people don't want me to be one of them for whatever reason. Once the account is disclosed the people that know should confirm they know and by private means confirm it is the same one.

<dd>I notice that you have informed Jtkiefer about this discussion on his talk page. I suggest that, if he should want to continue editing under a new account, he should contact a bureaucrat and disclose his username. It doesn't need to be generally published, as long as it is known within the bureaucratship. If he doesn't come forward within a month or so, I guess we assume he's not interested. If he is then detected at some time in the future (due to problematic behavior) then we'll deal with that when it arises. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 18:11, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agreed to use one account and continue to agree to however I do not agree with mandatory disclosure should I request adminship and that's holding me back from full agreement from this. I understand the community has an interest in knowing if I ever go up for adminship again, however statements like dante's "oppose indefinitely" make me weary of disclosure since I feel that I will never be able to get a fair chance again for adminship due to people who will infinitely oppose even after I've earned trust again, also I am not sure if the community will accept anything short of the arbcom and even though I am trying to assume good faith I do not have faith that this won't be done then I'll end up being perm banned by some admin who can claim that this isn't a "community wide decisions".

<dl>
<dd>Yes, we reallize that you want to be able to reapply without having to disclose the situation, but that is unacceptable. Many RfA's pass with some opposes and some with a significant amount. If significant time passed where you were able to demonstrate an exemplary edit history and some patience, then I believe you could have a successful RfA. Heck, not that many Wikipedian's stick around forever. If you're patient enough, you can out-wait them and then your candidacy would be fully judged on the merits. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 18:35, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, sorry, but then I think the only option is forced disclosure or community ban. Restriction to one account with disclosure if need be was just a compromise to allow you to edit. If you are unwilling to disclose the situation should you choose to try for a position of importance, it would be disclosed for you. You made your choices, now you don't want to have to live with the consequences.

<dd>I agree. It sounds like you want to create a new identity, rack up some edits, promptly apply for adminship again, and a month later for bureaucratship. I can sympathize with you wanting a blank slate for editing, but your constant need for more power is very suspicious, and any future applications for adminship under a new identity should include your past history in this area. If there has been sufficient time and good behavior then I'm sure people can overlook your past deceptions, but it's not going to happen in 2 months like I think you expect. If you don't agree with the terms <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> outlined, then I would propose that your other account be revealed and blocked, and you be restricted to editing as user <a href="../../../j/t/k/User%7EJtkiefer_5ea4.html" title="User:Jtkiefer">User:Jtkiefer</a>. 12.75.4.22 20:00, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Jt, the only reason it seems that people will hold permanent grudges is because they do. You burned a lot of bridges, did you really think that people would just ignore it? Your actions have consequences, and one of those is that you don't get a free pass to have a secret identity so you can be an admin. This is not a matter of us failing to Assume Good Faith, you've PROVEN (more than once) that this community cannot trust you and that you do not care about the opinions of the people who make up the community. If you want to be an admin, you go ahead and convince a sizable majority of people that they can trust you. Now, I doubt you'll be able to do that, but you are entitled to try... OPENLY. I would also like to make a special request that someone who's a regular on the WP:FPC page be made aware of Jt's secret identity, as there are concerns about his behavior on that page specifically. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDante_Alighieri_2b5c.html" title="User:Dante Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDante_Alighieri_3f7c.html" title="User talk:Dante Alighieri">Talk</a> 22:12, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A possible other solution, since it appears that I risk being banned if I don't give into being railroaded, what if I edit only as Jtkiefer and do a 6 month voluntary ban on all spaces outside of article/user/and user talk with a one year ban from FPC and RFA and all subpages and related pages, which of course would be enforced not only by myself but the community at large I guess since I can assume that from now on all my contributions will be gone over with a fine tooth comb, this is not my first choice for a solution and the conversations above so that you do not have a legitimate excuse for a community ban as the community by and large is split over possibly banning me but I'm willing to abide by it if it will appease Taxman, Dante, and the community.

<dd>Note that I have no special weight here, other than that I have been especially vocal in my disapproval of Jtkiefer's recent controversial behavior. As such, Jt has referenced me by name above, and accordingly, I am responding. I will grant that "permanent" was perhaps a bit harsh on my part with respect to a ban. I suppose it is possible for people to "reform" and change their attitude, so leaving the door open in the future is not wholly unreasonable. I would not oppose Jtkiefer's proposed solution (listed above), specifically with respect to the one year voluntary ban from FPC and RFA pages. I am uncertain whether the 6 month ban on "generic" non-article/user pages is necessary, and do not consider it required for a reasonable solution. As Jt's objectionable behavior appears to have been limited to FPC and RFA pages, I have no problem with the punishment being confined to those pages, especially if he continues editing on a known account (User:Jtkiefer, for example, with no socks). Based on a brief check of Jt's additions to the article namespace, it does appear that his "problem" is limited to administrative tasks, and that he would probably be capable of making useful contributions to the 'pedia if they were limited to the article/user space. I maintain my position that his behavior with respect to seeking authority is absolutely unacceptable, but acknowledge that he has contributed outside of that capacity and should probably be allowed to continue to do so. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDante_Alighieri_2b5c.html" title="User:Dante Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDante_Alighieri_3f7c.html" title="User talk:Dante Alighieri">Talk</a> 01:18, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're not being railroaded. You just don't want to deal with the consequences of your actions. But from my perspective you don't need to agree to any namespace bans as long as you agree to edit from one known account and to have that be enforced. You'd be free to e$it as you please and build back trust with the community. That seems like a reasonable solution to remove the problems but allow you to continue the good editing you do. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 01:32, 1u August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Lets get this straight, you were found using sockpuppets abusively, abusing your previous admin powers and you are now presented with two options (a) A community ban (b) And alternative which still has a risk of a community ban (though it since I have no reason to believe <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> is not dealing with this honestly in which case consensus for the ban would not be met). I'm sure many editors wouldn't be given an option (b), yet this isn't good enough for you, as above you seem to want to avoid dealing with the consequences of your actions. I can't speak for anyone else but reading through this thread, this seems to wearing a bit thin and perhaps we should consider withdrawing option (b). --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User%7EPgk_d0c7.html" title="User:Pgk">pgk</a><sup>(<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk"><font color="mediumseagreen">talk</font></a>)</sup> 06:48, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, the only page I am editing with this account that I could not contribute to were this account blocked is this one so I hardly consider that sockpuppetry, this account is totally inactive except for replying on this page and replying to anything on my talk page. If you consider me being able to reply to any comments, questions, or accusations on this page sockpuppetry then I guess I would fall under that definition this is no different than a ban on an editor editing anything except for user talk and his/her arbcom case except in this case it's not an arbcom page it's this set of threads and subthreads in AN/I. <a href="../../../j/t/k/User%7EJtkiefer_5ea4.html" title="User:Jtkiefer">Jtkiefer</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/t/k/User_talk%7EJtkiefer_123b.html" title="User talk:Jtkiefer">talk</a></sup> 07:10, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<p><a href="../../../j/t/k/User%7EJtkiefer_5ea4.html" title="User:Jtkiefer">Jtkiefer</a> is now indefinitely blocked as I know the identity of the other account and so do other trusted editors. The difference here Will, is Jtkiefer now can't use <b>any</b> other accounts than the one new account he created. Not even alternate accounts as permitted by <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a>. And there is a right to vanish so he can stop editing from Jtkiefer and start over as long as he sticks to one account and that is monitored, which he will be. So it's a one account limitation or it will revert to a community ban and if he applies for any position of trust, the situation will be disclosed.

<dd>I think that Taxman has committed to taking responsibility for Jtkiefer. I expect that he will take that responsibility seriously, and realize that it is a long-term commitment. If he finds he is no longer interested, or becomes inactive on Wikipedia, it should be delegated to another equally responsible, editor. I still see no reason why Jtkiefer's new identity should be secret, but I'll defer to his new mentor. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 23:37, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Although I believe I am within my rights to levy it, as the target of his nonsense, I feel that I must first take special pains to ensure that any actions are done according to Wiki guidelines and that there is no opening for claims of admin abuse, although I am not abdicating the right to apply the appropriate wikipedia procedure.

<p>Users here are upset that Oiboy has added items to <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_rights_in_Israel_6f67.html" title="Human rights in Israel">Human rights in Israel</a>.

Do not put words in my/others mouth. I have not even once insinuated anything like that. This does not involve any 'false or defamatory accusation'.

<p>It's quite simple. Did you click that link I brought?

<p>So, it looks like Oiboy77 committed a forgery on an article's talk page by making it look as if a warning or comment came from an admin it did not come from. Is that the truth of it? Right now, it's looking like mischief rather than an honest mistake. That certainly would merit a warning, but I think we need some kind of explanation here. I suggest that Oiboy77 explain himself or an adverse inference is going to be drawn. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 23:26, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Correct. Now if you check his talk page, you will see that this is not the first time he has broken the rules. Also his total denial of anything having happened is very weird.

The guy is as innocent as a bank robber in plain daylight with 1000 witnesses. Yet he accuses me, who discovered it first (as did <a href="../../../o/k/e/User%7EOkedem_d37e.html" title="User:Okedem">User:okedem</a>) of 'playing a silly little game' and denies that it is vandalism. Well, tell you what, it is whim who is playing a silly little game and committed vandalism here. A very childish form, which makes it even worse than gross vandalism, in my eyes. This was done merely to annoy, to harass another user. There is no explanation possible, the only thing fitting is an apology by Oiboy77 and a promise to never, ever, do this again. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel575_1e43.html" title="User:Daniel575">Daniel575</a> 01:54, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nice try with the strawman. The dispute is actually leaning towards my argument, not away from it. There is not enough proof that Rand is a philosopher, as only a very rare few academics back this claim. Rand-related articles are currently skewed in her and her followers favor, making all of them POV. What I am doing is required in order for these articles to maintain a NPOV status. There are very, very few academic sources that call Rand a philosopher, and most "reliable sources" given in articles come from Rand's supporters, almost all of whom have no academic credibility. Consensus isn't needed when the facts say that calling Rand a philosopher is POV. -- <a href="../../../l/g/a/User_talk%7ELGagnon_b412.html" title="User talk:LGagnon">LGagnon</a> 02:50, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Just because you disagree with a claim, does not make it a strawman. Let's use terms properly if we could. Someone doesn't have to be "academia approved" to be a philosopher. Please. We've gone over this for months and months. No one is going to be unduly influenced in favor of Rand by seeing that she's a philosopher. That's just insane. <a href="../../../m/r/v/User%7EMrVoluntarist_23fd.html" title="User:MrVoluntarist">MrVoluntarist</a> 02:54, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I meant the entirity of your argument is one. You are trying to make a simple content dispute look like a holy war.</dd>
<dd>And again you assume your statements are understood to be true instead of backing them with evidence. Yes, <i>a lot</i> of people back Rand because she claims to be a philosopher; in fact, most Randists do. It's not until they learn that they are dealing with a pseudo-philosopher that they stop backing her ideology.</dd>
<dd>And you are trying to keep an academic term in articles involving an anti-academic and her pseudoscientific ideology. Her work is only "philosophy" in the sense that intelligent design is a "theory". It only counts as such in the vernacular sense, which a responsible and accurate encyclopedia should not be using to describe a pseudo-science. -- <a href="../../../l/g/a/User_talk%7ELGagnon_b412.html" title="User talk:LGagnon">LGagnon</a> 03:17, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I think it's very different to state that someone is a philsopher and to state that one agrees with the stated philosophy. Being a philosopher, IMO, is to concern oneself with a certain broad sphere of ideas -- IMO it's safe to call her a philosopher but still disagree with her over all the philosophical stands she takes. --<a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImprov_b282.html" title="User:Improv">Improv</a> 21:01, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm going to put my two cents in here real quick. Attic Owl has behaved in an uncivil manner towards Kelly Martin and Cyde Weys. Now Cyde did in my opinion make a boardline uncivil comment on A.O.s page about becoming a member of Esperanza. Cyde Weys was in my opinion as a Non SYSOP to be justifed in 48 hour block. A.O. has shown that he doesn't understand Wiki Policy. How ever if this member is a possible sock then can we run a check user? <a href="../../../a/e/o/User%7EAeon1006_ee0d.html" title="User:Aeon1006"><font color="green">Æon</font></a> <font color="red"><sup><a href="../../../a/e/o/User_talk%7EAeon1006_32f8.html" title="User talk:Aeon1006">Insane Ward</a></sup></font> 02:44, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Cyde's comment, while I found it funny, probably did go a bit too far (but if this is indeed a sockpuppet, I couldn't really care less).

<dd>Tada, and we just bagged one of those sockpuppet accounts that Karmafist claims was "ready to go up for adminship". LOL.

<dd>Incivility that is provoked is understandable. Occasional incivility is forgivable. Constant incivility is the only thing worth bothering this noticeboard with, and I don't see that here.

<dd>Normally I would say go ahead and strike them with a note. However, because Cyde is something of a lightning rod, and I can not find an on-wiki source for the checkuser report, you might want to wait for public conformation from one of the checkusers. I think I know who ran the check, but it would help if Cyde can point to an on-wiki diff, or if one of the checkusers could sign off on this, just to dot the i's properly. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131 (talk)</a> 17:18, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Most of us, including some of the most partisan among us, have been engaged in fruitful discussion, compromise, and negotiation regarding <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">anarchism</a> and its related pages. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThat%27sHot_b6db.html" title="User:That'sHot">That'sHot</a>, a new user (created a little over a week ago -- possibly a sock puppet), arrived out of nowhere and began making significant and controversial changes to the article, ignoring the ongoing discussion. As might be expected, the focus has been removed from the dialogue, and is now almost entirely centered on That's Hot's changes. There have already been numerous back-and-forth reverts and many of the cooler-headed editors are absent. It would be very helpful if a neutral person, or someone with a cool head, might hang around for a bit and monitor things or offer a few mediating words. Dropping a note on <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThat%27sHot_f7b9.html" title="User talk:That'sHot">That'sHot's talk page</a> might help, too.

<p>I also find it amazing that we warn users without a second thought, but the past two times I've warned an admin, a big blow up occurs. No wonder I've seen so many complaints about admins being able to do what ever they want. From what I've seen, argue with an admin about content and it's all diplomatic and attempts at a peaceful resolution. However warn them about conduct and it turns into a schoolyard (as Dbachmann said). To be honest, this is nothing more than bullying as shown by Jayjg's smart ass remarks. Even if I haven't been that diplomatic, the admins here have definately not made any attempts to resolve the situation, but instead keep trying to make their point without budging. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Cyr_2f7a.html" title="User:Paul Cyr">Paul Cyr</a> 19:21, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>For what it's worth, telling someone to stop "being a dick" (whether this links to <a href="../../../d/i/c/WP%7EDICK_0b34.html" title="WP:DICK">WP:DICK</a> or not) <i>is</i> a kind of personal attack, and at the least <i>is</i> uncivil. Linking to project pages doesn't mean you don't have to be polite. I think, given that Jayjg is an admin, and could have taken action himself, reporting you to the noticeboard is totally appropriate: that means that someone ELSE should be the one to decide on any action. It's even a better idea than <i>warning</i> you himself, which would escalate your conflict, whatever it is. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 19:27, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yep it was probably a bit incivil, but hey, it's ok for the admin I was talking to to keep harrassing me after telling me to stop harrassing him, it's ok for Jayjg to make smart ass comments, it's ok for a user who has been given barnstars by other admins and thanked for his work to be called a troll by another admin, why?

<dd>You would do well to stop making false accusations about me and twisting the facts of the matter. You would also do well to remember that the purpose of Wikipedia is to write an encyclopaedia. We need people to write an encyclopaedia. We don't need professional scolds. Try contributing to the encyclopaedia for a while instead of filing spurious complaints against people. Also, if you stopped doing exactly what you scold people for doing, people might take you seriously. Instead, you engage in personal attacks while issuing NPA warnings, you complain when people archive their talk pages without it being to your liking, but delete warning on <i>your</i> talk page (while calling people liars), you complain about people deleting complaints from WP:PAIN, but you delete complaints against you, you engage in bullying, and complain that people are bullying you. Try making edits to the Main namespace, and people might take you seriously. Whatever you do, <i>at the very least</i> try <b>not</b> doing what you scold other people about. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a>

<dd>Something I just found out. I recently (today actually) found a link to a site called The Wikipedia Review. From what I've seen, the site's objective is to criticise Wikipedia. To me, that in itself makes me take it with a heavy grain of salt. However from reading some parts on that site and some of the links on there to certian "events" on Wikipedia, apparently Slim, Felonious and Jayjg have been heavily critisised for certain actions (some of the links to Wikipedia were rather interesting), so whether or not most of the site is trash, some of the stuff it brings up gives me pause. In fact it's actually helping restore my faith in WP admins, as now I know what happened above is apparently not an isolated incident, that the admins involved have some sort of connection with each other, and the users here who were not mentioned on The Wikipedia Review, are ones who have tried pacify this situation. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Cyr_2f7a.html" title="User:Paul Cyr">Paul Cyr</a> 00:31, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I concur with Tom Harrison and others: the problem, such as it is, is that the publications are placed in "References," when they weren't cited, rather than "Bibliography." It's probably good to ask the user to either actually insert citations and add to references or add only to a Bibliography. Personally, I wish we <i>did</i> employ bibliographies more, as I may only cite a couple of omnibus publications in an article but wish that readers were aware of other cool articles and sources. We have no problem with uncited "External links," so we ought to approach "Bibliography" the same way. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:47, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Would someone be willing to review <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorton_devonshire_9599.html" title="User:Morton devonshire">Morton Devonshire</a>?

<p>Morton Devonshire edits controversial subjects but he is <b>not</b> disruptive. He passionately fights POV pushing articles (like the one cited by rootology) and supporters of the article disagree. There maybe content disagreements but there is no actionable item for administrators. rootology needs to take content disputes to mediators or the Arbitration Committee, but Morton Devonshire is just making sure that articles are sourced properly and have a neutral POV. In the case that rootology listed, it appears that rootology had rv'd a completely different editors version. Not sure how he can complain that multiple editors versions' are disruptive when the objective is consensus. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 03:33, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Okay Gents, I promise to tone down the mockery -- except for Truthiness -- if you can't mock Truthiness, a term that Stephen Colbert uses to mock people who use the term, then what can you mock? Get real. "Truthiness" As far as not editing articles, sorry, I won't agree to do that. I know certain editors would like me to go away, but that isn't going to happen.

<dd>Well, I don't refer to Wikipedians when I use that term. I mock persons outside of Wikipedia who use that term.

<dd>Simple cases of vandalism? Did you look up the supposed personal attack, and the exchange between the users...? It's not vandalism for a good-faith editor to remove dubious warnings.

<dd>The edit you refer to does not qualify as a personal attack, American Patriot, and as you must be aware, the user himself regretted the strong wording and removed it. (Thanks, Anchoress, yes, exactly.) Your warning was illegitimate and self-interested. Your edit warring to keep it on his page was harassment. Anyway, what is this vengeful activity <i>for</i>? If Jasper removes a warning, Jasper has seen it. That was what it was for, wasn't it? What more do you want? Thank you for posting on this page and making admins aware of what was going on. Now just stop. Mr Lefty, no, I appreciate your excellent intentions, but this is not a bona fide use of warning templates. Also it's the tired old assumption that using a template, per se, somehow means it's virtuous to edit war on another person's talkpage. Wrong. Maybe he shouldn't have done the blanking, but if you follow the whole dialogue, you can see that he's taking the warnings seriously and getting stressed out and frustrated, so I can't say I blame him. Anyway, it's his page, he can blank it--remember, it did <i>not</i> contain any legitimate warnings, or anything else that Wikipedia needs to force him to keep in view. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 02:19, 17 August 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<p>(deindent) I've just waded through the entire history of the Afd for Zapatista and the recent history of Jasper23's talk page. Note that the outburst on the AfD took place on 10 August -- that's a week ago, folks -- and the edit warring on Jasper's talk page has kept up since then. I don't have a problem with the initial NPA warning. Jasper23 knew his words were heated, and undid them. Warring to keep the warning tags - and then to keep the warning tags about removing the warning tags, etc, isn't right. My view, we should fight to keep tags only in the same cases where we're likely to report someone to <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>. Then and only then is speed really an issue. In all other cases, any blocks to be issues <i>need</i> to be done with deliberation anyway; and that deliberation demands that the actual history of the event be investigated, not just what's on someone's talk page at the moment. So -- once it is clear that there isn't active vandalism in progress from an account, don't edit war over the tags. Yes, I know this doesn't mesh up with whatever the proposed policy <i>de jour</i> is. Let common sense rule. The goal is not to "bag" people, to get them in enough trouble to block. The goal is to help people, and build an encyclopedia. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 03:06, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just to add a note of explanation, I am well aware that the box on that page did not signify that it should be deleted. I was using tabbed browsing last night in Windows IE7, which I never use.

As I result, I simply clicked the wrong button and deleted the template page.

<dd>I think you'll find that most legal jurisdictions to indeed distinguish between credible threats and "threats" that are plainly not meant to be taken seriously.

<p>We've corresponded, and he apologized for the message. I don't think he thought it through, and we've discussed the importance of thinking these things out. He's a teenager, and we all did dumb things when we were teens. The important thing is whether we learned from 'em. I'm now confident that there was no real physical threat intended (unless he's a master bullshit artist) and I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. Consider the matter closed. For the folks that said "ignore it", a note, I've got children, and when you've got something that looks to be a threat against your actual, non-metaphorical children, it's a bit more serious than a casual "I'll hit you so hard your kids will be born dizzy".

<p>If someone says "I'm going to throw a bear on your head and eat your mother's lungs for supper" it isn't really a threat.

<li>I've protected the deleted page too, since it seems to have been re-created at least 7 times. For what it's worth, I think the original threat certainly warrants a block, especially since it's toward Chairboy's children. If the user had a complaint, there's any number of ways they could have dealt with it. Physically threatening someone's children is never okay. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 20:09, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>User has linkspammed links to his website, <a href="http://www.isurvived.org" class="external text" title="http://www.isurvived.org" rel="nofollow">isurvived.org</a>, which promotes a minority viewpoint on many Holocaust-related topics. He has made many unhelpful, bad-faith edits to <a href="../../../h/i/r/Hiram_Bingham_IV_b043.html" title="Hiram Bingham IV">Hiram Bingham IV</a>, attempting to portray him in a negative light. He has reverted edits, which I had given reasoning for on <a href="../../../h/i/r/Talk%7EHiram_Bingham_IV_fe13.html" title="Talk:Hiram Bingham IV">the talk page</a> without explanation several times. He has made zero contributions other than those trying to promote his website, a clear single-purpose account. I am perfectly willing to "clean up" his damage (remove isurvived.org links, revert his minority POV additions such as those at <a href="../../../h/i/r/Hiram_Bingham_IV_b043.html" title="Hiram Bingham IV">Hiram Bingham IV</a>, and an already-reverted edit to <a href="../../../h/i/r/Hiram_Bingham_III_1074.html" title="Hiram Bingham III">Hiram Bingham III</a>); however, I want to make sure that this is an appropriate course of action. I also am quite certain he will reinstate all the links afterward, so I do not think it will be enough. I brought attention to him earlier on the noticeboard, but the only response was an editor offering to remove his spammed links (although he did not), and I do not believe that will be enough anyway. -<a href="../../../e/l/m/User%7EElmer_Clark_37e1.html" title="User:Elmer Clark">Elmer Clark</a> 09:47, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The other thing I noticed is that your account is only 7 days old or so, and there may be things about Deskana's action which seem wrong or unusual to a new user but which in fact are quite ordinary. So definitely try talking to him first. Regarding points 3 and 4, Deskana was promoted in May after a discussion in which 54 users approved of him being granted adminship and only 2 opposed, so the wikipedia community has already decided that those aren't important considerations. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131 (talk)</a> 13:58, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This user came to my attention today because he made a separate page for <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karen_Carpenter_c4a3.html" title="Karen Carpenter">Karen Carpenter</a>, which was a redirect to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Carpenters_ea28.html" title="The Carpenters">The Carpenters</a>, and it showed up on #vandalism-en-wp. I checked the page and it looked like a copyvio to me, and sure enough it was - taken verbatim from the Internet Movie Database.</p>
<p>I reverted it back to a redirect page, then went to notify him, but it seems like this is SOP for Paul Arnott. He's got warning after warning after warning for copyvio problems, mostly local news anchors that he kept recreating after they were deleted. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMets501_2e06.html" title="User:Mets501">Mets501</a> blocked him for 24 hours on August 14, but that apparently hasn't fazed him at all.
