<dd>user:BZ(Bruno Zollinger) has been banned form the German Language Wikipedia because of his comments on the article <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diskussion:Hermann_G%C3%B6ring#Erw.C3.A4hnenswertes" class="external text" title="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diskussion:Hermann_G%C3%B6ring#Erw.C3.A4hnenswertes" rel="nofollow">Hermann Göring</a>, among others. He has never done any edit in an article. He is seemingly less agressive in his tone in the English Language Wikipedia, but this is simply because he doesn't want to get kicked out of it as of the GLW, which would prevent him from chatting on his talk page. In the GLW, he tends to be provocative and sometimes offensive. When posting his messages on the talk page, he intents to provoke the author to answer him and then to increasingly criticize what had been said. Please don't allow him to display his behavior here any more. 67.172.157.35 04:23, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Please note that there is a big argument going in the page of <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Gulf_06b2.html" title="Persian Gulf">Persian Gulf</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Gulf_naming_dispute_532d.html" title="Persian Gulf naming dispute">Persian Gulf naming dispute</a> on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Some Iranian users are trying to eliminate any minor information indicating that it is translated to “the Arabian Gulf” in Arabic language, or even it could be also called the Arabian Gulf according to some medieval maps and documents. If this term is disputed then it is <b>controversial</b> issue and <b>has not been solved</b>. As many old references and maps saying it is “Persian Gulf”, also dozens of historical maps and documents saying it is the “Arabian Gulf”<a href="http://mapmogul.com/catalog/product_info.php+manufacturers_id+10+products_id+235" class="external autonumber" title="http://mapmogul.com/catalog/product_info.php+manufacturers_id+10+products_id+235" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> <a href="http://www.betzmaps.com/AS-155.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.betzmaps.com/AS-155.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> <a href="http://www.betzmaps.com/AS-161.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.betzmaps.com/AS-161.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> <a href="http://www.arabiangulfmaps.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.arabiangulfmaps.com/" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> that is long time before 1960's as our colleagues indicate <i>it is the time of using Arabian Gulf by Gamal Abde Nasser</i>.</p>
<p>In its discussion page, long talk and hot debate has been running since long time. But the major point that users editing this page are writing its translated name in a way not used, or even found, in the Arab world which oscillates this geopolitical issue through Wikipedia pages.</p>
<p>Please note that <b>الخليج الفارسي</b> means Persian Gulf, while <b>الخليج العربي</b> mean Arabian Gulf (it could be not easy for you to distinguish anyway as letters looks similar, but actually different, could be like similarity between English and Spanish). However, Persian language is basically different from Arabic.</p>
<p>In 1977, the third UN Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names (UNCSGN) adopted resolution III/20 entitled "Names of Features beyond a Single Sovereignty". The resolution recommended:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>"when countries sharing a given geographical feature do not agree on a common name, it should be a general rule of</i> cartography that the name used by each of the countries concerned will be accepted. A policy of accepting only one or some of such names while excluding the rest would be inconsistent as well as inexpedient in practice."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is so witty and meaningless if one Persian user in Wiki has basics in Arabic and change names as he like in a bigotry way!</p>
<p>It is not accepted, in any way, to translate/transcribe a name from one language to another according to unidirectional transcription system and giving it a translated name not –basically- used in that language for the sake of political domination.</p>
<p>No one will accept deleting all used names for the <b>Danube River</b> pages on Wikipedia in all other Central European languages and adopt what just the Germans or Czechs only used to call! and so on… These are different languages and cultures, and have their own nominations for interlaced territories/resources/rivers/water bodies... etc.</p>
<p>The major concept adopted here by Wikipedia will open the way for other users to entitle (or rename) new pages or modify information according to their own political background using their own language to change names in other language(s). Like a French Wiki user can speak English go and delete any word of the “<b>English Channel</b>” on English Wikipedia and replace it with “<b>Sea of Manch</b>” or a British Wiki user French basics do the same and replace all “<b>La Manche</b>” with “<b>Canal Anglais</b>”! or a Muslim user changes all pages entitled “<b>God</b>” in all languages to “<b>Allah</b>”!</p>

Please turn their attention to follow rules of Wikipedia editing and not to keep reverting additions by others without any discussion or voting. You may notice in pages history how many times they undo edits of the pages without describing minimum reasonable reason. Some of them has been warned of offensive use and vandalizing pages. You may also remind them that such violation of national geopolitical name could lead to a serious international juridical issue against Wikipedia’s users and management. Adopting fake and non-approved names in official language(s) of some countries could lead to significant political conflict lead by Arabic-speaking countries, mainly Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, UAE, Qatar, Oman and Iraq as they are sharing this water body with Iran as it is an oriented propaganda shouldn’t be lead by you, Wikipedia. Violating terms in other languages to achieve political aims is irresponsible behavior. Faking territorial names for political purposes could fall under threatening national security, illegal translation and offensive use of internet, that can cause international conflict if not indicating real term used in mentioned language. Wikipedia will be mainly responsible for the behavior and actions of its registered members.</p>
<p>On the other side, no one will blame Wikipedia, only in its Persian version, for adopting names used in Persian language.</p>
<p>Please direct them not to play geopolitical-linguistic games in Wikipedia and to stop undoing other people's edits repeatedly without voting or discussing the page. This is really not accepted and not convenient for Wikipedia’s atmosphere. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERalhazzaa_8126.html" title="User:Ralhazzaa">Ralhazzaa</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERalhazzaa_79bc.html" title="User talk:Ralhazzaa">talk</a></sup> 17:57, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Um...The last edit I made to the Persian Gulf article was on the 13th of January, and that was to take the article back to the version that was agreed upon on the talk page by the vast majority. The last edit I made to the Persian Gulf naming dispute was on the 17th of January, which again had to do with the talk that was going on in the Persian Gulf. I dont know who drew my name out of the pot...Are you sure you have the right Azerbaijani?

<dd>Again, more false accusations (you can try hard Adil, but it wont work). The Arbcom injuction is for REVERTS, not edits (you know this very well, as you ahve the injunction on your very own talk page and have read it yourself). Here is where you can read the Arbcom injunction:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Azerbaijani#Notice_of_Arbitration_Committee_injunction" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Azerbaijani#Notice_of_Arbitration_Committee_injunction" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> It clearly states: <i>Until the conclusion of this case, all parties are restricted to one content revert per article per day, <u>and each content <b>revert</b> must be accompanied by a justification on the relevant talk page</u>.</i> I did not revert your edits (reverting your edits means that I must have deleting the entire quote that you added!), I simply removed something which you had typed int he quote which was not in the original quote. I reverted none of your edit. Here is the diff of the version before your edits and my edit: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ganja_khanate&amp;diff=115928170&amp;oldid=102068430" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ganja_khanate&amp;diff=115928170&amp;oldid=102068430" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> If I had made a content revert, which I did not, my version would look exactly the same as Aivazovsky version! Does that look like a revert to you Adil, because it certainly doesnt fit into the definition of what a revert is. I'm really getting sick and tired of your personal attacks, your stalking, and your campaign of trying to demonize me on Wikipedia using false information.<a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">Azerbaijani</a> 04:13, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your wikilawyering is not constructive, Azerbaijani. A revert is any action which undoes the work of another editor, and removing content added by another editor - even if you just remove one word of it - is a revert. You certainly don't have to undo every change made in a given edit, or restore a particular old revision, to have made a revert.</dd>
<dd>You are both treading a fine line. Any more reverts contrary to the injunction will result in blocks. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a>&#160;(<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 10:15, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello there fellow wikipedians (yes, that includes you Administrators). I have a complaint (duh!)</p>
<p>For the past day now (yeah 24 straight hours, can you believe it?), i have been trying to figure out why a <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragon_Ball_Z_eb3c.html" title="Dragon Ball Z">Dragon Ball Z</a> <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fictional_character.html" title="Fictional character">character</a> by the name of <a href="../../../v/e/g/Vegetto.html" title="Vegetto">Vegetto</a> does not have his own article. My first step was to take the initative and create the article. My first attempt was disrupted by a user by the name of <a href="../../../t/t/n/User%7ETTN_1fb9.html" title="User:TTN">Nemu</a>. Nemu immediately redirected the article which i was willingly working on, and told me on the <a href="../../../v/e/g/Talk%7EVegetto_9e98.html" title="Talk:Vegetto">Vegetto Talk Page</a> that, "<i>because nobody disputed it being an article, the unanimous decision was that it would never becoming an article <b>EVER!</b></i>" So hence, the redirection.</p>
<p>So what's my case? I would like to write the Vegetto article. However, i have been consistently stopped. Users on the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Dragon_Ball_4003.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Dragon Ball">Dragon Ball Project</a> have all told me that "<i>you will never be able to create the Vegetto article, because they all said so</i>". Even though i have tried to discuss the situation (peacefully at first) many of them, especially Nemu, have insulted and ridiculed me. Now i'm not sure as to why they do this, maybe because their numbers far exceed my own (and i mean it literally, i am by myself) or that i'm just a "new guy" so why should they give a damn?</p>
<p>I would like to report this incidednt, because i feel voilated the priviledge of being given the freedom to express my knowledge on a certain subject. I should not be judged and be mis-understood because of the failures of past users. I kindly ask for the dedicated time of an Administrator, to check this situation out.</p>
<p>For further investigation, Visit <a href="../../../v/e/g/Talk%7EVegetto_9e98.html#Let.27s_Think_before_we_act" title="Talk:Vegetto">Here</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Dragon_Ball_4918.html#Redirection_of_the_Vegetto_Article" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Dragon Ball">Here</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/w/Wikipedia%7ENew_contributors%27_help_page_6291.html#Reporting_a_User_or_an_Action" title="Wikipedia:New contributors' help page">Here</a>.</p>

<dd>I'm sorry, this is a content issue, not an administrative problem. This does not belong here.</dd>
<dd>On the merits, I think you are mistaken about how Wikipedia works. A user has pointed you to an extended discussion, the consensus result of which was to merge this character description into another article. This is also what our guideline <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> says: 'Minor characters (and places, concepts, etc.) in a work of fiction should be merged with short descriptions into a "List of characters.'" On Wikipedia, you <i>must</i> work within <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECON_c65b.html" title="WP:CON">consensus</a>; you <i>do not</i> have "the freedom to express my knowledge on a certain subject". If you want to do that, please do it on your own blog or website. In this case, you must first engage your fellow editors in discussion, persuading them to change consensus, and only then may you create this article. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 07:31, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>But does that also mean that i have to work with the them all. Are you saying the presence of an article is impossible? You say that i have to discusss the matter with my fellow contributors. How can i do anything when they will refuse to listen? Also, it seems that everyone around here has come to some sort of agreement that this character is a "minor" case, i do not understand why? I mean, talk to me here! I still need some kind of recommendation for the entire situation. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGooden_fc9c.html" title="User:Gooden">Gooden</a> 14:28, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>My sincere recommendation is: accept that you are alone with your view - that's quite clear from the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Dragon_Ball_4918.html#Redirection_of_the_Vegetto_Article" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Dragon Ball">long discussion here</a> -, forget about it and find something else to edit. That is enough now for this noticeboard. Do not edit this thread further. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 17:56, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This doesn't appear to be vandalism, so I'm posting it here rather than on a vandalism-specific board. <a href="../../../n/u/k/User%7ENuklear_f5aa.html" title="User:Nuklear">User:Nuklear</a> has made several hundred edits to <a href="../../../o/h/m/Ohmefentanyl.html" title="Ohmefentanyl">Ohmefentanyl</a> over the last few days. These edits mostly seem innocuous, but some seem to be problematic, inserting text like "The author has personally bioassayed (±)-OMF2 but is disappointed that not more physical data was made available" and "The founder of Hochemicals© is the overall master of the totalitarian dictatorship regime. This important &amp; extremely fundamental principle will become deeply embedded in the readers mind, his thoughts, his ideas &amp; his daily philosophy. —Immediate &amp; generous capital payments must be donated to his lordship, on the double, without any precondition whatsoever. Failure to comply will most definitely lead to draconian measures being taken, likely resulting in death (though not to oneself), without any remorse, or reconnaissance of any description."</p>
<p>I'm concerned that, among other things, the article is being turned surreptitiously into a manual for drug manufacturers to produce this substance with the intent to use it as a narcotic. Content that suggests this to me includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>"It will become apparent to the reader in later sections that there are important and complex distinctions that can be drawn between the subsequent isomers through studying their pharmacology."</li>
<li>"HC1abcd is the Hochemicals© code for the four most active isomers of 23HOMeF." (see information on Hochemicals <a href="http://www.alibaba.com/company/10545270.html" class="external text" title="http://www.alibaba.com/company/10545270.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://feedback.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewFeedback2&amp;userid=hochemicals&amp;ftab=AllFeedback" class="external text" title="http://feedback.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewFeedback2&amp;userid=hochemicals&amp;ftab=AllFeedback" rel="nofollow">here</a>; it seems to me to be a somewhat dubious organization)</li>
<li>"HC-1a is already 13K x stronger than morphine. If a p-fluoro atom is then incorporated into the phenethanol tail, the resultant compound has recently been reported to have a potency of 18K x morphine!&#160;;-)"</li>
<li>"Professor Q speculates that "there is a good chance that this compound could be made more powerful still, [...] Even if ED50 doesn't go any lower, one would expect duration of action to increase by a factor of three or so...""</li>
<li>"Those skilled in the art will also acknowledge that these formulations are representative of so-called prodrugs"</li>
<li>"However in a real-world environment, the dosage [of <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carfentanil.html" title="Carfentanil">carfentanil</a>] is so vanishingly small that it is difficult not to overdose even if one is careful; Although it must be conceeded that opiate naïve individuals are at magnified risk, in the event of exposure, relative to hardened addicts who may already have significant tolerance."</li>
<li>"Introduction of an α-Me into this molecule would probably compliment it nicely. It will also be apparent to the veteran narcologist, that organometallic addition of XMEt to the direct product of the Strecker synthesis gives a pharmacophore common, to both methadone and ketobemidone. Such SAR overlap is thus likely and might be expected to have a favorable outcome with regards to creating unexplored agents with a longer duration."</li>

<li><b>Answer</b> I'm not sure what's going on with you, but you have been shooting a lot of venom around lately. The Cut/Pasted info from Nesbit's page has been RESOLVED. There is no sock puppetry, and there is no identity theft, and it CERTAINLY has nothing to do with the FAC. You have gone through great lengths to derail the whole FA process, and I'm not sure why. You have made personal attacks against me and I don't know why you have done that either. If I had known that nominating a page for FA would have invited the attention of a stalker-type, I would never have done it. This entire experience has taken all of the fun out of Wiki for me, and I'll certainly never nominate another page again. <a href="../../../s/u/e/User%7ESue_Rangell_e1b6.html" title="User:Sue Rangell">Sue Rangell</a><sup class="noprint">[<a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">citation needed</span></i></a>]</sup> 19:31, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Right. I'm afraid this one's a little complicated.</p>
<p>I was going through the Homeopathy-related articles after seeing everyone talking about POV forks but doing nothing about it. By talking with the people on <a href="../../../h/o/m/Talk%7EHomeopathy_15b1.html" title="Talk:Homeopathy">Talk:Homeopathy</a> I tried to make sure I had a brake, and didn't do anything too foolish. A few got deleted, several others were improved to the point that they didn't have to be.</p>
<p>Now, a couple things need mentioned here: Homeopathy-related articles pretty clearly have gone through a certain amount of POV-forking and advertising. For an easy example, take Robin Murphy, ND where, when told he needed to assert notability or have it deleted, he seems to have lied outright about his qualifications. I trimmed the worst bits - which had been marked with fact tags for ages, but he had made claims like "Most well known teacher of homeopathy" when '"Robin Murphy" Homeopathy' plugged into google gets 873 hits. Um, should probably be mentioned that that's a PROD, so it'll probably be gone sometime tomorrow, unless someone deletes the prod tag, in which case I'll put it up for AfD.</p>
<p>There were other problems elsewhere, but many of them were fixable - <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_important_homeopaths.html" title="List of important homeopaths">List of important homeopaths</a> got a title change, a trim of a long list of homeopaths without either articles, cites, or assertations of notability (It was in two categories: "Generally considered influential" and "Other known homeopaths" - you can see the problem of the last bit. Robin Murphy, ND, by the way, had been added to influential.</p>
<p>Now, this leads us to the problem. <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Vithoulkas_c798.html" title="George Vithoulkas">George Vithoulkas</a> was a terrible article, with long list. I'll quote a bit of the old article in a footnote.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> It was a long list of searches, all of which are not for his full name, but just for his surname, with no qualifier. I found this highly suspicious - he's surely not the only Vithoulkas - and suspected the results were being gamed. It also made some quite extrordinary claims about governments showering him with awards, more of which anon. It wasn't very well cited, which something with that many extraordinary claims needed, so I nominated it for deletion.</p>
<p>However, huge numbers of new editors invaded the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_George_Vithoulkas_9cb6.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/George Vithoulkas">AFD</a> and its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Articles_for_deletion/George_Vithoulkas&amp;direction=prev&amp;oldid=115788271" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Articles_for_deletion/George_Vithoulkas&amp;direction=prev&amp;oldid=115788271" rel="nofollow">talk page</a>. If you'll scroll forward an edit from there, you'll see my possibly misguided attempt to end the attacks on me there, followed by Guettarda simply archiving the whole. Skinwalker pointed out to me that there had been canvassing on homeopathic forums - <a href="http://hpathy.com/homeopathyforums/forum_posts.asp?TID=5641&amp;PN=1" class="external text" title="http://hpathy.com/homeopathyforums/forum_posts.asp?TID=5641&amp;PN=1" rel="nofollow">Here</a> and <a href="http://hpathy.com/homeopathyforums/forum_posts.asp?TID=5640&amp;PN=1" class="external text" title="http://hpathy.com/homeopathyforums/forum_posts.asp?TID=5640&amp;PN=1" rel="nofollow">here</a> - possibly elsewhere, but not until after I had put up a request for checkuser to try and figure out what was going on (which I should probably close now, as it's probable they aren't all the same person).</p>
<p>I think I'm getting slightly ahead of myself. I discovered the George Vithoulkas page was a copyvio while trying to research claims made to me about him, and so deleted it. It wasn't extreme copy vio - no sentence stood unchanged, but there was a very telling sentence order, and pretty clear evidence that the opening of the sentence was simply tweaked a bit to make it a little different. The farther back in the history, the worse things got, back to an edit labelled "fix copyvio", before which it was straight copyvio. I did the only thing that seemed sensible: deleted the page, closed the AfD, asked on the Talk:Homeopathy page if it should be recreated.</p>
<p><a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeHunter_0ab1.html" title="User:LeeHunter">User:LeeHunter</a> at this point gave the third of three nasty messages to my talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAdam_Cuerden%2FArchive2&amp;diff=114184829&amp;oldid=114176702" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAdam_Cuerden%2FArchive2&amp;diff=114184829&amp;oldid=114176702" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> accusing me of "abusing the process to delete the article". I, I hope politely, pointed out I had already asked on the Talk:Homeopathy page whether it should be recreated, and he made a short article on Vithoulkas.</p>
<p>At that point, the <a href="../../../h/o/m/Talk%7EHomeopathy_15b1.html" title="Talk:Homeopathy">Talk:Homeopathy</a> page promptly went to hell, becoming devoted entirely to bashing and abusing me. It's been archived, but is all available <a href="../../../h/o/m/Talk%7EHomeopathy_Archive_13_fda7.html#George_Vithoulkas" title="Talk:Homeopathy/Archive 13">here</a>.</p>
<p>User:Homeopathic, who is strongly related to George Vithoulkas, if <a href="../../../g/e/o/Image%7EGeorge_vithoulkas_smallpicture.jpg_9b02.html" title="Image:George vithoulkas smallpicture.jpg">Image:George_vithoulkas_smallpicture.jpg</a>'s copyright label is any guide, was the worst attacker. He also doesn't sign his posts, so I'm afraid some digging in the archive of <a href="../../../h/o/m/Talk%7EHomeopathy_15b1.html" title="Talk:Homeopathy">Talk:Homeopathy</a> is necessary to prove connection. Among his gripes with me is after one of the meatpuppets called the Speaker of the Swedish Parliament on a video of George Vithoulkas getting an award there "Ms. Rikstag" or something like that, I checked to find out her proper name. Unfortunately, the speaker at the time that the video being placed as evidence took place was a man, so it's pretty clear that the video either mislabelled the woman, or, if my rather poor ability to identify faces is correct, combined a video of the female speaker from several years earlier praising the award he got and saying the Swedish Parliament supported it with the video several years later, also in the Swedish Parliament building, of Vithoulkas getting the award. The faces seem to match.</p>
<p>This is an important claim, because without that speech, there's no strong swedish parliament connection outside of building, which was one of the things they were making huge numbers of personal attacks on me about.</p>
<p>I quote the last two posts before Guettardsa atchived it:</p>
<p><i>I want to suggest something. Adam Cuerden must not be editor of wikipedia any more!!!!!He is prejudiced and wikipedia doesn't need people that forge the truth. So, please I call you to VOTE: Adam Cuerden must not be editor of Wikipedia any more. Do you agree? YES or NO? Althea Khun</i></p>

Reset the block, and leave a message to the IP talking about the consequences of continuous block evasion?

<dd>I'd agree that we shouldn't do that sort of thing blindly -- at least make sure the person's story checks out, WHOIS the IP and such. In this case, it looks like the IP was shared and the story at least makes sense. I see it's been given month-long blocks, previously and not too long ago. We should be wary of these requests, though, I'd hate to see some random person wander in, tag some random dynamic home ISP's IP as shared, and get it blocked for six months because "the school admins asked."&#160;:x – <span style="font-family: Garamond"><a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELuna_Santin_1cab.html" title="User:Luna Santin"><font color="#1E90FF"><b>Luna Santin</b></font></a> (<a href="../../../l/u/n/User_talk%7ELuna_Santin_c747.html" title="User talk:Luna Santin">talk</a>)</span> 23:09, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, there are many problems. First, the user <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_g2s_b24e.html" title="User:Ed g2s">ed g2s</a> has been deleting images from the Evanescence articles, because according to him the use of album cover images violates thes Fair use criteria. This is totally fake, and it can be proved. <a href="../../../n/i/r/Nirvana_%28band%29.html" title="Nirvana (band)">Nirvana (band)</a> and <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nightwish.html" title="Nightwish">Nightwish</a> have images of album covers, and these articles are Featured articles. If the use use of album cover images is forbidden, then these articles would never have passed the FA. Now, he is also contradicting himself, because he has also deleted an logo ([[:Image:Evanescence early.png, an earlier logo of the band). Logo are not album covers, so...? He has deleted it with no reasons. The only thing he said was that the use of the images hasn't been discussed. What's that??</p>
<p>Some edits he made (deleting images):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Evanescence&amp;diff=115134138&amp;oldid=115095667" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Evanescence&amp;diff=115134138&amp;oldid=115095667" rel="nofollow">14:42, March 14, 2007</a></li>

</ul>
<p>Another problem is that he has nominated an free-use image created by me, <a href="../../../e/v/-/Image%7EEV-In.svg_4e0a.html" title="Image:EV-In.svg">Image:EV-In.svg</a>, with a very vague reason. He says this is a derivated work of the Evanescence logo. It would be a derivated logo if I would have copied the Evanescence logo and added something like some lines or whatever. Here's the <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImages_and_media_for_deletion_2007_March_12_38ac.html#Image:EV-In.svg" title="Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion/2007 March 12">discussion</a>, but it's going nowhere.</p>
<p>And the last thing, he has tagged the Image:Evlithium1.jpg for deletion. This is a fair-use image, but many of the contributors in the Evanescence articles including me, reached a consensus. (<a href="../../../e/v/a/Talk%7EEvanescence_Archive_2_cc87.html" title="Talk:Evanescence/Archive 2">this</a>.</p>
<p>Also the fair use rationable stated the reasons why we are using a fair-use image by now.</p>
<div style="font-size:85%">No free equivalent is available or could be created that would adequately give the same information. While Evanescence is a very popular band and would probably be easier to get user-created pictures of than most, the fact remains that in general it's incredibly difficult to get good free use images of bands. The reasons are two-fold: the majority of user-contributed images are going to be from 1) dark concerts with bad lighting, where the band is spread across the stage and difficult to see, or 2) individual members posing with a fan. Highly unlikely that a decent picture of <i>just the band</i> outside of a concert setting could be found. (Check the fair use rationable for more reasons).</div>
<p>You should also check this <a href="../../../a/r/m/User_talk%7EArmando12_6440.html#Evanescence_main_article" title="User talk:Armando12">discussion</a>.</p>
<p>I really don't understand his reasons. I can even compare the fair use rationable of the main image of Nirvana (FA) with the rationable of the Evanescence (GA) rationable. The Evanescence images is very very very detailed.</p>
<p>Well, I hope these problems end and we can continue our Wikipedian lives normally... <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmando12_bd10.html" title="User:Armando12"><font color="#276394">Armando.O</font></a><sup><a href="../../../a/r/m/User_talk%7EArmando12_6440.html" title="User talk:Armando12"><font color="#2C518F">talk</font></a> • <a href="../../../e/v/_/WP%7EEV_8e07.html" title="WP:EV"><font color="#2C518F">Ev</font></a></sup> 16:36, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ed could have handled this better, but I don't think any of his actions violate policy. The fair use rationale is weak. If there are copyvios on the Nirvana page they should be removed, not used for justification for other copyrighted content. Since Carnildo stopped spending time on WP:FAC, these things have not been checked as thoroughly as they should. <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorisblue_1bc2.html" title="User:Borisblue">Borisblue</a> 21:14, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As for the logo currently on the page, I believe that there is enough grounds for it to be used, but you should remove the CC- tag and add a fair use rationale. Even though you made the image yourself, it's a copy of the copyrighted logo so you can't release it under creative commons. <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorisblue_1bc2.html" title="User:Borisblue">Borisblue</a> 21:18, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am a bit puzzled by this chap. His user page seems to indicate he's an admin, yet his edits are practically zero and those he's done are sometimes un-admin-ish to coin a phrase.

<dd>This debate has been going on for what, 30 minutes and Just H already listed it? This request does definately not belong here. Just H is overreacting because I referred to some poorly sourced stuff he inserted into the article as "bullshit". While I realise that was not the most civil thing to do, WP:A spade is a... Of course, that's not an excuse, I should have been more careful. Then again, his edits are honestly not helpful to the article and he hasn't provided anything resembling a reliable source. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan_e4e7.html" title="User:Mackan">Mackan</a> 20:20, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't see a much of an issue here regarding incivility. Mackan does, however, seem to be right in saying that the disputed content fails <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>.

<dl>
<dd>Steel, is there a way we can convince Mackan to use his expertise to assist in developing that aspect of the article? I do not have his expertise, but I am curious about the sub-subject at hand. Also, if Wikipedia does not consider Wikipedia a notable source, what does that tell you? <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_H_c9c6.html" title="User:Just H">Just H</a><sup><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Just_H_4_bcbb.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Just H 4">editor review</a></sup> 20:35, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

While cascading semi and move protection allows non-admins to fully protect pages by transcluding them, on high profile pages like the day's FA this is going to be noticed and reverted pretty swiftly. – <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteel359_41ed.html" title="User:Steel359">Steel</a> 02:41, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>There may be already, but how about: there is basically an exact copy of Uranium, as say Wikipedia:Mainpage article/Date, and then a cascade protected Wikipedia:Mainpage article, which transcludes the current day's subpage. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProdego_6b33.html" title="User:Prodego"><font color="darkgreen"><i>Prodego</i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProdego_ff0b.html" title="User talk:Prodego"><font color="darkgreen">talk</font></a></sup> 02:43, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>As I understand it, the idea is to have a copy of the article somewhere else to cascade protect.

<dd>Goodness, I can't get a word in here (the edit conflict bug needs to be fixed). Anyway, Prodego means that if a new template is added to <a href="../../../u/r/a/Uranium.html" title="Uranium">Uranium</a>, the secondary page could have the updated page substed onto it.

<dd>You. I mean that any way to protect transcludes, and not the article needs to be coded, and allows anyone to protect a page by transcluding it.

<p>Ok, trying to gather everyone's thoughts together after all the edit conflicts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cascade protect the FA.
<dl>
<dd>Pros: Quick and easy, simply enable cascading when the page is move protected.</dd>
<dd>Cons: People could remove templates from the page and vandalise them. The template removal to the FA will get reverted, with a fully protected vandalised template in place. Hilarity ensues.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Prodego's duplicate FA page.
<dl>
<dd>Pros: Doesn't allow non-admins to play about on cascade protected pages, etc.</dd>
<dd>Cons: Requires manual updating every day. In the past, when people have failed to do this, main page pensises resulted.</dd>

<dd>Reality check: it's very rare (i.e. it has never occurred) that a new, appropriate template has been added to TFA and then vandalized.

<p>Can't we combine both options? Have the cascade protection enabled as the default option. Then, once an admin creates the duplicate page, they remove the cascade protection from the FA?

<dd>(Yet another edit conflict) Testing at <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurricane_Nora_%281997%29_d5ba.html" title="Hurricane Nora (1997)">Hurricane Nora (1997)</a>, I saw that if cascading protection works, under the following conditions:

<dd>Yeah, it's on.

<p><i>Background: See <a href="../../../b/l/a/Talk%7EBlack_people_41e8.html" title="Talk:Black people">Talk:Black people</a>. The article is a POV/edit war magnet, and has all the requisite "keep a cool head" boilerplates on the talk page. The article was just speedily kept in an AFD, and that is under review at DRV.</i></p>
<p>Also note, that I'm not involved in any way with the content of the article. I stumbled across the talk page while investigating</p>
<p>The comment in question is left by an IP who wrote: "Where is your comment regarding the existence of the "White People" article? I don't see your comments in that article's discussion page. Where is the request to delete the "White (People)" article in any event? --208.254.174.148"</p>
<p>I see that comment as particularly incivil against another editor who asked an innocuous question regarding why the page exists. I redacted the comment per <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html#Removing_uncivil_comments" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL#Removing_uncivil_comments</a></p>
<p>It's basically reverse racism. Why <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">bite</a> someone for questioning the existence of a <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_people.html" title="Black people">Black people</a> article with "Why you got a problem with black people huh? Why don't you have anything against White people."?</p>
<p>According to WP:CIVIL, "Whereas incivility is roughly defined as personally targeted behavior that causes an atmosphere of greater conflict and stress, "</p>
<p>As well, for removing incivil comments, "Remove offensive comments on talk pages (since they remain in the page history, anyone can find them again or refer to them later on)"</p>
<p>thus, I feel in the right having redacted the comment. However, User:JD2718 does not seem to agree, and is reinstating the redacted content, basically forcing the incivil comment to stay in. I've reverted him once and he's reverted back (the present version).</p>
<p><br />
I'd like a review as to whether I'm in the right in removing this comment, or if JD2718 is correct and the comment should remain. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">⇒</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../c/l/i/WP%7ECLIMBING_ffc5.html" title="WP:CLIMBING"><small><sup>On Belay!</sup></small></a> 05:29, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Generally speaking, removing someone's commrnts should only be done rarely and with consesnus. Obviously if someone reverts you, then you don't have consensus. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> | <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">Taste the Korn</a> 05:52, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Fair enough, but I disagree with your statement that a reversion = lack of consensus. If that was true, any one person could disrupt consensus on any other thing, and there would never be any progress made on wikipedia. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">⇒</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../c/l/i/WP%7ECLIMBING_ffc5.html" title="WP:CLIMBING"><small><sup>On Belay!</sup></small></a> 06:00, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>Justanother accurately portrays my comments and experiences above, but I have since had a bit of interaction with Smee that was much less contentious than indicated there, and that leaves me much more hopeful that a truce, at least, can be reached when dealing with articles of mutual interest to these editors. My surprise at the "abrupt rebuff" turns out to have been partly due to a misunderstanding--I had thought Smee's edit summary saying something to the effect of "don't post on my talk page" was aimed at me, but I now see that he(?) was responding to Justanother--in other words, his response to my offer to help with the problem was fairly non-responsive, but not hostile, as I had originally thought. I later reiterated my offer, which Smee politely declined. I did indeed experience the frustration Justanother talks about when editing <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bridge_%28film%29_68f7.html" title="The Bridge (film)">The Bridge (film)</a> and experiencing Smee's instantaneous reverts of my good faith edit. However, Smee eventually did read my rationale on the talk page, considered the edit, and agreed that not only was it worth allowing to stand for comment, but that it actually did represent a small improvement in the article. So, happy ending. He followed it with some friendly words about my manner as an editor. My sense is that this conflict can be resolved with a mutual agreement to assume good faith and to limit disputes to substantive article changes, allowing others to deal with the small stuff. Both editors are capable of working civily. Justanother clearly wants some sort of mutually acceptible understanding to be brokered; if Smee agrees to some sort of arbitration, formal or otherwise, I think it can. <a href="../../../b/t/f/User%7EBTfromLA_9257.html" title="User:BTfromLA">BTfromLA</a> 06:35, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

From what I've seen there's a content dispute, often over trivial matters, with both sides resorting to trying to get their way through attrition and every so often making a tactical yield to seem reasonable and stay within 3RR. If there's a propagandizing problem, it's resolved with POV tags and RFCs, not edit wars and repetitious AfDs and back-and-forth tattling about which neutral editor W said X about Y. That goes for both of you: whichever one of you is in the right is playing into the hands of the other by burying the issue in back-and-forth so that no one neutral wants to get involved. Perhaps Smee is POV-pushing, but you've made it near-impossible to tell by your conduct.

<dd>While following a few other outlinks, I fell into the tit-for-tat between both of these editors at the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bridge_%28film%29_68f7.html" title="The Bridge (film)">The Bridge (film)</a> article. I find that each editor spends probably 45% of their time undoing the work of the other, another 45% looking for ways to "improve" the article in a way that the other won't like, and the final 10% doing good and useful work. Maybe that's exaggeration, but it is my perception because I have become so exhausted watching the ping-pong and sniping that I have essentially given up on that article, leaving it to them to argue over, and decided to move on to things less stressful. Neither editor is wholly without blame and while Smee's words may be less caustic, his actions are nonetheless just as tiring. My biggest concern with the situation is that it will eventually end up at ArbCom (if it hasn't before, I haven't checked yet). Both users have their trenches dug and are simply hurling their own brands of grenades. <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 14:07, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

<dt>Response by Smee</dt>

<p>I have not edit warred on those particular articles. A merge tag is inappropriate if a majority of editors or even a large minority of editors are opposed to a merge. An AFD is more appropriate, in order to assess consensus for a <b>"Merge"</b> decision. In any rate, this is most certainly not "disruptive" behavior. Incidentally, it seems that this user above is the only user utilizing this word "disruptive" in this situation with regard to other individuals - whereas multiple other individuals have used the word "disruptive" with regard to Justanother's <i>own</i> caustic behavior. In any event, I am removing the page <a href="../../../t/i/l/Tilman_Hausherr_909d.html" title="Tilman Hausherr">Tilman Hausherr</a> from my watchlist. I am also <i>not</i> going to be monitoring this page <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> on my watchlist - so as to avoid conflict and possible baiting into a back and forth discussion with the user in question. I would most appreciated it therefore if an editor (not Justanother) will inform me of how this proceeds. Thank you.

<li>I think someone mentioned the Tilman Hausherr article dispute here. I am new here and still trying to learn some of the rules. I wish someone would look at Tilman's incivil behavior. He has accused me on the Tilman Hausherr disussion page of bad faith because I proposed a merge. His reason, according to him, stems from a edit war in the article Steve Hassan. Before I knew any better I edit wared with Tilman on that article's discussion page. He accused me of lying by omission and propaganda and other things. Could someone look into that and advice me please? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn196920022001_6c9c.html" title="User:John196920022001">John196920022001</a> 10:59, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>On the article 'Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2' these two Wikipedia users are stubbornly and repeatedly erasing any mention of the widespread issues that are found on the Xbox 360 version of the game. While it seams there are many users who are now doing their best to re-submit the relevant section of the article, therefore maintaining the accuracy and honesty of the article, I believe these two users should be restricted in their ability to edit this site.</p>
<p>I also question whether or not they have any affiliation with the companies Microsoft and Ubisoft, as their devotion to censoring this issue from the article is very frequent and unusual. "211.28.166.87 10:02, 19 March 2007 (UTC)"</p>
<p>The material seems to be pretty poor and not suitable for inclusion because of WP:ATT - having said that, Cobaltblue612 has breached 3RR and should be blocked for that (I'm not going to report him - I find the 3rr page a real pain in the arse to work with). --<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFredrick_day_9590.html" title="User:Fredrick day">Fredrick day</a> 10:07, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>CobaltBlue612 here (I am actually the user who posted undr SteveG when I was editing via my IP and not an account). I have removed the content in question numerous times because of its poor sources which are tantamount to heresay. The basis of these claims seems to be that the issues, if they're actually widespread, seem to be a general Xbox 360 issue that affects any title that would place a heavy load on the Xbox 360. If that is the case then any such mentions would belong in the Xbox 360 article (Otherwise every article for a game on this platform would contain such a section, as would most games for most other platforms since just about every console has had initial production run issues). The editor in question has repeatedly ignored requests to cite notable sources and has so fair neglected to take part in the talk page of the article other than to accuse me of being a Microsoft / UBISoft shill. In addition <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteel359_41ed.html" title="User:Steel359">User:Steel359</a> reviewed my request to semi-protect this article (and in the process reverted one of these additions) and I am further discussing this with <a href="../../../a/g/a/User%7EAgathoclea_2154.html" title="User:Agathoclea">User:Agathoclea</a> who has so far blocked one of the users who keeps re-adding the material in. <a href="../../../c/o/b/User%7ECobaltBlue612_3b7a.html" title="User:CobaltBlue612">CobaltBlue612</a> 10:26, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

You can see that the 217.x user posted a recent comment to their talk page extolling their additions to the article in question and again insulting me in the process. The second IP in question has been actioned by Agathoclea earlier today for removing talk page commentary, being insulting and making nonsensical additions to an article on another subject (Power Rangers of all things....).

<li>A cursory check doesnt seem to indicate the presence of proxies on those addresses.

</ul>
</li>
<li>Another user has taken it upon themselves to remove the content in question this time. If the content re-appears again what is the acceptable course of action? I'm still going to refrain from further edits until this is cleared up but since it is likely that within minutes the comments will be back any official determinations or guidance in this matter would be helpful.... <a href="../../../c/o/b/User%7ECobaltBlue612_3b7a.html" title="User:CobaltBlue612">CobaltBlue612</a> 11:11, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In fact that is the first step. If your view has a wide support of the community there is no need for yourself to make the reverts. Others will do so. As far as further options are concerned <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">WP:DR</a> outlines many.

<dd>Yes, but why hasn't this resulted in even one user block? Consensus about community bans is that things don't leapfrog from <i>let's sit down and talk</i> to <i>you're outta here</i>. They get a 12 hour block, a 48 hour block, a one week block, and we hope they get the message and adjust to site standards without needing to get booted from the project. If you did convince other editors at this page to community ban at this juncture I doubt the remedy would withstand an appeal, which means arbitration and all its attendant headaches. What exactly is the reason no blocks have been implemented? <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></font></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charge!</a></i></sup> 04:41, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>I looked, and I must say I misremembered; what I wrote wasn't Korea history-specific; it was a general request for intervention in <a href="../../../g/o/g/Goguryeo.html" title="Goguryeo">Goguryeo</a> and related articles due to edit warring; it wasn't a specific conduct issue with regard to Korea history, nor was his/her name specifically mentioned. Thought here: should I move this thread to WP:ANI in light of that? In any case, Korea history, the issue isn't my POV or your POV; it's that you can't seem to comply with policy. When you are removing citations to reliable sources and replacing them with non-citations to non-reliable sources, restoring grammatically incorrect versions, removing wikification, &amp;c., it's getting to the territory of vandalism, and the behavior is thoroughly unacceptable. Further, you are not discussing your edits; you don't respond to people's comments; and your behavior is getting worse. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 15:28, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Conclusion</b></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Nlu is overusing his powers granted as an administrator. To ban a user on these grounds is ridiculous.</li>
<li>Nlu, as an administrator, changed the way he views disputes and discussions. Anybody who challenges his edits are rebellious, or harassing,. Not a matter of difference in opinion, personal character, or usages of different sources.</li>
<li>The CPOV-KPOV disputes spill over to here. Using his/her administrative powers, Nlu should stabilize the disputes &amp; satisfy both parts in order to prevent these "harassing" acts by not only Korea history, but also other KPOV <b>AND CPOV</b> editors as well.</li>
<li>The CPOV editors are just as bad. The salon.com's article on "history wars" used <a href="../../../g/o/g/Talk%7EGoguryeo_a01b.html" title="Talk:Goguryeo">talk:Goguryeo</a> as an example &amp; specified an instance in which CPOV editors cussed at Korean editors.</li>
<li>Korea history is acting Korean. That is, not all Koreans act this way, but there is this type of personality which is extremely aggressive against any attack on his/her country (=patriotic?), easily angered &amp; easily inspired (in other words, emotionally unstable), &amp; if you're friend w/ him/her, s/he's the best friend you'd ever have.</li>

<dd>The issue here isn't Korea history's views. (I've had fairly spirited disagreements with people with views that are similar to Korea history's, as Wikimachine himself/herself knows.) The issue is that Korea history stepped over the line; look at the contribution history, and I don't think anyone, anyone can justify his/her behavior. It's Korea history's <i>actions</i>, not views, that is the problem. As the links I've cited shown, Korea history wasn't just reverting; he/she was reverting without discussion, restoring edits with worse grammar and style and less proper citations, and escalating in his/her behavior. Further, he/she was reverting everyone that he/she disagrees with -- not just me, and not just people with "CPOV." (I believe that is oxymoronic; there shouldn't be such a thing as "CPOV" or "KPOV"; Wikipedia is about "NPOV.") In the case of <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Salsu_7598.html" title="Battle of Salsu">Battle of Salsu</a>, for example, he/she was restoring edits without citations, and when pointed out at the sources don't support his interpretation, simply ignored the sources. He/she was even reverting people with "KPOV" just because he disagreed with them as well as to wording and as to factual characterizations. The behavior is not acceptable. Frankly, it was getting tiring to, in good faith, write lengthy explanations for my edits to have him revert without <i>any</i> explanation. Agree or disagree with my edits, at least come up with some reasons supported by citations, and further, don't wipe out my <i>grammatical</i> corrections as well. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 04:53, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If Korea history reverts my edits, I won't protest them because I know that they were all done under good faith. And I'm sure that all other editors at WikiProject Korea don't mind him either. It's for them to decide, not a single individual administrator, Nlu. If he causes too much ruckus, let us petition for his expulsion. At the same time, I'll try to talk to him on this issue.

<dd>My question is how does it work when you have an anonymous editor who continually posts clearly false information - what is the recourse for the serious professional with verified court documents to post? Can anyone just keep ripping them down and posting fraudulent data. Wikipedia is routinely referenced (wrongly in my view) as a source for locating court experts and investigating facts related to an issue. In fact many look no further.</dd>

<dd>AIV will block for 48 hours. But that only works if people notice there's a problem and report to AIV, and that seems to take several hours, by which time a lot of damage has been done. (So far, I seem to be the only editor noticing this problem; AGF seems to be making people think that the repeated insertion of incorrect nationalities and Victoria's Secret models is just an honest mistake.)

<p>Thanks. I guess many/most of the "Werdna" users are called Andrew IRL. I wouldn't refer a name like that here. This was different. I've never heard of the name "Nguyen" - the letters looked random to me (heh, lucky I never took Blnguyen to <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFCU_026f.html" title="WP:RFCU">WP:RFCU</a>!) - so worried that another user using that string of letters would be impersonation.

There has been some disagreement over whether or not Uncyclopedia's "claim" that Wikipedia is a parody of Uncyclopedia should be added to the introduction, but Smylei has gone as far as to actually say that Wikipedia <i>really might be</i> a parody of Uncyclopedia (as in, the encyclopedia article currently states that it's possible WP is actually a parody of Uncyc), re-inserting it with an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Uncyclopedia&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=116276739" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Uncyclopedia&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=116276739" rel="nofollow">edit summary of dubious integrity</a>.

Jayig (who has not yet commented on the issue) indicated that a checkuser has confirmed IP address identity, but we can't find records of a checkuser request. MiddleEastern meanwhile claims to have used some sort of IP obfuscation, which according to Jossi justifies a block per <a href="../../../n/o/p/WP%7ENOP_fa61.html" title="WP:NOP">WP:NOP</a>. Apart from all this, MiddleEastern has exhibited some unpleasant habits sometimes associated with single issue editors, e.g., blaming his troubles on <a href="../../../c/a/b/WP%7ECABAL_ad8b.html" title="WP:CABAL">cabals</a> of "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AMiscellany_for_deletion%2FUser%3AMiddleEastern%2FUnited_States&amp;diff=115316852&amp;oldid=115316740" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AMiscellany_for_deletion%2FUser%3AMiddleEastern%2FUnited_States&amp;diff=115316852&amp;oldid=115316740" rel="nofollow">Jewish admins</a>"...</dd>

<p>MiddleEastern appears to be a single issue editor. (S)he may or may not have a point on that issue. MiddleEastern should realize that <a href="../../../t/i/n/TINC_ef05.html" title="TINC">There Is No Cabal</a>, but should note that people with particular interests do tend to congregate. In this case I would think it might be on a per-language basis. We have a lack of arwiki&lt;-&gt;enwiki translators doing adequate cross checking and sources checking. I would not surprised if both wikis were biased, POV, and out of sync on the topics at issue. If so, this particular case would just be a symptom, not a cause.</p>

My use of the word "description" refers to solely to the possibility that "Jew" in this context might be merely a descriptive adjective and therefore not necessarily anti-Semitic, though certainly offensive for its implications that Jayjg cannot overcome bias as a Jewish editor and therefore: <i>"an off-colour potentially anti-Semitic comment that violates <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> or <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>".</i> I think that's pretty accurate assessment, don't you? Lovely speaking to you and still waiting fo my apology, as noted clearly on my talk page and yours many, many times now. You can add this one to the list.

<dd>It seems to me there are at least two distinct, though related issues here. Firstly, is MiddleEastern really a sockpuppet of Frogsprog - because that was what s/he was blocked for. If not, then how and why was s/he blocked for that reason? Secondly, if s/he isn't a sock should s/he be indef blocked per <a href="../../../o/p/_/WP%7EOP_2cfb.html" title="WP:OP">WP:OP</a> and/or for <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> issues? Personlly I think that is extreme. However, even if the consensus on the second issue is to block, I would still like to get to the bottom of the first issue, otherwise we are open to allegations of using <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a> as a difficult to challenge justification for blocking "nuisance" editors. <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockpocket_2e94.html" title="User:Rockpocket"><font color="green">Rockpock</font></a><font color="black">e</font><a href="../../../r/o/c/User_talk%7ERockpocket_62af.html" title="User talk:Rockpocket"><font color="green">t</font></a> 01:10, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Presumably Jay saw the evidence that ME is a sock of Frogspog so your second question may be moot, but frankly, in this case, I think an indef block for <a href="../../../o/p/_/WP%7EOP_2cfb.html" title="WP:OP">WP:OP</a> and/or for <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> issues isn't extreme at all. There are too many "nuisance" editors as it is, and MiddleEastern and/or Frogspog, like anyone else, could have come back <i>without</i> being disruptive. Had this happened, there would have been no reason to examine this editor, and he/she would not have been blocked again. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmon_3172.html" title="User:Armon">&lt;&lt;-armon-&gt;&gt;</a> 02:21, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Both went in for lots of ranting (ME anti-Jew/Israel and FS anti-American), lots of caps and shouting, both appeared to live or have lived in the UK, neither were native English speakers, both made the same kinds of errors. Add the apparent technical evidence to that.

<p><a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMiddleEastern_be86.html" title="User:MiddleEastern">User:MiddleEastern</a> was using the same IP as a very small number of other disruptive editors, one of which was positively identified as the permanently banned editor <a href="../../../f/r/o/User%7EFrogsprog_786c.html" title="User:Frogsprog">User:Frogsprog</a>. MiddleEastern was clearly an experienced Wikipedia editor, though she claimed otherwise, and her edits were remarkably similar in tone and style to Frogsprog's, though in a different topic area. Her explanations for using the IP in question were unbelievable; that she was using a non-existent program ("MaskMaster") purchased somewhere which had never sold that product (eBay) which did something technically impossible (pretend your IP is from another country) for a reason which was totally bogus (to get to sites that are "banned in Israel", something Israel doesn't do). And if there is any truth at all to her claims, then she is still editing from a proxy, which is forbidden on Wikipedia. On top of that, reviewing her contributions in hindsight, they seem solely for the purpose of political advocacy, remarkably aggressive and hostile, and far too obsessed with "jews" and "Zionists". Finally, MiddleEastern has already made it clear she would honor no block, regardless of the decision made here. I am baffled as to why we are wasting so much time on this. As for the claims by MiddleEastern that I have a "vendetta" against her, and by Domitius that I was "in a content dispute" with MiddleEastern, as far as I know I had never interacted with MiddleEastern before the block, either on a Talk: page or in an article. I would encourage Domitius in particular to provide evidence of any content dispute, or apologize. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 13:33, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am not saying that she has to date on her account at English Wikipedia. That's quite obvious. But I fully agree with Rockpocket that the issue that prompted the Check-User was a sockpuppet accusation and that that is what needs to be investigated here. While there are certainly violations of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>, all of us have trangressed these at one point or another. New users, particularly those who from places or backgrounds underrepresented amongst our editors here at English Wikipedia, may have a more difficult time than most when they first begin, for many complex reasons probably better discussed in a forum addressing issues of systematic bias, conflict resolution, cultural sensitivity, etc. My comments here are not designed to excuse <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMiddleEastern_be86.html" title="User:MiddleEastern">User:MiddleEastern</a>'s editing work so far, nor her inappropriate or disruptive comments. I do want to point that she/he has expressed a willingness on her talk page to avoid editing at Israel-related pages without engaging in the talk and to turn over a new leaf in her bahviour. She even extended <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">User:Jayjg</a> an "olive branch" (almost poetic considering Arafat's famous quote about not letting it fall from his hand at the UN - but I digress). My point is only that perhaps we could try to be a little more empathetic, while still considering what is best for all members of the community. We could shut <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMiddleEastern_be86.html" title="User:MiddleEastern">User:MiddleEastern</a> out now, or we <i>could</i> give him/her a chance and see what happens. The most we have to lose is having to put up with a few more days of inappropriate and disruptive behaviour before she would be blocked again. Whereas blocking her now means that we risk turning a potentially good editor who might not even be a sock-puppet into a sworn enemey of English Wikipedia. <a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiamut_fba0.html" title="User:Tiamut">Tiamut</a> 17:54, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not sure what this "olive branch" is about. Is MiddleEastern apologizing for the various false accusations she has made about me? It doesn't really matter; this is not a personal issue between MiddleEastern and me, so "olive branches" are irrelevant. She is either a sockpuppet of a banned user, or, if you believe her farfetched story, editing via proxies, contrary to Wikipedia policy. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 20:29, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The IP's version removes the redundant duplication, and also changes the incorrect figure of 6 as the maths is completely wrong.

<dd>However, the IP's blanking of this AN/I, instead of a reply here, IS worth discussing, since it should be up to others to say 'nothign ot see here' instead of him removing it; if any accused could remove, that could lead to chaos here. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 03:26, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Assuming good faith, ThuranX, I would say that since that IP just started editing here the day before yesterday, s/he probably isn't acquainted with our policies. Yuser, on the other hand, is an established user and should know better than to call another editor a blatant vandal. Considering this IP is so new, I think s/he is to be commended for such a calm response to such aggressive messages. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffpw_23d5.html" title="User:Jeffpw">Jeffpw</a> 10:29, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'll agf, but still, an IP that can find and delete from AN/I suggests to me that it might also be a more experienced editor with a semi-static IP. but if nothign else shows up behavioraly, then I guess it's jsut a new editor learning.

<dd>But the article that you added was a straightforward copyright violation (every phrase or sentence that I checked was copied; there might be some linking material that wasn't, but that's simply not enough). If you want to write an article on this topic, then do so off-line (making sure that none of it is plagiarised from anywhere), and then ask an admin to remove the protection. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Talk</font></a>) 14:04, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My mistake here was saving the article before I was finished with it. My first save was a quick summary of the subject that I found on another site. I then expanded and reworded the article -- but before I could save it the article had already been deleted. I then saved what I have finished at that point as the new article, and then <i>that</i> article was deleted (and the page protected), even though there was very little remaining of the original article. I then explained to the admin that it was a work in process, and that there would be no copyright infringement whatsoever when I was done, but I was ignored. I have the finished article here right now, and there is not a single sentence that violates copyright. This whole problem started because I save my unfinished page too soon, but there was no reason for the admin to over-react in the manner that he has (especially after I explained my intentions to him). There is no reason to protect a page that clearly doesn't need protecting. This is starting to get ridiculous. -- <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Brother_1984_991e.html" title="User:Big Brother 1984">Big Brother 1984</a> 14:19, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There really <i>wasn't</i> a copyright violation the second time it was deleted. The admin simply saw that it had been deleted before, and then deleted it again even though my second article was completely different from the first. I NOW HAVE A 3RD COMEPLETELY ORIGINAL ARTICLE HERE RIGHT NOW AND ALL I WASNT TO DO IS SAVE THE FRIGGIN' THING. I apologize for shouting, but I am starting to get frustrated by everybody's reluctance to remove a block that never should have been added in the first place. I’m getting tired of being treated like a vandal. This admin protected the page <i>before</i> discussing the issue with me, and there is no reason for everybody here to uphold the block. I am a long-time editor, and I fully understand what needs to be done to correct the article in order to satisfy the admin's complaints. There is no reason to protect this page from me. None whatsoever. -- <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Brother_1984_991e.html" title="User:Big Brother 1984">Big Brother 1984</a> 14:45, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The second (i.e. last) version of the deleted article was a very clear copyright violation of [<a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article1368918.ece" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article1368918.ece" rel="nofollow">[69]</a>], with only some words changed, bt with the order and complete sentences copied verbatim. Both deletions of this article were correct. E.g. your article: "Her husband, a local judge in Linz, Austria, named only as Andreas M, was not allowed to see them, despite filing nine claims with the court for access.

<dd>Like I said, both the first and second version was a work in progress. The admin should have sent me a message instead of deleting and protecting the article. The finished article would not have had any verbatim sentences either, but I never got a chance to finish it because this admin over-reacted. And in any case, an occasional copied sentence does not make for a severe copyright violation. .But I'm telling you, the new article that I have here does not have any verbatim sentences. The proper course of action would have been to delete or reword the offending sentences, not the entire article. I can't believe that nobody will remove the protection. This is absurd. I have a new article to post and it is really starting to piss me off that I can't post it. This is such a minor issue, and I don't see why it is being blown so far out of proportion. Just unprotect the article and see what happens. I promise, I won't bite. ^&gt;^ -- <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Brother_1984_991e.html" title="User:Big Brother 1984">Big Brother 1984</a> 16:17, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>From my initial read this situation escalated because you re-added copyvio material. Now were some new pages monitors/admins overzealous, sure, but you initiated the copyvio; they were simply doing clean up work. The entire situation could have been avoided if someone, anyone, simply stubified the article with original writing. An article will come of this eventually. I would unprotect the article myself, but I'll recuse myself for a day. <b>There is a case to answer here</b>, a <b>notable</b> article was deleted for a good reason. (no deletion review necessary) That ideally shouldn't happen; instead it should be replaced with content; an original stub isn't hard to do folks. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 02:33, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello.<br />
I'm having problems with user <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarthZantetsuken_a46d.html" title="User:DarthZantetsuken">User:DarthZantetsuken</a>. A while ago, I noticed that he had several copyrighted images on his userpages. Every time I've seen other people with 'fair use' images on their userpage, they were removed. So, after checking the policies, I saw that, indeed, they should be removed. So I did. So he wouldn't think he was just being vandalized, I explained in the edit summaries. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ADarthZantetsuken&amp;diff=115135301&amp;oldid=115131820" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ADarthZantetsuken&amp;diff=115135301&amp;oldid=115131820" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is the first case, and then I saw a second one and removed it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ADarthZantetsuken&amp;diff=115135637&amp;oldid=115135301" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ADarthZantetsuken&amp;diff=115135637&amp;oldid=115135301" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Note that, in the edit summmaries, I explain that copyright images can't be used in userpages.<br />
His first response was to revert one of those removals, and restore a copyrighted image as seen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ADarthZantetsuken&amp;diff=115220739&amp;oldid=115135637" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ADarthZantetsuken&amp;diff=115220739&amp;oldid=115135637" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br />
I removed the offending image again, and once again spelled it out in the edit summary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ADarthZantetsuken&amp;diff=115257051&amp;oldid=115221303" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ADarthZantetsuken&amp;diff=115257051&amp;oldid=115221303" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br />
Disgruntled, he then proceeded to request protection for his userpage from "vandalism". The page was semi-protected, but he was informed that it wouldn't stop me and that I was right to remove the image anyways. Across several edits, he eventually added an accusation directly into his userpage, as seen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ADarthZantetsuken&amp;diff=115595343&amp;oldid=115257051" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ADarthZantetsuken&amp;diff=115595343&amp;oldid=115257051" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I didn't vandalize, and I'd say explaining my reasoning calmly meant I wasn't being "childish".<br />
He also decided to remove my barnstar from my own userpage, just because it contained the <i>words</i>, "playstation", and "wii". This <i>was</i> vandalism. (You can see the edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ABladestorm&amp;diff=115592696&amp;oldid=115428101" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ABladestorm&amp;diff=115592696&amp;oldid=115428101" rel="nofollow">here</a>.)<br />
By now, I was a bit miffed. Just because I actually bothered reading the rules, I get accused of vandalism <i>and</i> got my own userpage vandalized for real. Rather irritating. So, I left a message on his talk page explaining the rules, including links so he could check them out for himself, and telling him to remove any and all false accusations from his user page. You can see that message <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADarthZantetsuken&amp;diff=115621571&amp;oldid=67160009" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADarthZantetsuken&amp;diff=115621571&amp;oldid=67160009" rel="nofollow">here</a>. (There's an intermediate revision not shown because I also added that he needs to fix things if he doesn't want me to seek administrative intervention)<br />
Rather than realizing that he was wrong. Rather than seeing that the rules leave absolutely no room for ambiguity, he instead decided to do a series of rather childish things.<br />
He changed my post on his talk page into, well, you can see it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADarthZantetsuken&amp;diff=116301356&amp;oldid=115621571" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADarthZantetsuken&amp;diff=116301356&amp;oldid=115621571" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br />
He moved <i>part</i> of the discussion onto my own talk page (for some reason, leaving out the part where I signed, just so he could call me out on not-signing; as if nobody could just check his own page's history if they were actually interested). He then admitted to doing it as revenge (or, as he put it, "You cannot prove this. Also, you have violated my user page so, an eye for an eye.") You can see the results of this move <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABladestorm&amp;diff=116298305&amp;oldid=115755661" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABladestorm&amp;diff=116298305&amp;oldid=115755661" rel="nofollow">here</a>(nice and polite edit summary, btw).<br />
Furthermore, at the very same time that he started having a beef with me, an anonymous ip has started vandalizing both my userpage and talk page. Including things like labelling me as homosexual (<b>around the same time that darthzantetsuken decided to add a note to his own userpage indicating that he was straight</b>), suggesting that "bladestorm should die", etc etc etc.<br />
While although I've been annoyed with many editors, I've never suggested that they should die, nor questioned their sexual orientation.<br />
If you take a look at the edit summmaries in my own userpage <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Bladestorm&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Bladestorm&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">here</a>, my talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bladestorm&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bladestorm&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and his own changes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:DarthZantetsuken&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:DarthZantetsuken&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:DarthZantetsuken&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:DarthZantetsuken&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">here</a>, I think it's pretty obvious that he and 158.123.134.2 are probably the same person (at least, likely enough to check it out with a checkuser). (Actually, as a possible coincidence, if you look at the contributions of both darth and 158.123.134.2, and go back far enough, you'll see that both have targeted CertifiedGangsta with uncivil behaviour. I'm sure CG has cheesed off a lot of people, so it could be nothing, but I still find that an odd coincidence.)<br />
Any and all accusations against me having vandalized when it's irrefutable that I've merely done what the policies explicitly state I should have should be removed.<br />
If darth <i>is</i> 158.123.134.2, then I expect serious action to be taken for both the vandalism, and the rather uncivil comments like "bladestorm should die".<br />
All false quotes from me on talk pages should be summarily deleted.<br />
So, can I get some help here? <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBladestorm_00c0.html" title="User:Bladestorm">Bladestorm</a> 17:52, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

How is that related to Wikipedia? Because he's in the Swiss Army he's qualified to edit articles or to be an adminstrator? I don't understand the point of that statement. Why would that information matter to anybody? I think the deletion was POV motivated. Why isn't he going through other people's userpage and deleting things that he thinks are irrelevant?

<dd>It deals with politics. It's more than one page in length on a Microsoft word document, normal font setup (Just because no one separated the paragraphs doesn't mean it's not more than one page).

In other words, if you have a few words about your stand, that's all right, but Sandstein clearly thought you were verging on a full fledged essay. Compared with your comments about his page, for example, no doubt he feels strongly about liberalism and the Swiss army, but he doesn't put up an entire lecture on them. If you can condense your statements to brief notes, that should be OK. I wouldn't recommend going to subpages either, that would fall under the same policy. Your user page should be about you as a Wikipedia editor.

<dd>Actually, it would have been better if he had been asked to remove it on his talk page, which is where such a request should go.

It is absolutely not optimal to post every single policy violation on AN/I for opinions. It was a clear-cut policy violation. Sandstein pointed to the policy and asked him to remove it (whereas some editors would have skipped this step, incorrectly, in my opinion). He didn't, so Sandstein removed it for him.

<dd>The content dispute is obvious, and it's not really anything different from your average content dispute about a controversial topic. I tried to keep my replies to him short - please provide sources, avoid use of weasel words, don't use original research, don't soapbox on the Talk page, etc. Which eventually led to him attacking me. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> <small>(<a href="../../../h/o/n/User_talk%7EHongQiGong_c2a3.html" title="User talk:HongQiGong">Talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HongQiGong_7564.html" title="Special:Contributions/HongQiGong">Contribs</a>)</small> 21:16, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>That's completely disingenuous and mirepresentative.

<p>It seems he's only interested in justifying his attacks and continuing his incivility. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> <small>(<a href="../../../h/o/n/User_talk%7EHongQiGong_c2a3.html" title="User talk:HongQiGong">Talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HongQiGong_7564.html" title="Special:Contributions/HongQiGong">Contribs</a>)</small> 21:30, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>It seems that Hong Qi Gong is in the habit of running to authority whenever his own inconsistencies and ill-behaviour are called on the carpet and he finds his bad logics/evidence cornered and revealed for what they are (empty posturing); and de facto what he's doing is a personal attack <i>on me</i>, based on my responses to his ill-advised, provocative and utterly POV changes to <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinaman.html" title="Chinaman">Chinaman</a>, and his fudging of the facts concerning the citations there etc. The squeaky wheel gets the grease - but why is it that Hong Qi Gong's wheel squeaks so damned much? Recruiting admins to hound another editor he's deliberately provoked an argument with......The real incident here is Hong Qi Gong's POVisms, lately as applied to <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinaman.html" title="Chinaman">Chinaman</a> under the guise of needing-citations, but without providing valid citations of his own; and throwing around guidelines like <a href="../../../w/e/a/WP%7EWeasel_words_17d9.html" title="WP:Weasel words">WP:Weasel words</a> which he himself is guilty of violating, especially in regards the logic applied to his POV edits at Chinaman.

<dd>Further, IMO Hong is only launching this incident report so as to incite momentum against me towards a block for incivility; during my last and only block (thanks to standing up for democratic values at <a href="../../../e/r/i/Talk%7EErik_Bornmann_9b71.html" title="Talk:Erik Bornmann">Talk:Erik Bornmann</a>) Hong actually showed up on my talkpage and <i>gloated</i> about me being blocked, and how he hopes I'd never come back etc etc. Some admins may choose to cooperate with this childishness and clear attempt to manipulate Wikipedia processes; I'd hope most of you have more common sense. Hong is not posting this out of a concern for civility, but because he wants to get rid of someone who challenges him so he can "control" certain articles in peace. Fine, masking disreputable conduct under the guise of "civility" may indeed be one of the oldest games in "civilization". More's the pity.<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 21:59, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm perfectly willing to further engage in discussion regarding the content dispute, but I have warned you twice on personal attacks before "running to authority". My only responses on said content dispute has been that we should avoid using weasel words and original research, and that sources should be provided if weasel words like "some people" are used.

<dd>"I have warned you twice on personal attacks" - warned me? Whined at me, maybe. But what are you, a judge and jury? Just because I don't invoke official procedure against you (which maybe is a good idea, given last time, especially your gloat-attack during the Bornmann block) doesn't mean you're not <i>just as guilty</i>. And yes, "running to authority" is the hallmark of the morally weak - that's an opinion, not an attack, so deal with it. If you want others to stop using "weasel words" maybe you'd better learn what those are and not falsely accuse others of using them when they haven't and <i>when you have YOURSELF</i>.

<dd>Well, edit-warring about it with them is not likely to solve the problem.

This bad tagging has taken place both with and without NPWatcher. Since Steel359 removed Patrick from the access list for NPW, I have undergone a long campaingn of repeated requests both on and off WP to give access back to Patrick, which I am of course unwilling to do. What has spurred me on to this decision to report the matter is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Martinp23/NPWatcher/Checkpage&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=116350130" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Martinp23/NPWatcher/Checkpage&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=116350130" rel="nofollow">this</a> edit of Patrick's, which strikes me as trolling. In addition to the grievances I've expressed, I suspect that there are others shared by many other contributors. However, I do feel that Patrick's actions are in good faith, but that he allows himself to let things go a little too far at times, allowing his emotions to take precedence over policy when on NPP. Does anybody have any ideas for where to go forward from here? I suspect that mentoring would be a fair idea, but it's hard for me to say whether or not he has "exhausted the community's patience" already. <strong><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_980f.html" title="User:Martinp23">Mart</a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartinp23_2732.html" title="User talk:Martinp23"><font color="red">inp23</font></a></strong> 21:23, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

The user has admitted to being a sock of the blocked vandal, saying <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Paul_Staines&amp;diff=114540587&amp;oldid=113468931" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Paul_Staines&amp;diff=114540587&amp;oldid=113468931" rel="nofollow">[97]</a> "Just a small point to add here, that it was Nssdfdsfds that repeatedly undid revisions of mine both here on the discussion page, and on the article itself."

<dd>Sorry to see Nssdfdsfds getting in a tizzy and telling tales out of school here. It's perfectly true that after Pogsurf was blocked by Persian Poet Gal as a "Vandal Only Account" I created the "Lobster Bloster" account. However I object strongly to the label "Vandal Only Account" which I assume is being used perjoratively, and not as an obscure reference to my Germanic ancestry. If Nssdfdsfds bothered to discuss prospective changes via talk pages I don't think so much hot air and wind would be generated. Please feel free to ban me again if you feel that is the right thing to do. There are many more names and IP addresses I could adopt, should the need arise. --<a href="../../../l/o/b/User%7ELobster_blogster_39c3.html" title="User:Lobster blogster">Lobster blogster</a> 00:46, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree here, theres plenty of other websites where people can identify their age also plenty of users who identify themselves as being under 18 - the users merely giving some facts about themselves <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanpostlethwaite_bb6d.html" title="User:Ryanpostlethwaite">Ryanpostlethwaite</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ryanpostlethwaite_1aae.html" title="Special:Contributions/ryanpostlethwaite">contribs</a>/<a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanpostlethwaite_d7e9.html" title="User talk:Ryanpostlethwaite">talk</a> 22:53, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>(edit conflict)&#160;:Users who are minors are generally advised to be cautious about giving out too much identifying information. There are stricter guidelines, albeit sometimes controversial and not policy, that are applicable to younger minors (younger than 13; this user states he is 14). However, a user merely stating that he is 14, by itself, would be harmless. We have administrators who have done that. The only advice I might give this user would be that he might want to provide his state of residence instead of the specific town. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 22:53, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

If it does edit again, please report it here or at AIV, which might get you a quicker response.

<dd>Hi I didn't know that using the extended name is a personal attack. I wouldn't ask a user to be blocked, if he said The Cold Truth or TCT, instead of TheColdTruth. It's as if someone had username InterPol, why would anyone be offended if others said International Police. Therefore "the personal attack" is unintentional, and is not meant to harm anyone. In my opinion the wisest thing would be to ask not to call someone by their full name, instead of saying that it was a personal attack. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheColdTruth_bb09.html" title="User:TheColdTruth">TheColdTruth</a> 21:06, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

I then realized that he was clearly causing trouble; so I started monitoring his recent edits regularly, and have to revert or de-tag about dozen of prod/speedy tagged articles(none of which I created) a number of which again were expanded to decent articles. To top things off, earlier today he/she vandalized <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devil%27s_advocate.html" title="Devil's advocate">devil's advocate</a> by inserting c's into the middle of several interwiki links. Because a registered user made a good faith edit and failed to notice it, I had to remove the c's myself. Based on the fact that he/she has clear knowledge of prod/speedy deletion policies and abusing them, I'm not ruling out the possibility that this IP may be a sock/meatpuppet of a more prolific deletionist vandal... <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERanma9617_c5d0.html" title="User:Ranma9617">Ranma9617</a> 01:58, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
