<p>There are many opinions regarding <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators_37b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators">adminship</a> held by a variety of people, and a number of perennial discussions about adminship or the <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFA_4c83.html" title="WP:RFA">related procedures</a>. Several issues have been debated to death a number of times already, and there seem to exist good arguments on both sides of the issues. This <b>survey</b> seeks to find out if a substantial majority of editors believes that certain changes should be made to our procedure or precedent. This is in line with the belief that <a href="../../../c/c/c/WP%7ECCC_b716.html" title="WP:CCC">consensus may change over time</a>.</p>
<p><b>This is <i>NOT</i> a policy proposal, neither should it be treated as pure voting, or/and in any way binding</b>. This is a gauge of public sentiment. However, if public sentiment is that a certain policy would be beneficial, effort can be made towards creating a policy proposal. While some people consider voting to be "<a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Polling_is_evil" class="extiw" title="m:Polling_is_evil">evil</a>", measuring public opinion is not. If a public opinion is obvious, people may want to take it into account for their future actions or judgments.</p>
<p>All editors may participate, and are strongly encouraged to explain their rationale behind their opinions whenever possible, to allow for a full discussion and diversity of voices. - <a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMailer_diablo_6ffa.html" title="User:Mailer diablo">Mailer Diablo</a> 11:04, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Points to think about&#160;:</p>
<ul>
<li>RfA's ability/inability to adapt to changes in community and withstand times of "crisis"?</li>
<li>Is RfA currently the best method for promoting editors for <a href="../../../a/d/m/WP%7EADMIN_f0df.html" title="WP:ADMIN">adminship</a>?</li>
<li>Do you consider RfA to be "broken"?</li>
<li>Do you feel that RfA is fair in determining whether to give/not to give the mop to editors?</li>
<li>Is there room for improvement in RfA? Please specify what changes you think may make RfA a better one.</li>

<li>I am, yes. I have not yet seen any single better suggestion for how to run it, nor can I think of one. There are always going to be complaints about different methods. I do expect this survey to be very strongly (and possibly misleadingly) against RFA in its present form, because the people that feel strongly about how RFA is "broken" are most likely to contribute. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a>&#160;<a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></a> 16:05, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That's because this adminship survey is a voluntary response sample, and only people who have strong vocal opinions on this issue will actually participate in the survey. <b><a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENishkid64_5481.html" title="User:Nishkid64"><span style="background:#009;color:#7FFF00">Nish</span><span style="background:cyan;color:#009">kid</span></a><a href="../../../n/i/s/User_talk%7ENishkid64_b4d4.html" title="User talk:Nishkid64"><span style="background:orange;color:navy blue">64</span></a></b> 22:24, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Yep. As opposed to adminship based on: edit count, years here, limited group decision, or a combination of them, I think community decision based adminship is the right approach. Saying the community, or certain members are incapable of making up their mind could be considered mildly arrogant. Discrediting someone’s&#160;!vote for clarifying it with a silly reason is irrelevant. Putting your gut feel into words isn’t always easy, it’s their&#160;!vote, their reasoning, their opinion, and their tiny part of the community’s input on giving someone some extra buttons. The fact that a&#160;!vote is sometimes joined with a reasoning <i>you</i> don’t agree with, can at max prompt to talk a bit. Besides, the fact that a bureaucrat is allowed to interpret a&#160;!vote is supposed to solve the "silly reason" problem. The only problem I see is that even with 300&#160;!voters, they are potentially not an average cross section of the community, but people with an special interest. I agree that that is not ideal, but hard to solve. --<a href="../../../v/a/n/User%7EVan_helsing_c85b.html" title="User:Van helsing">Van helsing</a> 16:48, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Best way of all the suggested ones--strikes a good balance between quality and general approval, which are not quite the same. The main problem I find is the unfortunate affect effects of negative criticism on future discussions between the parties. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 18:51, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yes, in considering whether or not I am "content" with the present system and I certainly do not think it is "broken", conceeding that no system is perfect. There is far too much subjective opinion put forth to support the proposition that it is the system that is not working, broken, or at fault. Too much is made of people being opposed for the "wrong" reasons. I agree that some opinions, both in support and in opposition, can be based on irrelevant factors, be frivolous, ill-thought out, or vexatious, but it appears those responses are in the minority and the bureaucrats can put as little weight as they want on those opinions in making their decision. In any event, an important part of the discussion is trust, and I cannot accept that a person can be told their ability to trust or not to trust is wrong. It has been said a number of time in RfA Talk that "good" or "worthy" candidates fail to get promoted. I have to take that with a grain of salt. No candidate is a guaranteed shoo-in, and I assume that all (or the vast majority) commentators posting an opinion are stating their opinion in good faith on criteria that they think are relevant. I have supported candidates who have failed, and opposed candidates who have succeeded, but despite my opinion I can respect the opinion of those who thought to the contrary and did not see the opinions contrary to mine as an indication that the system is broken. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 19:10, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I am generally supportive of the way RfA is currently run. I think some tinkering about the edges may be appropriate, but the process seems rather hard to replace with one better. <span style="font-family:serif;font-size:120%"><b><a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">Αργυριου</a></b> <a href="../../../a/r/g/User_talk%7EArgyriou_e022.html" title="User talk:Argyriou">(talk)</a></span> 22:05, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yes, I think there is much hand-wringing about RfA, but I don't see a broken process at all. —<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Bell_8398.html" title="User:Doug Bell">Doug&#160;Bell</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoug_Bell_81b5.html" title="User talk:Doug Bell">talk</a></sup> 23:30, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I am content currently, because on 90% of situations (in my opinion) the outcome is the best one for improving the encyclopaedia. It could be tweaked, but the current method is better than most other proposed methods. <b><a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel.Bryant_22a1.html" title="User:Daniel.Bryant"><span style="color:#2E82F4">Daniel.Bryant</span></a></b> 04:05, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>"Content" is a rather strong word for what would be better described as toleration. I am not thrilled with RfA but don't see a better system on the horizon and certainly don't see any way to get consensus to switch to a new system even if it is better. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 05:10, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Essentially agree with Eluchil. While there are always pathological cases, the current system basically works, which is more than I'd predict for any of the alternatives I've seen proposed. General satisfaction with the system, however, does not necessarily amount to satisfaction with the culture of (some of) the participants. In particular, the insistence that the system is essentially 'not a vote' contrasts with the common view that opposition should not be disputed or even replied to; I would rather see acceptance that individual comments - in any section - may generate discussion of the particular point being made. Correspondingly, one should not make a comment that one is not prepared to defend, and 'don't badger the opposers' should not be a flag to wave in lieu of explaining oneself. <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 05:19, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Until someone presents a viable alternative, and RfC-like methods aren't it, the imperfections of the current system are a necessary evil. There are indeed some bizarre reasons given for opposing candidates, but these come in all shapes and sizes. Some of the "RfA is broken" people aren't backward at coming forward with their own shrubberies. When the system fails to promote apparently suitable people, it usually works eventually. I don't see any way to produce a system which will not be unpleasant for some: we are asked if we trust the candidate with the tools. If it turns out that, actually, no, you aren't trusted, that's unlikely to be an experience you'll enjoy. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 11:28, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't think there is a problem with the process, rather, some people's standards are too high. I think&#160;!votes should be based on whether the user would misuse the tools through either malicious deletions/blocks etc or inexperience. Other than that I think there should be no other criteria. Of course people need evidence that the person understands policy etc but some people's standards are too high. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames086_6f65.html" title="User:James086"><font face="comic sans ms" color="#454545">James086</font></a><sup><a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJames086_1a79.html" title="User talk:James086"><font color="darkgreen">Talk</font></a></sup> 14:04, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>RfA is the most scrutinized and over-discussed process on Wikipedia. People's standards could use work, yes, but I don't see that as something that can be changed by a change in the process. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmasterka_6922.html" title="User:Grandmasterka"><font color="green">Grand</font></a><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrandmasterka_5f38.html" title="User talk:Grandmasterka"><font color="blue">master</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Grandmasterka_b497.html" title="Special:Contributions/Grandmasterka"><font color="purple">ka</font></a> 08:22, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>The high standards in RfA are a function of the difficulty in removing the sysop bit to the bad apples. All other processes will have the same issue, defensive editors and rising criteria, until the other side of the equation is addressed. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito<span style="color:#008000;">xd</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a>)</sup> 23:20, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I see no problems in RfA that would warrant a redesigning of it. Though the votes tend to disaggree, changing RfA will not change the disaggreement in votes. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_panda_d8a7.html" title="User:Captain panda"><font color="orange">Captain</font> <font color="red">panda</font></a> <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptain_panda_3940.html" title="User talk:Captain panda"><font color="teal">In</font></a> <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_panda_Autograph_Book_f2a2.html" title="User:Captain panda/Autograph Book"><font color="green">vino</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Captain_panda_0806.html" title="Special:Contributions/Captain panda"><font color="indigo">veritas</font></a> 23:35, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>This process has withstood many trials relatively unscathed and in full bloom. The concerns regarding silly reasons for opposition are irrelevant to the RfA; those are problems regarding the person voting, not the process of voting. We do not blame the initiative process for crappy measures and propositions; you blame those that came up with said crappy measures and propositions. --<sup><a href="../../../p/h/y/User_talk%7EPhysicq210_4b59.html" title="User talk:Physicq210"><font color="#000000">210</font></a></sup><b><a href="../../../p/h/y/User%7EPhysicq210_ccba.html" title="User:Physicq210"><font color="#0000C0" face="Comic Sans MS">physicq</font></a></b> (<i><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Physicq210_25e9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Physicq210"><font color="#0000C0">c</font></a></i>) 20:27, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Too many decent candidates who would make great admins are opposed because they aren't PC enough, or are willing to take contentious decisions (and I'm not thinking about me, I'm thinking Moreschi). Other RfAs snowball on the basis of one diff because many voters can't be bothered to consider all the qualities of the candidate. I would say that it's getting to the point where people simply pile in from what they've read on the RfA, not from their own investigation, which can lead to horrible bias. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDev920_f8f8.html" title="User:Dev920">Dev920</a> (Have a nice day!) 15:42, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Per the above reasons, as well as the silly oppose reason "must have at least one FA" - pardon me, but we need more admins, and writing well is not an admin function - admin functions are primarily housekeeping, mentoring, policy, etc. Perhaps if we promote more admins, those who <i>do</i> write well will have more time for it. As it is, I never saw that blocking vandals, protecting pages, deleting articles, and closing Afds require ability to write to FA standards. If we promote only those who <i>do</i> write to that level, then we're losing valuable writing time for them - they'll be too busy with housekeeping to write, and then why are we here?

<li>Tyranny of the majority seems to occur during RFAs, with many people just jumping on the bandwagon and saying "Oppose per (name)".

<li>RFA is currently problematic: users take their personal dislikes to RFA: what is more: "OMG! He's an inclusionist! All inclusionists are evil trolls out to wreck Wikipedia's credibility" and "OMG! He's a deletionist! All deletionists are evil maniacs out to destroy Wikipedia" are currently especially prevalent. I agree with GhostPirate greatly in that RFA needs to move away from the current format, which reeks of supermajority, to one that will truly give us consensus. Purely from a practical point of view, we need more admins, particularly given that large chunks of our current admins are either inactive or only semi-active. A reluctance has arisen among the community to promote more freely because certain admins go bad, and it takes ArbCom to stop a broken admin. In my opinion, this is perhaps because editors, including admins on occasion, have used Wikipedia as their batttleground, either on a personal or on an ideological level: in particular on a personal level. This has led to overmany blocks of established users and following wheel wars. For that to be fixed, a culture change at Wikipedia needs to take place: <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#BATTLEGROUND" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#BATTLEGROUND</a> needs to be more rigorously enforced and a culture of "work with" needs to be installed in place of "war against". Even without this, however, which is not really an RFA problem, RFA is still broken. While supreme perfection is an unattainable goal for mankind, RFA is so badly broken that it needs to be fixed. We are getting good admins, the right admins - but not enough. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoreschi_31bb.html" title="User:Moreschi">Moreschi</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_recordings_a333.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested recordings">Request a recording?</a></sup> 19:21, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I echo others' concerns about opposition because of, gasp, imperfection. The need to be counted, considered, or influential causes people to oppose when a comment and a "I'll keep that in mind and will not do it again" would suffice. This oppose&#160;!voting causes support&#160;!voting in an attempt to cancel the opposes out, and this makes Wikipedia way, way too much of a <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#BATTLEGROUND" title="WP:NOT">battleground</a>.

<li>I feel RfA is broken. Editors and users who would make great admins are opposed "because of lack in mainspace", "not enough XfD participation", "tagged an article with db-band instead of db-bio" (exaggerating on that one). It's also a problem because the <i>good</i> admins are not necessarily the <i>popular</i> ones. <i><a href="../../../y/u/s/User_talk%7EYuser31415_0c1d.html" title="User talk:Yuser31415">Yuser31415</a></i> 22:12, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>We have a major issue of a non-standard set of criteria for what constitutes <i>A Good Administrator</i>™, which leads to people opposing/approving based off of other people's opinions, not on their own, and the case of a pile-on oppose from one diff from 26 years ago. Also, it's absolutely absurd that we call it a discussion. It's nothing more than a popularity contest based on a VOTE. Just because you put an exclamation point in front of the word vote in a vain attempt to negate it doesn't make it any less of a vote. The fact that we say "70%+ approval is required" further proves that the content of people's comments matter much less than the overall percentages for/against. In my opinion, a single editor bringing up a very valid point for opposition should be able to negate 100 support (!votes, of course). However, I personally cannot think of another way to do it better right now. <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">^</span><a href="../../../%5E/d/e/User%7E%5Edemon.html" title="User:^demon"><span style="color:black;font-weight:bold;">demon</span></a><sup><a href="../../../%5E/d/e/User_talk%7E%5Edemon.html" title="User talk:^demon"><span style="color:red">[omg plz]</span></a></sup>&#160;<em style="font-size:10px;">23:09, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</em></li>
<li>No, it's current method isn't the best it could be. I suggest it be more discussion oriented rather than 70% majority-crap.

<li>RfA has become a popularity contest. No matter how Jimbo and other keep saying that <i>"being an admin is no big deal"</i>, it obviously is. Reading through the opposers arguments (if they even <i>have</i> any arguments) makes you think one is running for president. Adminship is (or <i>should</i> be) about <i>volunteering</i>. Therefor, all that is needed is enough editors supporting the adminship; let's just do away with the opposers. --<a href="../../../e/d/o/User%7EEdokter_4a5a.html" title="User:Edokter">Edokter</a> <small>(<a href="../../../e/d/o/User_talk%7EEdokter_9869.html" title="User talk:Edokter">Talk</a>)</small> 23:28, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>People are opposed for the silliest reasons (ex. too little image edits when thr candidate doesn't even plan to help with images). A lot of the criteria are too high. We have too little admins.

<li>We seem to have moved away from the ideal that adminship is "no big deal" to some sort of system where only the most over-qualified stand a chance of succeeding. To illustrate: I was promoted with unanimous support two years ago, two years, and 10000 edits later, I doubt I would pass a RfA now for one reason or another, despite having used the tools without controversy, if a little sparingly. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERje_9381.html" title="User:Rje">Rje</a> 19:42, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Expectations are <i>way</i> too high. I'd love to have admin privileges to assist with moves and other maintenance but I know that if I RFA, I'll be told that I'm not involved enough in the encyclopedia work. Only 500 of my 4000 edits are in the mainspace (second only to the Wikipedia namespace with 2200). I don't think that this should be a valid criteria for RfA oppositions since there's plenty of admin work to do in the WP namespace too --<a href="../../../f/r/o/User%7EFroth_72db.html" title="User:Froth">⁪froth</a><sup><b><a href="../../../f/r/o/User_talk%7EFroth_2eda.html" title="User talk:Froth"><small>T</small></a></b></sup> 21:40, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

It is hard to define when a system is broken, and not just backward, but RfA is one or the other, and not too far from the line between the two. Many good candidates aren't promoted because of arbitrary standards which have nothing to with their trustworthiness, and, occasionally, bad ones <i>are</i> promoted - with flying numbers - because they've somehow become popular. <a href="../../../p/i/c/User_talk%7EPicaroon9288_6280.html" title="User talk:Picaroon9288">Picaroon</a> 21:43, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have 3 points. <b>Point 1</b> - I am not content with the current system of RfA's. My biggest pet peeve is that they have come rather a popularity contest. Editors who I call social editors (Who normally hang around talk pages &amp; make small gnommish edits to articles occasionally) with little or no article achievements make adminship far too often based on a cabal of wikifriends which admire them. Editors which are less liked &amp; have many more achievements are left out completely or struggle terribly to make it past a RfA. I know of one editor, can't remember his name, who had like 8 FA's &amp; many articles under his belt (Rama's Arrow?) &amp; he only just made adminship &amp; after his second time. However, despite being close friends, Riana Dzasta, Phaedriel &amp; others have little to none in regards to article writing &amp; they made WP:100 &amp; WP:200. Forget the fact that the social, policy editors need the sysop tools more, an editor should be well rounded no matter what. <b>Point 2</b> - In addition to this point, there are a frenzy of other reasons that I am not happy with RfA's &amp; I'm sure some of you agree too. Too often have I seen a good editor be totally destroyed or broken after a failed RfA - myself included. This usually ends in a leaving or a self destructive wikibreak ending spiral of edits. It is literally like being on trial. You are being told that you are not good enough. Despite this, I can see little other way to appoint admins. - <b>New way of appointing admins?</b> - The only other way I can think of is if a committee set up a tight set of rules. To become an admin you have to fit the criteria that they set up. I'd sayit would be something like:- "Must have edited for more than 1 year. Must have over 3,600 edits. Must have over 1,500 main space edits. Must have X number of Wikipedia edits. Must have 1 FA or FL. Must have uploaded 5 pictures. Must have participated in X number of Xfds." Then you could have 3 or 5 beurocrats or admins sign off on the request. Also, you could have a section where people could cite any uncivil behaviour &amp; provide evidence. If there was none &amp; the editor had all the points above &amp; got the sign off from the admins/beuros, then they would become an admin. With this system there would be no popularity contest nor a long discussion process &amp; adminship would be decided on editing merits not how many people you know. It would save time as all a beurocrat would have to do is check if the user had all the requirements &amp; if any people had cited any uncivil behaviour. It would also excluded the whole "You're not good enough for us thing" as the user would know that prior by checking if he had all the requirements. <b>Point 3</b> - Oppose votes are very discarded nowadays. Since it's not a vote (Geez I hate that annoying bloody "!" before the vote) whether or not a person makes adminship should be decided on reasons. However this is not the case such as in the following example. A person has 100 support votes &amp; 3 opposing votes with excellent arguments. In theory, those 3 votes should be able to topple all the support votes in the world if they are legitimate &amp; valid. However this is not the case &amp; in the example, the person would make adminship &amp; get rewarded by making WP:100. This is wrong. Blame the beurocrats if you will, but they would get a load of crap if they ended a RfA because of only 3 well put oppose votes. My above process of only citing uncivil or bad behaviour would rule out this common action too. Anyway, I've gone on long enough &amp; should probably leave it there. As you can tell I'm passionate about the subject.... <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpawn_Man_fbc1.html" title="User:Spawn Man">Spawn Man</a> 01:22, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>One or two oppose&#160;!votes sometimes lead to pile-on oppose voting. Takes a brave person to open themselves to critical appraisal.

<li>As mentioned by Amarkov up top, one of the biggest draw backs with the current system, is that good editors are blocked because they do not work in a certain area. The criteria should not be whether they are active in a particular area i.e. Images, or XfD, or stubbing, but whether they understand the policies and structure of wikipedia so as to find the relevant information if they are requested to help out. My other concern is the people voting on RfA's it becomes clear that after around 20 votes or so the pile on phenomenon starts. I'm sure there are a few editors who religeously investigate the candidates background, but I have a sneaking feeling that this is the exception rather than the rule. Some editors I feel start voting on the RFA's as a means of getting themselves noticed. Unfortunately reading through some of the votes, every now and then I see a name I don't recognise, look up and they have a handful of edits to their name. An RfA almost should be a vote by one's peers, this would never be excepted as it could lead to more cabal theories etc, but we must have a clearer set of guidelines and the editors voting must understand in detail of what they are voting for, and what isn't excepted reasoning. <sup><a href="../../../k/h/u/User%7EKhukri_e3b4.html" title="User:Khukri"><b><font face="verdana" color="#6633CC">Khu</font></b></a><a href="../../../k/h/u/User_talk%7EKhukri_0ba4.html" title="User talk:Khukri"><b><font face="verdana" color="#CC66FF">kri</font></b></a></sup> 12:07, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I always stay away from RfA, because of the objections also raised by others above me(silly comments like "does not meet my admin standards, to few Image talk posts"). If being an admin is really "not a big deal", then any trustable user, who has shown a reasonable effort to improve Wikipedia (in whatever way) should become an admin when no serious objections are raised. --<a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt. Morgan (Reinoutr)</a> 12:58, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I can't believe that anyone would think RfA was a good process. People get opposed for low editcount when they have over 1,000 or even 2,000 edits. The threshold for adminship needs to be dramatically lowered - I don't see why any reasonably experienced and trustworthy user can't become an admin. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 13:26, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>The standards are arbitrary and often meaningless. For example, edit counts have nearly no bearing on whether someone's a good admin (well, excepting people with maybe 20 edits.) <b><a href="../../../2E/v/2E/User%7E.V._5c4f.html" title="User:.V."><span style="color:purple">.</span><span style="color:green">V</span><span style="color:purple">.</span></a></b> <sub>[</sub><sub><a href="../../../2E/v/2E/User_talk%7E.V._d46b.html" title="User talk:.V.">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_.V._ddc5.html" title="Special:Emailuser/.V.">Email</a>]</sub> 14:36, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>RFA is broken because too many people seem to believe that you have to know how to be an admin before becoming one. If there is a great editor, who has done a lot of article editing and Wikiproject work (i.e. activities that don't need the tools), he or she should be promoted simply on the basis of being a trusted user. Clearly someone who has worked among others on WP for months or even years is unlikely to go berzerk upon receiving the tools. However, such a user will never become an admin, because only people who are already overly involved in admin activities will receive support.--<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanaman5_142b.html" title="User:Danaman5">Danaman5</a> 07:53, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>No</b>. For quite some time now RfA has been dominated by a small handful of users. Many of these frequent voters have very little (if any) participation in the encyclopedia outside of RfA. Go to any RfA from the last year, and you'll find any number of voters whose talk pages are an unbroken string of "thanks for your support on my RfA" messages, and whose contribution histories are one-dimensionally focused on the adminship process. These users tend to exhibit wildly variable RfA standards and convoluted or just plain fallacious logic in their arguments. Admins like myself who were promoted pre-2006 would certainly not have been promoted by the current crop of regular RfA voters. I can assure you that I never would have accepted a nomination for sysop back then if the climate at RfA had been what it is now. RfA *must* become a less venomous place. A wider variety of users needs to find the time to participate in the discussion there, and everyone who votes (and don't quibble - that's exactly what RfA is) needs to bear in mind that admin actions are always reversible and that adminship is neither trophy nor honorific. <a href="../../../a/_/t/User%7EA_Train_c9b0.html" title="User:A Train">A Train</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../a/_/t/User_talk%7EA_Train_dd5d.html" title="User talk:A Train"><font color="DarkBlue">take the</font></a></small></sup> 15:05, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I have to say that editcountitis is ridiculously rampant on RfAs. Any editor who has worked on Wikipedia and without blocks or signs of problem editing for 500-1000 edits is obviously familiar with the basic policies and the way Wikipedia works. The&#160;!votes "per <i>other user</i>" are also somewhat problematic, as are&#160;!votes with short, pithy but shallow statements.&#160;!votes like that should simply be discounted from the total. I also tend to oppose the one-FA standard, since being an admin and a great writer are not mutually inclusive. Supposedly, it is to show that an editor understands the goals of Wikipedia/article standards, but wouldn't someone who's participated in GA reviews, FA reviews, RfCs and the like have an obvious grasp of such standards without being a top shelf writer? In essence, I think a lot of good users are discouraged from seeking an RfA, or nominating another good editor, because of these perceived hurdles and flaws. I also believe some editors decline to participate for similar reasons, myself among them. If adminship is "no big deal" as repeatedly stated, then why so many hurdles and why such a big deal? Rather than another system replacing RfA, I think the current one just needs a solid overhaul. <a href="../../../v/a/s/User%7EVassyana_7573.html" title="User:Vassyana">Vassyana</a> 17:13, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm not exactly content, but I've generally quite sceptical of the proposals for significant change.

<li>I agree with Dragons Flight. RfA isn't perfect, but it generally works, meaning that there aren't too many false positives or negatives (IMO, at least).

<li>The rate of promotion is too slow. I don't think you can blame RFA itself for that, though.

<li>RFA is not working well. The problem is not the process of RFA but the state of adminship on en.WP. Since there is very little feedback towards existing admins (and none of it positive) the people in RFA don't know what to look for in a potential admin. They end up using metrics which have nothing to do with adminship. Admins themselves seem to have no system of priorities or evaluation (except for specific complaints). They seem to run about dousing flames (or setting them) in groups that forms by happenstance and seldom vary with no effort to really organize in an efficient way. Adminship is what is not scaling not RFA. Fix adminship and the RFA process will fix itself.--<i><font color="#9966FF">Birgitte</font><font color="#CC99CC" size="2">SB</font></i> 20:01, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think that making RfA much more reason-based would be beneficial, as the bureaucrat will be able to look at all the users' research and come to a rational conclusion. However, if there are like 100 votes for and 2 votes against, such as in <a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a>'s case, the bureaucrat can quickly come to a decision. <a href="../../../-/s/l/User%7E-Slash-_14f9.html" title="User:-Slash-">{<span style="color:green">Slash</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_-Slash-_adb7.html" title="Special:Contributions/-Slash-">-|-</a><a href="../../../-/s/l/User_talk%7E-Slash-_9e42.html" title="User talk:-Slash-"><span style="color:red">Talk</span>}</a> 22:52, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>It's tough to answer this question because it seems to proceed from a paradigm that doesn't have much relevance to me. Yes, the people who get through RFA usually succeed as administrators. No, the voters' priorities aren't necessarily ones I consider necessary or beneficial - but structural changes to RFA wouldn't change that. Two aspects have me very concerned. First, as I outline in the opening of <a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_Admin_4b2c.html" title="User talk:Durova/Admin">User talk:Durova/Admin</a>, I consider the low and declining admin to user ratio to be a serious systematic problem at this site. We ought to be recruiting and mentoring more good editors into adminship. Second, there's a specific shortage of administrators to do the work I specialize in (complex investigations) and that shortage is rarely recognized or prioritized at RFA. In my opinion that's why <a href="../../../r/f/i/WP%7ERFI_2cc3.html" title="WP:RFI">WP:RFI</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/i/WP%7EPAIN_2701.html" title="WP:PAIN">WP:PAIN</a> both got discontinued.

<li>RfA is doing an okay job, but I don't see any other satisfactory method. <i><b><a href="../../../b/i/b/User%7EBibliomaniac15_4b0f.html" title="User:Bibliomaniac15"><font color="black">bibliomaniac</font></a><a href="../../../b/i/b/User_talk%7EBibliomaniac15_e27b.html" title="User talk:Bibliomaniac15"><font color="red">1</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bibliomaniac15_b1b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bibliomaniac15"><font color="blue">5</font></a></b></i> 22:37, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>RfA is very good at preventing bad candidates from getting promoted (which is the most important criterion), but not so good at getting good candidates promoted. Too many people are opposed because of "inexperience" (i.e., the editor voting just <i>happens</i> not to know the candidate). --<a href="../../../n/_/s/User%7EN_Shar_b1e6.html" title="User:N Shar">N Shar</a> 21:34, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think that the procedure is good and works for the most part, however I have seen RfAs opposed (and supported for that matter) for really inane reasons. The most recent example was an RfA being opposed to because the applicant used the <a href="../../../a/w/b/WP%7EAWB_c695.html" title="WP:AWB">AWB</a> on a page when the project that associated itself with that article decided they didn't want people using AWB on <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">their articles</a>.

<li>RFA does a good job weeding out bad admins, but the cost has been weeding out some good users to. ---<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User%7EJ.smith_e018.html" title="User:J.smith">J.S</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User_talk%7EJ.smith_6ef6.html" title="User talk:J.smith">T</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_J.smith_698b.html" title="Special:Contributions/J.smith">C</a>/<a href="../../../w/r/e/WP%7EWRE_9138.html" title="WP:WRE">WRE</a>)</small> 05:09, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Of course RfA isn't perfect. Nothing's perfect. But, as several people have mentioned, I haven't heard of a better system. Any problems it has, I feel, arise less from the system itself than from some - not all, not most -&#160;!votes being made for trivial and/or questionable reasons. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrystallina_cbad.html" title="User:Crystallina">Crystallina</a> 23:11, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I see a lot of good points on both sides. My main issue with it is that it is <i>incredibly</i> easy for one disgruntled editor who doesn't like the candidate for some personal reason, or a single sockpuppet upset that their spam article was AfDd, to derail an RfA; nasty accusations that sound plausible cause a snowball effect of "Oppose" votes, because few if any oppose voters will actually do any legwork to verify claims of badness, meanwhile candidates are often crticized for responding argumentatively to "Oppose" votes, leaving blatant lies often unchalleged. Another problem with it is that oppose votes are usually longwinded and rancorous, citing all kinds of real or imagined slights in great detail, while support votes are usually one-liners, effectively giving a lot more weight to oppose votes. — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 22:30, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The job of a bureaucrat is to interpret consensus, and I think they do a fine job of that. In the case of a bad admin, that's the fault of the people voting, per my comments above, not the crats. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDev920_f8f8.html" title="User:Dev920">Dev920</a> (Have a nice day!) 15:46, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes. Even with Ryulong's RFA, I think what was done was something that <i>needs</i> to be done, but it was the wrong RFA to pick for it. Several users that everyone 100% completely and totally agrees are trusted users have failed to get promoted because they didn't jump through the right hoops. This is where the bureaucrats need to exercise their discretion. If someone is 60/40, but every single one of the opposes is for namespace balance reasons, then a bureaucrat needs to consider promoting that user. See <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Gay_Cdn_3945.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Gay Cdn">Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Gay Cdn</a>, for example. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 16:43, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I do have faith though I would prefer for a far greater discretionary range to be available. Again, its just a metric that itself doesn't make sense as the range is determined by a proportion without looking at the overall total. A higher total number is also an indicator and that is never considered by the proponents of a particular % figure. Perfectly happy with Ryulong. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 16:58, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm confident in the current set of 'crats, for the time being. I suspect most of them would fail RfB if renominated, but that would be due to shortcomings in RfB rather than with the current set of 'crats. --<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">ais523</a> 17:08, 16 February 2007 (<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">U</a><a href="../../../a/i/s/User_talk%7EAis523_6ca0.html" title="User talk:Ais523">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ais523_df26.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ais523">C</a>)</li>

<li>Put me here. AN and ANI have been on my watchlist for quite a while and I have not seen anyone criticize Carnildo's actions once that I can recall, so it seems as though the crats called that one right. Ryulong was promoted on a bad rationale but I think that one will turn out OK as well. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoreschi_31bb.html" title="User:Moreschi">Moreschi</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_recordings_a333.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested recordings">Request a recording?</a></sup> 19:25, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yes I trust them. However I think they should be more proactive in sheparding difficult disscussions toward consensus, rather than standing by while people become more and more entrenched.

<li>I do trust crats to make the right decision, which should be determined by consensus from discussion, not from merely numbers. Using percentages may have seemed like a good idea when it was first introduced, and probably still does, but we need to be weaned off of addiction to them. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGracenotes_686d.html" title="User:Gracenotes"><font color="#960">Grace</font><font color="#000">notes</font></a><sup><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGracenotes_98ea.html" title="User talk:Gracenotes"><font color="#960">T</font></a></sup> § 20:31, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I haven't seen any recent bad calls.

<li>I accpeted Danny's explantion for Sean Black's promotion but felt that Carnildo's was clearly against consensus (which is oddly enough the opposite of my own oppinions of the candidates). Bureaucrats should not use their own judgments on a candidates accetability but rather consider the feelings of the community. If a substantial minority feels that admins must have attribute X then they must have it to have the consensus support of the community. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 05:15, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>If I can't trust the system which they were spawned from the foul creatures&#160;;) (Kidding of course...) then how can I trust them? As I said above, 1 oppose vote should in theory be able to negate an army of support votes. This is not the case &amp; bureacrats are partly to blame. Why I say they are partly not to blame is becuase if they ended a RfA because of one really valid oppose despite the 100's of supports, then they'd be ousted from the community... Other wise yes I trust them, but overall I don't.

<li>I totally agree with what the guy above is saying. Every time someone is made a bureaucrat, their screenname should be modified (all of them) so that anonymity might be maintained.

IMHO the current process gives bureaucrats too much dictatorial power - once SPAs and obvious trolls are discounted, the RfA <i>should</i> be decided on a majority vote.

<li>What do you mean by "consensus"? There is rarely consensus in non-unanimous RfAs these days. Bureaucrats often decide by supermajority, and only rarely dare to stray from the old 80% definition. I don't understand how people can believe a 73/27/7 RfA to be "no consensus" but a 165/35/27 RfA to have reached "consensus". In both cases, there is not really consensus to promote the candidate, as sizable minorities are opposing. However, what is important is not consensus, but whether the candidate should be promoted or not (which can be decided by taking into account the arguments provided). As there have been no complaints about Carnildo and Ryulong since their promotion, the bureucrats acted correctly in their decision to promote even though they ignored the supermajority requirements others think they should have used. Unfortunately the Carnildo promotion resulted in a lot of other bad things (none of which were related to Carnildo's admin actions since repromotion), which the closing crat might have anticipated better. Anyway, the bureaucrat's job in my opinion is not to determine whether consensus has been reached, but to make the decision whether to promote or not to promote in cases where there can't be any consensus due to the large number of participants in the debate. <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> <a href="../../../k/u/s/User_talk%7EKusma_087e.html" title="User talk:Kusma">(討論)</a> 16:10, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Votes supported by no evidence should be ignored entirely, and merely stating your agreement with someone else is no evidence. The consideration should <i>not</i> be the number of individuals, but the number and weight of the good arguments. Negative votes expressed over a dispute on a single article--unless the matter was so enormously bad that several people mention it, should not count for much.

<li>Of course. The question about lying looks like a red herring: good reasoning carries its own force and impact.

If an editor states something their own heart isn't behind, but that's legitimate and sways other opinions, then its own cogency legitimates it. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></font></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charge!</a></i></sup> 01:04, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Obviously. The <i>really</i> dumb ones already get filtered out, but - see my comment in the first section of this survey - I believe that discussion of particular rationales, in any section, should be encouraged, in contrast to the current 'don't badger the opposers' meme. Not only would good rationales be more thoroughly discussed, but a bit of natural selection could be applied to consistently bad ones. Explicitly disallowing certain positions is a terrible idea, as is requiring/expecting every supporter to post his own reasons when he only means 'I agree with the nominator'. <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 05:33, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Short answer: Yes. Longer answer: This is basically the way RfA already works. Someone who opposes because the candidate has <i>only</i> been editing for 364 days won't have their argument taken very seriously.

<li>By their very nature, some votes are of more merit than others (an oppose vote for vandalism is of far greater import than an oppose vote for not having enough Portal edits., for example.

There are also innumerable 'tag on' votes, 'per soandso' that really add nothing to the discourse. Votes of this nature, without substantitive argument to or from a wikipedia policy should be utterly discounted. Someone who puts forth strong rhetoric tied to the core policies, past practices and guidelines of wikipedia should be given more weight than a&#160;!vote that simply tags onto another's position.

<li>Agree on the condition that I get to pick the standards. Heck no, on the condition that I get to pick the votes that count! More seriously, all the suggestions for discounting vote standards I've seen so far are silly. "Per X" means that X wrote a well reasoned 15 sentence argument that I investigated and agree with, but don't feel like retyping word for word. 1FA is at least a theoretically reasonable criterion (which I wouldn't meet ... yet!) showing the admin seriously knows what good editing is, and has been through the whole process. Mainspace edits, talk page edits, etc., means the admin has participated in that part of the process, which I think is the most important part of being an admin. All these and others are at least potentially as reasonable as any others, and should not be discounted.

<li>All opinions are worthy of consideration, it's how those opinions are considered that is the issue. The real question is what weight ought to be given to those opinions, and in the proper context. That analysis is part of the discretion that is delegated to bureaucrats. Part of what people are being asked is whether or not they <i>trust</i> a nominee, which is in many ways a very personal matter. You can't tell someone to trust another by saying certain criteria make it so, or that someone is untrustworthy by other criteria. People are entitled to their opinion, and it's not always correct to say an opinion is true or not. It's the facts underlying the basis of the opinion and the rationale of the analysis of those facts that help determine whether or not the opinion ought to carry much weight. I don't think it's fair to disregard an opinion out of hand because it falls any particular category of response. Obviously, with some votes (opinions), it will not take much thought at all as to whether or not the opinion expressed ought to carry any weight or not. Again, this is an exercise of discretion based on the discussion. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 17:42, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Certainly in the abstract. But the community should do the weighing not the 'crats. This means that all (excluding anons, socks, and joke votes) should count more or less equally in determining community consensus, but not all votes are equally persuasive when a perspectiveparticipant reviews the RfA. In particular, votes with no (or an evasive) rationale or useful neither to the nominee or other participants (whereas per whomever votes show that certain veiws are widely shared which may be very useful.

<dd>There's a lot of parallels drawn about janitors and the 'mop and bucket' - this is all well and good. At the wikiversity I'm happy to have the rubbish removed, the floors mopped and entrust the keys to rooms to janitors. I'm less happy with allowing the janitors the say on who matriculates, who publishes work, who graduates. Great, lets have janitors, lets have specialists, but to maintain that intelligent people can't perform more than one function is more than a little hollow.

<li>Agree fully. Having admins who do not have much experience writing articles and dealing with other editors in that process will be creating admins who lack a basic understanding of those they should be helping with those tools. I believe that admins should be prepared to take up the slack on both mop tasks and writing. Getting admin tools should not pull away a great writer and in the same sense should not give a person who solely mops, less understanding of writing and a larger mop. I do not believe you can have a respected understanding without having constant experience, I am sure wikipedia has changed over time, and editing an article on SPAM is probably entirely different from an article on George Bush. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 16:30, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I tend to agree here. Admins are <s>forced</s> encouraged to deal with all sorts of situations - 3RR, POV pushing, and other general content issues which lead to behavioural misdemeanours - and to be lacking in this are will not benefit Wikipedia. <b><a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel.Bryant_22a1.html" title="User:Daniel.Bryant"><span style="color:#2E82F4">Daniel.Bryant</span></a></b> 04:12, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I have to dispute the term "forced to". In almost a year as an admin I've never dealt with a single 3RR issue. I'm just not interested in that area right at the moment.

<li>Absolutely!!! This <i>is</i> an encylopedia last time I checked? People aren't drawn to Wikipedia.org because of the chance of zapping vandals; no they are drawn because the site allows you to write an encyclopedia &amp; should be rewarded for doing so. Zapping vandals should only be a side activity that you get to do once you've proven yourself doing what the site was intended to be used for - writing. We don't make people admins for talking on talk pages, this is just a side activity like RC patrolling. If suddenly there was a shortage on vandals etc, then I garauntee there would be a load of inactive admins out there. That's why I suppose they get little respect, because people don't really think they do any real writing work. If more admins were elected on writing merits, then they'd be more respected &amp; there would be better articles all round.

Any sensible candidate will do their research before doing something in an unfamiliar area (e.g. today I added some items to Did You Know.

<li>Strongly disagree. Admins are trusted in two specific ways: 1) to competently carry out their duties in the areas they're familiar with, and 2) to recognize which areas they're unfamiliar with and to use a lot of restraint when using their admin bits in those areas. As long as they have enough experience to recognize what their limits are, then they'll be a suitable admin.

<li>Strongly disagree. If Wikipedia was a college, this would be akin to forcing janitors to have a Masters degree in Janitorology. We're just gnomes that do the will of the community as documented in the project policies and guidelines. We don't have to be featured article writers to block someone for making legal threats.

<li>People should be given adminship because it will make things easier for them to do something in particular. As Renesis13 says, if they know that they're inexperienced in an area, they shouldn't go jumping in there and doing controversial things without knowing what they're doing. Article writing is only important for an administrator as far as it develops knowledge of content policies (which can be obtained in other ways); but I wouldn't oppose an administrator just because they had no experience with images, for instance, or with interface messages, unless they wanted the tools for that reason. A user who wants admin tools to streamline vandalfighting shouldn't be opposed for a lack of article edits or of copyedits on the Main Page, and an admin who wants the tools to sort out technical problems with templates and interface messages shouldn't be opposed for lack of vandalfighting, for instance. --<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">ais523</a> 17:21, 16 February 2007 (<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">U</a><a href="../../../a/i/s/User_talk%7EAis523_6ca0.html" title="User talk:Ais523">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ais523_df26.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ais523">C</a>)</li>

<li>Certainly not. No person not spending full time here can possibly be effective in all the aspects of editorship. However, there should be some recent experience with it. For someone with no experiences in AfDs or in policy discussions, it becomes a valid question of just what purpose the adminship is intended.

<li>If an admin wants to work in a certain area (indicated by Q1), then surely they should have a bit of experience with it, but opposes because of "Wants to do X but doesn't have experience with it" are less-than-ideal. If experience in a process is more important than knowledge of policy and guidelines related to that process, then said policies and guidelines <i>direly, exigently need</i> to be rewritten. To further qualify, it's good for an admin to not be a total introvert, but otherwise, being weaker in certain areas is okay. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGracenotes_686d.html" title="User:Gracenotes"><font color="#960">Grace</font><font color="#000">notes</font></a><sup><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGracenotes_98ea.html" title="User talk:Gracenotes"><font color="#960">T</font></a></sup> § 20:44, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I disagree with this.

<li>Absolutely not. The fact that people will say "While they're good at reverting vandalism, this person has never helped with backlog, nor have they ever written a FA, nor have they joined a WikiProject..." is stupid in my opinion. Specialization is what makes this thing run. Most of the people who participate in process don't do much article writing, and vice versa.

<li>Specialized admins for specialized circumstances. All editors, admins or not, have the personal responsibility to contribute in areas they know, and to recognize their own limitations in areas they don't; if we can't trust someone to do that, then we probably don't want that person as an admin.

<li>I don't expect article editors to be all-rounders, and I don't expect admins to be so either. If people stick to what they are good at, enjoy doing, and have the free time to do, burnout rates will be much slower. Also, some areas of policy are very complicated: it is unrealistic to expect admins to have a complete knowledge of, for example, copyright policy/law - people go to law school for years to learn this sort of thing. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERje_9381.html" title="User:Rje">Rje</a> 20:01, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Let those who like doing dispute resolution get on with it, same goes for RC patrollers, image sorting, XfD, stubbing or any other area of Wikipedia. The mark of a good admin isn't that he/she is involved in every facet of Wikipedia because in the end their contribution to everything will be minimal. But that they undertand the workings of Wikipedia, where to find the information and more importantly how to use it if they are ever called to work in an area outside their normal comfort zone. We notice editors because of the exemplary work they do in a specific area, you don't then take a large percentage of their time away from that area and make them work somewhere else, which may not be of interest to them, just to fulfill some check boxes. You give them the tools and give them greater ownership of their area. <sup><a href="../../../k/h/u/User%7EKhukri_e3b4.html" title="User:Khukri"><b><font face="verdana" color="#6633CC">Khu</font></b></a><a href="../../../k/h/u/User_talk%7EKhukri_0ba4.html" title="User talk:Khukri"><b><font face="verdana" color="#CC66FF">kri</font></b></a></sup> 12:31, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strongly disagree.</b> Too many good candidates are rejected because of "not enough XfD activity" or "no vandal-fighting." Admins should know what they are not good at and not use the tools until they understand the particular area of Wikipedia. For example, I have no experience with images, so if I were an admin I wouldn't delete images until I had gained some experience. It's as simple as that. --<a href="../../../n/_/s/User%7EN_Shar_b1e6.html" title="User:N Shar">N Shar</a> 21:41, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Absolutely disagree</b>. There is a certain faction on Wikipedia that feels admins are here to "serve" content creators and so they must be content creators themselves. I see this POV being pushed everywhere, in RFA votes and elsewhere. The tasks of an admin are actually quite specific and limited, mainly dealing with problem users and evaluating consensus before closing debates. I have tried to nominate outstanding vandal-fighters in the past because I felt they could use the tools; they declined, citing concerns over lack of substantive edits. Admins need to be familiar with policy, effective at fighting abuse, and, above all else, diplomatic. Many admins in the faction I mentioned fail the last test. --<a href="../../../i/d/e/User%7EIdeogram_de1d.html" title="User:Ideogram">Ideogram</a> 22:37, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Disagree. Many users nowadays are being opposed because they don't know <i>everything</i>. Well, there's hundreds upon hundreds of <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kilobyte.html" title="Kilobyte">kilobytes</a> (or is it <a href="../../../k/i/b/Kibibyte.html" title="Kibibyte">kibibytes</a>) on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_policies_and_guidelines_a676.html" title="Category:Wikipedia policies and guidelines">Category:Wikipedia policies and guidelines</a>.

Still, I would be opposed for "lack of knowledge of image policy" in the current climate, just because I don't like to deal with images, regardless of whether I know the relevant image policy or not. The same occurs with others. Admins naturally specialize in tasks; it is human nature to do whatever one finds {amusing | comfortable | interesting}. There are processes that would collapse if one or two users stopped doing them, precisely due to specialization. What matters is whether an admin has the common sense to figure out what he/she is doing before doing it. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito<span style="color:#008000;">xd</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a>)</sup> 23:35, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Absolutely not.</b> I'm fine with "It is preferable for admins to be completely well-rounded," but this need not be a <i>should</i>. I certainly prefer an editor that has edited plenty of mainspace articles, but this 1) is not an absolute necessity, and 2) is not as important as having a lot of talk, user talk, and WP talk edits- gauging community opinions and reactions is far more important to being a sysop than writing FAs (or anything). But moreso, why I fall into the "No" category is because I don't feel that every admin needs to know every policy. If an admin does not deal with images, that's fine with me; if someone questions him/her about an image problem, he/she should direct the inquirer to an admin with more image experience. Obviously, all admins should know the ins and outs of Attribution, SNOW, IAR, and other vital policies and guidelines that could theoretically affect any and all debates. However, we don't need every admin to devote their time to vandalism, nor fair use criteria, nor any other single aspect of the encyclopedia. If I was running for adminship (which I have no plans of ever doing), I would be very open- I'd have no problem saying "I think you should support my adminship even though I don't have experience with FUC or on AIV, since I plan on focusing on [so on and so forth]," because I would gladly support a candidate who is strong in some areas when he/she has no aspirations of dealing with what he/she doesn't know. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 23:58, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Not at all. The only criterion should be "not likely to fuck up".

<li>In workplaces and sadly on Wikipedia, there is too much emphasis on people being a 'jack of all trades'. In relaity this can be useful if there is a shortage of skills, i.e. a small office, but on something like Wikipedia, there are more than enough people to go round to have focus and concentrate on one area only that they can really become specialists in, and I believe would better serve Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrincessBrat_4583.html" title="User:PrincessBrat">PrincessBrat</a> 11:06, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Isn't this what RFA decides, if the RFA participants believe strongly in a set of characteristics required in an admin, then they'll be the ones normally promoted.

<li>I don't think admins should necessarily be all-arounders, but I do think (and will&#160;!vote) that potential admins should have significant experience as <b>contributors</b>, not just process wonks or deleters. Anyone unfamiliar with the difficulties faced by people who try to contribute will not be sufficiently sympathetic to the people building the encyclopedia. Potential admins should spend *some* time dealing with the various processes - XfD, RfC, AN/* etc., also - they're going to need to learn a bunch of stuff once confirmed, but they should learn those things they can before they become admins. <span style="font-family:serif;font-size:120%"><b><a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">Αργυριου</a></b> <a href="../../../a/r/g/User_talk%7EArgyriou_e022.html" title="User talk:Argyriou">(talk)</a></span> 22:33, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Most of the time I think this is useful. However, there are the occassional trusted nominees that perform useful work in narrow areas where the admin bit makes that work much more efficient.

<li>Varied experience is a good thing, but it's not a must-have. Because we're struggling to handle the problems, some sorts of specialism are preferable, particularly those related to images and investigative work. I have real difficulty in seeing how an editor can understand Wikipedia without having made some efforts at content building. Everything else we do is secondary to, or supportive of, this main activity. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 17:16, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>"Allround" is too broad. But an admin should know processes as well as understand the idea behind the encyclopedia. For example, "deletion-only" admin functions will attract people with a deletionist point-of-view, which might introduce severe bias in deletion processes. --<a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt.

<li>My main criteria for RFA is if I know the candidate to be trustworthy and have fair reasoning ability. Given that the point of the site is to build the encyclopedia, a potential admin should show these skills in improving and expanding content. I expect some edits that show knowledge of policy, and don't mind if they end up specializing in purely administrative tasks once sysopped, but feel very uncomfortable with the thought of a body of admins whose actions are not mainspace-focused.

<li>It's fine. Flagrant abuse gets handled quickly, and if there are admins guilty of "low level abuse", then they can be Rfarb'd. If they aren't, then it's because the people who feel they're doing wrong aren't taking the time to present a case with evidence. I'm sometimes left with the impression that some people are looking for a way to basically just press a button and 'zap' an admin they disagree with without needing to do anything else. If that's the end result folks are looking for, it's a terrible, terrible idea. Each person who is an admin has worked hard to improve the project in different areas, and has often invested months if not years of work in the project. For someone to casually strip them of the admin bit is not only a slap in their face, but more importantly it's an end-run around the community who both supported them in their RFA and who might disagree with the objector. De-adminship needs to be both A: Possible and B: Something that requires a bit of effort. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChairboy_157e.html" title="User:Chairboy">C<small>HAIRBOY</small></a> (<a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChairboy_882d.html" title="User talk:Chairboy">☎</a>) 17:33, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Agree; administrators are dealt with appropriately. I'd be open to another proposal, but I don't think you could protect it from tampering, and then there's the "looking over my shoulder" attitude that an admin might be prone to take. The one case I was involved with where an administrator overstepped their boundaries was Freestylefrappe, and he/she was de-adminned rather speedily, I thought. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315">talk</a>) 17:59, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>If an admin is chronically abusing his or her tools (and even constructing a false sense of superiority to facilitate abuse) <i>after</i> discussion occurs, then an ArbCom case might be needed. It's important, however, that de-sysopping loses some of the connotations that it shares with community bans; evidenced by de-admins leaving Wikipedia permanently. If wikidrama could be purposefully decreased by mediators, then ArbCom seems like a good route to go for such a (usually) drastic action. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGracenotes_686d.html" title="User:Gracenotes"><font color="#960">Grace</font><font color="#000">notes</font></a><sup><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGracenotes_98ea.html" title="User talk:Gracenotes"><font color="#960">T</font></a></sup> § 20:54, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>By and large, yes. Remember, the majority of admin "abuse" is defined highly subjectively and consists, at root, of doing something <i>I don't like</i> rather than something that's against policy. It should be easier to register an ArbCom case for abuse of admin privileges, given that RfCs on admins as with all editors who do anythign even remotely controversial tend to become a cesspit, and posts of <a href="../../../r/o/u/WP%7EROUGE_ace2.html" title="WP:ROUGE">rouge admin abuse</a> are daily fare at the noticeboards; an impartial review and quick accept or strikeout would be useful, but in the end the genuinely abusive admins get desysopped and the ones who have a bad day do not, which is as it should be. The textbook case here is MONGO: ArbCom did the right thing both times, and for the right reasons. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 23:21, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I just don't see a problem with too many evil admins running amok.

<li>I can think of a few abusive admins who really need to have their bit taken away. However, there are no processes by which one can nominate for deadminship - someone has to edit war for a very, very long time before ArbCom take it on, low level abuse is simply ignored. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDev920_f8f8.html" title="User:Dev920">Dev920</a> (Have a nice day!) 15:52, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The current process takes much too long, requires an Arbcom hearing.

<li>It's too difficult to remove them, because it needs too great a consensus on persistent wrong behavior; the standard should be set somewhat lower, because we really have no subsequent appeal over most individual decisions. I agree that all admins should be open to recall, but I can easily see how this can be abused &amp; it would need safeguards, such as not more than once a year. There should also be a way of encouraging inactive admins to give up the position--it should be a working position, not primarily a prestige position.<b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 19:07, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>No. De-adminship, besides the worst of the worst, is only possible when there is a wronged party who is extremely wiki-experienced, perserverent, and above all innocent of any past wrong-doing themselves. There should be an effort by neutral parties to ensure admins maintain high standards. Or at the least a neutral party should look into admin conduct when there is a complaint. Leaving inexperienced, confused complaintants to file RFC's against admins is a horrible way of doing things. The lack of people commenting on admin RFC's is disgraceful. Dispute resolution is in much worse shape than RFA (and in my opinion more important).--<i><font color="#9966FF">Birgitte</font><font color="#CC99CC" size="2">SB</font></i> 20:41, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>NO!</b> Beyond what Birgitte says, part of the problem is structural, because admins have life tenure - if admins had limited terms, those who were abusive would be much less likely to be reconfirmed, which would solve the problem of low-level abusive admins, after a time. The current process too often turns legitimate complaints by users into character assassinations of the user, or exercises in stonewalling by a united front of admins protecting their own. <span style="font-family:serif;font-size:120%"><b><a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">Αργυριου</a></b> <a href="../../../a/r/g/User_talk%7EArgyriou_e022.html" title="User talk:Argyriou">(talk)</a></span> 22:39, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>God no! The system isn't working right now. There are admins who abuse their rights every-so-often, but because the way it is set up, unless the abuse is very obvious, long-time members get 'get out of jail free' cards and sometimes ArbCom doesn't except the cases that really need to be reviewed. Thus system is broken. — <a href="../../../m/o/e/User_talk%7EMoe_Epsilon_62b6.html" title="User talk:Moe Epsilon"><font color="#000000">Moe</font></a> 23:51, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>No blame to ArbCom which is doing the best that it can, but there needs to be a way of remiing admins who have lost the trust of the community without all the time and difficulty of an arbitration preceeding. Someone can demonstrate that they are not an asset to the project as a sysop without the kind of flagrant policy violations that are currently required. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 05:27, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The real problem area is not abuse - there are recent cases which prove that abuse is quickly dealt with - but negative net value as Eluchil404 says. Not simple to prove to arbcom, and requires extreme measures for something that ideally should be easy to deal with. The current system doesn't correspond with the idea that sysop rights are "not a big deal". I feel that most RfA problems are down to the perceived difficulty of removing incompetent, tendentious, and generally dimwitted admins. We have surprisingly few of these, but they do tend to stand out. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 12:33, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Certainly not. It's not Arbcom's fault; in the cases they recieve, they do very well in this context; people are desysopped if they deserve to be, and are not if otherwise. The issue here is that you have to be insane to <i>want</i> to be involved in an Arbcom case, and an arbitration process is not friendly to the newcomers who are the most likely victims of bad admins. I'm sure there's at least one admin that should be desysopped, but we don't know about it because the only people affected, for some reason or another, will not initiate formal dispute resolution. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">moo!</a></small> 16:25, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strongest possible "NO".</b> While I fully respect most every arbitration ruling, it should not take dozens of people and weeks (if not months) of time to desysop someone who is clearly abusing the tools. The fact that there is no way to simply request deadminship via a&#160;!voting process similar to RfA is, in my opinion, a big mistake. I know there have been many policy proposals regarding deadminship in the past, and I'm disappointed that none of them have stuck. In short, it is <i>far</i> too difficult to remove adminship, and it is <i><b>unfair</b></i> to the community that there is no way to state displeasure with an admin's actions that will have any sort of impact. And then, of course, there are the cases of admins who have themselves been blocked multiple times for disruption or warring, yet still have the mop; this is criminal. I feel that perhaps the single biggest problem with WP is deadminship- that admins can sometimes get away with unchecked abuse, and that there's a fairly good process to allow the community to show approval, yet little if any way to show disapproval. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 00:10, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>This "under a cloud" verbiage is nonsense. Stripped of bit, bit gone. Not stripped of bit, bit stays utill competent authority strips bit. No more, no less. Arbcom needs to step up and take a stand - not let people get harassed off the project and then sanction this behavior. How to get rid of an admin in two steps? 1. File RFAR. 2. Harass admin.

<li>There needs to be a better way of deadminning admins who abuse the tools without having to drag it through arbcom, whilst still rejecting, quickly, any frivolous requests for desysopping.

<li>The issue isn't so much that de-adminship is handled incorrectly. People who should be removed as admins are, eventually, and if they quit the project, I can't say that I would feel the loss of someone who warranted de-adminship that badly. I don't see any way to make the process faster while still maintaining good decisions. Similarly, I can only think of one case where I even suspect that someone might have been desysopped improperly, and that's borderline. The current Arbcom system doesn't scale, either, but that's easily solved by electing more arbitrators; it's not like there is a deficiency of people who would make good ones. My issue is the same as Hipocrite's; it is far too easy to use the process as a sword to harass an admin who's done nothing wrong. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">moo!</a></small> 18:55, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Opinions of established <i>editors</i> of this site matter. The only ones that don't are the ones who create fresh accounts to troll or disrupte on RFA.

<li>I rarely participate at RFA because I like to interact with an editor down in the trenches before I form an opinion. I recently nominated an editor for the first time (what I hope will become the first of many) and was flattered to see several responses that stated my support of the editor was a factor in their decisions. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></font></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charge!</a></i></sup> 01:12, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree, insofar as a well-reasoned vote will sway other voters, whereas a poorly reasoned vote will not. If my opinion is damning yet is opposed 100-1 I would expect to be "ignored", this is the fundamental nature, and flaw, of having a democratic system. Would an elitist democratic system, perhaps allowing votes only from admins, bureaucrats etc., produce "better" results? Maybe it would, maybe it wouldn't, but is that really a road we want to go down? I, for one, wouldnot want to. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERje_9381.html" title="User:Rje">Rje</a> 23:55, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think that my opinion or anyone's provided it is backed up and sensible can turn an RfA or at least sink it if an oppose.

<li>Very much so.

<li>It is, but giving discretion exclusively to bureaucrats is a flawed way to handle this. While I trust bureaucrats to do this correctly, there are candidates who may apply multiple times, and if one or two people are rejecting them left and right, it appears cabal-like (even though there may be legitimate reasons for denial). Vote rationales should certainly be considered- when I stood for adminship, I had 2846 edits (which was 2-3x what some people had going for adminship). Today, people would oppose me for too few edits. Sure, AWB, VF and other automated programs add to people's edits, and should be taken into account; however, if a user has showed dedicated work toward the project and is judged to be trustworthy, there should be no real reason to oppose. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315">talk</a>) 18:02, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, and it is only necessary to look at any RfA to see this. There appears to be a considerable amount of canvassing, which indicates that this is a major consideration. I do not think anyone unpopular should be an admin, because the community is unlikely to be satisfied by her/his decisions. But popularity should not be the major positive factor.

<li>I agree and I cite myself as an example. Especially when I first started voting on RfAs, I would pick whatever side looked right (i.e. had more votes.) Now I make sure to look into the candidate myself and base my vote on that. However, as I used to be one who would "jump on the bandwagon", there are certainly others who do that same thing. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_panda_d8a7.html" title="User:Captain panda"><font color="orange">Captain</font> <font color="red">panda</font></a> <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptain_panda_3940.html" title="User talk:Captain panda"><font color="teal">In</font></a> <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_panda_Autograph_Book_f2a2.html" title="User:Captain panda/Autograph Book"><font color="green">vino</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Captain_panda_0806.html" title="Special:Contributions/Captain panda"><font color="indigo">veritas</font></a> 23:54, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>To some extent, yes, despite naysayers. It's a fact that cannot be denied. Popularity plays a role in RfAs. I've seen some pass with 25 supports and others with 225 supports. However, the results are the same, but numbers do reflect upon one's popularity (or lack thereof) in the Wikipedia community. --<sup><a href="../../../p/h/y/User_talk%7EPhysicq210_4b59.html" title="User talk:Physicq210"><font color="#000000">210</font></a></sup><b><a href="../../../p/h/y/User%7EPhysicq210_ccba.html" title="User:Physicq210"><font color="#0000C0" face="Comic Sans MS">physicq</font></a></b> (<i><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Physicq210_25e9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Physicq210"><font color="#0000C0">c</font></a></i>) 20:41, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>It does seem to largely be a popularity contest, but I don't really see how it could be otherwise. If anything it's an <i>un</i>popularity contest. All it takes is one or two oppose voters with some axe to grind, and the opposes will snowball like mad, based not on the incoming oppose-voters' own experiences with the candidate, but on agreement with whatever (AGF, etc.) that the original opposer raise as something important that the candidate has allegedly transgressed.

<li>RFA often reflects popularity, but a 20/2/2 result is the same as a 200/2/2 result.

<dd>Definitely can - at least 4 admins come immediately to my mind with whom I find myself in frequent content conflict, whose personalities I think are poorly suited to content editing and talk page resolutions of disputes about content, but whom I trust to do a pretty good job of adminning, just not of article writing.

<li>Yes, popularity matters, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. A different way of saying "popularity" is "trust by the community." I certainly don't want to have bureaucrats appoint people who can't get along with the community. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 17:15, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>RfA is not a popularity contest overall, but it's certainly clear that some nominations involve worthy candidates who are also popular. I have no qualms about supporting a good nominee who co-incidentally happens to be popular, but it bugs me when there are multiple pile-on co-nominations. In those cases, at best it certainly comes across as a popularly contest , and at worst it comes across as peer pressure or intimidation. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 17:47, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Popularity at Wikipedia isn't like popularity in high school: here it isn't earned by how much acne exists on your face or whether you dress well. It's about whether you've been an active and productive member in the community who collaborates well. That, by and large, amounts to some good reasons for sysopping. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></font></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charge!</a></i></sup> 01:15, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>And the point is <i>what</i>? Popularity here is based on your participation, demeanor and behaviour.

<li>To the extent that popular people will get a lot of support and unpopular people won't, sure. But that's not a bad thing; as above, 'popular' here <i>usually</i> means 'well regarded'. There are a few cases where users who specialize in deletion - especially image deletion and fair-use enforcement - get clobbered for their choice of policies to specialize in. <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 05:53, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I agree with Durova that popularity on Wikipedia isn't the high-school, "starting quarterback" type where someone is liked based on superficial things.

<li>RfA isn't entirely a popularity contest. No doubt it does have an effect but a popular user could still fail if they have some recent bad edits. I don't think admins should be promoted purely by the crats. It would lead to distrust and they would be accused of forming a "bureaucrat cabal" who only promote for popularity reasons. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames086_6f65.html" title="User:James086"><font face="comic sans ms" color="#454545">James086</font></a><sup><a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJames086_1a79.html" title="User talk:James086"><font color="darkgreen">Talk</font></a></sup> 23:01, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Mcginnly gets it right. Of course it is easier to support (or oppose) someone with whom one has had previous interaction with; that is not a bad thing. It is human nature. Opposing someone <i>because</i> one has had no interactions with him or is senseless, though. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito<span style="color:#008000;">xd</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a>)</sup> 23:43, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think some of them are (<i>and some are judged more on merit...</i>) but thats not automatically a bad thing. If our community holds up particular standards, and the ones who are popular are those who hold those standards, then making it a popularity contest is positive. However, non-positive standards become more popular then "popularity contests" become a negative. Right now I think it boils down to "person who breaks stuff"="unpopular person"="never become admin". Then again, I'm not particularly popular. I think my RFA was more of a result of my skills and knowledge. ---<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User%7EJ.smith_e018.html" title="User:J.smith">J.S</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User_talk%7EJ.smith_6ef6.html" title="User talk:J.smith">T</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_J.smith_698b.html" title="Special:Contributions/J.smith">C</a>/<a href="../../../w/r/e/WP%7EWRE_9138.html" title="WP:WRE">WRE</a>)</small> 05:19, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>First, I agree completely with Doug Bell's statement above.

<li>The bureaucrats are where they are because the community trusts them to Do What's Right. If the community finds the trust misplaced, the tools exist (RfC, Rfar, etc) to fix the problem.

<li>About right.

<li>Yes, generally acceptable. Was tempted to put myself under "Too low, it's too easy to pass", because if there's a problem, it's on the too easy side, but only mildly so.

<li>They're acceptable, but too rigid. Witness the controversy when someone <i>dared</i> to promote at .6 percent under the "discretion range".

<li>I lose faith when candidates who "know the 'crats" slide in with low margins. If the reasoning behind the promotion of Carnildo's and Ryulong's RFAs was extended to every other RFA, I'd be fine with it, but it's a selective kind of "you're in and you're out" spiel with some successful and failed RFAs. <a href="../../../h/b/d/User%7EHbdragon88_4994.html" title="User:Hbdragon88">Hbdragon88</a> 00:50, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm uncomfortable with the appearance of cherry-picking pointed out by Hbdragon. It's important that every candidate gets a fair shake - and that the 'voting' community believes that. In general, there's entirely too much emphasis (by "watchers", not bureaucrats) on beancounting - people seemed to think it mattered that Kafziel's second nomination changed by a percentage point after the official ending time passed. <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 06:05, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think I'm cherry picking - it's just been my experience with RFA. I seldom participate - I can count the number of times I've actually voted on one hand (Splash, Newyorkbrad, Ryulong, Carnildo). I dislike supporitng because it tends to be pile-on, and I think that my opposes have more merit than my supports. I opposed on Ryulong 3 and Carnildo 3, and in both instances the 'crat decided to promote. During the discussion after Ryulong's promotion, when I discovered other candidates who had gotten 75% or so and did not succeed, and Ryulong/Carnildo passing with far lower margins, I don't feel like my opinion mattered, only the relationship. <a href="../../../h/b/d/User%7EHbdragon88_4994.html" title="User:Hbdragon88">Hbdragon88</a> 07:17, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I do not really have an issue with the bar being too high. Whenever there has been an apparently pressing need, we have promoted a qualified candidate. If there are no pressing backlogs and the bureaucrat corps do not ask for an additional pair of hands to help, I see no real urgency to promote just because someone feels it would be cool to be a bureaucrat. Fundamentally, I do not feel it is meritorious to have a large pool of bureaucrats with nothing to do, it just smells of ego-massaging to me. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERje_9381.html" title="User:Rje">Rje</a> 00:13, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Too high, especially with the mass of "no need for any more" opposes. --<b><a href="../../../m/a/j/User%7EMajorly_3081.html" title="User:Majorly"><font color="blue">Majorly</font></a></b> <sub><a href="../../../m/a/j/User_talk%7EMajorly_3c0f.html" title="User talk:Majorly"><font color="green">(o rly?)</font></a></sub> 16:16, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Far too high (although at the moment the 'crats are holding up fine; we don't need any more, but that isn't a reason to prevent extra 'crattings), because numbers as high as 90% fail to have anything much to do with consensus. Think about it; an oppose vote (which might be for a spurious reason) cancels out 9 support votes, so whether someone is cratted or not in a moderately close case will depend not on arguments, but whether the size of a support pileon is smaller or larger than an effectively random number (9 times the oppose count; I consider this to be a random number because there's often a few oddball opposes in any RfA/RfB). This effect doesn't happen so much in RfA because 3 is a sufficiently smaller number than 9 that the spurious opposes mostly don't make a difference. --<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">ais523</a> 17:33, 16 February 2007 (<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">U</a><a href="../../../a/i/s/User_talk%7EAis523_6ca0.html" title="User talk:Ais523">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ais523_df26.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ais523">C</a>)</li>
<li>Way too high. It turns into a straight pileon contest. Considering the limited ability a 'crat has to actually do harm, the 9/1 strength ratio of an oppose to a suppose is ridiculous. Also, in response to the perenial "we don't need any more beaurocrats" argument, keep in mind that this is a <b>volunteer project</b>. None of the 'crats are paid, they are here because they want to. Each time a valid 'crat candidate is rejected on this basis, the opposers are essentially saying "I have no interest in reducing your workload" to the remaining crats. Since the folks who have gotten to that position love the project (as evidenced by their hard work), this creates extra stress that's simply unneeded and shows a lack of empathy. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChairboy_157e.html" title="User:Chairboy">C<small>HAIRBOY</small></a> (<a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChairboy_882d.html" title="User talk:Chairboy">☎</a>) 17:43, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Way too high expectations, we'll never get another bureaucrat if we keep this up. Also, so many users say just because we <i>"don't have a shortage of bureaucrats, we don't need anymore"</i>. What crap. Just because we don't have a shortage, doesn't mean we couldn't use them. I think you should look at these, as RfAs, from the standpoint of <i>"Is this user going to abuse the tools?"</i> If the answer is no, then give it to them. They deserve it, after hard-work on Wikipedia, especially if thats what the user was eventually expecting to get when they joined (say, a few years ago), but now that policies (unofficial) have changed, they think they'll never achieve it.

<li>If either Essjay, Taxman or Redux decreases his level of activity, things get delayed.

<li>Of the three bureaucrat tasks, renaming users, flagging bots and promoting admins. The first seem fairly trivial, the second is determined by the bot approvals group (though I guess a crat could refuse to do so in extreme cases). This mainly leaves the latter which is to most people quite significant and has caused much unrest in some cases. If RFB as it stands is the way to do it, then I think it's only right that a high standard is demanded, but I'm not convinced it's the best way to select them at all (Don't ask I haven't come up with a good and practical alternative yet.) --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 19:40, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have not heard anyone complain about a backlog in crat tasks. The constant backlog in admin tasks is why you never hear the "don't need more" argument. One benefit of a smaller number of crats is that it reduces the incentive to pass the buck due to collective responsibility, which may be an issue with the large number of admins. (If it's everyone's responsibility to close AFDs, it's nobody's responsibility.) While potentially hurt feelings are a downside, someone who is experienced enough to go for crathood should know enough about how these things work that it wouldn't be an issue. - <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree">Banyan</a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanyanTree_059e.html" title="User talk:BanyanTree">Tree</a> 17:34, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>depends on extent-- if they seem to be learning to be civil. Not that an uncivil admin will necessarily do a bad job, but she/he's much more likely to cause resentment. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 19:18, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Very important. Losing one's cool is acceptable when it is followed by an apology. Admins should set the tone. No matter how great an admin is when they are uncivl they encourage uncivil responses and incivilty will spread wherever they go. Even trolls should be handled with civilty because you never know when you have misjudged someone or met them on their worst day. It is better to come across as patronizing than incivil.--<i><font color="#9966FF">Birgitte</font><font color="#CC99CC" size="2">SB</font></i> 21:16, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Definitely, definitely. Uncivil admins are far more likely to act rashly under stress, even if they apologize afterward.

<li>Civility is the number three criteria after trust (#1) and judgement (#2).

<li>Not as concerned as most. Persistent rudeness should not be tolerated, but cranky replies to trolls are completely forgivable.

<li>This is heavily intwined with "trust" to me.

<li>Very important in my opinion. Admins get a lot of crap and if someone can't handle it, I don't think they're fit to be an admin. If someone was in-civil 6 months ago and without any signs since that's fine though, they probably learned since then. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames086_6f65.html" title="User:James086"><font face="comic sans ms" color="#454545">James086</font></a><sup><a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJames086_1a79.html" title="User talk:James086"><font color="darkgreen">Talk</font></a></sup> 10:09, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I would prefer frank incivility to smug autocratic ignorance.

<li>Fairly important, but my expectations are on the low side. So long as the editor understands that we have standards, and tries to meet them, that'll usually do me.

<li>If there is no participation in process, how can we properly assess the candidate?

<li>Administrators are here to do the things that would cause havoc if everyone could do them, normally on request from other users (<a href="../../../c/s/d/CAT%7ECSD_4339.html" title="CAT:CSD">CAT:CSD</a>, <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a>, <a href="../../../r/f/p/WP%7ERFPP_fba0.html" title="WP:RFPP">WP:RFPP</a>, <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/r/CAT%7EPER_8966.html" title="CAT:PER">CAT:PER</a>, etc.), although of course they can take such actions themselves if they would come across a situation where they'd otherwise request them. It's quite rare that there's a major row on AN/I over admin behaviour, and even rarer that there is actually a problem with the admin. Yes, I know that sometimes admins cause trouble and need desysopping, but that's sufficiently rare that I'm using this section (after all, it says 'overall', which can be treated as 'mostly'). --<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">ais523</a> 17:42, 16 February 2007 (<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">U</a><a href="../../../a/i/s/User_talk%7EAis523_6ca0.html" title="User talk:Ais523">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ais523_df26.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ais523">C</a>)</li>
<li>The main problem isn't the quality of their work, its the fact that there is too vast an amount of work to go around.

<li>Everyone makes mistakes, and no process isn't going to let some bad eggs slip through.

<li>Of course not every admin is good, but the phrasing of the next option is prejudicial. That phrasing means that a vote here would somehow indicate that there are <i>no</i> bad admins, rather than what it should indicate, which is that bad admins is not a significant issue. —<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Bell_8398.html" title="User:Doug Bell">Doug&#160;Bell</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoug_Bell_81b5.html" title="User talk:Doug Bell">talk</a></sup> 02:32, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Overall, yes. Agree with the above that the section titles are not well worded, but in general I don't think that admins as a group consist of a bunch of mostly-okay people and a few 'bad eggs' who would be stripped of their bit forthwith if only we had an effective mechanism of desysopping. It's more like a bunch of mostly-okay people who mostly make good decisions but have a distribution of error rates, and someone has to be in the tails. <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 06:37, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>The number of avoidable genuine errors in outcome - as opposed to trivial faults according to some obscure and ill-worded process - seems remarkably low to me. As Opabinia regalis says, the bottom end of the distribution is always going to be populated. Overall I am more than satisfied with performance. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 13:32, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ol>
<li>Agree, but it's like any walk of life - the trick is to have the mechanisms in place to remove the bad eggs and an intitutional culture, structure and the will to do it. --<a href="../../../m/c/g/User%7EMcginnly_76e7.html" title="User:Mcginnly">Mcginnly</a> | <a href="../../../m/c/g/User_talk%7EMcginnly_e9ad.html" title="User talk:Mcginnly">Natter</a> 15:36, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Strongly, especially in the deletion processes. Deletion abuse is one of the major issues we're facing right now. It has gotten better <i>as a whole</i> as some notoriously bad eggs have resigned, left the project, or been deadminned. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 15:54, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Agree with Mcginley - possibly Arbcom should have a separate branch to investigate admins accused of abuse? <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDev920_f8f8.html" title="User:Dev920">Dev920</a> (Have a nice day!) 16:03, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Agree with all above. --<b><a href="../../../m/a/j/User%7EMajorly_3081.html" title="User:Majorly"><font color="blue">Majorly</font></a></b> <sub><a href="../../../m/a/j/User_talk%7EMajorly_3c0f.html" title="User talk:Majorly"><font color="green">(o rly?)</font></a></sub> 16:23, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Agreed, and the process for removing the bad takes too long. I support the idea by Dev920, maybe we need a special commission in a way, all groups with power have checks and balances specifically for them. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 17:36, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>There are always bad eggs; I would argue, however, that the bad eggs (and I can't think of any in particular off the top of my head) should be taken to RFAr immediately. Many felt Philwelch was a bad egg; he's been taken to ArbCom and has lost his adminship. It's that simple, if they're truly bad eggs. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315">talk</a>) 18:15, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Right, there always will be problems. Some of them are fixable--admins after making bad decisions sometimes say they've been on WP too long &amp; were getting tired. Some are not--even the best of conduct during a probationary period or during pre-adminship does not necessarily mean it will continue. To diminish the odium of desysopping, there should be some way to get an admin not to participate in some particular parts of process--e.g. someone blocking too much, or speedying too much, or refusing to undelete into userspace.--just like there can be a block to prevent someone from editing a particular group of articles. We perhaps need not just a special commission, but an audit--there should be routine visible records kept of each admin's actions, and whether they've been overturned, without having to analyze their very long contribution record every time. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 19:42, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>This is probably the closest to the the truth. But the corps of admins is not divided into bad eggs the need removal and good eggs that need to be left to their own devices. What is really needed is a some sort of feedback or performance review which allows all admins to improve while exposing the unreformable.--<i><font color="#9966FF">Birgitte</font><font color="#CC99CC" size="2">SB</font></i> 21:33, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I feel they're doing a very good job overall, considering they are human. What the definition of "bad eggs" is tends to differ between many editors. <i><a href="../../../y/u/s/User_talk%7EYuser31415_0c1d.html" title="User talk:Yuser31415">Yuser31415</a></i> 22:40, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Mostly, though many otherwise good admins have become a little too quick to assume bad faith when dealing with anyone who questions their judgement. There are a small number of admins who should be deadminned last year. <i>I have a little list</i>. <span style="font-family:serif;font-size:120%"><b><a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">Αργυριου</a></b> <a href="../../../a/r/g/User_talk%7EArgyriou_e022.html" title="User talk:Argyriou">(talk)</a></span> 23:19, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>For the most part, they're good. We hear overblown cases from like what? Like 1% of all admins? We have over 1000 of them now, and the fact that we've dealt with abuse with what? 20? 30?

<li>Although many of them are understanding, caring &amp; easy going characters, a few "bad eggs" are mixing into wikipedia. A couple are even supporting the above option of "admins are doing alright". They strut around like officious peacocks, superimposing their strict rules &amp; talking down to you like one of their children. They delete &amp; block without warning &amp; think they are above the law. I think someone up there knows I'm talking about him. These admins in my view are the ones who are pulled through the corrupt RfA system by their cabal of friends (See my above answers to the questions in this survey). It is these admins that give RfAs a bad name - If all admins were well rounded &amp; perfect examples, then I doubt that we'd be having this survey. The very fact that people are questioning the RfA system shows that there are in fact bad admins out there that should never have gotten through. The funny thing is, is that there will always be bad admins that get through &amp; this means the RfA system will always be under question. The fact is, you can't please everyone.

<li>I speak to the deletion processes, as that is my personal "expertise". Overall, I feel the admins are doing a very good job handling deletions.

<ol>
<li>Arbcom currently has two different levels of sanction on admins; nothing or desysopping. There's no sort of temporary desysopping, no admin probation, no bans from using specific powers, etc... So if an admin isn't <i>terrible</i>, they can get nothing more than "Bad admin!

<li>Strongly. It's too difficult to have poor admins held accountable in any real way, especially without being accused of a witchhunt. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 15:54, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>The only current action that can be taken against admins is to desysop them. Consequently, if an admin is good at reducing backlogs but, say, persistently harrasses a user they don't like, that is ignored. Admin abuse is one of the biggest problems on Wikipedia - heavy users leave over it, and we can't afford to lose them. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDev920_f8f8.html" title="User:Dev920">Dev920</a> (Have a nice day!) 16:07, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Agreed, the very first step is "dispute resolution" of which takes time. I am not saying you ignore this process, but lets follow the steps. You tell the admin on their talk page you felt offended, etc. Now if you are ignored or further offended, you need to goto a 3rd party mediator, if they refuse mediation, then you goto AN/I where other admins judge if you have merit. From there you goto RfC, which usually is highly watched by other admins (obviously). If that doesnt turn around on you for every bad thing you once did, and doesnt get resolved, then you goto Arbcom. Arbcom is particularly bad because those making accusation for abuse from the admin, are scrutinized as well. Imagine complaining about a cop and being told that you were being cited for something you did 2 months ago ... leaves a bad taste. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 17:39, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, and Amarkov's idea for admin probation is a good way to handle it. Immediate de-sysopping is a bad, bad idea, unless an admin blocks all IP addresses with a range block, or goes on a vital articles deletion spree. It should be thought-out and processed, and that's why stewards do it. There should be middle line between losing nothing and losing everything. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGracenotes_686d.html" title="User:Gracenotes"><font color="#960">Grace</font><font color="#000">notes</font></a><sup><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGracenotes_98ea.html" title="User talk:Gracenotes"><font color="#960">T</font></a></sup> § 21:22, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, but we need primarily a way to deal with correcting the minor problems, and some sort of reprimand process as suggested above s--for example, a short block on adminship, would do nicely. But I do not think many admins who would be willing to do this to other admins.

<li>Major boy-who-cried-wolf situation. There are so many trolls and nogoodniks whining about admin abuse that legitimate complaints - usually framed when the complainer is angry, frustrated, and not communicating as clearly as he would after some distance from the situation - get swamped in the din. At the other extreme, desysoppings have occurred for minor missteps, even those that occurred mostly in the course of <i>editing</i> disputes. I don't have any good ideas on how to fix this without putting out the welcome mat for trolls and perennial complainers, though. <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 06:46, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Definitely. I have nearly 30,000 edits and no blocks, but admin misconduct - against which in reality there is no recourse for non-admins who do not wish to undergo great stress in a nearly hopeless cause - drove me away for seven months. An unacceptable proportion of admins become arrogant about their status. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalJW_41ef.html" title="User:CalJW">CalJW</a> 00:25, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I want to see the admins shaking in their boots. If I ever become admin, I want to shake in my boots. Why do you think that the revolution was so successful &amp; gave birth to an outburst of democracy? Because the government should be afraid of the people not the other way round! If admins want to go around like officals &amp; think they're holier than thou, thou should be prepared to be reviewed &amp; held accountable for asny mistakes they make. Period. I'll love the day when an admin isn't given slack for incivilty or Jimbo Wales is blocked for 24 hours for acting like God. Don't take it the wrong way Jimbo, but I'm making a point here... Admins should have no different treatment to the layman editor. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpawn_Man_fbc1.html" title="User:Spawn Man">Spawn Man</a> 02:25, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>When admins and editors are actually regarded equally (they should be now, but theres always bias), then there won't be a problem.

<li>Per <a href="../../../g/a/i/User%7EGaillimh_1708.html" title="User:Gaillimh">User:Gaillimh</a>, I now find out Admins have the right to vanish and return under new user names, and have those new user names adminstratored, with no links to the old name. There is now no ability for me to do something I can't find and complain about - edit war over an article, vanish, return, and use their admin powers on it. <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 12:11, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Ideally, yes. But as Opabinia regalis states, the devil is in the details. Half of the complaints of "admin abuse" actually boil down to "He disagreed with me", which wastes everyone's time and causes most complaints to be ignored. That said, major issues need to be addressed without having to kick things to Arbcom or Jimbo. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito<span style="color:#008000;">xd</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a>)</sup> 00:06, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>In the case of anything but a block, the easiest appeal is to ignore the admin. In the case of a block, the easiest appeal is to create a new account--though some proportion of editors will take a yet easier course, and just leave. In any case, there is practically no incentive but pure obstinacy for a wronged user to attempt to bring the admin to reckoning. Therefore we should expect that most abuse is undetected. -ac</li>
<li>I'd say almost all admin actions I see look fine. The scariest thing to see is admins taking a heavy hand with articles and editors where it's obvious they're highly biased about the topic or the editor. Sometimes the admin will wave a "I've never edited this article" flag as if it's some kind of proof of neutrality. Well. As everyone has biases, and some of our most experienced admins are heavily biased, there needs to be a way to say, "Thanks for the work you do, but we're going to make you stay away from this spot here." And incivility by admins needs to be called on more often. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClayoquot_bbe3.html" title="User:Clayoquot">Kla'quot</a> 06:27, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>There actually aren't all that many "trolls and nogoodniks" stirring up trouble. There are a few but there are some really bad admins who do some rotten things! I think we need to be stricter. Admins should be routinely desysopped for things like protecting pages they are involved in conflicts in, deleting pages in the same circumstances, wheelwarring, committing blockable offences. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 09:38, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Admins are still editors, just with a couple of extra buttons on their screens. They/we should be just as accountable for our actions as regular editors, etc. A higher profile due to vandal-fighting or closing XfA debates doesn't indicate a defensive position on the moral high ground. <a href="../../../%28/a/e/User_talk%7E%28aeropagitica%29.html" title="User talk:(aeropagitica)">(aeropagitica)</a> 17:42, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yes, it's too difficult to get any consequences for admin misbehavior. I think this is a big part of why it's so hard to pass an RfA, and I fear that we're turning away good candidates because folks are concerned that once you're an admin, you're an admin for life unless you do something really horrible. To me the idea that admins have to be free to make unpopular decisions doesn't work because it seems to me that if it really was the right decision, you'd be supported by policy and there would be enough people to back you up. Decisions about right and wrong behavior have to be decided by consensus, not a small minority. <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelldot_cc92.html" title="User:Delldot"><font color="#990066">delldot</font></a> <small><a href="../../../d/e/l/User_talk%7EDelldot_82a5.html" title="User talk:Delldot"><font color="#8B00FF">talk</font></a></small> 18:02, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I believe they can, and think the influx of admins needs to be met with a removal of admin powers from those not using them enough. This is not a job, but its not something you do once every 3 months when you pop on. The influx of admins should only be taken if they are willing to work in areas that need help.

Depends per person, but overall, I see no danger to admins... <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpawn_Man_fbc1.html" title="User:Spawn Man">Spawn Man</a> 02:28, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Too much repitive work. CSD, most of *FD, could be better done via distributed user processes and bots.

<li>More active admins would be good. Large backlogs encourage corner cutting, leading to sloppiness and errors. Example error: deleting a vandalized page instead of reverting. Sloppiness wastes more time in later explaining the correctness of an action than it saves in doing it quickly the first time. On 24 January 2007, for 5% of articles deleted, I couldn't tell why from the deletion log (see <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_Deletion_Log_Stats_7686.html#Reasons" title="User:GRBerry/Deletion Log Stats">User:GRBerry/Deletion Log Stats#Reasons</a>). Similarly, we seem to get about a deletion review a day for correct AFD closes with insufficient explanations. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 16:40, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>We are volunteers, not workers. We each operate under an obligation determined by our personal levels of passion for the project. Shortages of admins create extra stress for the volunteers who are here, and it can lead to burnout. There is no cost to having a greater quantity of admins because they are not salary positions. Opposition to new admins on this basis shows a lack of empathy. Opposition should be based on individual merit, not a 'mood' about the entire admin community itself. This is akin to deciding not to accept a woman or man into a volunteer position at a charity because there are "too many" of that sex in position already, without regard to their qualifications. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChairboy_157e.html" title="User:Chairboy">C<small>HAIRBOY</small></a> (<a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChairboy_882d.html" title="User talk:Chairboy">☎</a>) 17:50, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>CSDs should be handled by bot, most XFD could be handled by bot with administrative oversight (i.e. making the decision, telling the bot what to do, and the bot handles the close while the admin moves to his next XFD), many Prods could be handled by bot (if no edits have occurred since the prod was added, and it's been the required number of days, it's a clear case where deletion can be done), etc. If the community would let this happen, I think it'd lessen a lot of the backlogs. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315">talk</a>) 18:19, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Ral315 is right...more things should be automated.

<li>Per Ral315 again.

<li>Yes, the backlog is by choice. If we forced all our admins to work on backlogs for 50% of their Wikitime, rather than choosing what they wish to do, then we might well not have any. But the fact is, we <i>can't</i> force people do do things they don't want to, so we have backlogs that we will not get rid of without many more admins. While we manage the speedy deletion backlog at times, who knows how many improper deletions have been made in an effort to quickly muck out the category? I suspect it's at <i>least</i> 100 times more than the number we get at DRV. New people who get their articles deleted will rarely challenge the decision; I'm sure that most do not even know how, and it's not exactly easy to find out. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">moo!</a></small> 19:23, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Having had a 3rr report sat unwatched for over <strike>a day</strike> two days, a request for semi-protection sat for over 12 hours, and a watchlist full of vandalism to be reverted, I have to agree that backlogs are not being dealt with. <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatchpole_52c3.html" title="User:Catchpole">Catchpole</a> 12:01, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>This is a voluntary project and until there is more incentive to get down to the backlogs nobody wants to look at they will remain. I think the current number of admins could handle it if they were paid to edit WP (I'm not suggesting it) but if they want to block users and AIV is empty, it doesn't mean they suddenly switch wanting to clear the speedy categories. When given a choice, anyone would do what they wanted to and seeing as there's no obligation, backlogs are inevitable. More admins would mean more people (perhaps the same percentage but a higher number) would see the backlog and tackle it rather than just skip over it. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames086_6f65.html" title="User:James086"><font face="comic sans ms" color="#454545">James086</font></a><sup><a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJames086_1a79.html" title="User talk:James086"><font color="darkgreen">Talk</font></a></sup> 09:13, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>We can cope with the current backlog. However, as we don't have enough people actively working on cleaning them, a lot of the work is done after only a superficial examination of the merits of a deletion (especially in image deletions). If we could halve the workload on the average admin, there would be more time to actually explain to newbies why their images aren't okay or why their articles were deleted. Right now, the backlogs encourage (at least me) to rather do a mediocre job on 10 articles than do an excellent job on 2. <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> <a href="../../../k/u/s/User_talk%7EKusma_087e.html" title="User talk:Kusma">(討論)</a> 15:53, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>(edit conflict) I was just about to observe that it would not be too much work if more admins participated. (And one way to do this would be to strongly encourage admins who wee not, to either resume, or relinquish the job if they were holding onto it for prestige). But I'm not clear what Just H means by new admins being likely to punch the current ones. I do not get the feeling from the discussion on this that there is radical dissatisfaction with the way the current admins work--the general trend of the discussion seems to be a desire to improve the process not revolutionize it, and to find a way to possibly remove some few, but not the whole body of them. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 22:23, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>We don't need just more admins. We need more admins that are interested in doing the tasks that are severely backlogged.

<li>No. I think if we were to relax the standards in this way, we would need another level of "administrators" to watch for bad-faith "trial administrators."

<li>Either give them the mop or don't. Don't put too much ceremony on adminship, it's just a maintenance position.

<li>In the one month, they're either going to go nuts and delete the interface messages or play it conservatively and make themselves look good until they can get adminship permanently.

<li>The extra complication does not seem worth the effort. As others have already said, either they're already mature enough to be trusted with the mop or they're not.

<li>Agreed, having faith in ones ability at a time does not extend forever. There have been cases where admins have been desysop'd, showing the community can be wrong. In the same manner that we worry about "recall" being a feeding ground for trolls, wouldnt that same logic apply to those trolls opening an Arbcom against an admin? A recall would not soley consist of a vote, but people have to provide points and discussion, making it a community decision, no trollish behavior can hide the truth of difs and actions. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 16:44, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Qualified yes. Non-recall should be the default, but the requirements to recall shouldn't be too high, perhaps even a simple majority of qualified votes. Term limits with the same standard to requalify as to qualify in the first RfA may be an acceptable substitite, as bad admins would fail their next RfA. That would draw out the length of the problem, but avoid the divisiveness that a dedicated AdR page would create. <span style="font-family:serif;font-size:120%"><b><a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">Αργυριου</a></b> <a href="../../../a/r/g/User_talk%7EArgyriou_e022.html" title="User talk:Argyriou">(talk)</a></span> 23:57, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>While the opposition reasoning is not trivial, it has worked well in practice and I really think that a community based way to de-admin is what is missing from the current system. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 05:51, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Definitely. I have nearly 30,000 edits and no blocks, but admin misconduct - against which in reality there is no recourse for non-admins who do not wish to undergo great stress in a nearly hopeless cause - drove me away for seven months. An unacceptable proportion of admins become arrogant about their status. At the moment they are an unaccountable overclass. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalJW_41ef.html" title="User:CalJW">CalJW</a> 00:25, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Admins are granted their powers by community support, and should keep them for only as long as they maintain that support. It's true that in the course of their duties, admins sometimes upset people. But if an admin upsets so many people that a substantial number of users in good standing question their adminship, something is wrong. Accountability requires not merely that admins <i>earn</i> the trust of the community, but that they <i>keep</i> it. I commend the members of <a href="../../../a/d/m/Category%7EAdministrators_open_to_recall_309a.html" title="Category:Administrators open to recall">Category:Administrators open to recall</a> for stepping forward in this regard.

<li>Absolutely. With some of the blatant abuses of policy going on now (particularly arbitrarily blocking on a whim and then citing so-called "disruption") it's necessary (what if the community doesn't want to put up with it any more?). If a particular administrator has behaved fairly and he knows it, then there is nothing for him to fear even if trolls do have it in for him. It should be however more than just votes; convincing evidence would have to be presented for a successful de-sysoping and those responsible for de-sysoping would have to take the process more seriously. To set limits on who can participate (sockpuppets excluded) would be unacceptable.--<a href="../../../d/o/m/User%7EDomitius_c4a0.html" title="User:Domitius">Domitius</a> 15:55, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think this is the only scalable solution to problem admins that also prevents troll abuse. The details on how it works are not clear to me.

<li>I think we urgently need some way of recall, but we will need barriers. What I do not know is what level the barriers should be, and we wont know till we have experience. To discourage single issue trolling, it should perhaps be time on wiki, rather than just edit counts--e.g. unless you've been here for x months, you probably don't know enough about process here to vote. I am prepared to guess that once we o have a provision for mandatory recall, we will very rarely use it. Having it available will be sufficient to deal with most admin problems. 19:56, 16 February 2007 (UTC) .</li>
<li>Very, very strongly here. "The faith of the community" gained during an rfa isn't infinite.

<li>The current suffrage is just too low. My personal specification is that recall has to be started by another admin in the category. While one could criticize this as cabalistic, expanding this to the entire body would seem to minimize this - if 1000 admins don't feel that you've done something that merits sanction, then you almost certainly haven't. - <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree">Banyan</a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanyanTree_059e.html" title="User talk:BanyanTree">Tree</a> 17:46, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I am uncertain as to the need or practicality of this proposal. I'm open to proposals that are workable, necessary, and address real, not perceived, problems. However, absent any new proposals that have not been suggested before, I cannot see how recall, by any process, would solve the current alleged problems and avoid incorporating those same problems. Recall in any form would pretty much be an RfA in reverse, and the culture and behaviour in RfA would likely carry over to the new procedure. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 21:44, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>We need a way to desysop without an Arbcom proceeding; they are far too long, cause too much drama, and many of the people who could provide evidence actively avoid the committee for those reasons. To deal with the issue that recall would be too easily gamed by trolls, I would support a form of recall such that consensus is required to <i>remove</i> the admin tools, not to keep them, consensus judged the same as in an RfA. If you can't get a meager ~25% of people to agree that you should have admin tools, you should not. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">moo!</a></small> 05:33, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Agreed, there has been growing talk of cabalism and a closed community with no oversight in communication has only fueled that further. There has been times where it is said "it was discussed on IRC", which means its discussed in a manner that you do not know what was said, who said it, and when. We have such an indepth manner here with "dif's" to keep track of discussions, there really is no reason decisions should be made outside that scope. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 16:40, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Certainly not, in most cases. There will be some where the matter really cannot go on record because of breech of privacy or possible libel--and there's no way of discussing in WP space without going on record. There should be very few of them, and when this procedure is used, it should be declared--as it sometimes has been. It is an obvious violation of the basic principles to have closed discussions--first, there will be cabals; second, it diminishes trust by the community in the decisions; third, it arouse a certain degree of resentment by those excluded. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 19:28, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

I'm wondering if you mean no blocks at all, or merely no blocks of users with any good faith edits, or something else. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGracenotes_686d.html" title="User:Gracenotes"><font color="#960">Grace</font><font color="#000">notes</font></a><sup><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGracenotes_98ea.html" title="User talk:Gracenotes"><font color="#960">T</font></a></sup> § 02:46, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Per Chick Bowen. IRC is not a bad thing. To get a quick reality check, it's great, and doesn't clutter up AN with something relatively useless. For blocks of established users, it should obviously be on-wiki. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315">talk</a>) 18:25, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Sure. I can go in and ask a simple question like "hey, look at the history of this page, not a ton of IP vandalism, but someone's complained about it to me; anyone think it's worth semi-protecting?" Maybe it's worth it; maybe someone points out that it's just one single IP range adding false statements, and a small range block would suffice. It's a relatively minor issue, but it's good to get input on something like that. It also is a quick way of reaching many admins quickly; in the case of a serious BLP issue, Jimbo Wales, myself and about 6 or 7 other admins set up a quick channel to talk with a non-admin who was trying to help with the issue (which was ultimately resolved). I'm not saying by any means that IRC should be the ultimate source of judgment, but it can help in minor situations. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> <a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315">»</a> 23:08, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>This is ridiculous. IRC is a technology. You don't solve a social problem with a technological fix. Everything done on IRC can be done with a conference call. Secretive back room dealings have existed since the dawn of time and they will always exist. The real issue here is that binding decisions have to be made transparently and receive approval from the full commmunity. Issues can be discussed and clarified in private before being presented to save the general community from drowning in details. This is how every social system works. --<a href="../../../i/d/e/User%7EIdeogram_de1d.html" title="User:Ideogram">Ideogram</a> 22:46, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Off-wiki communication is perfectly fine to make decisions, including IRC. So long as people understand that consensus on IRC does not count when you have to defend your actions. "We decided it on IRC!" is not sufficient justification. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">moo!</a></small> 15:44, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Off-wiki communication is reasonable for discussing a situation. But it should <b>never</b> be offered as an explanation of an action. The reasoning behind the decision is the only explanation that should be offered. If the person making the decision can't explain the reasoning, they don't understand it well enough to act on it. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 16:48, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>What they both said.

<li>Many blocks etc. never get discussed on wiki, some since they are obvious and some because they need prompt action. The immediacy afforded by IRC or the like can add for at least a sanity check. But as above, ultimately the person who blocks makes the decision and takes the responsibility for it. Regardless, to try and outlaw it would be unpoliceable, make such a decision and any discussion which does happened gets pushed further away from a more general gaze and so is subject to less independant review, not more. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 19:55, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Uncontroversial blocks or speedy deletes are perfectly fine for IRC, when a non-admin needs admin assistance. I'm less fond of admins deciding something on IRC unless their explanation of the action transcends the medium through which it was communicated. Wikipedia is, by etymology and in practice, quick.

<li>The only off-wiki communication that should be regulated is that which negatively affects others (including, for example, the publication of another user's personal information, attack sites, etc.) Personal attacks and incivility off-wiki are perfectly acceptable, in my opinion; while I don't condone such actions, they do not affect any parties directly, and it helps keep a civil atmosphere on-wiki. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315">talk</a>) 18:28, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The community should have a direct say, but not necessarily a deciding vote, on oversight and checkuser, similar to arbcom. There should not be a dedicated IRC channel which has a necessariy and sufficient qualification for joining "being an admin". As that's the only IRC channel which seems to cause trouble, there's no need to change the other channels. #wikipedia is not Wikipedia. <span style="font-family:serif;font-size:120%"><b><a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">Αργυριου</a></b> <a href="../../../a/r/g/User_talk%7EArgyriou_e022.html" title="User talk:Argyriou">(talk)</a></span> 00:09, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>IRC has technical issues relating to it that oversight and checkuser do not.

<li>I don't see the big deal about chanops. If arbcom had jurisdiction over IRC (see above) than they could simply instruct a chanop to remove someone (they never institute blocks themselves, even though they're all admins). As for checkuser and oversight, the current system works fine, and since these are highly technical procedures general community trust is not the only issue. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChick_Bowen_2101.html" title="User:Chick Bowen">Chick Bowen</a> 17:52, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I admittedly am not in channel 24-7, but I have never seen chanops ever used in the admins channel. Ever. #wikipedia- 99% of chanop actions I've seen I approved of, and the 1% were minor blocks that I think were probably acceptable, but a bit harsh. I don't mind ArbCom adding a few ops, but direct community input wouldn't make any sense, because many of the voters don't go on IRC, have no idea who's active in the channel, and in some cases, have no idea what ops do (#wikipedia ops, for example, mainly deal with kicking trolls spamming lines about administrators' sexual orientations- nothing where I'm particularly worried about abuse). Oversight and checkuser are obviously foundation issues. I also want to strongly endorse pgk's point that those who want oversight and checkuser often shouldn't have them. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315">talk</a>) 18:30, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Can't see the big deal for IRC Ops, Oversight is only a stop gap solution and checkuser has privacy issues.

<li>Oversight and Checkuser are extremely technical tools, and there are potential legal issues, as such I do not believe it to be either desirable or necessary for their use to change.

<li>I disagree with IRC; that's not part of Wikipedia, so we don't need control over it, any more than we need over Wikipedia Review. As for Oversight and Checkuser, the community should be able to overrule a decision to grant access, but not the other way around. Oversight is fraught with legal issues, and Checkuser requires <i>much</i> more technical knowledge than I think most people realize (plus, again, legal issues). -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">moo!</a></small> 20:46, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>A decision should be made on whether IRC is 'self' or 'other'.

<li>Actually, Amarkov makes a lot of sense here - the community should have a way to say that certain individuals should be removed from having Oversight and Checkuser priviledges.

<dd>For the record I don't disagree with the substance of Just H's coments, though I deeply resent the implication that I am trying to subvert the discussion process. I think it would be better served by more focussed discussion rather than trying to do everything at once. My point was that as an initial step in the decision making process polls like this can over define the debate (a couple of concrete proposals are included above, but others might be worthy of discussion as well). Maybe I should have included a smiley. I appreciate this poll and support what it is trying to do, but I think that it is worth pointing out that it won't solve anything by itself. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 22:10, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

I was originally going to say that the only superfluous question was this one, but even that is untrue, as this question could be useful in creating further surveys. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 00:32, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>This poll needs to have as many questions as it needs to get the information it needs. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_panda_d8a7.html" title="User:Captain panda"><font color="orange">Captain</font> <font color="red">panda</font></a> <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptain_panda_3940.html" title="User talk:Captain panda"><font color="teal">In</font></a> <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_panda_Autograph_Book_f2a2.html" title="User:Captain panda/Autograph Book"><font color="green">vino</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Captain_panda_0806.html" title="Special:Contributions/Captain panda"><font color="indigo">veritas</font></a> 02:11, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>This poll has the wrong questions, or rather I'm sure we can all think of questions which may have reflected a differing view and other questions which maybe we couldn't see the point in. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 08:14, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Not really, but it took a long time &amp; many of the questions "overlapped", making you write the same stuff again &amp; again until you can't stand it any longer &amp; the constant buzzing sound of the computer becomes unbearable &amp; you feel forced to do something very very bad to your computer!!!!!! Ah, so yeah maybe the survey <i>did</i> have too many questions for me....&#160;;) <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpawn_Man_fbc1.html" title="User:Spawn Man">Spawn Man</a> 02:35, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>If reviewers take the time to count the total number of participants in the survey, and note for specific questions that N people chose to skip this question, having more questions may help reveal the size of the "I don't care" population for a specific point. (Of course, it would be understated by leaving out the "I don't care about any of this" group.) <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 17:24, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
