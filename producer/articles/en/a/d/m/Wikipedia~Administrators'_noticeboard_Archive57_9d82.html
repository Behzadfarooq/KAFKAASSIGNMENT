<p><a href="../../../w/i/a/User%7EWiarthurhu_a86e.html" title="User:Wiarthurhu">User:Wiarthurhu</a> has contacted me by email to ask whether his community ban could be lifted. He was banned after exhausting the community's patience after several months of incivility, personal attacks and disruptive behavior. The discussion of his ban can be found <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive130_2e94.html#Concerning_Wiarthurhu_-_community_block.3F" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive130">here</a>. Wiarthurhu's email proposes a set of conditions he feels are reasonable to accompany the lifting of the ban and which he agrees to abide by. I have listed these below verbatim - although this technically allows a potential breach of the fifth condition he lays down, any discussion of undoing a community ban has to take place in the open and I see no other way to fairly discuss this proposal.</p>
<p>I am an involved party having blocked Wiarthurhu before for <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> violations. My personal opinion is these conditions are not acceptable given the user's past behavior, but might with modification by us be the basis for lifting the ban. Obviously this is the broader community's decision.</p>

<p>Proposal:</p>
<ul>
<li>I do have a problem with all of the authors listed on my rfC</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I have very few problems with anybody else anywhere else on WP as long as I don't reference anything these above editors have done.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I agree to a three month self-imposed block on any article ever touched by any of the editors listed on the rfC, including talk pages</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>user wiarthurhu and all associated pages and records are deleted</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I get another username which will not be disclosed to the above editors, some who have shown a pattern of searching everywhere I've ever been and attacking both my material and myself. The terms of this user agreement will not be disclosed to the above parties, who will assume that I do not exist, and I will provide no reason for them to believe that I still exist as a WP user. If detected, you can terminate this agreement.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I will cease to worry about the sort of things you folks have been tasked with fixing such as bullying behavior, or inaccurate content. Therefore, if challenged, I will defer. If ticked off, I will remain silent. It is no longer my job, it's the job of admins to enforce civility and factual correctness until WP rules are changed otherwise.</li>
</ul>
<p>Can we give this a 1 week trial?</p>
<p>According to WP rules, a ban can be lifted if the user agrees to change behavior. I believe the above rules of engagement will eliminate all cases of conflict.</p>
<p>Ex-wiarthurhu.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I am willing to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> and believe that he wants to change. I would support a second chance for him, but he must realize he is on a very short leash. If this is refused by the community, however, he could take it to the arbitration committee. <a href="../../../c/o/w/User%7ECowman109_5ea9.html" title="User:Cowman109"><font color="DarkGreen">Cowman109</font></a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/w/User_talk%7ECowman109_260b.html" title="User talk:Cowman109">Talk</a></sup> 22:01, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As the dispute in question was beyond simply a user dispute but involved repeated violations of content guidelines and policies including <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, I am uncomfortable giving the user a fresh start unless these issues are addressed. The user still seems to believe the dispute is limited to "problems" between editors, and not incompatibilities with his edits and Wikipedia guidelines and policies. If the proposal is accepted as offered, the user will simply run amok of other editors and the processes we have observed over the last few weeks will be repeated. --<a href="../../../m/m/x/User%7EMmx1_39e2.html" title="User:Mmx1">Mmx1</a> 22:08, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Can't say I care much for "user wiarthurhu and all associated pages and records are deleted", beyond the normal right to vanish I can't see why we'd grant this user any special favours. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User%7EPgk_d0c7.html" title="User:Pgk">pgk</a><sup>(<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk"><font color="mediumseagreen">talk</font></a>)</sup> 22:23, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm deferring my comments until I see what others like Tony Sidaway or Cyde have to say on the subject. Beyond that, Wiarthurhu has been warned plenty of times that his behavior would either end up in an ArbCom case or a permaban, so he really can't say that he hasn't been warned. I personally warned him of this fact several times, and that didn't stop him from personal attacks or incivility. Perhaps I'll have more to say later, but for now, I'm at a loss for words. <a href="../../../c/q/j/User%7ECQJ_12e6.html" title="User:CQJ">CQJ</a> 05:45, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just a thought ... How about if all that is initially promiced is that he is allowed to edit under the conditions he has set out <i>except</i> that he edits as an anon - which differs from his current position in that it won't be violating his ban. A month from now he can provide a list of his edits and it can be decided whether or not to grant him a user name or not. Just a thought. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 10:35, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Okay. I've had about twelve hours to sleep, eat, and think about this. I think it's obvious to me that Wiarthurhu has a problem with all of the authors listed on his RfC, particularly because some of them (not all of them) tried to get him to edit within the rules several times. I think part of the problem that Wiarthurhu cites was created by Wiarthurhu himself, especially by the creation of the now deleted Wikipedia strategy article and repeated <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> violations time and time again. I saw the problem in WikiProject Automobiles brewing long before he was banned, about the time our mediation at <a href="../../../f/-/1/F-14_Tomcat_c28a.html" title="F-14 Tomcat">F-14 Tomcat</a> ended, and I didn't interject or start looking for things until the second and third MedCab cases were filed.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Wiarthurhu's references to these editors who he has a problem with are part of the problem itself. He has referred to the editors joining the RfC in a very negative tone, to the point of crossing the <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> line, even to the point where some of his comments are within the scope of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>. He repeatedly has made comments along these lines in reference to Mmx1, ApolloBoy, and Karrmann at least, even going as far to call them Wiki-bullies and their supposed interference with him "evidence of Gang activity on Wikipedia".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If Wiarthurhu is to come back to Wikipedia, I strongly oppose deletion of his userspace and his associated records on the grounds that he's shown the same type of behavior in two separate disputes in two unrelated content areas against two groups of editors. What happens when the third or fourth group runs afoul of his intent? Further, Wiarthurhu has agreed to follow rules or suggested actions before which he's broken, and allowing him to create another name and dissappear from the radar would not be a prudent course of action, in my honest opinion. I don't think that he would follow a three month block of any article that these editors have touched, including talk pages, because if he was capable of self-restraint, I don't think he would have been permablocked in the first place. I don't mean that as a personal attack, either. Wiarthurhu has brokered "cease-fires" and peace agreements before, but when the other person doesn't play the game as he wants it played, then all hell breaks loose and more conflict comes to light.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Wiarthurhu has not been attacked here. To the contrary, it is usually him doing the attacking on other editors, especially ApolloBoy and Mmx1. Karrmann has also been a recent target of Wiarthurhu's scathing wit in addition, albeit Karrmann has also done a bit of pot-stirring in this case as well (for which he's been warned to cease). And, if Wiarthurhu's material and edits are called into question, it is because of the quality of his edits, not the fact that he makes them in the first place. So again, I strongly disagree with the community allowing him to get another username under the pretenses of non-disclosure.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Now, with that said, I would be in favor of Wiarthurhu coming back and being allowed to edit again, but not under the conditions which he proposes, and on a very, and I mean very short leash. I will pause here to save my contribution, and then I will continue in a moment. <a href="../../../c/q/j/User%7ECQJ_12e6.html" title="User:CQJ">CQJ</a> 19:22, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Here's what I propose.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ol>

<p>If Wiarthurhu is honestly sincere about becoming a better editor, and can change his Wiki-ways to conform with our standards, practices, the Trifecta, and Foundation goals, then I have no issue with allowing him to return under these pretenses. If he is not, then he shouldn't be allowed back, as the way it stands right now, there is more than enough evidence that I've seen to support a community permablock without question. <a href="../../../c/q/j/User%7ECQJ_12e6.html" title="User:CQJ">CQJ</a> 19:37, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>As someone who signed the RFC, and peripherally involved but not closely enough to be emotional about it, I think his proposal is missing the point. Regardless of whether some of the RFCers were more active and emotional, Wiarthurhu's fundamental problem is not that he's being wikistalked. The username change won't help with that, and will help obscure the user history. If he's really willing to reform, he can do it under that username just fine as far as I care. If other editors or admins do start really wikistalking him then that would be a separate issue to be dealt with later, but I hope and suspect that if he does in fact reform he will have very few problems. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 00:10, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm extremely upset that (as one of the aggrieved parties) the first I get to hear about this is when I see the 'unbanned' notice pops up on Wiarthurhu's talk page in 'my watchlist'. I should have been given notice - and given the opportunity to at least say something about the terms and conditions before the unbanning - why did nobody tell me about this via my Talk page or something? I believe unbanning this user after so little time is a serious mistake. Whilst he may be out of my hair for a while longer, I don't see anything in the restrictions imposed upon him that prevents him from terrorizing another neighbourhood as he has in the past with Aircraft and Automobiles. Giving him a fresh identity would just make that even harder to recognise if/when it does happen again. Notably, you are requiring me (an innocent party in this) to involve interlocutors or face a ban myself! I edit widely in Wikipedia - the odds of running into this guy again are rather high and I'm not going to risk a week long ban because of him. I have never been consulted about these terms - nor do I particularly think them appropriate. To expect me to abide by them without my prior agreement is asking a lot. IMHO, Wiarthurhu should remain banned forever - the destruction he has already caused to the encyclopedia in terms of wasted productivity and in people forced to take Wikibreaks in order to avoid the stree by far exceeds all of the contributions he is ever likely to make. We gave the guy a one week ban and he was back causing trouble within a day of it being lifted. Now we're telling him that even an 'indefinite' ban is over in a few weeks. We should have stuck with the ban for at least a year. I'm most unhappy at this decision - and especially how it was (not) publicised to the aggrieved parties. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 16:33, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Steve's got a point. We really didn't consult him or any of the other editors that were involved in the situation beyond our involvement at AN/I and our fact finding, especially on the caveat that any editor that doesn't use an interlocutor can get nailed equally. With that said (warning to other editors: CQJ's infamous use of numbering points follows):
<ol>
<li>I have already voiced the opinion that this situation could develop negatively for the encyclopedia. If it does, then we'll take appropriate action when and if the time is necessary.</li>
<li>I agree that everyone involved should have had the chance to comment on the conditions of Wiarthurhu's return, especially when punitive action can be taken against a group of editors. However, given the discussion that I've had with Cowman in regards to the situation, and the fact that I'm now partially accountable for Wiarthurhu's actions since I've volunteered to be his "mentor", I will do my best to make sure that this agreement doesn't come back to hurt anyone within the scope of <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> or the Trifecta, and that includes Steve and all of the other editors who listed in the RfC as well as Wiarthurhu himself. But I will not tolerate anyone, neither Wiarthurhu, nor any other editor involved in this dispute (and I won't mention names) spreading incivility and personal attacks on Wikipedia, and those editors know who they are.</li>
</ol>
</dd>

<p>As such, I propose modification of the "terms" to the following, and I encourage enforcement of these modified terms unless there is a grave reason to stick with the terms already agreed to.

Sorry, but I don't know if I am in full support of this. He would often treat me like I don't belong on Wikipedia just because I am 14, and claimed that he is a better editer than me simply because hes older, without even looking over my edit history. He would take pictures of toys, and plaster them all over Wikipedia in places they don't belong, then called me a "Prolific teen vandal" when I took them down (Though I left them where they belonged, like in the Johnny Lightning or slot car articles) I am sorry, but I do not want him to come back.he was a major headache to all of the Wikiproject automobiles, and I felt a LARGE weight was taken off my shoulders when he was banned. I also don't like the idea of giving me a week long ban for getting into a conflict with the guy. I get severly pissed when people claim that I am not as good of an editer as them just because I am 14. If you look at my edit history, you can tell that I am up with par with the older editors. The guys would do crap and age discriminate me, and call me a prolific vandal when I would take down any of his toy car pictures, or remove his POV from articles. I also had a large headace with him combating my liking for the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Taurus_17f2.html" title="Ford Taurus">Ford Taurus</a>. In a deleted article, I wrote an entry for the Taurus, which I admit, sounded a little pro Taurus, and he acted like it was pure POV, and rewrote it with stuff like "Many people would be su[rised to hear that this low key fleet special sold 7 million units, but it did" and stuff like that. He claimed he toned it down, but instead, he just turned it around ot make it all anti-Taurus, thus not solving anything. He also based his behavior off of a "nice list" If you were on his nice list, he would treat you like a person, if not, he treated you like crap. And just look at whot he would do with RfCs and AfDs, he would totally interupt, making it sound like none of our opinions mattered. I am sorry, but I am NOT in favor of bringing him back. If it were up to me, I wouldn't just block him, I would set his computer on fire too. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarrmann_9858.html" title="User:Karrmann">Karrmann</a> 19:25, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry, it looks like I forgot to change some things in there - basically what I mean to say is that Wiarthurhu is the one who will be watched, and he is agreeing to avoid you guys for the time being while remaining under the same account should he be watched. Others indeed should not be subject to blocking for this, but nonetheless provoking him is innappropriate and people will be warned if they do so. So, here's a revision of the terms.</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li><i>Accepting that Wiarthurhu has a problem with the authors listed on his RfC, and the authors accepting that they've had problems with him in the past, Wiarthurhu agrees that he will avoid the other editors he has had trouble with in the past and will speak with them through a mediator.</i></li>
<li><i>Wiarthurhu agrees to immediately cease and decist in any action deemed to be in violation of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> or <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> against ApolloBoy, Mmx1, SteveBaker, Karrmann, or any other editor that has joined in dispute resolution mechanisms against him in the past. Violation of this condition will result in another block for Wiarthurhu.</i></li>
<li><i>Wiarthurhu will avoid any article within the scope of WikiProject Aircraft or WikiProject Automobiles for three months, as he has suggested himself, or be subject to a one week block.</i></li>
<li><i>Further, a mentor (or several mentors) from the community will be assigned to Wiarthurhu to help him out wherever necessary or possible.</i></li>
<li><i>Also, other editors are warned to not provoke Wiarthurhu, and warnings will be handed out if that occurs.</i></li>
</ol>
<p>There, I admit that I somehow completly overlooked the application of the earlier agreement towards the other parties involved - I guess I was too busy focused on the Wiarthurhu part to realize that. Does this sound more appropriate? <a href="../../../c/o/w/User%7ECowman109_5ea9.html" title="User:Cowman109"><font color="DarkGreen">Cowman109</font></a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/w/User_talk%7ECowman109_260b.html" title="User talk:Cowman109">Talk</a></sup> 19:36, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Let me be frank here. I understand your concerns, and Steve's concerns, and everyone else's concerns as to allowing Wiarthurhu to come back. The behavior you cite above was taken into consideration when Wiarthurhu was blocked in the first place. He was warned for <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> violations when calling you a "Prolific teen vandal". We understand why you were making the edits that you were making, and believe me, I'm very familiar with the timelines and who started what, who said what, and when they said it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Cowman's modified things above (while I was writing this...grrrrr). Wiarthurhu's essentially agreed to leave you guys alone as much as possible, and if he can't, then he's supposed to get a hold of Cowman or I and we're supposed to come help out. At the first hint of impropriety, then we'll cross the bridge of further action. Until then, well, I'd suggest that you not state that you're going to set another contributor's computer on fire, regardless of how you feel. Relax. The situation is well at hand, and neither Cowman or myself or any other administrator or editor that cares about this encyclopedia as deeply as we do will allow things to continue in the manner in which they have in the past. <a href="../../../c/q/j/User%7ECQJ_12e6.html" title="User:CQJ">CQJ</a> 19:50, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Since Wiarthurhu is to be allowed to return (against my better judgement...but whatever) - I have no problem with the present (or previous) requirements on both him and his former victims. <b>My</b> main problem was that I had not been consulted - and now I have, that's OK. For Wiarthurhu to have any chance at a fresh start, far from the people whom he's upset so badly, it is obvously necessary that none of us inflame the situation by chasing after him - so "don't feed the trolls", and "if you do you are in trouble too" are not a bad set of principles (<i>so long as you tell the hypothetical troll feeders first!</i>). Since Cowman and CQJ are both going to be on watch for bad behavior, the rest of us should be able to relax and pretend that life is still good (and if it's not good - it'll get good again within the time it takes someone to type the word "blocked" in the right place). You guys are definitely going the extra mile for Wiarthurhu - I sure hope he appreciates what you are doing for him and adds more value to the encyclopedia than he subtracts from it! Let's all hope this works out. Thanks guys! <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 20:42, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I will say, given the clearly stated suspicion on the page that the subject was a Wikipedia editor, some more care might have been in order. But honestly, I'm skeptical that this is in and of itself grounds for an emergency desysopping. It seems more like a case of the arbcom seeing an opportunity to justify a penalty they've wanted to put out for quite a while.

<dd>But did not actually post anything. This is a critical point.

<dd>This is outrageous. Retrieving/posting deleted material is a <b>basic right</b> under the GFDL (but one that should not be exercised if the material was deleted for legal reasons or contains sensitive detail, of course.) When are people going to understand that <b>Wikipedia does not own content</b>? It's not OK to copy something I (for example) write into other Wikipedia articles just because I posted it here, without giving me attribution. It's not OK to accept my (for example) contributions under the GFDL then delete them and deny the Commons access to them. What if another site wants to publish it? What right have we got to deny the use of GFDL material to anybody? Absolutely none. I am genuinely shocked and outraged at the suggestion that Wikipedia has any right <i>whatsover</i> to material posted here above and beyond the rights assigned to it under the GFDL. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 13:01, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Indeed - Wikipedia would be hard pressed to persue legal action against someone who posted deleted page content. Hence the lack of takedown effort on Wikitruth. However, the GFDL does not constitute an obligation to make content available, and the GFDL offers no protection outside of legal protection - whether someone is an admin on a website is wholly outside its purview. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 13:55, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Regardless of the situation at hand, I do want to remind everyone that deleted content - especially deleted revisions of an article - are deleted for a reason, and that special concern needs to be taken when viewing and discussing the material.

<p>Last I checked, Wikipedia doesn't own the internet. In the past, deleted content was retrieved and posted elsewhere. The highly controversial Brian Peppers fiasco came to a close when Jimbo deleted the article and the article was transwiki'd in full on the YTMND Wiki, and remains there to this day. There should be no reason why in this case posting deleted content outside Wikipedia is against Wikipedia policy. The content is outside Wikipedia, not in it. Stuff that is unsuitable for Wikipedia isn't to be censored and banned from view by the entire world. What Everyking did may have been wrong morally, but to impose a sanction on him before he actually did it without warning is just as bad. I say resysop him and let the community vote to see if there's a consensus to take him down. I don't think showing deleted content is a breach of trust on us. Rather, I think quite the opposite. Refusing to allow people to view things, especially if they wrote them, is a breach of trust. I don't know exactly the situation completely, but I do think that there should have been less unilateral action. <b><a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyswordsman_e813.html" title="User:Crazyswordsman"><font color="orange">Sir Crazyswordsman</font></a></b> 02:04, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's funny, but the question of a warning, or some sort of prior contact, hasn't been mentioned before. There were three days that passed between my suggestion and the "emergency" desysopping. If somebody believed even after that interval that I still might post the content, and felt strongly that I should not, then the obvious first option should've been to simply <i>say</i> to me: "Hey, in case you were still thinking of doing that, please don't; I believe it may contain personal information." In this case the response from me would have been: "I wasn't planning to post it, and now that I know it contains personal information I am very happy that I did not." <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 05:06, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The deleted content apparently contained personal information. In the past, such personal information has been used to harass editors, etc. Revealing that information would not be like letting an editor simply view a bad vanity article he wrote, it would be exposing rather private information to some persons who have in the past used such information in threatening ways. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 05:25, 7 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>We should be glad that this did not occur, then. Everyking offered to post the contents of a deleted article, which is a common enough occurrence, but as he says, he did not realise that it contained personal information. The key point is that the personal information was not posted. The over-reaction is akin to taking away someone's driving licence for speeding when a driver says that he will travel at a certain speed. Even if he is aware that the speed limit has been lowered on that road, there is no act to warrant punishment. Seems to me that policy is being made on the fly here.</dd>
<dd>I'm all in favour of desysopping for misbehaviour, but let's leave it until we have a clear case, because if we start desysopping for what people think but don't do, then we might as well say goodbye to a whole swag of admins. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperJumbo_33a0.html" title="User:SuperJumbo">Jumbo</a> 06:30, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think you should definitely discontinue that practice, though I don't think any action should be taken against you in the circumstances, since you were apparently motivated by loyalty to WP and your colleagues. I can't say the same for Everyking. We have every reason to lose confidence in an admin who would even contemplate posting deleted information on another site. It's not a matter of whether there's a specific policy against it; it should go without saying - a matter of basic common sense and team loyalty. Everyking is entitled to have certain ideals of free speech, or whatever they are, but if he is at all inclined to pursue them to assist Wikipedia Review then the honourable course for him is to avoid any conflict of interest between his ideals and his corporate loyalties. The way to do that would have been by voluntary relinquishment of his admin powers.

<dd>As a personal matter I agree because frankly most of the people there are trolls or worse, but if a user or an admin wishes to slum, we shouldn't stop them (I am strongly not endorsing Everyking here.

<dd>Dude we rely on admins being ignorant to get through the day. Aside form that admins are ignorant of all sorts of things. Copyright law. How to do range blocks how to use the whitelist. The fact there is a whitelist. How to close an AFD. What the exact CSD criteria are (they keep changeing for some reason).

<dd>If this was a reply to pschemp, pschemp's not a dude&#160;:) Anyways, admins are supposed to be rational in every decision they make. I don't really have a stance towards either side, but considering EveryKing has a prior history of blocks, I didn't surprise me that he was desysopped for something like this. How to close an AFD is one of the most basic admin activites. If an admin candidate doesn't know how to do that, I would be surprised if the RFA passed. Admins don't know how to do everything perfectly, but they should have a general idea of what to do in a situation. — <span style="font-family:Edwardian Script ITC"><font color="#50C878">The Future</font></span> 03:05, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think wikipedia review isn't a good place to criticize wikipedia. There's criticizing to improve and just being anti-wikipedia and wikipedia review is sort of the later. They are really picky on registration and it seems they only allow in vandals and those that they want to corrupt (like wikipedia admins). I don't think it's wrong to complain about wikipedia, it's like complaining about your tap water quality or TV programming... you sort of need it, but you can always want it to be better. Maybe someone can host a wikipedia criticism forum that is more inline with wanting to help wikipedia. I don't want to, though.

<p>Hummm, after reading this, I wonder what the long ranging implications of this will be, aside from the stern warning to the community in general. One important issue is that it is all a matter of timing. The information was available for some time, and in that time, it could have been cached by a webcrawler (google, answers, whatever), and be available permanetly outside Wikipedia. Or it could have been stored by a visitor and made publicly available (all allowed under GFDL). The conflict here is between the openness at one hand (everybody can at a specific time get all available information and store it off-wiki, regardless of libel, Copyvio, personal information etc), while at the otherhand desysopping for just offering to do the exact same thing. For me at the moment, that does not compute, and I would like to have some input on this from others on the timing aspect before making up my mind on whether the desysopping was good or not. -- <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimvdLinde_061a.html" title="User:KimvdLinde">Kim van der Linde</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/m/User_talk%7EKimvdLinde_a7d1.html" title="User talk:KimvdLinde">at venus</a></sup> 15:12, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am not familiar with the case in sufficient detail have an opinion about that. I am more interested in the implications, and especially when information added to wikipedia is under GFDL, and when the same information is not. Because what happens here is that information can be at the same time under GFDL and not, depending on how it was retrieved. That is a legal impossibility. Either it is under GFDL, or it is not. If it is under GFDL, I would think that people can actually request or sue the foundation for it if they want to have it, while we at the same time desysop people for doing the same thing. That just confuses me. -- <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimvdLinde_061a.html" title="User:KimvdLinde">Kim van der Linde</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/m/User_talk%7EKimvdLinde_a7d1.html" title="User talk:KimvdLinde">at venus</a></sup> 16:33, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Nobody can require the foundation to provide any piece of information simply because it was edited into Wikipedia. The foundation can hardly be required to publish or distribute information to which it does not even hold the copyright simply because another individual has released it under the GFDL. (This ignores the fact that much personal information is not subject to copyright, and that therefore the GFDL has no bearing on its publication.) The Foundation would certainly exercise judgment in releasing deleted revisions. Everyking lost his sysop bit precisely because he appeared uninterested in demonstrating such judgment. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 17:22, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sounds like few, if any, are sad to see Everyking lose the sysop tools. But, the excuse used for removing them was fairly sad.

<p>Where is all this discussion heading? Everyking was emergency desysopped apparently because of a sworn desire to make deleted content available to non-admins. Whilst this is occasionally appropriate, it is most definitely not appropriate to post it to Wikipedia Review. However, Everyking has made clear above that he has no intention to make such content available to non-admins, and unless we doubt his word, why does he not have his sysop bit back? Emergency desysoppings are not permanent unless they get ratified by the ArbCom or under <a href="../../../o/f/f/WP%7EOFFICE_66ac.html" title="WP:OFFICE">WP:OFFICE</a>, as far as I understand it. - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_d9f5.html" title="User:Mark">Mark</a> 17:01, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Presumably because the circumstances of the incident have brought his judgement into question to such an extent that the ArbCom feels his retaining the bit would be a liability to the project? I doubt this can be boiled down to a simple question of promising not to do someting in particular (e.g. not make deleted content available to non-admins); the broader issue is whether someone who considers—even fleetingly—using his sysop tools to help the nice folks at WR can be trusted with access to them. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 17:47, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While I'm sure we're all glad that in the end Everyking decided to <i>not</i> start posting said information on WR, that fact that it was ever an option is disturbing.

<dd>A couple of hours ago someone on IRC asked me to post the text of a page deleted by Dmcdevit. I did. For all I know the person I was talking to is a banned user on enwiki (though I think that's quite unlikely). This happens all the time. As long as the content is harmless it's fine. Everyking was in a dodgy forum and he implied he might post the contents of a page without reviewing it carefully first. That was a mistake. Then he decided not to do it and let the matter drop.

<dd>While you may not have thought about whether or not the information was sensitive, <i>you should have</i>. There is a difference between providing the contents of a deleted page to an editor (a vanity bio, promotional page, or some sort of facruft, say, that a newbie didn't realize was inappropriate for Wikipedia) and providing the contents of a deleted <i>revision</i>. Deleting individual revisions from a page history is more effort and inconvenience than reverting an edit or deleting a page, and admins only tend to do it when there is a good reason for that extra effort. Straight vandalism gets reverted; revisions are only removed in special, exceptional circumstances.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>When <i>any</i> editor asks for a copy of a deleted page <i>revision</i>, it should prompt careful questions and investigation before releasing the material. When a banned sockpuppetting troll (WordBomb) asks for a deleted page revision – surely out of innocent curiosity and a sense of civic duty...<i>*cough*</i> – that should trigger very loud alarm bells in the mind of an admin.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Before offering to release the information – before <i>thinking</i> about releasing the information – you might have asked the deleting admin why the revisions were deleted. That could have cleared things up nicely. Choosing not to release the information not out of respect for another admin's judgement, nor out of respect for the privacy of the involved individuals, nor because you didn't want to be used as a tool of some trolls...but rather because you were "<i>worried that SlimVirgin might get pissed</i>" does not inspire confidence in your ability to handle admin tools.</dd>

<dd>I've had run-ins with you before over your interactions with other editors, particularly other admins. I've been concerned about your occasional lack of civility.

Aside from a few regrettable mistakes during the Ashlee Simpson edit wars two years ago, I've never seen you misuse your admin privileges. But <i>this</i> is beyond the pale. If the only thing that stops you from handing out deleted page revisions to banned trolls bent on harrassing SlimVirgin and other admins is your fear that you'll piss off SlimVirgin, your judgement is no longer sound. I don't know whether it's because you're mad at Wikipedia, or mad at SlimVirgin, or mad at me (now, at least) or what—but this sort of offer shows a contempt for the Wikipedia community and for your Wikipedia colleagues. You've done a great deal of good here, but I just can't see how you can be trusted with admin privileges now. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 02:06, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think it would be useful to not hide non-sensitive deleted articles from non-administrators. Deleting articles because they don't fit editorially should be factored from deleting articles or revisions that have personal information etc. Almost all articles deleted via prod or AFD could be viewable by anyone.

<p>I believe it is fine for admins to give out a deleted article if it's been AFD'd as non-notable. Right?

<dd>Yup, it was clear that Slim Virgin had her reasons for deleting a quite specific revision. It was also clear that digging around to try to discover the content of that revision for the purpose of making it available to a banned user with an evident grudge against Wikipedia was something that a good colleague on the admin team would never even have thought of doing. When Everyking says he never actually did it, that's a relief. But he's still questioning (as of yesterday) whether there would have been anything wrong with it if he'd gone ahead. I can't trust him with the admin tools in those circumstances, no matter how good an editor he is otherwise. This is definitely not like userfying an article that was deleted because it was on a non-notable topic or userfying a userbox that did not belong in template space but had no particular tendency to disrupt the project or bring it into disrepute. We are expected to have good enough judgment to make such distinctions. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 00:46, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I also agree with Deathphoenix, and LtPowers.

<dd>In this case the offer isn't cause for dismissal. Everyking has stated that he didn't know there were personal details in the material. It's not like knowingly offering to hand over a credit card to somebody inappropriate - more like picking up an advertising flyer and offering it to an interested person. After all, most deleted articles are of that ilk and there is nothing controversial about their content. And as we find out from another comment, there may not actually be any personal information at all. I'm not an administrator, but I'm beginning to have grave doubts about the professional attitude on display here. Surely we should investigate the facts <b>before</b> acting?

<dd>Your analogy is wrong. He knew an admin had deleted a small number of edits, which strongly indicates it's personal information or defamation, as those are the most common reason for that kind of delete. But he offered to show the information to a bunch of trolls on an attack site anyway, some of whom have stalked people on-wiki and in real life. Whether he went ahead with it is irrelevant.

<p>This <a href="../../../c/o/p/WP%7ECOPY_08ab.html" title="WP:COPY">WP:COPY</a> may be interesting reading. IANAL but I am not reading an obligation for us to make material (licensed by others under GFDL as all text content is here) available forever. GFDL infers redistribution rights (or imposes making material available for redistribution, subject only to reasonable charges for media and costs) but only if we ourselves are using it. If we're not using it (that is, if it's deleted) we don't HAVE to make it available to anyone, the seeker should go to the source. Availability is then up to the original author to determine. If that author chooses to make themselves anonymous or is a troll, and thus we are not quite sure who that is, it's sort of not our problem to help the seeker determine who it was. Therefore to the points said above, I'm not seeing a need to make deleted content available on request, in general, despite it being GFDL licensed. We're not. after all, still using it. We can do so if we choose to but we don't have to.

<dd>I don't want to know what the information was. It's good enough for me that Slim Virgin, a colleague in good standing, thought it necessary to delete certain quite specific revisions of the article. I then see a banned user who has an obvious grudge against Wikipedia trying to get hold of it in a way that shows he is hoping to use the information for some purpose such as undermining Wikipedia or Slim Virgin, or both. I then see an admin hanging around on an anti-Wikipedia attack site openly talking to the banned user about using his admin powers to dig out the information for the banned user's benefit, and evidently seeing nothing wrong with this.</dd>
<dd>Folks, this is far worse than a bit of wheel warring (for example). I don't care that Everyking did not actually go through with it - the way he openly discussed doing so, refrained only because he was afraid Slim Virgin would be "pissed off", rather than because it would be undermining collegiality, and was still suggesting after being desysopped that there was nothing wrong with what he was offering to do all add up to this: Everyking is not someone I trust with admin powers. Given his judgments in this instance, I don't know what he would do next to undermine people whom he is supposed to be supporting. We can't afford to leave admin powers in the hands of people who have lost our trust.

<p>Reading through this thread, I am somewhat shocked a sysop is being punished for association with a forum that WP is highly critical of, claiming the forum is not a place for constructive criticism, but a place for trolls, which is a way of dismissing the forum as a whole. However, demanding no admin be part of the forum is to give the forum de-facto validation, saying they indeed got something right, when WP should instead say WPR is of no concenquence. Also, I am surprised over the protectionism over deleted information. It is as if Wikipedia suddenly laid claim to the information that was offered by the admin, reasoning the posting of the information is a betrayal of another admin. However, this fundamentally contradicts the copyright-less nature of Wikipedia. The texts, even when deleted is not owned by either Wikipedia or the Admin who deleted the information.</p>
<p>This desysop is not based on factual concerns, but it is a witch hunt, which Everyking has been unfortunately targeted.--<a href="../../../o/r/b/User%7EOrbitOne_44d2.html" title="User:OrbitOne"><big><big><font face="Brush Script MT" color="blue">Orbit</font></big></big></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font face="Brush Script MT" color="green">One</font></a> <sup>[<span style="color:red"><a href="../../../o/r/b/User_talk%7EOrbitOne_a840.html" title="User talk:OrbitOne">Talk</a></span>|<span style="color:gold"><a href="../../../o/r/b/User%7EOrbitOne_Translations_7e87.html" title="User:OrbitOne/Translations">Babel</a></span>]</sup> 18:48, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

The notion that it is somehow a bad thing to not release personal info to banned users is simply absurd. To claim that this has something to do with the nature of the copyright on the information shows such a basic misunderstanding of the GFDL that I don't evene know where to begin. While it is true that admins have a right to edit on Wikipedia Review it is accurate that it is by and large full of unproductive trolls and banned editors and that such editing will be rarely productive. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 19:15, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just to clarify the GFDL thing: GFDL requirements only come into play when something is being redistributed. If we've <i>deleted</i> something from Wikipedia we have no obligation to release that material to anyone. Now, if some current version of an article is based on a previous version that has been deleted then that <i>is</i> a problem, because attribution information has been removed. However, what we are talking about here is some random personal information that was deleted, so any GFDL concerns are irrelevant. There's this misconception out there that the GFDL requires that every single edit to Wikipedia be available when this is simply not the case; only the edits on pages that are <i>published</i> must be available. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 05:16, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just to clarify, once the information is on an article, it is legally published, and once someone distributes it, that version is no longer in your hands, and once it is deleted from wikipedia, the versions in the wild do not get deleted either. And GFDL is a copyleft, not a copyright.(added later) Still though, no one has cared to address how Wikipedia owns the information that was deleted or how the GFDL gives any rights to Wikipedia to decide who can or cannot publish previously deleted content. Still though, no one has addressed why no admin may be part of this forum without being attacked by peers when the forum in question is disputed in validity, which is the same as to question if anything the forum says should be taken seriously, which is the same as saying what ever happens on that forum does not matter, which means Wikipedia should concern itself with only the information it currently is displaying and not with the information others are displaying. I also question the validity of the argument that the users who recieved this information were banned and therefor were ineligable for possession of any wiki information, or atleast ineligable of possession of information from a sysops or should be barred from association with sysops. --<a href="../../../o/r/b/User%7EOrbitOne_44d2.html" title="User:OrbitOne"><big><big><font face="Brush Script MT" color="blue">Orbit</font></big></big></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font face="Brush Script MT" color="green">One</font></a> <sup>[<span style="color:red"><a href="../../../o/r/b/User_talk%7EOrbitOne_a840.html" title="User talk:OrbitOne">Talk</a></span>|<span style="color:gold"><a href="../../../o/r/b/User%7EOrbitOne_Translations_7e87.html" title="User:OrbitOne/Translations">Babel</a></span>]</sup> 08:01, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, under the GFDL he may. That's beside the point. The point is that he may not use his Wikipedia administrator privileges to do so.

<dd>(Edit Conflict) Part of being an Admin is using one's own judgement. Now for me, going onto a wikipedia attack forum, and offering to give deleted content, which contained personal information, to a banned user without even contacting the deleting admin, and then, to top it all off, state that the reason he didn't post the content was because he might piss off SlimVirgin, is a gross lack of judgement. I've seen a lot of words like witch hunt, and making an example of Everyking, but the truth is that he has lost the trust of the community. Simple as that. As far as validating WPR, well, I disagree with you on that point. Again, what's important here is judgement. Going onto WPR, and mixing with banned users, wiki-haters, and a general bunch of trolls is likely to have some of the community, some of them being constantly attacked by WPR, wonder why Everyking would want to be there in the first place. However, I think that Everyking's de-sysoping comes down to this: It is debatable if he abused his powers, but he has abused the trust of the community with his actions. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Halo_3472.html" title="User:The Halo">Th</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Halo_Esperanza_d8f6.html" title="User:The Halo/Esperanza"><font color="green">ε</font></a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Halo_3472.html" title="User:The Halo">Halo</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Halo_8994.html" title="User talk:The Halo"><b>Θ</b></a></sup> 10:36, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>But again, there is an allussion of ownership to the text. As for mingling with banned users, why do you feel you have the right to control who your peers can mingle with? As for the trust of the community, I cannot care less about what Everyking does on WPR, as long as his actions <i>on</i> Wikipedia are fair and reasonable to other users of Wikipedia and helps improve Wikipedia. Everyking has done nothing to destroy my trust of him and my trust for him is just as important as your trust for him.</p>
<p>Also, I question the wisdom of 'super users', users who are a little more than all other editors, making the foggy rules of trust. The everyday editors of Wikipedia need to trust you, the sysops, more than you need to trust each other and without our input, editors can feel invalidated personally at times and come to feel distrust. A picture as an example would be an overlord commanding the underlings. --<a href="../../../o/r/b/User%7EOrbitOne_44d2.html" title="User:OrbitOne"><big><big><font face="Brush Script MT" color="blue">Orbit</font></big></big></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font face="Brush Script MT" color="green">One</font></a> <sup>[<span style="color:red"><a href="../../../o/r/b/User_talk%7EOrbitOne_a840.html" title="User talk:OrbitOne">Talk</a></span>|<span style="color:gold"><a href="../../../o/r/b/User%7EOrbitOne_Translations_7e87.html" title="User:OrbitOne/Translations">Babel</a></span>]</sup> 12:44, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmmm...a very interesting reply to say the least. I wasn't aware that I ever said that your trust for Everyking was less important than mine. As you can see from my edit summery, this is just my humble opinion of the situation. I'm sorry if you feel it is something more. As far as <i>"...why do you feel you have the right to control who your peers can mingle with?"</i> is concerned, again, I never wrote that Everyking's movements or who he talks to on the internet should be restricted. He makes a choice of who he talks to. However, that choice has a consequence. I believe that one of the Admin's duties are as to act as ambassadors of Wikipedia, and, as such, I hold them in higher reard when interacting with Wikipedians, and talking about Wikipedia elsewhere. As for "Super user", well, I don't think that they do make foggy rules of trust. Everyone's idea of trust is different, yours from mine, mine from Tony Sidaway's, Tony's from Everyking's etc. However, it is my firm opinion that Everyking, with his actions, has lost the trust of at least part of the community. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Halo_3472.html" title="User:The Halo">Th</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Halo_Esperanza_d8f6.html" title="User:The Halo/Esperanza"><font color="green">ε</font></a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Halo_3472.html" title="User:The Halo">Halo</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Halo_8994.html" title="User talk:The Halo"><b>Θ</b></a></sup> 13:03, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Maybe I should make clear who I am addressing. I am addressing multiple users, all of whom support the removal of Everyking as a sysop, and at the same time, no users. As such, I will address arguments individually as if they created and argued for themselves instead of addressing users. I, in this method, avoid offending people without intention. The exception is when I ask people to expand on their own arguments.</dd>

<dd>Our differing ideas of trust is exactly why mods, admins, sysops, crats and so on, should not define what trust is. However, at the very top of this thread, it was declared by a single entity that Wikipedia has lost trust for this user. --<a href="../../../o/r/b/User%7EOrbitOne_44d2.html" title="User:OrbitOne"><big><big><font face="Brush Script MT" color="blue">Orbit</font></big></big></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font face="Brush Script MT" color="green">One</font></a> <sup>[<span style="color:red"><a href="../../../o/r/b/User_talk%7EOrbitOne_a840.html" title="User talk:OrbitOne">Talk</a></span>|<span style="color:gold"><a href="../../../o/r/b/User%7EOrbitOne_Translations_7e87.html" title="User:OrbitOne/Translations">Babel</a></span>]</sup> 13:12, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Personally I do believe BJAODN does need to be deleted per the reason this page was deleted. This page was more than likely singled out because it wasn't on BJAODN.

<dd>In fact, while I'm commenting: Speedy out of process deletions make sense when a page is producing divisions and distractions from editing the encyclopedia. If a discussion is otherwise more or less civil and is not actively disrupting the wiki such deletions are not helpful and will often harm more than help. That said, users who focus on out of process procedures, especially to defend non-encyclopedic material are being just as disruptive and unproductive as the admins who go out of their way to delete such material in out of process fashions.

I'm just kind of surprised that someone went to all of the trouble to logon from three different terminals in the library at my university just to vandalize. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 05:18, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I noticed this story as it was posted on another website. It said to see the edit summary so I looked over many contributions. I can't see any contributions other than making the right guard deorderant add so I don't know what they did in the deleted pages. However, Canderson7 handled the unblock horribly. He is supposed to make it unblock reviewed and give a reason. Instead he gave no reason and blanked the notice, only even saying denied in the edit summary. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AThe_Wiki_Fan&amp;diff=74189985&amp;oldid=74188777" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AThe_Wiki_Fan&amp;diff=74189985&amp;oldid=74188777" rel="nofollow">[31]</a> Then The Wiki Fan not knowing Canderson was an admin and not say a vandal (the handling did look like it wasn't an admin to me), put it back <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:The_Wiki_Fan&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=74189985" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:The_Wiki_Fan&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=74189985" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>, Canderson blanked it again and actually bothered to say in the talk it was denied while committing the horrid crime of protecting the talk page without good reason. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:The_Wiki_Fan&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=74190375" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:The_Wiki_Fan&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=74190375" rel="nofollow">[33]</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnomo_6299.html" title="User:Anomo">Anomo</a> 03:58, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Anomo, I'm always open to criticism of my actions, but I believe my handling of the unblock template was fully justified. There's no reason to tolerate a troll after they've been blocked, and The Wiki Fan was clearly trolling. However, there's no way to really understand that without looking at Wiki Fan's deleted contributions. I'm curious what site you read the story on. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanderson7_df2b.html" title="User:Canderson7">Canderson7</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECanderson7_595d.html" title="User talk:Canderson7">talk</a>)</sup> 12:33, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The site I found it on is not a liked site and I don't want to associate myself with it by naming it. But I'm objecting to the use of the unblock template. It looks like its first edit or two was to make on article on the real name of Linuxbeak, so it should have {{unblockreviewed| as something like "single purpose account, account exists for harassment/trolling, see deleted edits" and not just the notice blanked. It just looked like unfamiliarity with the unblock template. It is evolving all the time. Recently, I saw it has "NO REASON GIVEN." I didn't realize that could be done with wiki code and the whole thing of {{{1}}} being blank doing that is just lovely skilled code! So I'm just saying I think some text should have been written on the talk page as documentation, that's all. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnomo_6299.html" title="User:Anomo">Anomo</a> 13:10, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This may be a bit of a long shot but I thought I'd ask... I need to go through the edit history of a page to identify 3RR violations for an arbitration case. Unfortunately it's an extensive and complex edit history involving multiple editors. Is there any way of automating things so that I can automatically identify instances where an editor has reverted more than 3 times in 24 hours? Is there perhaps some sort of script that would do the job? Any advice or pointers would be much appreciated. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 22:48, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, since it would merely <i>identify</i> who had done 3&gt; reverts. No blocking is involved - all I'm after is data for an arbitration case.

<p>It's not worth the hassle; just say that they were edit-warring. If they were obviously edit-warring, you don't need to just look through their contributions for the arbitrary 4 reverts in 24 hours violations.

<dd>I know this guy from Fark (though I haven't had a lot of discussions with him). He's usually an exceptionally reasonable guy; I really don't think this is anything malicious at all. I have his email address and am sending him an email, asking him what's going on and explaining the consternation his edits are causing. Tatsuma could be a really helpful and knowledgeable editor (particularly on articles related to Israel); I think he just doesn't know about the talk page. If he has to be blocked he has to be blocked, of course, but I really think this is a matter of ignorance about Wikipedia policies more than anything. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 04:25, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>Thanks in advance for conducting an investigation into this violation. The current version of the grapefruit seed extract article still has some illegal copyrighted information left in it.

Again, Drini has protected this article which has illegal information in it. Drini has reverted to illegal copyrighted information and protected this illegal copyrighted information which is against wikipedia's rules which can be proven by looking at the history section of the grapefruit seed extract article.

<dd>There are (as I understand it) two other problems with open proxies. One GFDL which requires some form of attribution. I think this proxy server lacks that problem. Second if users are making sockpuppets or placing defamatory or libelous material (or related problems) we need checkuser data. Therefore a non-free open proxy is still highly problematic.

<p>Hi everyone. I'd just like to have the following clarified. I've heard it discussed before on IRC, but I haven't actually found any policy that implicitly allows or encourages it:</p>
<p>If a user has requested to exercise their <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Right_to_vanish" class="extiw" title="meta:Right_to_vanish">meta:Right to vanish</a> and have their talk pages deleted/protected, is it a good practice to indefinitely block their accounts to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Protect against account hijacking or prevent further misuse</li>
<li>Force them to request an unblock thus giving an administrator the opportunity to restore their talk page history.</li>
<li>Provide a record that such user claimed to have left the project on a specified date</li>
<li>Discourage theatrics because "quiting" would be taken much more seriously.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the above procedure is indeed commonly accepted, could we please have it codified somewhere? Thanks, <small><span style="border: 1px solid"><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetsnipe_10c5.html" title="User:Netsnipe"><b><span style="background-color:White; color:#003333">&#160;Netsnipe&#160;</span></b></a><a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetsnipe_6c35.html" title="User talk:Netsnipe"><span style="background-color:#003333; color:White">&#160;►&#160;</span></a></span></small> 04:59, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was going through what links here on my talk page, and there appears to be a problem with what one person claimed about me. User:XClyn is an imposter of me. I despise that someone would make those harsh statements, and use my name as a scapegoat in order to benefit their views, at my expense. But know, that this person was not me, and is not affiliated with me in any way shape or form. I would appreciate it if you would block the user indefinately for something else, but not as my imposter, because it makes me look bad for something I would have never done. You know my nature by now, and know how I operate, and it is clear that this is not me at all. I dont use vulgar language, and I find it pathetic that someone would become an imposter of me just to make me look bad. So, please at least know that this was not me, and I have no clue who it was that made these statements to Will Beback, and then reverted them (while using my name as the signature).

<dd>Wow! O.K., that was an unexpected response. Though I think I understand your reasons for deleting that article, I can't say that I wholly agree with them. I felt that it was a noteworthy article, but felt that the circumstances of the editing were suspect, prompting me to post my concerns here. Therefore, I humbly request an undeletion (<a href="../../../e/x/e/Execution_by_firing_squad.html" title="Execution by firing squad">Execution by firing squad</a> is an example of why to keep the article) and put a <i>request cleanup</i> tag on it. <a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAutopilots_f1bc.html" title="User:Autopilots">Autopilots</a> 07:23, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Brad's the Foundation attorney. While his statement may be influenced by his relationship with the Foundation, it rings true to me. Even if the Foundation <i>were</i> to be held to be a content provider (which Brad apparently thinks isn't the case), the editors of Wikipedia would be held responsible in law for their own contributions. If you put something libellous on Wikipedia, that doesn't automatically absolve you of responsibility for what you've done. It doesn't make any difference what the Foundation says, this is the law. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 17:40, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The distinction arrises because the Foundation and its agents (through OFFICE) exercises almost no control over what appears on the site. In particular what you post on this site will appear without anyone having approved it, and hence you are solely responsible for that content. Others might come along later and remove what you posted, but that is not the same as the agents of a magazine deciding whether or not something should be printed in the first place. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 14:48, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sysops, as a class, are not agents of the Foundation; they are (usually) appointed by the community. In rough terms, agents of the Foundation are those individuals employed or appointed by the Foundation and who are exercising special authority derived from that employment or appointment. This would include Jimbo, Danny, the Board, Brion, the election officials. It may include ArbCom, OTRS, and the Devs. It is unlikely to include sysops, burueacrats, etc. As a sysop you are personally responsible for your actions (so you could be liable if you chose to restore or protect libelous content), but you are not (usually) responsible for the actions of others. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 15:15, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I always assumed this was the case (after reading some discussions about s.230).

<dd>I have long assumed this was the case as well, and have said so on a number of occasions. I'm also pretty sure I've seen similar quotes from the foundation in the distant past, though I wouldn't know where just now. (Haukur, where does this particular one come from?)

<dd>I was under the impression that MFD's usually run for five to eight days. The intro to MfD says that "Items sent here are usually discussed for eight days," but as you noted some discussions are closed after five. I think it's probably a good idea to give the discussion <i>every second</i> it's 'entitled' to. No matter what the decision, there are going to be a lot of people who won't agree with it, and the last thing anyone needs is for the page to go through another deletion review because it was closed 'early.' It'll be over in around 24 hours, anyway. -- <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVary_c05b.html" title="User:Vary">Vary</a> | <a href="../../../v/a/r/User_talk%7EVary_f3a1.html" title="User talk:Vary">Talk</a> 21:04, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would like to use the username <b>Reformed Vandal</b>, which has been blocked because of <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSERNAME_bbd4.html" title="WP:USERNAME">WP:USERNAME</a>. There are quite a few ways of going about this, so I would like to solicit advice from anyone using this noticeboard. I have given my three most favoured methods, but would love to hear of other plans.</p>
<p>Please assume for the sake of this discussion that I am absolutely, positively, dead set on using the name - because I am.</p>
<p><b>Methods</b>:</p>
<ol>
<li>File RFC or similar, pointing out that although <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSERNAME_bbd4.html" title="WP:USERNAME">WP:USERNAME</a> forbids keywords with 'Vandal' in the title, there is an existance of a much more imporant rule, namely: <a href="../../../i/g/n/Wikipedia%7EIgnore_all_rules_528b.html" title="Wikipedia:Ignore all rules">Wikipedia:Ignore_all_rules</a>. Clearly <b>Reformed Vandal</b> will not be a username that will cause trouble to any English-speaking human. Therefore it is within the <i>spirit</i> of both Wikipedia in general and the Username policy in paticular that I should be allowed to keep this name. This is my favourite option.</li>
<li>Push for explicit modification of the username rules to allow potentially controversial usernames with community consensus (which I believe I should get for this paticular name).</li>
<li>Try to make myself an exception by some means. This is certainly my least favoured option.</li>

<p>Your thoughts?</p>

<dd>Usernames which include the word "vandal" are properly considered to be inappropriate for editing on Wikipedia. If a user is a "reformed vandal", they are well advised to avoid disclosure of this fact. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn254_98f8.html" title="User:John254">John254</a> 20:33, 9 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Why is that 'proper'? I can understand why something like "Vandal - the vandal on wheels!!!!" would be banned, but I see no reason for a blanket ban. As I have no interest in wikipolitics, I feel free to reveal what I like, as I do not have anything to fear from the consequences. I fully understand why in pragmatic terms it may be unwise to reveal the fact (given the temperments of some of the more vocal admins here), but I feel I have to - and that includes the username (plus the username is memorable, which I like).

<dd>Why <i>would</i> a legitimate editor, seeking to expand Wikipedia, want to refer to a past history of vandalism? Why would such a username be important other than to validate the "ex"-vandal: requiring us all to judge every edit against his/her previous vandalism and leaving us all open to accusations of failing to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> the moment the user turned on us and started borderline vandalising? If a former vandal had legitimately turned to positive editing, they would, of course, create a new account that gave no suggest of their previous behaviour and would never mention it again. Human nature. Statistically, more than one current admin would fall under this category. But a vandal wishing to parade the fact they were previously a vandal? What would that <i>mean</i>? <a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedvers_29e5.html" title="User talk:Redvers">➨</a> <b><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_ab65.html" title="User:Redvers"><font color="red">ЯEDVERS</font></a></b> 21:19, 9 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Quite. Being a reformed vandal is something which will become less significant with every good edit, why be lumbered with a username you will later regret? My children have boringly conventional names for much the same reason&#160;:-) Choose a neutral username and then say you are a reformed vandal on your userpage. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 21:26, 9 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I will address these points if you really want me to (as I don't want to seem to be evading questions) - but I am primarily looking for information/guidance on the username issue.</dd>
<dd>One thing I will say: I am happy to be judged more harshly, even with a zero tolerance policy. I am also happy to give away my real identity to a trustworthy admin if that helps. RVTA 21:37, 9 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>On the username issue: the policy at <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSERNAME_bbd4.html" title="WP:USERNAME">WP:USERNAME</a> has an "eye of the beholder" clause. So, yes, you may be blocked from editing under a name that another editor finds offensive, because another editor finds that name offensive. That's what the policy says, so you need to take any issues up with the policy, not the editor who blocked you. In other news: yes, I would like the questions I asked answering.

<dd>The username would not 'validate' me - I can not envisage a situation in which, in practice, I would be shown more leeway - if anything the converse is true. However, I have offered to have a voluntary zero tolerance policy placed on me to alleviate this concern. Your description of human nature is simply correct - there are many historical cases of poachers proudly turning game keeper, again I can provide cites if you like. As for the meaning, I suppose it must be related to what generally drives people towards guilty conscience type confessions, where one feels more comfortable having oneself, warts and all, on display at all times. I think the meaning is in there somewhere, but I am no psychologist. RVTA 22:35, 9 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In addition to this, I suppose I'm motivated by what seems to be injustness of the username policy. I do not blame anyone involved at all for this - the problems caused seem to be accidental but I believe that it can be improved upon. RVTA 22:44, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've decided to go about this in a more 'constructive' manner, so this section can be archived. I won't forget the useful advice I got from pretty much everyone on the noticeboard, but I will try to forgive the attitude by Dr. G - from my years as a vandal tbh he was very good at blocking vandal accounts; definitely in violation of good faith, and certainly stopping genuine contributers (I know of at least 8) but also stopping a lot more real troll/vandal accounts (at least an order of magnitude more - just like Curps/Cryptoderk/Lucky 6.9/etc). Although I have quite a few issues with the current priorities of the Wikipedia project, I'd like to record my genuine appreciation for how admins and others have treated me over the last few days. 84.9.83.105 23:42, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Folks chill. The heinous 'block evade' today was to point out vandalism ("blah blah blah") which I had overlooked when I protected a page. If that's 'evading a block to be disruptive' then I encourage all users to engage in 'disruption' of that sort. Further, he has disclosed each of those accounts himself without there ever having been any need for a checkuser to do so. Not to say that there haven't been other problems (incivility, personal attacks, et cetera), but let's try to stick to <i>those</i> and not invent ones that don't exist. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 23:00, 9 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It is not as clear cut as you indicate. Many edits were made after the block, the one you mention was the most useful one, not the only one. Also, while it is true that disclosure of who he is has often happened before checkuser, it seems to always be after he runs into disruption problems (when I assume he knows it is time to create yet another anonymous account). Remember, KI ran for adminship without revealing the FSF connection. Removing the tags and having the accounts redirect to his "current" account, whatever it is, is fine by me. Using a single account, with full disclosure of who he is, seems a reasonable thing to require for this user. <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_Signature12_b3bf.html" title="User:NoSeptember/Signature12"><font color="green"><b>NoSeptember</b></font></a> 23:11, 9 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sockpuppeting to evade a block is, in my opinion, a fairly clear third-rail activity. If "But, but, but, I had a <i>really good reason for evading my block</i>" becomes an acceptable excuse for this sort of disruption, we may as well all pack it up and stop editing now. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 23:18, 9 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Is it 'sockpuppeting' when you disclose who you are? I wouldn't think so. Block evasion yes. Sockpuppeting, no. That implies subterfuge... which isn't on the menu here. Evading blocks is bad, but I hardly think we need to "pack it up and stop editing now" if someone isn't crucified for saying, 'There is vandalism over here and I couldn't tell you about it any other way because you protected my talk page'. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 23:26, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(edit conflict) I didn't recall that he ran for admin as KI, but I assume that was <i>after</i> the FSF had been desysoped? If so, I'm not sure that he should have been <i>required</i> to disclose it... so long as it wasn't an attempt to get <b>two</b> admin accounts. As to sticking to one account... I think it would certainly be in the user's best interest, but I don't think anyone has ever shown that two of these accounts ever 'voted together' or were used to 'evade 3RR' together or... anything other than complaining about blocks on other manifestations. As I said, lots of problems... but I don't think sockpuppet abuse is really one of them unless I missed some instance of it. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 23:18, 9 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I thought I'd come by and say what I've seen. Irishguy has just been reverting nuisance messages, and I believe reverting the removal of legitimate warnings on sockpuppet IPs. 75.8.108.201 has a track record of leaving miscellaneous unsigned comments on talk pages, and then (for some unknown reason) removing or tampering with the {{Unsigned}} tags. Since being told to stop their actions, 75.8.108.201 and suspected sockpuppets have attacked Irishguy (and now several other editors who've interviened in this case) by doing things like vandalising his User and User talk page. Also makes some wild accusations, such as Irish 'removing' messages in a previous edit and how 75.8.108.201 was going to be warning him shortly via the edit note. In that case, Irish was simply reverting the tampering with {{Unsigned}} --<a href="../../../s/a/g/User%7ESagaciousuk_943b.html" title="User:Sagaciousuk">Sagaciousuk</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../s/a/g/User_talk%7ESagaciousuk_5eb4.html" title="User talk:Sagaciousuk">talk</a>)</sup> 09:52, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello</p>
<p>Would it make sense to include a new search utility run by users?For instance,all relevent search results from search engines(google,yahoo..) could be added by the user along with contextual information.This would help other users looking for such a link. Are there any copyright implications in posting links found from commercial search engines.I think this would be a good source for non-commercial search that users have found useful.</p>

<dd>AFAIK, a <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metasearch_engine.html" title="Metasearch engine">metasearch engine</a> isn't infringing the database rights of the original database so long as the originating database is credited. This would be similar to our <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">WP:FU</a> in images. But a search engine that, for instance, provided a frontend for Google results and reported nothing but Google results back, but didn't credit them and had no further use other than to do so would not be fair use. Certainly search engines could ask to be excluded, and meta searches could refuse to do so, but it would all end up in court. But like "fair use" on images, so far it hasn't happened. IANAL. The use of the logos on Dogpile suggests a contract, though. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedvers_29e5.html" title="User talk:Redvers">➨</a> <b><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_ab65.html" title="User:Redvers"><font color="red">ЯEDVERS</font></a></b> 19:07, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Database rights are a concept that exists in Europe but which is not mirrored in the US. The US does not allow copyright to be applied to mechanically generated collections or organizations of factual information. If you live in the US you would be entirely within your rights to simply parrot the URLs returned by Google (though you might get in trouble if the presentation of your results stylistically imitated Google, or your actions gave the impression of being sanctioned by them). More likely Google would just block you for running too many queries. I have no idea what specific arrangements Dogpile may have made, however. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 19:33, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

When users nominate for a speedy delete, they should be acting as an admin - given a different universe, they would be deleting the article; if something is reported to <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> that can be dealt with without tools, then users should deal with it - given a different universe, they would be dealing with it.</dd>

Whenever I tried to enter the most noteable personalities, the artcile was reverted, as there are 2-3 who are personally opossite to the tribe of those person whom I mention. I can also provide evidence and proofs of their personal enimity and the reason of deletion. Here, I must tell you that oenof the entries I add is an Ex-President, Ex-Chairmn Senate, Ex-Minister, Ex-Chief Justice of the country.

This user, who frequently logs on to Wikipedia as an anonymous editor under IP Address User: 203.175.64.10 or as a Sock User: Ghazni Khel has even tried to delete my AFD Tag from an article on <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khan_Habibullah_Khan_b439.html" title="Khan Habibullah Khan">Khan Habibullah Khan</a> (as per Wikipedia’s policy I warned him for doing so on his talk page). He has also tried to become personal with me by inviting me to chat with him on MSN (he provided his MSN ID batgram786@hotmail.com and which I ignored for obvious reasons). Additionally he has been inconsiderate of all other editors who have voted Delete on a AFD Debate on Akhtar Munir Khan and had tried to pass personal remarks. This user was repeatedly asked by me to provide sources of his preposterous claims but he never came up with any. Finally as per Wikipedia's policy I merged/redirected his two line entry on <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mina_Khel_19a2.html" title="Mina Khel">Mina Khel</a> (a sub clan of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marwat.html" title="Marwat">Marwat</a>) with the main article of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marwat.html" title="Marwat">Marwat</a> but he recreated the same and which is now pending for a decision by the editors for deletion/merging/redirecting. He was also requested to discuss his additions on the discussion page on <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marwat.html" title="Marwat">Marwat</a> but he turned personal.

<p>This proposal calls for a template to be added each debate in order to categorise it. {{<a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfd2_d3bd.html" title="Template:Afd2">afd2</a>}} was edited in order to carry this out, however it was decided to place the categorisation template above the heading. The result of this is that when one clicks the edit link beside a heading on an AfD day page (which I presume is how most admins begin to close debates), one brings up section 1 of the debate page (everything under the heading), but not section 0 (the lead) which is where the template is.</p>
<p>The end result is that for every AfD started between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template%3AAfd2&amp;diff=73317226&amp;oldid=65149919" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template%3AAfd2&amp;diff=73317226&amp;oldid=65149919" rel="nofollow">00:25 (UTC) 2 September</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Afd2&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=73317226" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Afd2&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=73317226" rel="nofollow">02:22 (UTC) 11 September</a>, closers will have to use the edit link from the AfD day page, then click the "project page" tab in the top left (or the "cancel" link below the edit window), and <i>then</i> click the edit tab again to edit the whole page.</p>
<p>Note that this proposal has been implemented without updating any of the documentation for closing admins either, so if someone would like to do that <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Lumbergh_3822.html" title="Bill Lumbergh">that'd be great</a>. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 02:38, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That is a very good point, and explains why I didn't notice the categories. I use AFD Helper to nominate and click the header edit link to close, as you say, which also means the article name appears redlinked in the RC list if the article is deleted, which is nicely informative. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 12:25, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It won't break the system if you change {{<a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfd2_d3bd.html" title="Template:Afd2">afd2</a>}} (in fact, that's already been done) to reorder the tag (saying this as tech author of the system), and that would probably make it easier for closers. (I'd forgotten the way that AfD's edit links worked, and thought it would be more visible above the title...oops...)

<p>It will be pretty obvious here that I am sick and tired of this particular argument, nonetheless the other party has asked for an external opinion, so here goes.</p>
<p>A website, fisheaters dot com, was spam blacklisted, see <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_Fisheaters_f6e8.html" title="User:JzG/Fisheaters">User:JzG/Fisheaters</a>. This followed a brief but intense edit war by the site owner, then using User:Used2BAnonymous, over a large number of links to her site. Since then the site owner has spent many hours arguing for the blacklisting to be lifted. During this time I have no evidence that she has added actual content, her sole intent appears to be to add links, not information. I can't see much evidence of adding of the site owner actual content before then, either, although she asserts that she did so, because for most of her time on Wikipedia she has not used an account, for whatever reason.</p>
<p>The final catalyst for blacklisting was the addition of a link to a mirror of a document which is hosted and freely available on the Vatican website, which is the original and authoritative source for that document. This was added (as were most of the links) by an anon, whether the site owner or one of her forum members or some other person I cannot tell. The blacklisting was approved and subsequently confirmed several times based largely on my evidence - the meta spam blacklist talkpage is not I think often visited by anyone other than a few admins and people trying to get thier sites delisted.</p>
<p>Fsheaters is a <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traditionalist_Catholic_36a0.html" title="Traditionalist Catholic">Traditionalist Catholic</a> site, supporting a minority point of view within the Roman Catholic Church. It is not the official site of any known organisation. It is not linked with any identified authority. The largest "trad" Catholic organisation is the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Society_of_St._Pius_X_8d3f.html" title="Society of St. Pius X">Society of St. Pius X</a>, and we link to their site on various articles. There are a small number of historied editors who share this minority position, and they are active on the article <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traditionalist_Catholic_36a0.html" title="Traditionalist Catholic">Traditionalist Catholic</a>. There are occasional amusing moments of dispute on articles such as <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papal_inauguration.html" title="Papal inauguration">Papal inauguration</a>, where it is asserted that the failure to take a supposed <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papal_oath.html" title="Papal oath">Papal oath</a> renders recent primacies invalid. But this is an aside. Suffice it to say that this site, although it contains some good content, espouses a minority POV. Some at least of the good content is available elsewhere.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell the site is run by a single, unidentified individual (or perhaps a small group of individuals), with no known or provable authority, which supports a minority viewpoint, which was linked to a very large number of articles by the site owner and members of the site's forums, where the site owner conducted a bitter edit war over removal of said links, where an agreement to "a few" links was used as an opportunity to constantly reinterpret "few" upwards, where links were added with misleading link titles (e.g. Catholic view of <i>foo</i>, not Traditionalist Catholic view of <i>foo</i>) and with misleading edit summaries. I can find no credible evidence that the site owner intends to beenfit the project by adding information, only links to her site. Discussions tend to follow a similar pattern of her repeating that she did not know that what she was doing was wrong, that <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> did not say avoid links to your own site when they were originally added, that I am an evil <a href="../../../r/o/u/WP%7EROUGE_ace2.html" title="WP:ROUGE">rouge admin</a>, that I bear a grudge, etc. etc. And generally they descend to trolling once she realises that endlessly repeating the same arguments is not going tohave a different result where I am concerned. Apparently this is founded not in my well-known disloike of spammer, but in some personal animus towards this minority group of Catholics of whom I had never heard prior to the December 2005 edit war.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, she has requested yet again that her site be removed, and has asked that some "independent third party" review the request. Since I am now sick to the back teeth of the endless argumentation and offsite attacks, such as www.fisheaters.com/evangelize.html and www.fisheaters.com/wikipedia2.html, I would like to know if perhaps I <i>am</i> being unreasonable, or alternatively whether there is more widespread support and we can send her packing.

<p>I'm afraid I made a bit of a mess. I saw that the page for <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Covenant_2361.html" title="The Covenant">The Covenant</a> discussed a group of science fiction characters, and I thought that since a movie of that name is currently in theaters, that title should go to a redirect page. I moved <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Covenant_2361.html" title="The Covenant">The Covenant</a> to The Covenant (video game), where I think it is now, but when I looked at the "What Links Here" page (yes, I should have done that first), I saw that <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Covenant_%28Halo%29_49f3.html" title="The Covenant (Halo)">The Covenant (Halo)</a> had previously existed, and in fact still is pointed to by many links. However, I cannot now move the main page to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Covenant_%28Halo%29_49f3.html" title="The Covenant (Halo)">The Covenant (Halo)</a> because the redirect pages no longer have only one line in the page history (this is also my fault, as I had the erroneous idea that moving <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Covenant_%28Halo%29_49f3.html" title="The Covenant (Halo)">The Covenant (Halo)</a> to a temporary name The Covenant (Halo1) would make room for the main page to go there; I see now that this was entirely mistaken).</p>
<p>I don't want to do cut-and-paste moves, but I don't think I have the authority to clean up the mess I've made. The result I would think is best is that 1) The Covenant (video game) be moved to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Covenant_%28Halo%29_49f3.html" title="The Covenant (Halo)">The Covenant (Halo)</a>, 2) the temporary page The Covenant (Halo1) be deleted altogether, and 3) <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Covenant_2361.html" title="The Covenant">The Covenant</a> contain a redirect to <a href="../../../c/o/v/Covenant_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Covenant (disambiguation)">Covenant (disambiguation)</a>.

<p>This is something that came up at <a href="../../../t/e/_/WP%7ETE_1869.html" title="WP:TE">WP:TE</a> (and I don't have anyone in particular in mind, just the general idea)... we've got the occasional community <i>ban</i> sometimes discussed on this noticeboard. So how would people feel about community <i>probation</i>? It's a bit like ArbCom probation - the intent is to allow us a lightweight way to tell User:Some User to stay away from Some Article for the next month or so.

<dd>FWIW, I tried a community probation (on releasing an indefblock) with an editor back in May 2006 that ended up badly (editor is currently again indefblocked) but there wasn't any specific articles that they were banned from as conditions of it. <a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 18:28, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sounds good. We can already do community bans; community probations and community article bans are actually less severe, and could help to keep around good editors who are just incapable of NPOV on a certain narrow topic range. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 18:35, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is already possible. Here's how it works: Admin sees Problem User disrupting an article. Admin tells Problem User to stop disruption. Perfect world: Problem User stops disrupting. Real world: Problem User continues. Admin blocks Problem User. Admin makes offer to Problem User: "stop editing that article and you'll be unblocked". This happens regularly and we don't need to formalise it.

<li>We don't need a separate policy, it can be included in the blocking or banning policy. A little support of the arbcom in this would probably help. If they support it, there's no need to go to RFAr. I would restrict executing probations to uninvolved admins, after multiple users (unrelated to the subject) have shown they believe the user's editing to be tendentious.

<dd>It's clue-based adminship, and I'm all for it. No need to write it down, we <i>know</i> that some people are OK as long as they avoid some subjects, and some people should be politely shown the door. It's only when it's ambiguous that we need ArbCom. The current Arbustoo / Vivaldi dispute, and the Sathya Sai Baba dispute, are good examples: it's not open and shut, and many good-faith edits are involved. The project is pretty mature now, some people are arriving with the intent of causing trouble, and we can see them a mile off. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 22:58, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

If an article meets our policies and guidelines, Google's opinion shouldn't really factor into the decision. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 15:15, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I can confirm that this guy is a problem. He is in mediation with <a href="../../../p/u/b/User%7EPublicola_d78a.html" title="User:Publicola">User:Publicola</a> over something or other; Publicola is an admitted second account created to push a particular editing style as an "experiment."

I tried to explain that even if Pepsidrinka <i>was</i> Publicola's master account, they haven't edited the same things so there is no violation.

<dd>Its not like deleting / renaming user categories is actually important. I'd still go with mostly ignoring the problem. Just shove the user categories aside and deal with them when people get around to it, which is mostly what happens now, as I understand it.

<dd>Agree with KillerChihauhua. On a related note someone a while ago brought up the notion of having another space for user:categories. That might make the more trivial user categories more tolerable and even if we only keep a few of them would still be good since these cats blur the line between article space and user space. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 01:23, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As someone who does a LOT of discussion closing at CFD, I'd be perfectly happy with jettisoning the whole mess. It just takes up too much time and resources to deal with, even with all of them lumped on one page. If people want to have their userboxes, I really don't care, but I don't think a category is needed for every single one of them (save <i>maybe</i> the language ones). --<a href="../../../k/b/d/User%7EKbdank71_f952.html" title="User:Kbdank71">Kbdank71</a> 02:11, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Radiant!, for your information, I believe you were on your 7+ month long wikibreak when these type of categories were first created. They were originally started to keep track of which users were using what userbox (e.g. Category:Wikipedians who eat apples lists every Wikipedian who has {{User Apples}} on his or her user page. <a href="../../../z/z/y/User%7EZzyzx11_e7c4.html" title="User:Zzyzx11">Zzyzx11</a> <a href="../../../z/z/y/User_talk%7EZzyzx11_0d23.html" title="User talk:Zzyzx11">(Talk)</a> 04:50, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Why did we need to keep track? Wouldn't a what links here work? I'm still not clear why we need to know that some wikipedians eat apples. I have no objection to being told that on a user's page, but I'm unsure how the grouping of such users through the category system helps the Wikipedia. Would we eventually have to kill all users who eat apples, and this is the hit list? <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 10:23, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I believe that the idea is so that apple-eaters can find other apple eating editors on wikipedia, which will result in lots of wiki-love through people's shared love of apples. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_b339.html" title="User:Dave">Dave</a> 14:41, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>On reflection, I think it's so that we can check their bias when editing articles about apples.

<li>OK, since I'm the person who's been doing most of the nominating of these things, let me speak up in defense of the approach of just getting it out of the way. When I got there, there were hundreds of user categories that were named like mainspace categories (<a href="../../../c/a/p/Category%7ECapuchin_alumni_6207.html" title="Category:Capuchin alumni">category:Capuchin alumni</a>, for example). There was a clear consensus to put "Wikipedians" in the title of all of them, so there wouldn't be any confusion. But this led to other questions: If Wikipedian was needed for several hundred categories, wouldn't it be better if there was no confusion whatsoever about how categories should be named? And thus the long nominations, which some have welcomed and others have despised. My thought is this: Let's get it all out of the way now, then (as I've proposed elsewhere) move it to its own renaming process so that those who do care can take care of it. I think it's worth it to run through the last sets of categories and then deal with wiping out entire sections if that's the consensus. Hope that helps.--<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Selinker_8b26.html" title="User:Mike Selinker">Mike Selinker</a> 12:49, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>In my view, the problem is simply that the <i>Category:</i> namespace has to cover too many bases. The <i>Category:</i> namespace should be purely for <i>encyclopedic</i> categorisation of <i>articles</i>. A <i>User category:</i> namespace would be helpful with the immediate problem being discussed here. While we're at it, we could have a <i>Wikipedia category:</i> namespace for admin categories, such as <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_categorization_f6e4.html" title="Category:Wikipedia categorization">Category:Wikipedia categorization</a> and its sub categories. By extension, I think I'm suggesting a category scheme for each namespace (Image: categorisation, Template: categorisation, MediaWiki: categorisation and Help: categorisation all seem to me to be non-encyclopedic, but potentially useful). I just float this as it occurs to me: does anyone think this is a good idea, one that could be suggested tentatively to developers? --RobertG ♬ <a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobertG_9f35.html" title="User talk:RobertG">talk</a> 16:53, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

While one can agree or disagree with Tony's block, claiming that Karwynn wasn't warned is pretty disingenuous, given that his edit summaries indicate that he full well knew just how rude and disruptive he was being.</dd>

<p>Got a dilemma. I've heard from a blocked user, <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWiki_brah_9e73.html" title="User:Wiki brah">Wiki brah</a> who created a benign sockpuppet account under <a href="../../../l/e/_/User%7ELe_Wiki_Brah_0c6e.html" title="User:Le Wiki Brah">Le Wiki Brah</a> in order to contact me. This fellow was a problem user, but I don't believe the problems were intentional. Rather, I believe it's because he's slightly autistic and has admitted as such. He wishes to reestablish an account under the original user name but I don't want to override another admin, in this case, Tony Sidaway. I know how I felt when I was overturned a few months ago by another admin. I've left word with Tony but I haven't heard back. So...what to do?

<li>I'm not comfortable with unblocking someone who has a history of poor behaviour, followed by contrition, followed by poor behaviour. That's not autism, it's trolling.

In the meantime, if he wants to make any suggestions for changes/report vandalism etc he can always do it on his talk page. I'll watch list it and follow up on anything he raises, and I'm sure others will too. That allows him to make a contribution and show good faith, or otherwise.

<p>I don't endorse blocking Tony. In view of many comments from respected editors above, and especially the reasoning of Bunchofgrapes and Newyorkbrad, I call on Tony to take a complete and officially announced break from the block button, for a suitable period of time pre-determined by himself. Please just pretend you don't have it, Tony. 22:44, 14 September 2006 (UTC).</p>
<p><i>And this post of mine was a comment on Drini's removal of text, which I would be interested in getting a response to:</i></p>
<p>An ill-judged move, Drini. AN is not a discussion forum? Since when? Sure it is. Why is the long discussion immediately above, not to mention the other long discussions on this page, appropriate for WP:AN — just not this one? A discussion of a proposal for a community block? Moving it to ANI might have been appropriate, but what business does it have on Tony's page? It's a proposal to the community, not to Tony. (Excepting my counterproposal, which <i>is</i> indeed to Tony.) You should move it back. 23:12, 14 September 2006 (UTC).</p>

Anyway, <a href="../../../l/a/n/Langstaff_Secondary_School_f6fa.html" title="Langstaff Secondary School">Langstaff_Secondary_School</a> seems to have had a lot of unreverted vandalism over the last couple of days, and quite possibly plenty before then.

It also seems like it needs protecting. At the moment it's at least partly vandalism, but my options were to revert to a prior state that was probably vandalised, blank it, or stubify it...
