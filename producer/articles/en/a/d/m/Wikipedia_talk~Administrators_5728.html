<p>I recently wrote an article on a comic strip called "Westside". No sooner than I had finished it, it was tagged with a "speedy deletion" thing on the grounds that I was primarily saying that Westside was bad and the characters were stupid. Apparently there was some sort of misunderstanding or something and my article, which I worked on for a very long time, was deleted. I posted several messages on the talk page explaining why my page should not be deleted and as far as I know (it was late at night and i went to bed soon afterwards) they were ignored. I am not, I repeat NOT trying to insult Westside, its characters, or its creators. I simply tried to make an article that Westside's readers could be pointed to for more information, as I should hope is the goal of your site, and any good encyclopedia. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 64.136.196.67 (<a href="../../../6/4/2E/User_talk%7E64.136.196.67.html" title="User talk:64.136.196.67">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.136.196.67_e76a.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.136.196.67">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>Objection! OHnoitsJamie has declared that by informing the public of a company which has operated for 3 years and is the most successful Internet advertising company in Australia, that this information is spam. This is simply not the case and I demand an immediate review of this matter. Commission Monster is a legitimate company and does not in any way endorse or condone spam and as you have a very well detailed page relating to the affairs of Commission Junction, a Chinese owned and American operated company, you must by right also be obligated to cover Australia and the Oceana region.

OBJECTION: The Herschel Grynszpan article has been subject to extreme bias by a writer who refuses to take additional references and criticisms of the presentation seriously.

<p>Is there a support system in place for administrators? If not, is anyone interested in creating one?

<p>Fang Aili used this as her only criterion for a speedy deletion of my stub on The Tuna Helpers, which I had planned to expand. She seems to be rather rampant about speedy delete, as one can see on her talk page. I think she needs to be warned about speedy deleting and encouraged to mark pages as candidates for deletion instead, since she clearly has overstepped the rules. I think the article I wrote did make a claim for notability, even if it did not satisfy the guidlines; therefore, she had no right to speedy delete the article. --06:33, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If it was deleted for notability-related reasons, you should get some secondary sources together. If there aren't secondary sources, then it does not warrant inclusion in the encyclopedia.

<p>That failing to satisfy notability guidelines is not a speedy deletion criterion is something grossly ignored by the Wikipedia admin community, and this violation of Wikipedia policy is actually embraced by most admins. The immature hall-monitor complex demonstrated to me by most admins, such as calling any negative evaluation of a person whatsoever a "personal attack" is a clear indication that the infrastructure of Wikipedia should not be taken seriously and therefore neither the content that arises from it.</p>

<dd>In principle, there is no hierarchy here. Administrators are merely <i>different</i> from established users; well-reasoned opinions given by anyone hold greater weight than any technical position. Now, bureaucrats are certainly highly trusted members of the community who each have a certain amount of personal authority, but administrators also are experienced, trusted users who individually are each more or less reasonable, more or less trusted, and more or less knowledgeable, but this does not mean that bureaucrats simply over-ride administrators or that administrators over-ride editors.

<p>First of all, this is not a vote, so your bolded declarations are not meaningful and even if it were a vote would be premature. There is no corrolary to <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a>, that is, there is no policy page about "What Wikipedia is". If there were such a policy page, that exactly defined the properties and functions of Wikipedia, then WP:NOT would likely warrant merging into it. It is probably better over-all, though, to describe Wikipedia by what it is not rather than rigidly defining what Wikipedia is in a single page, beyond "it is an encyclopedia". For Administrators however, there is such a positive page, <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators_37b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators">Wikipedia:Administrators</a>. It may be reasonable to confine it only to a straightforward technical description, and <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_adminship_is_not_3fae.html" title="Wikipedia:What adminship is not">Wikipedia:What adminship is not</a> may not be formal enough to be a guideline. <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_administrators_do_4c68.html" title="Wikipedia:What administrators do">Wikipedia:What administrators do</a> looks to be rather redundant, and anything that is not clear in <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators_37b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators">Wikipedia:Administrators</a> can be changed to have a simple introductory explanation. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 01:31, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_administrators_do_4c68.html" title="Wikipedia:What administrators do">Wikipedia:What administrators do</a> was originally an essay that advocated against the <a href="../../../1/f/a/WP%7E1FA_289a.html" title="WP:1FA">WP:1FA</a> idea and to some extent the arguments expressed at <a href="../../../c/a/m/Wikipedia%7ECampaign_for_less_bull_more_writing_ce80.html" title="Wikipedia:Campaign for less bull more writing">Wikipedia:Campaign for less bull more writing</a>. However, the language was toned down to such an extent this may not be very apparent. Essentiallly, <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_administrators_do_4c68.html" title="Wikipedia:What administrators do">Wikipedia:What administrators do</a> argues that you should support candidates in <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFA_4c83.html" title="WP:RFA">WP:RFA</a> if they want to clear backlogs, even if they don't have a lot of article writing experience. This is a legitimate view for an essay, but is substantially different to <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators_37b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators">Wikipedia:Administrators</a>. Regarding <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_adminship_is_not_3fae.html" title="Wikipedia:What adminship is not">Wikipedia:What adminship is not</a>, I would support a genuine merge, if that was possible, but strongly oppose deleting this valuable essay on the pretence that it has been merged into <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators_37b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators">Wikipedia:Administrators</a>.

<dd>The official process is to file a <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFA_4c83.html" title="WP:RFA">request for adminship</a>, and the community looks at your contributions and discusses whether they think you're ready to be an admin (i.e. will use the tools responsibly). People with about 75% of the community's support for adminship usually pass and are promoted by <a href="../../../c/r/a/WP%7ECRAT_3381.html" title="WP:CRAT">bureaucrats</a>. There are no official standards for who gets supported as an admin, but different people have different <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Standards_ce02.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Standards">standards</a> for what they will support in their request for adminship. Usually it's a good number of edits, (many people say at least 2000, but some say you should have at least 5000), a long time on the project (usually ~6 months to a year), a familiarity with policy, and no serious breaches of policy like violations of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> or <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a>.

<p>That failing to satisfy notability guidelines is not a speedy deletion criterion is something grossly ignored by the Wikipedia admin community, and this violation of Wikipedia policy is actually embraced by most admins. The immature hall-monitor complex demonstrated to me by most admins, such as calling any negative evaluation of a person whatsoever a "personal attack" is a clear indication that the infrastructure of Wikipedia should not be taken seriously and therefore neither the content that arises from it.</p>
<p>The resources required to express this opinion here imply that I represent, though perhaps not relatively, a vast demographic. To the misfortune of the project, this demographic includes experts on significant academic topics that are presently neglected by Wikipedia. That admin culture would persist in spite of this indicates that admins value their ability to affect the project more than the project itself. How unfortunate.</p>
<p>In consideration of the quote in the "Trivial matter" section, I think Jimbo would be particularly disappointed to see a readout of the common admin's dopamine levels when they mark an article that someone obviously spent a lot of time on with an AfD. 69.142.140.177 12:42, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

Similarly, {{<a href="../../../c/o/p/Template%7ECopyvio_c034.html" title="Template:Copyvio">copyvio</a>}} says "Do not edit this page until an administrator has resolved this issue," which may be taken to mean that only an administrator has the right to remove the tag if it's determined that the page is not a copyvio.

<dd>In many cases where actions are limited to administrators, what is <i>really</i> being said is that a <i>trusted</i> user should be the one who takes the action; this really shouldn't come as much of a surprise, because jobs like protecting the Foundation from legal liability (copyvios) or judging community consensus (AFD) are tasks that require a certain level of trust in one's abilities. There are plenty of users who are not administrators but who do qualify as trusted, but it's fairly difficult to set out exactly who these people are. By default, all administrators are trusted users (there are those who would argue exceptions to this rule, but the standard is that users who can't be trusted shouldn't be administrators), so it's often the case that "administrator" gets subbed for "trusted;" once again, this isn't intended to say that all non-administrators can't be trusted, but rather, that "trusted user" is much harder to define (and much easier to wikilawyer around; you can't really wikilawyer around whether or not you have a sysop flag). In practice in most cases, if a job is reserved to administrators but doesn't require administrator access to accomplish, and a trusted non-admin (once again, something we can't really define easily) carries it out, it shouldn't be reverted just because they aren't an admin. There will, however, likely be a lot more controversy surrounding a non-admin carrying out these jobs, as others may question whether the user is in fact a trusted user. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">(<small>Talk</small>)</font></a></span> 10:59, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I'd like to suggest a change under <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators_37b9.html#Other" title="Wikipedia:Administrators">Wikipedia:Administrators#Other</a>: "Can move <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_protected_pages_a8e1.html#Pages_protected_only_against_moves" title="Wikipedia:List of protected pages">move protected</a> pages" to "Can move pages that are <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_protected_pages_a8e1.html#Pages_protected_only_against_moves" title="Wikipedia:List of protected pages">protected against moves</a>." I think it will be less confusing and unclear this way (since people sometimes miss double words when reading, this could be taken to mean "can move protected pages").

<dd>There have been 189 promotions since that RFA, which was over six months ago. There have been at least that many that have not been promoted, all according to the established standard. You &amp; I are both well aware that there have been hard feelings related to Sean's RFA, but to state that the standard has been altered by that single RFA is misleading, especially when you're answering a new user who has no idea of the politics wrapped up in such a statement. The standard is, and has been for well over a year, 80% for promotion, 75%-79% at the discretion of the bureaucrat, 74% and lower no promotion, barring extenuating circumstances; bureaucrats have always had discretion in making promotions, and there will always be exceptions. It does not change the fact that the 99.9% of RFAs that are not controversial make the rule, not the 0.01% of exceptions. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">(<small>Talk</small>)</font></a></span> 14:28, 20 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I made three links, not one, and the latest of those happened just a few weeks ago. I don't have statistics handy about how many RFAs pass below 75%, but three out of 190 is 1,6%, not 0,01%, so it happens at least a hundred times more often than you claim it does. Note that I am not stating that this is a problem; I am only stating that RFAs can and do pass under 75%. Obviously most admin nominations are not controversial; the point is that those that are, are decided by whichever crat gets there first, and this is accountable to neither the community nor the arbcom. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 14:37, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I wasn't aware that we were going to be pedantic about it, but if we are, it's 1.6%, not 1,6%. Now, leaving the silliness of "I know what you're saying but want to make a point at your expense" behind, my point remains: There are very infrequent exceptions to the rule, but that does not change the rule. The standard is as I set out above. As for the accountability of bureaucrats, we are accountable to the community, and to the Arbitration Committee; that the AC has not chosen to remove anyone's rights since Ed Poor was asked to step down does not mean they do not have the authority to do so. If I suddenly decided to begin promoting users who had unanimous opposition on RFA, I would quickly lose my status. That some have disagreed with particular expressions of bureaucrat judgment (which, by the way, were supported by just as many users) does not make for an argument that the bureaucrat staff is unaccountable. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">(<small>Talk</small>)</font></a></span> 14:45, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I'm not talking about a crat going totally insane (obviously he'd be demoted post haste), but more subtle cases of unfairness or double standards. The ArbCom decided <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Giano_Proposed_decision_db5e.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Giano/Proposed decision">here</a> that they will not look into improper RFA closings, so it would seem that crats are not accountable to the ArbCom. And how exactly are 'crats accountable to the community? The community can say what they like, and a 'crat can decide to step down on grounds of that, but can also decide to ignore any and all of it. That's not accountability. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 14:53, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>(de-indenting before we end up with one-word-per-line) If the standard for accountability is "Any bureaucrat decision with which some people object is cause for immediate de-bureaucratting" then no, we are not accountable. If, however, the standard is the same as it is for administrative and editorial actions, then we are quite accountable to the community. In case I've left you wondering, the standard of accountability for administrative and editorial actions is "Those who demonstrate a pattern of bad judgment and abuse of the priviledges granted to them will lose those priviledges." We don't ban editors for one controverisal revert, we don't de-admin administrators for one controversial AFD closure, and we don't de-bureaucrat bureaucrats for one controversial RFA closure. I guarantee that when someone can demonstrate a pattern of repeated bad judgement in the use of bureaucrat rights, the Arbitration Committee will act to de-bureaucrat that individual. That there are only 24 bureaucrats, only 10 of whom are remotely active in using thier bureaucrat rights, and that all of them are sensible, well-respected individuals makes it highly unlikely that such a case will ever happen. It does not mean, however, that if they actually did something that warranted de-bureaucratting it would not happen, and <b>that</b> is what accountability means: If you actually do something for which you should be held accountable, you will be. It does not mean providing for vigilante de-bureaucratting of anyone who makes a call that generates disagreement. "No bureaucrat has actually done anything to deserve being kicked out" does not equate to "The bureaucrats are not accountable." <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">(<small>Talk</small>)</font></a></span> 15:06, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Again with the straw men. Nowhere am I suggesting anything even remotely resembling "Any bureaucrat decision with which some people object is cause for immediate de-bureaucratting". You appear to be jumping to the conclusion that I might be part of that old lynch mob; let me assure you that I'm not. My point is that (1) there is no mechanism to appeal bureaucrat action, and (2) there is no mechanism by which the community could remove bureaucrat rights. Thus crats are not accountable to the community (for that matter, neither are admins, although there are mechanisms to appeal admin actions). <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 15:13, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

It may or may not be a good edit (I'd need to check everyone's sources to have an opinion on that) but on what I've seen so far, this is purely a content dispute and the fact that William is an admin is irrelevant, and I don't see what you hope to gain by discussing this matter here?

<p>Let me start over (this time without a specific example) so I know how to proceed (and not with the example above). When an administrator is violating policies (i.e. Vandalism, 3RR, etc) what, where and how is this dealt with?

<p>THIS obviously doesn't apply to ALL adminstrators, but rather a tight-knit group of administrators that watch, edit, and constantly revert most changes (however minor) to many Jewish-themed articles. I'm not here to name names, but if one looks at the edit histories of this tight-knit group of administrators almost ALL of their edits are in relation to Jewish-themed articles, somewhere in the range of 75-90%, with some of them close to 100% exclusive editing of Jewish-themed articles.</p>
<p>Now, I understand that certain administrators have certain pet articles or favorite groups of articles usually focused on a single theme that they most like to edit/patrol, <i>but what does it say about the priorities of these powerful administrators that spend 75-90% of their time editing Jewish-themed articles to the exclusion of all other articles</i>, eventually abandoning the rest of Wikipedia for their own set of articles yet still retaining all of the privileges and powers of an administrator with broad powers over the entire project (even though they rarely if ever edit non-Jewish themed articles or even care about them, as stated)? So, I ask: once these administrators get locked in to this cycle of editing only their particular set of pet articles and ignoring the other 99.99% of Wikipedia (even though they are supposed to be the police or 'guardians' of the <b>entire project</b>), are they still looking out for the <i>entire project</i> or just their special sub-set of articles? What admins. are doing the 'grunt work' and looking after the well-being of the entire project while this set of narrow editing administrators ignore the rest of Wikipedia in favor of their special articles and pet projects? These are a few questions I'd like answered...thanks for any replies. --<a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWassermannNYC_d58e.html" title="User:WassermannNYC">WassermannNYC</a> 04:55, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I like to call them "administraitors" because of their betrayal of the spirit and cause of the <i>entire project</i> and their increasingly blatant and ridiculous attempts at keeping valid, well sourced, and highly relevant information out of 'their' closely guarded Jewish-themed articles.

<dd>Well, you request adminship at <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFA_4c83.html" title="WP:RFA">WP:RFA</a>, and then are discussed.

<dd>I'm saying something similar to what Radiant elaborated on. Basically, i'm saying that "adminship is no big deal" is a good philosophy to keep in mind, but it's not really realistic anymore because wikipedia now is very different from what wikipedia was when Jimbo whales said that. Yes, let's not make adminship into a BIG thing. But trying to treat adminship now as it was treated back then just won't work. Radiant outlined one good example of how things have changed because of how big the community has become - given the size of wikipedia now, it's almost impossible to get to know every active wikipedian. --<a href="../../../y/a/k/User_talk%7EYaksha_d46a.html" title="User talk:Yaksha"><font color="#330066"><b>`/aksha</b></font></a> 08:15, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Part of the answer may lie in psychology: people naturally think in terms of authority, and have trouble trusting their own judgement when they are part of something bigger than themselves. You know, it could simply be the name, which sounds rather "powerful" -- if the title were something like "User-blocker-article-deleter-arbitration-person", people might not think of it to the extent its reached. As it is, though, it's inevitable that many will assume the office is something equivalent to their elected representatives (and not in the proper sense of mere "<a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_servant.html" title="Civil servant">civil servants</a>"), or confuse them with beaurocrats and/or developers, thinking they are entrusting them with ultra-sensative Wikipedia powers. <img class='tex' src="../../../math/f/5/5/f55d4435e31a3e1d665905db4b6afe24.png" alt="\sim" /> <a href="../../../l/e/n/User%7ELenoxus_9f29.html" title="User:Lenoxus">Lenoxus</a> <a href="../../../l/e/n/User_talk%7ELenoxus_46a4.html" title="User talk:Lenoxus">" * "</a> 17:07, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The name might be a problem (as "administrator" implies authority in the context of most websites and computer networks), but it's really more the fact that administrators <i>do</i> have real power. When you give some users power and privilege of any kind that others do not have, it's inevitable that others will want it, and will work hard in order to achieve it. This isn't necessarily a bad thing; in fact, I find (for myself, and for others) that the desire to become an admin is a motivating factor to contribute regularly and constructively to Wikipedia. Obviously some users don't want to be admins, just like many people in RL don't want to be political leaders or company directors. But Wikipedia, as a community of human beings, is inevitably going to function according to the psychological needs of human beings - and one of those is the desire for power and status. It's quite impossible that adminship could ever <i>not</i> be a status symbol. To assume otherwise is to deny human nature. <font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89"><font color="purple"><b>Wal</b></font></a><a href="../../../w/a/l/User_talk%7EWalton_monarchist89_7ca3.html" title="User talk:Walton monarchist89"><font color="silver"><b>ton</b></font></a> <small><sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/WP%7EBRoy_e296.html" title="WP:BRoy"><font color="purple">Vivat Regina!</font></a></sup></small></font> 17:20, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Very true - that's why we have such a tough RfA process, to eliminate the possibility that a potential vandal or troll could slip through. And that's partly why RfA is so harsh to inexperienced users; someone has to demonstrate a vast amount of good, constructive work before the community is inclined to trust them with the tools.

<p>The image was going through a replaceable fair use dispute, which have not closed yet. I, the unloader, have made have made considerable arguments to validate its fair use, and have made changes to the article that uses the image to conform to Wikipedia principles. It uses a plain <b>fair use</b> license tag, with elaborate rationales, provided with readily verifiable external links (not a <i>logo</i>, <i>promotional</i>, <i>book cover</i>, <i>album art</i>, <i>screen shot</i> or any such specific fair use tag). How did it become <i>an image with a clearly invalid fair use tag; or it is an image that fails some part of the fair use criteria</i>? The fair use dispute was about the first fair use criterion, not a <i>clearly invalid fair use tag</i>.
