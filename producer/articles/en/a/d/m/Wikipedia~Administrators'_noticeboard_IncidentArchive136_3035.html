It is my understanding that the 3RR applies to bona fide content disputes. Is an editor (in this case <a href="../../../c/r/c/User%7ECrculver_e648.html" title="User:Crculver">Crculver</a> (<a href="../../../c/r/c/User_talk%7ECrculver_46df.html" title="User talk:Crculver">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Crculver_d387.html" title="Special:Contributions/Crculver">contribs</a>)) reverting several unrelated nonsense (but not necessarily bad faith) additions to an article in violation of 3RR if the <i>sum</i> of his reverts exceeds three, or should each case count as a separate 'content dispute' (if at all)? I am afraid that if we begin applying the 3RR cumulatively in this way, it will become rather difficult to keep articles with a high frequency of poor quality/nonsense additions in decent shape. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 07:30, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Generally, the 3RR means more than 3 reverts to one article in 24 hours. Doesn't mean to one particular version. Unless it's vandalism (and it doesn't appear it is), that user violated the 3RR. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">(meow)</a></sup> 08:31, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The 3RR always needs to be interpreted in the circumstances. The circumstances here were:

In these circumstances I think both blocks were justified, especially considering Spiritindia went on to revert war with another editor (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sanskrit&amp;diff=75340421&amp;oldid=75326203" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sanskrit&amp;diff=75340421&amp;oldid=75326203" rel="nofollow">this</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sanskrit&amp;diff=75370307&amp;oldid=75345432" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sanskrit&amp;diff=75370307&amp;oldid=75345432" rel="nofollow">this</a>).</dd>
<dd>I'm not sure that I agree that more than three reverts to an article necessarily means that the 3RR has been breached. Clearly four of the same revert is a breach. But if a long-time editor of an article reverts four different contributors making four different edits, I wouldn't be so sure. One would need to look closer at the number of reverts, and their attitude, ie. whether they were reverting in good faith or to protect their version of the page. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 08:55, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is one of those situations where 3RR is being applied mechanistically. There is no doubt that the text Crculver reverted was POV, redundant with a more encyclopaedic treatment of the same facts higher up, and in somewhat questionable English (this is by now a very mature and well-written article with largely excellent use of English, scholarly in both tone and content); it seems to me that the article is better without that text. Nor was Crculver the only editor reverting it. Spiritindia inserted text and then refused to support its inclusion on Talk, and reinserted it with a variety of patently false assertions such as "no reason given for removal". It's obvious who the source of the problem is, here. If Crculver is repentant and asking to be unblocked I suggest we admonish him and unblock, if Blnguyen agrees. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 09:39, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think Guy makes a good point. Let's consider my favourite article, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_KLF_651e.html" title="The KLF">The KLF</a>. This is a Featured Article which is meticulously referenced but I doubt it's on many watchlists. An FA can be improved, of course, and I have no POV to protect, but what if 4 or 5 anons come along in a day and insert bad English, uncited assertions and general crapness? Am I supposed to say well I've reverted 3 times in a day it'll have to wait? Am I going to be blocked for removing crud 4 times in a day? I sure hope not. Also, I don't think it's fair to apply 3RR against a sole editor who is tackling 4 "opponents", unless those "opponents" collectively get 3RR too. Otherwise, in an edit war a gang of meatpuppets are guaranteed to win. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 09:47, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>IN fairness to Blnguyen the two other editors then involved in the war (including Spiritindia) were blocked as well, and we do not endorse reversion as a way of pursuing content disputes. Thus far Crculver seems to have taken it in good part.

<p>hm, I was referring to the circumstance that Crculver was blocked for <i>96</i> hours for <i>7</i> reverts, i.e. his 'Spiritindia' reverts were cumulated with other cleanup he had been doing. It may be arguable that Crculver did 4 reverts against Spiritindia, but to penalize him for <i>7</i> seems extremely 'mechanistic'.

<p>While I am not saying that Crculver did or did not do something wrong, as I would have to check into it further, I am uncomfortable about blocking someone for removing unsourced statements from an article. It is allowed for negative statements on the biographies of living people and I see no reason why it should not be allowed for other articles, whether the statements are negative, positive or neutral. Also, it is very disturbing to think that the three revert policy could be used to keep a clearly false statement in an article. However, there is the troubling problem of people claiming that things are unsourced when they clearly are not or claiming that the source is not reliable, even though it is (although there are plenty of people who use awful sources). -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 06:53, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Correct me if I am wrong but images taken off the state attorneys website are in fact permissable. As for fictional characters if the image is released to the public domain in the form of a press kit then these images are being released to be used by the public for purposes of exposure. Should we use fair use images over free ones, of course not, should we delete all the fair use ones and wait for free ones, of course not. Should we substitute fair use images with free ones that are of far inferior quality, surely not. However a free image should be used when it is of equal or superior quality then the fair use.

<dd>Ok, a question: What measures are being taken to ensure this is <i>not</i> a meerly destructive campaign? Whilst Ed means well, simply removing all such images en masse will damage many, many articles, and often in cases were the aquisition of such imagery is difficult to impossible. If Ed was publically part of a wikiproject that was actively working for alternatives, contacting people to try and get promophotos under the GDFL, there would be no question about good faith. But it seems there is a nieve assumption being made that GDFL or otherwise free images will always be practically availible, which is certainly not the reality. I strongly advise that Ed stop all such actions and begins to work more productively with the community on this. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> 14:01, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, it's not assuming bad faith, removing informative material from an article reduces it's quality, and to reduce the quality of things en masse is by definition destructive. It appears that whilst you do mean well, you have not thought about the implications of much of what is being done. The discussion at <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">WP:FU</a> appears to suffers from a nieve belief that free images can always be taken, or permission will be granted, whilst in reality this is not a sensible assumption. Whether you are involved in sourcing replacements is an indication of your beliefs and motivations. By removing images but not seeking replacements, it creates a classic example of pure wikilawyering, rather than a strive to actually improve the articles. Whilst unfree images are indeed bad, images add significant content to an article, and most visitors to wikipedia will not understand the concept of GDFL, only that we don't have a pretty image. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> 14:29, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is your opinion that removing Fair Use images reduces the "quality" of the article. Our policy is based on the philiosophy that articles with avoidable fair use images are of a less quality with respect to creating a free encyclopedia. I believe that removing these images will long-term improve the project as people strive to find free replacements for the spaces. If you think my motives are anything but the best interests of the project then you are mistaken. <span style="font-family: Verdana;"><a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_g2s_b24e.html" title="User:Ed g2s">ed g2s</a> • <a href="../../../e/d/_/User_talk%7EEd_g2s_9b37.html" title="User talk:Ed g2s">talk</a></span> 14:37, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ed, I truly do believe that you were acting in good faith and meant the absolute best. Please understand that. What is being taken issue with is the medium-term implications, as it will take quite some time indeed to aquire free images and it is nieve to assume otherwise. May I suggest an alternative change in approach: Do a small numder a week, or even better announce the intention to remove the image link and mark the image for deletion in the following week. By making this a systematic project, people will have adequate warning to work on creating the replacements. Indeed, I would fully back such a measured scheme to remove all such images, it just has to give proper opportunity to work on aquiring replacements. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> 15:03, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Lina's suggestion seems reasonable (I'm still not convinced there is a policy cause to remove these images anyways since they are fair use and we don't have alternatives at the moment (obviously photos that are claimed promo with no good justification should be removed but I dont see that claim being made for these photos in general). Incidentally, please note that Jimbo's opinion isn't binding unless he speaks <a href="../../../e/x/_/Ex_cathedra.html" title="Ex cathedra">ex cathedra</a> which I don't see him as having done in this case. Also Wikipedia may be now well known enough such that we could set up or work with some celebrities to release GFDL or similarly marked photos (I'm aware of a few less famous cases (mainly scientists) where this has been done). <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 15:21, 14 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I expect your focusing on the "could be created" section. They are describing images such as flags and maps here. These are something that an editor may be able to recreate and release for free. Under your definition, no fair use would be acceptable as all images "could be" recreated for free. However, were not talking about people here. We should not have wikipedia paparazzi hunting down celebs to take pics for free release. Fair Use is perfectly acceptable until we can find or someone releases a free image.

<dd>Rather than continuing to argue, can we agree to a compromise here? Annoyingly it is true that if someone is still alive and not a complete recluse or highly restrictive of photographing them, we should somehow be able to create GDFL or similarly licenced images. And if that is the case, the <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_criteria_7a9f.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use criteria">Wikipedia:Fair use criteria</a> do not apply. However, as a gesture of good faith and in an attempt to minimise the short term damages, image deletions will be carried out with warning and in a series of phases, allowing time for free images to be sourced.

<p>If someone needs to see something labelled with a "policy" template that supports this, see item number one of <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_criteria_7a9f.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use criteria">Wikipedia:Fair use criteria</a>. We, and by we I mean both those people dealing with <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use</a> issues and Wikipedians in general, have been encouraged to begin enforcing our fair use guidelines and policy, which we have, to date, been extremely lax about. The best way to support the continued careful and thoughtful use of unfreely licensed content on Wikipedia is to demonstrate that we are not using it to replace the freely licensed content that we're trying to provide here. The "promotional" template is an extreme case; very few of these images can actually be demonstrated to have their copyright owned by the subject or their agents. That means that they fail our basic sourcing requirements as well. The cleanup of that category is going to be a huge job, and I encourage interested editors to pitch in and help. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 16:34, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>My own view, which is at the extreme end of the spectrum I know, and therefore not (yet) formal policy in every case, is that we ought to have almost no fair use, outside of a very narrow class of images that are of unique historical importance.</p>
<p>The cover of an album is the best and only sensible illustration of an article about that album, for example. A screenshot from a movie is often also the best and only sensible illustration. Some pictures (Elian Gonzales and the Border Patrol for example) are historically critical and irreplacable and worth fighting a fair use battle for if necessary.

<dd>Well, <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> is almost always retained anyhow (seriously, read the articles on it, it's a confusing mess o.O), what matters is if the NAAG can issue these images under the GDFL or a compatable licence.

<dd>Copyright is a mess. Look at <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Licensing" class="extiw" title="commons:Commons:Licensing">Commons:Licensing</a> about it. The images that we have "by permission" are usually also 'non-commercial' which means that any downstream user can't use them, which means that our project fails to be what we want it to be. Ideally we'd replace every publicity and permission image tomorrow, but it isn't going to happen that quick, but it <i><b>must</b></i> happen eventually, and the sooner the better imho. My own view is that it would be better to get rid of the flagrant abuses of copyright we have before deleting all the permission and publicity ones, but either way, one day they'll have to be gone. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlisonW_8a46.html" title="User:AlisonW">AlisonW</a> 20:01, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I suppose that I neglected to mention a few points that may not be obvious if you don't spend several hours a week looking at our fair use images. The overwhelmingly vast majority of them fail <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_use_policy_10e2.html" title="Wikipedia:Image use policy">Wikipedia:Image use policy</a> or <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_criteria_7a9f.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use criteria">Wikipedia:Fair use criteria</a>; there is a huge gulf between our policy and our practice. It is already policy that if an image can be replaced by a freely licensed alternative, we don't republish an unfree one claiming "fair use". It is already policy that if we cannot verify who the copyright holder is, we don't (re)publish an image. Almost all of the images in the category under discussion fail on one of these two points, which are necessary, but not sufficient, under <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_criteria_7a9f.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use criteria">Wikipedia:Fair use criteria</a>. If there are images that adhere to <a href="../../../f/u/c/WP%7EFUC_7b76.html" title="WP:FUC">WP:FUC</a> and Ed g2s (or anybody else) wants to see them deleted, then they need to go to IfD. There's lots of room for discussions about how best to go about unfree image cleanup, and whether it makes sense to focus on categories that <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">User:Jimbo Wales</a> has drawn attention to or not (I suppose), but I suggest that taking the position "We shouldn't be deleting images that are against policy", or "We should rewrite policy so that we can claim 'fair use' on media that we could replace with free content and when we don't know who the author/copyright holder is" is not fruitful. As I said above, I'm happy to volunteer to give a close look to any images that seem to meet policy and are in danger of deletion, as is, I am sure, Ed g2s, and to have as much discussion about this as is needed, but I would really like to encourage people with concerns to think in terms of helping with unfree image cleanup instead of resisting something that is going to have to happen sooner or later. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 18:11, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This entire mass deletion seems to either center around a form of wikilawyering, or a kind of "end justifies the means" idealogical battle over copyright and fair use. I think it is really stupid that the average person making wikipedia articles and those that read them are the only ones that suffer from this. Obviously this is Jimbo's website which he is kind for letting us use, and he is the final authority on every matter, but it is not our job to follow his every idea unless he tells (or even implies) that we have to. I have great respect (maybe even love&#160;;) ) for him as a person and as an authority, but he is speaking from a macro-political viewpoint in his above statement, not as a writer of encyclopedia articles. Though I will say that in this situation I would rather Jimbo make a definitive decision that I do not agree with, than make no decision at all.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 06:50, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

Part of the reason was his alleged contrition, and partially because the AOL blocks that were aimed at him frequently hit others, particularly <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_4e16.html" title="User:Danny">Danny</a> (<a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDanny_9d6e.html" title="User talk:Danny">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Danny_ec43.html" title="Special:Contributions/Danny">contribs</a>). If memory serves he finally admitted that while the Garcia account was relatively well behaved he was also running the Jonny the Vandal accounts. He claims to be WoW but there's no reason to believe him, as Pgk notes above. WoW really isn't a single vandal any more - it's essentially a franchised brand that any old idiot picks up. Hephaestos, on the other hand, was a long-term, very productive, highly capable and very well respected contributor and fearless vandal-slayer (back in the days before all these namby pamby vandalfighting tools like bots and autoblockers and even rangeblock). Michael had a particular obsession with Heph, and it looks like (surprise) Jonny the Vandal did too. There's no reason to suppose that Michael will stop any time soon (he's been doing this junk for years). The sooner we permanently block those parts of AOL which can't/won't send end-user IP info the better. -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinlay_McWalter_466b.html" title="User:Finlay McWalter">Finlay McWalter</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/n/User_talk%7EFinlay_McWalter_a93f.html" title="User talk:Finlay McWalter">Talk</a> 19:23, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The major difference between Wow and Michael was their attitude - Michael was always a foulmouthed, threatening, nasty vandal. The real WoW (back when one could descern him from those who took his name) never was; indeed, he seemed to go out of his way to make himself obvious, and while his vandalism was frequent and sometimes hard to fix, it always seemed to me that (in his own weird litle way) thought he was part of the dev team, helping us with pen testing by doing vandalism we couldn't ignore but which (if some visitor chanced upon it) was both clearly vandalism and yet inoffensive (he could, lets face it, have renamed pages to something far worse than "... on wheels"). -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinlay_McWalter_466b.html" title="User:Finlay McWalter">Finlay McWalter</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/n/User_talk%7EFinlay_McWalter_a93f.html" title="User talk:Finlay McWalter">Talk</a> 19:34, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Heck, Hephaestos was a vandal-fighter in the days when there was no ArbCom, &amp; IIRC he had about as much clout as a newly-minted Admin today -- if that much (I don't remember if we even had Admins besides Jimbo in those days). BTW, Danny considered Michael one of his success stories, &amp; I don't know if he's been convinced that Michael==Johnny the Vandal.

<dd>Since someone else brought this to AN/I, I'll speak up now about my experience with it and the editors who work on it. I was so new that I didn't know what to do and thought that what happened to me was okay, and the way Wikipedia worked.</dd>
<dd>During my very first week as a registered Wikipedian, I put a 'cite sources' tag on the article page. There was an edit war going on about a sex abuse scandal and how the article should treat that scandal, so I thought I could help by asking them to provide a source for the content in question. I won't rehash the lambasting I got here, but if you're inclined to look in the history of the article's talk page and my talk page in June 2006, it's there.</dd>
<dd>I couldn't log in to Wikipedia without someone leaving a nasty personal attack on my talk page almost as soon as I logged in. I really was trying to help, but they scared me so much that I almost left Wikipedia for good. I didn't yet know about admins and that they could intervene, or that I could refactor personal attacks out of my own talk page. Obviously, I eventually decided to stay here and I'm glad I did, but it left its scars, which I'll keep to myself. I truly hope they haven't intimidated any others in that fashion. An admin really needs to see what's going on over there, because Wikipedians should not behave like that.

For the sake of argument, lets just call this behavior incivility. That is still something that admins should deal with. Your "voluntary efforts" apparently include reading incident reports like mine (which you obviously read because you mention incivility) and just ignoring them because they dont jive with your POV.

<dd>I thank you for taking the time to address this issue, but if this is really incivility and not a personal attack, that is all the more reason that a warning is not sufficient for this situation. ThuranX has two prior incidents with incivility that drew admin response (one of which was actually a full block), and it is my understanding that repeated negative behavior like this is particularily frowned upon. To give <i>another</i> warning after already having been blocked once is just inviting him to do it again and again. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkovich292_9f23.html" title="User:Markovich292">Markovich292</a> 21:46, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No the site is not really promoting POV. Infact there are some very old and possibly valuable photographs from the last century. But thats almost all that there is. First of all, the photos are all probably in the public domain because the site itself claims them to be pre 1947 and most of them are actually from 1800s. Even if they are not in the public domain, the webmaster can simply upload them here under a free license instead of promoting the site. What goes against the site is the persistent nature of the above reported person who kept making socks to promote the site -- <a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostintherush_780a.html" title="User:Lostintherush"><font color="olive"><b>Lost</b></font></a><a href="../../../l/o/s/User_talk%7ELostintherush_4204.html" title="User talk:Lostintherush"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 17:14, 15 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What is it exactly that you want help with? Can you confirm that you want to try and deal with the mis-use of wikipedia editing that was been causing your IP address to get warnings? <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> 15:31, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>We kind of need more information... but in general, if your school lets people access Wikipedia from classroom/lab computers, a certain percentage of your students will vandalize articles. We can deal with it, but if it gets too problematic we might have to block your school's ability to edit Wikipedia articles for a few hours. You can discuss specific cases with the admin who issues the block, if need be.</dd>
<dd>If your concern is just about students reading Wikipedia from school, in a nutshell, most of our articles are reliable, but they should never be used as the sole source of information, just as a student's paper that simply rewords the World Book entry probably won't score very well. Many of our articles cite their sources, which should be helpful to students writing a report or doing a project on a given topic. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 19:12, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was enjoying not editing Wikipedia, but have been lurking now and then and making a few comments here and there. Today, I noticed, out of the blue, that I had been placed on probation by the Arbitration Committee.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAaronS&amp;diff=75255695&amp;oldid=73269597" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAaronS&amp;diff=75255695&amp;oldid=73269597" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> Needless to say, it came as quite a surprise. After all, nobody ever told me that the ArbCom was even considering doing as much. I've been involved in ArbCom cases before, but only as a witness. Never as a defendant. I was placed on probation for "tendentious editing," with 5 members voting yes, 1 voting no, and 1 abstaining. The reason? Well, since I've been "banned twice"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3AAaronS" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3AAaronS" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> for 3RR (well, actually only once, since the other two times were later admitted to have been hasty, if not in error), it must follow that I'm a very tendentious editor who needs to be on probation. What is strange, however, is that there was no discussion of this on the case's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Intangible/Workshop#Bans_for_disruption" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Intangible/Workshop#Bans_for_disruption" rel="nofollow">workshop</a> page. Where did this come from, then? It was placed on the proposed decision page on 28 August 2006, over a month after opening the case (and long after I had paid any attention to it);<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Intangible/Workshop#Bans_for_disruption" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Intangible/Workshop#Bans_for_disruption" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> I received no notification.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:AaronS&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:AaronS&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>. Any discussion of the matter is curiously absent from the evidence page<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Intangible/Evidence&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Intangible/Evidence&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>, and, of course, I had no input in the matter, since I was never told about it.</p>
<p>This only underscores the reasons why I have stopped contributing to Wikipedia. The head does not know what the hands are doing, and the hands don't even know they have fingers. Now I have the distinct pleasure of being placed upon probation without any apparent reason or any apparent warning. I'm extremely disappointed in the administration process, and especially at the ArbCom members who who, it seems, voted <i>yes</i> without adequate consideration of due process. Their only reason for placing me on probation seems to be that it seemed like I had been blocked for 3RR a number of times.</p>
<p>So, now I'm on probation, without evidence, and without ever having been notified that I was even being <i>considered</i> to be put on probation, thereby preventing me from defending myself. Preposterous. --AaronS 16:06, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

If you don't edit in a tendentious fashion, as you claim, then you should have nothing to worry about. You were still editing heavily when the matter was proposed, but to judge from your contributions you were busy elsewhere. You had weeks to defend yourself, but you chose to stomp off in rage instead. Now you come back to find that the wheels do indeed continue to turn in your absence. I'm afraid I can't fathom how it is you've been wronged in this matter. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 16:19, 14 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Do you really expect me to keep an eye on an ArbCom case that I'm not even involved in? I offered my initial statements as a witness in July, and then let those people who were actually involved sort it out. I had no opportunity to defend myself, because I was completely in the dark. Furthermore, I did not stomp off in a rage at all when I left Wikipedia. I was disappointed, yes, but not angry. Just like now. I also find it disappointing that anybody who is critical of Wikipedia in general gets caricatured as an angry, angsty, whining idiot. I'm just presenting my thoughts, and I would appreciate it if you treated them with the same consideration with which I treat yours. Your hostility seems unwarranted. --AaronS 16:24, 14 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm just telling you how I see the matter; I see no need for you to bring in all those negative epithets. For my part, I've always kept an eye on Arbitration cases in which I had either given evidence or been named a party. As a frequent editor of a page involved in an arbitration case you were obviously a party to the matter. My characterization of your leaving is based on my reading of your supposedly final post on this noticeboard, after which you promptly disappeared for a length of time. If you've been characterized as an "angry, angsty, whining idiot" it's only by your hand; I've made no such remarks and I see nothing in my rather terse reply above that would suggest such a characterization. You were in the dark by choice. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 16:32, 14 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Forgive me for interpreting your statements as smug and dismissive; clearly I was in error. I was also unaware that people become party to an ArbCom case simply by association. I was never named as a party to the case. I gave evidence, monitored it for a while, and then stopped monitoring it after a few weeks. My final post to this page contained no "rage," just disappointment, as I have already noted. Characertizing someone as "stomping off in a rage" has plenty of negative and condescending connotations. You are correct that there was no need for me to bring them to the forefront; they were already there. --AaronS 16:38, 14 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This same thing happened to me, after over 1 month of my arbcom case having no attention its being proposed I be put on probabtion even though the other people involved, including the accuser do not edit Wikipedia anymore. Luckily someone drew my attention to it since after almost 2 weeks of no admin or arbcom member even noticing it I took it off my watch list. As it stands it would have flown right by me that anyone even proposed anything, actually ti did since they moved on to the enxt stage without even informing me. I guess its just the load of the ammont of work they have, but it seems it prevents people from actually being to defend themselves as at any moment things can spur along rather quickly, meaning proposed items to final items in 3 days after 1 month of no activity. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">User:Zer0faults</a> 16:48, 14 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I would assume that, as in most cases where probation is imposed, the involved party may make a request to have the probation lifted. In this case, a request of the following form is probably appropriate.
<dl>
<dd><i>I would like to apply to have my editing probation lifted. I did not know that probation was being considered as a remedy to be applied to me, and was not notified that ArbCom was treating me as an involved party to the case. I believe that probation would not have been applied in my case had I had an opportunity to explain my actions. Specifically, probation is inappropriate in this case because of the following errors of fact or interpretation by the ArbCom: ____, ____, and _____.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Note that if there isn't an error in the ArbCom's findings of fact, or there isn't a good explanation for the behaviour observed, the probation is unlikely to be lifted. (He <i>did</i> receive 3 3RR blocks over a span of six weeks, imposed by three different admins.) This can be handled as a single motion amending the closed case. I also note that probation, in and of itself, doesn't restrict an editor in any way—as long as that editor abides by our policies and employs good editing practices. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 17:55, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have a general familiarity with ArbCom procedures but no involvement in this particular case, no acquaintanceship with (?ex-)User:AaronS, and no familiarity with the subject article, <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">Anarchism</a>. It appears to me that AaronS has a legitimate complaint here. According to his user contributions, he posted comments on <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERfAr_c2e7.html" title="WP:RfAr">WP:RfAr</a> at the case acceptance stage, on July 24. The case was then opened on July 26 and ArbClerk Tony Sidaway duly notified him on his talk page that: "An arbitration case <i>in which you commented</i> has been opened. Please add evidence to the evidence page. You may also contribute to the case on the Workshop page." (Italics mine, obviously.) There is no suggestion that the user <i>must</i> submit anything or follow the case for a decision.</dd>
<dd>The form of this notice was different from the one given to users who were considered parties to the case, for example, User:Intangible. The notice from Tony to those users read, "An arbitration case <i>involving you</i> has been opened...." There was no indication that AaronS was a party to the case or was potentially subject to sanctions.</dd>
<dd>Once the ArbCom accepted the case, an ArbClerk sets up the case with its Case, Evidence, Workshop, and Proposed Decision pages. At the top of the Case page, the template reads, "Please do not edit this page directly unless you wish to become a party in this request." However, the Case page was opened on July 26, and AaronS last commented on July 24, on the main RfAr page, which does not have such a notation and frequently incorporates comments from "uninvolved users" (I myself have commented there on occasion, and do not consider that doing so made me a party to the case I commented on, although I did follow the cases thereafter). The Case page lists the involved parties as Cberlet and Intangible; there is no mention of AaronS as a party and, although it might have made good sense for him to be following the case, he was under no notice that he had to do so and it appears that his surprise at having been notified, more than two months later, that he had been placed on Probation, is genuine and understandable.</dd>
<dd>As Tony Sidaway indicates, what occurred here is an inadvertent error on the part of busy ArbCom members and ArbClerks in not notifying AaronS when an arbitrator decided <a href="../../../s/u/a/Sua_sponte.html" title="Sua sponte">sua sponte</a> to propose a remedy against him. No aspersions of any kind should be cast and good faith on the part of the Arbs and ArbClerk is not only assumed, but it is clear that the fullest good faith was actually present throughout.</dd>
<dd>However, given the error that took place, the appropriate procedure is for an interested party to make a request on <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERfAr_c2e7.html" title="WP:RfAr">WP:RfAr</a> that this case be reopened to give AaronS an opportunity to present evidence if he wishes to do so. In the first instance, an Arbitrator can present such a request, or Aaron can do so himself (it goes under Requests rather than Motions if a non-Arb does it). If AaronS wants, I will place the motion on the page for him, although I am not expressing any opinion on whether he ultimately should be on probation or not (nor do I know if he cares given that he says he's on quasi-perma-Wiki-break anyhow).</dd>
<dd>Looking forward, I suggest that it become a practice that if a user is named on Workshop or Proposed Decision as being subject to a remedy, he or she be notified on talk. It sounds from what Tony has written above that this is what is intended anyway.</dd>
<dd>This sincerely is not aimed as a criticism of the Arbitrators or the ArbClerk for an inadvertent mistake. (I think ArbCom does a good job; if I were to criticize them at all, it would be for the undue delays that permeate some of the proceedings; understandable to be sure, as we are all busy people here and the Arbs more than most, but ... well, that is a conversation for another time.) Nor is it meant as Wikilawyering; ArbCom is not litigation, and picky procedural points should often be disregarded; and in any event, if I ever have to Wikilawyer, it won't be for someone I never heard of before&#160;:) . But this situation goes to the fundamental fairness of the proceeding, and I think it is in the interest of ArbCom as well as the affected user to acknowledge that, an inadvertent mistake having been made, it should be corrected. AaronS may wind up back on Probation anyway, but he's entitled to have his say if he chooses. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 18:42, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks to everybody for your comments. I appreciate the efforts of people to take a closer look at this matter and to try to examine it as objectively as possible. To be honest, if the case were to be reopened or reevaluated, I'm not sure how I would respond, because no evidence was presented to which I could respond. My involvement was apparently not discussed on any of the pages. In fact, the only discussion concerning me that I can find is on the discussion page of the main case page. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELingeron_802e.html" title="User:Lingeron">Lingeron</a>, sock puppet of indefinitely banned user <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThewolfstar_d89c.html" title="User:Thewolfstar">Thewolfstar</a>, posted a long diatribe against me, it seems. I wasn't even aware of it, or, if I was, I don't remember it now. Thus far, the argument seems to have been that, since I have a block log with some 3RR violations, I must have deserved it. Such an argument, of course, is highly fallacious and unfair.</p>
<p>I only care about this ArbCom decision because it is a slap in the face. I don't think that it received the attention that it deserved, and feel that it was marred by procedural missteps. As I said in the beginning, if it were to be reexamined, I'm not sure what I would say. The most surprising thing is that, as of yet, no evidence has been presented against me. Again, thanks to everybody for your input. --AaronS 20:03, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Interesting point as to whether 5-1-1 is a majority here, but I've probably been overly analytic today on multiple threads so I'll let that one go. The substantive question is whether the user had a fair opportunity to be heard before he was found to have edit-warred and a sanction was imposed. Granting that there may be little value to reopening a case if the result is predetermined, the sub-question is whether there's any reasonable possibility that the result might have been different if the user had been asked to submit his evidence. Given that one arbitrator (Fred Bauder) voted against the finding because he found insufficient evidence against AaronS, and another arbitrator abstained because he did not think this user's conduct was serious enough to warrant probation, it's hard to avoid the conclusion that a full opportunity for AaronS to be heard could have changed the result. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 23:28, 14 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As a regular editor on the anarchism page, I can say that there is a good chance the probation would not have gone through had aaron (and others such as myself) been able to comment on the matter. As Aaron says, one of his blocks was overturned after he explained the situation. The blocking admin in the second case apologized and said they wouldn't have blocked had they had more information, but the block had already expired by that time, so he was never unblocked. So basically, he has one block, and considering the crap that goes on at the anarchism articles, and how long he's been editing, that's pretty impressive. Most of the edit warring that happens there is due to users who are now indefinitely blocked, or sockpuppets of those users before they are blocked themselves for being socks. A lot of outsiders don't realize this, so users like Aaron will occassionally be blocked. It's understandable, and it usually gets resolved without a problem. I personally think probation is a bit harsh in his case. Especially considering he was never even notified. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force"><b><font color="black">Ungovernable Force</font></b></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_Wikipedian_kitchen_68b8.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force/Wikipedian kitchen"><font color="green"><sup>The Wiki Kitchen!</sup></font></a> 23:41, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think the problem here is clear. I was the one that personally added the proposal, and, since AaronS was involved, having offered evidence and had evidence offered against him, it didn't even occur to me that he would be unaware of the proposal. I just learned that he was, and that is unfortunate. As Dragons flight suggests, if he has a defense he would have liked to put forth, I, as with the rest of ArbCom, am ready, willing, and eager to hear it. Place it in the <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAr_9ea1.html#Requests_for_clarification" title="WP:RFAr">WP:RFAr#Requests_for_clarification</a> section where we regularly hear appeals. TenOfAllTrades' advice on the appeal is sound. Also: it's a wiki, everything is reversible, I am <i>very</i> human (believe me, being an arbitrator has made me <i>more</i> aware of that fact, not less), and I'm still trying to figure out quite why the tone here is so accusatory only a matter of hours after this issue was raised. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 00:08, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you for your open-mindedness, Dmcdevit. I appreciate your taking the time to reconsider this. It is also encouraging that you are more than happy to embrace your human limitations, which is always a healthy and commendable acknowledgement. As I have indicated a number of times throughout this discussion, however, I am confused as to what accusations of wrongdoing I should defend myself against. So far, no evidence has been provided. The only thing I can find in that case pertaining to me, before you added anything regarding me, is a post by banned user <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELingeron_802e.html" title="User:Lingeron">Lingeron</a>, which was replied to rather eloquently by <a href="../../../w/g/e/User%7EWGee_01b0.html" title="User:WGee">WGee</a> on the main discussion page. You noted that I had been blocked a few times as a result of <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> violations, but much discussion has already been had with regard to those blocks, and their gravity is less than certain. Since nobody seems to have presented any evidence against me, and since you were the person who made me a party to the case, perhaps you have evidence that you would like to present. In that case, I encourage you to do so, so that I, along with a few other editors, I am sure, could respond to it.</dd>
<dd>There is also the issue of an apparent lack of a majority. If the required majority was 6, and there were only 5 <i>yes</i> votes, then this might be a non-issue. Thanks again, --AaronS 01:04, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If the other arbitrators join in the fair and sensible approach of Dmcdevit, it looks like the problem is solved. Speaking for myself, at least, no accusatory tone whatsoever was intended; I stated several times that what happened was clearly an inadvertent oversight, and was concerned only because there were suggestions (<i>not</i> by arbitrators, and some since withdrawn) that perhaps it shouldn't be fixed. ArbCom is busy, and Dmcdevit is one of the two most active arbitrators (being one of the two arbs who actually write the decisions), and the community (well, the small subset of the community that follows ArbCom matters) understands and appreciates that. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 00:19, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think this is something which should be done immediately. Even after a lengthy discussion and advice thread on his talk page, he just uploaded the same image under a different spelling.

<li>Cacophony posted a note telling him he doesn't own an article to which he responded: "Thanks for the Note. But just know, I still don't care about what you said... get off the soap box, k? Have a nice day:) Bigjake". If this user persistently ignores policy, I'd block him for that instead of the talk page blanking. Blanking in itself is not a bad thing (althought very inconvenient for others who wish to look up discussions with that user), but doing so to hide critical comments might mean this user doesn't respond well to criticism which is not very helpful in a shared project. I'd recommend one final warning, before taking it further. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 12:51, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

That same line of reasoning dictates that because the George Bush article is likely to be vandalized, we should just let the vandals go at it. I don't care if I have to revert it 100,000 times, my comments <b>will remain</b> on that user page. <a href="../../../c/a/c/User%7ECacophony_1b6a.html" title="User:Cacophony">Cacophony</a> 03:55, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Honestly, is it such a huge deal? Really, you're only pressing the issue because you don't want to be 'silenced' as you so put it, Cacophony. I honestly don't care about my talk page, whatsoever, but what gets me is your following me around and checking my edits of other pages, as if I'm going around vandalizing things. If you'd leave me alone, then everything would be fine. I do NOT vandalize other pages, especially legit pages. If anything, I add, correct, and clean them as per the Wikipedia rules. The one thing I do NOT enjoy is your moving of my comments on your personal talk page (for example) back to my talk page. Is that not also talk page vandalization? I admit, I probably shouldn't have called you a 'douche,' but you took a page I worked on for a decent amount of time and completely rehashed it. That's not the issue, the issue was that you spelled things wrong, left large blanks, and overall just made it look like crap. I simply wanted to imply, if you're going to change it, at least make it look presentable. Since my 'douche' comment, you've been after me, being the 'wikipolice,' and I see that I've not been the only person that has had to deal with you in this manner. Your own talk page speaks volumes. Now, if you just leave me be, I'll leave the legit stuff on my talk page, you can go on doing your business, and this whole mess will be settled. Is that acceptable to you? <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigjake_d639.html" title="User:Bigjake">Bigjake</a> 18:40, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>User IrishGuy is repeatedly revising a page to remove material based on a personal grudge with the user that is posting it. The article in quesiton is <a href="../../../j/o/p/Joppa.html" title="Joppa">Joppa</a>, in which I am trying to add a small bullet--no links--concerning the name Joppa. This is not spam, as he keeps insisting. He is also taking this out on the Songs To Wear Pants To article. This article refers to a songwriter. One of his songs is entitled "What is Joppa Anyway?" and it was included in his list of songs on the article. Again, IrishGuy is continuing to remove only this song due to a personal grudge. I will admit that, in the past, I have taken a rather "annoyed" backlash against this user, but knowing the policies better now, I am simply trying to prevent him from "personal grudge" vandalism of pages concerning my edits--which are all legal. Please help. Drdunbar 18:04, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The above user is spamming Wikipedia with advertising for his site and harassing me personally. This is the fourth time he has requested an admin to come after me for reverting his spamming. His website had an article that was deleted in an AfD. During that time, he sent people from his site to sway the AfD <a href="http://www.fmcrew.com/discuss/viewtopic.php?t=389&amp;sid=467de8b7c722001ac0dd492c40297b93" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fmcrew.com/discuss/viewtopic.php?t=389&amp;sid=467de8b7c722001ac0dd492c40297b93" rel="nofollow">[48]</a>, after that AfD the article has been recreated and speedied again twice.

<dd>I had already mentioned that my above conduct was due to an outlash against IrishGuy's attack on an article due to personal issues, and not wiki guidelines. I have since refrained from my actions, knowing the policies of this site more clearly. This CURRENT issue has nothing to do with my past behavior. I am simply trying to keep up a couple pages, and he continues to delete anything I put up due to PAST GRUDGES. Nothing I am posting contains any "spam links" or personal promotion by any means. They are legitimate additions to legitimate articles. He continues to accuse me in the eyes of administration of reposting a deleted article, which I have NOT done. You can check the background on that. I didn't even publish the article that was deleted, I was simply there to defend it. He obviously has an issue with me personally, and is using that to remove my posts. I have nowhere else to turn. I really enjoy this site, and IrishGuy is giving it a bad name. I am sorry for that, as well as my past transgressions. Drdunbar 18:24, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Er, Drdunbar, you claim that you're making legitimate edits and not spamming, but your most recent edits do not fit that description <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joppa&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=75921188" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joppa&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=75921188" rel="nofollow">[55]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Songs_To_Wear_Pants_To&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=75923955" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Songs_To_Wear_Pants_To&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=75923955" rel="nofollow">[56]</a>. It's just all stuff about and/or links to this Joppa website. Contrary to popular belief, Wikipedia does not owe random websites free publicity and webhosting. I've looked through the basics of this situation and it seems IrishGuy is in the right. Drdunbar, we'd welcome any positive contributions but doing nothing but promoting your website is not really going to win you friends. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 18:36, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I just don't see what my revisions have anything to do with promotion. There are no "links" at all to my website. I am simply putting up a song title that belongs in the list. If you also look at the history of that page, I did not put it up there to begin with. Another contributor to that page did, and IrishGuy deleted it out of spite. I have been simply trying to revert back from his vandalism. STWPT produced a song for the webiste. I have simply stated that on the article, without links of any means. That is not self-promotion. If you would feel better about another user adding, that's fine. But, I wasn't the original poster to begin with. Drdunbar 18:41, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's very interesting that these users keep popping up from nowhere all of a sudden, IrishGuy? Hmmm. Not making any accusations here, but they all share a very familiar form of argument--baseless and attacking. TRUST me, Zoe, or whoever you are, I don't need wikipedia to promote anything for Joppa, I've got enough of that all over the web. There's no links or WEBSITES included on my posts. STWPT produced a song for us, along with the OTHER songs on that article. Our song has legitimate cause to be there. End of story. You either delete them all, or leave them all. Sorry, guys, you can throw "spam" at me all you want, but any "real" person that takes a look at it will see otherwise. Drdunbar 18:54, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Finlay -- the escalation has already occured, peeking with a two week block (which happened exactly two weeks ago, by the way&#160;;p ). One thing I mentioned to Aecis that I find particularly of concern is that this isn't light-hearted Colbert-esque vandalism, these are nasty racist attacks. It's harder to laugh it off.

<dd>Umm... *waves* You can blame me. I made the suggestion that, if they met Commons policies, the images he keeps trying to add to the Sweetest Day article might be better in Commons; apparently he took this as an invitation to move the entire thing to Commons, which wasn't my intention at all. I've been trying to find a diplomatic way of handling this user, who appears to have an unhealthy obsession with Sweetest Day - he has outright <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Miracleimpulse&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=75217958" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Miracleimpulse&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=75217958" rel="nofollow">accused</a> myself and others of being shills for the industry, and suggested that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sweetest_Day&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=75192917" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sweetest_Day&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=75192917" rel="nofollow">Sweetest Day causes terrorism</a>, which doesn't break any policies but is a sign of this editor's preoccupation with a Hallmark Holiday. All of his contributions have been either to the Sweetest Day page, user talk pages, or inserting information about Sweetest Day into other articles. He's even made a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0igTvZzcN4" class="external text" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0igTvZzcN4" rel="nofollow">YouTube</a> video about the matter, linked at Commons- oh, and now that I've checked, apparently linked from the Sweetest Day page here on EN, along with the user's homepage. Anyway, I just wanted to clarify that some of this may be due to an honest misunderstanding, possibly enhanced by an unhealthy obsession with the topic. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 11:05, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am quite disappointed that what I thought was a invitation for an editor with a questionable history regarding POV to lay out the reasons for his attempts at ownership of a high-profile article was misunderstood by the editor in question. I think my actions speak for themselves at this point, though I am available for any clarification if necessary. I admit that henceforth I will look with a somewhat more jaundiced eye at the contributions of the editor who - in the kindest of interpretations - misunderstood my comments enough to report them here, but as far as I know that's not a violation of policy. Also, I am not sure that making the point repeatedly on an AfD that the Gujarat Administrative Servxs is not the same as the IAS is a symptom of an 'obvious problem with Hindu related articles". <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 13:43, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This user was originally the banned user <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Tonetare" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Tonetare" rel="nofollow">Tonetare</a> who was banned for leaving abusive messages on my page and a number of others (I'm not quite sure why he's allowed to edit now but that's an admin thing). That was the past and it's fine someone get's a second chance. However his pattern of behaviour seems to have carried over into his new username. we have him <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Charlesknight&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=75450713" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Charlesknight&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=75450713" rel="nofollow">striving for me to leave wikipedia</a>. Then we have a situation where he tells another editor that it's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mikedk9109&amp;direction=next&amp;oldid=75567862" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mikedk9109&amp;direction=next&amp;oldid=75567862" rel="nofollow">sweet</a> that he got him to quit editing an article and so on.</p>
<p>I would have never realised that he had actually rejoined Wikipedia except one of his first moves was to turn up on my page and berate me for removing german commerical linkspam from the english golfpage (a page he's never edited but one he seems to have picked out of thin air as an example of my "rude" editing). His MO seems to be abuse and then if he drops in the odd "gee sorry" and then carries on as before, then everything is fine. I'm getting a little tired of it. I'm also more concerned about the low-quality <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Coral_Smith&amp;curid=6458969&amp;diff=76013770&amp;oldid=75872563" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Coral_Smith&amp;curid=6458969&amp;diff=76013770&amp;oldid=75872563" rel="nofollow">like this</a>. I could explain to him as before why that sort of edit does not below in an encylopdia, but if he could never grasp why "smack-talking bitches" does not belong in an encylopedia, why is he going to get this? --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesknight_2ce5.html" title="User:Charlesknight">Charlesknight</a> 08:13, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

Not allowing abusive editors to introduce low-quality edits such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Coral_Smith&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=70829659" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Coral_Smith&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=70829659" rel="nofollow">Smack talking bitches</a>&#160;?

He has been deleting references that are connected to anything Serbian in any way on <a href="../../../d/a/d/Dado_Pr%C5%A1o_9179.html" title="Dado Pršo">Dado Pršo</a> and his edits on <a href="../../../p/r/e/Predrag_Stojakovi%C4%87_ea45.html" title="Predrag Stojaković">Predrag Stojaković</a> also deserve a note. He has then been blocked twice for edit-warring and the 3RR on Dado Prso. After <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN">User:PANONIAN</a> warned him (among other users) for his nationalistic edits, he told him "..<b>kiss me in my but</b>" and called him <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Serbia_0728.html" title="Greater Serbia">Greater Serbian</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Afrika_paprika#Warning" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Afrika_paprika#Warning" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

Even though <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAsterion_ed2e.html" title="User:Asterion">User:Asterion</a> noted and confirmed that he should refer to rules, he ignored him as well and <b>again</b> repeated how I was blocked.

What's more, he further continues an edit war on <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duklja.html" title="Duklja">Duklja</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/g/Pagania.html" title="Pagania">Pagania</a>, <a href="../../../z/a/h/Zahumlje.html" title="Zahumlje">Zahumlje</a> and <a href="../../../t/r/a/Travunia.html" title="Travunia">Travunia</a>; and openly refuses to discuss <b>anything whatsoever</b>(after being kindly invited on every single talk page of the the corresponding articles, including <a href="../../../a/f/r/User_talk%7EAfrika_paprika_bc8d.html" title="User talk:Afrika paprika">his talk page</a>.

An admin's descretion (which is all that could be reached here) would not be a good way to delete these articles. However, you should talk to the guy creating them first, really. The closest thing to a "Wikipedia stance" on these articles would be whether the individual quotes have been written about meaningfully by third party sources. But people might add more subjective criteria of "notability" to keeping or deleting them as well... this would all come out at AfD. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 03:06, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps it's funny, but it's nonetheless offensive to other people and should not be allowed on Wikipedia. Would you allow the behavior of someone making fun of the <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shoah.html" title="Shoah">Shoah</a> on Wikipedia talk pages? Checking into MarkThomas's contributions history, I also found out that this user's scornful and offensive language is nothing new. He seems to particularly despise Paris, as these past edits show:
<ul>
<li>In an message on March 3, 2006 (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:London&amp;diff=42067990&amp;oldid=41657801" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:London&amp;diff=42067990&amp;oldid=41657801" rel="nofollow">[89]</a>), one can find, among other niceties: " I think the <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_cities.html" title="Global cities">global cities</a> page on Wikipedia is in error as actually cities like Montreal, Sydney and Mumbai all have a better claim to be world cities now than does <b>poor isolated and declinining Paris</b>."</li>
<li>In a message on February 14, 2006 (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:London&amp;diff=39562170&amp;oldid=38907209" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:London&amp;diff=39562170&amp;oldid=38907209" rel="nofollow">[90]</a>), he argues that French people are "obsessed" by the issue of whether London is larger than Paris (first time I hear about such French national obsession!), and he states that his personal research has undeniably proven that London is much larger than Paris.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Probably the most bizarre of all is this message which he left on February 15, 2006 (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:London&amp;diff=39724260&amp;oldid=39647736" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:London&amp;diff=39724260&amp;oldid=39647736" rel="nofollow">[91]</a>) and in which he claims that the British government grossly underestimate the population of the UK. Says he: "I also decided the total popn of the UK at any one time is at least 70m not roughly 60 as given in official figures." Apparently, this is the result a major government conspiracy: "I think the UK Govt know about this but don't tell people as it would stir up claims of incompetence." Now that is really something, isn't it! <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHardouin_7fc4.html" title="User:Hardouin">Hardouin</a> 18:31, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

However, as self-described on his user page, this user is 12 years old. I agree with the general rule that younger users join the fray and take their lumps with the rest of us, but in this situation we may want to make sure that this sound principle isn't taken too far. (Alastor Moody is not a real name, so that's not an issue.)

<p>comign from this conversation Talk:Inconsistencies_in_the_Star_Trek_canon#non-corporals. I previously encountered Ritchy months ago when this article was deleted under another name. I contested it consisted of OR, after a length AfD it was removed. I told one of the other people involved I wouldn't oppose its recreation with some minor changes and as long as it didn't have any OR in it. After this article was created under its current incarnation, I was invited by that individual to this article to give my opinion to ensure there was no OR, etc. As apparent from my first comment:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Magickpickle stopped by and asked me to comment on any OR so we could stay on top of it rather than find the article at another point where it just requires removal.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>I made some comments on what I felt consitituted OR as requested. Another user agreed with one of the things I thought was OR and removed it. It spawned the discussion above, where Ritchy falsely accused me of stalking him. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AInconsistencies_in_the_Star_Trek_canon&amp;diff=76308351&amp;oldid=76282834" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AInconsistencies_in_the_Star_Trek_canon&amp;diff=76308351&amp;oldid=76282834" rel="nofollow">[95]</a></p>
<p>I pointed out that I'd been invited to this article by another user to give my opinion and didn't feel his interpretation of canon was necessarily correct and there were many possibilities for what occured.</p>
<ul>
<li>his response was this incivility <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AInconsistencies_in_the_Star_Trek_canon&amp;diff=76310227&amp;oldid=76308984" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AInconsistencies_in_the_Star_Trek_canon&amp;diff=76310227&amp;oldid=76308984" rel="nofollow">[96]</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I left a civil2 template on his userpage for it, the attempts to own the page, spout profanity and general insults after myself and another user already asked him to calm down warranted that. As far as I was concerned.</p>
<ul>
<li>He then continued with some false accusations on my talk page, accusing me of incivility, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ACrossmr&amp;diff=76313704&amp;oldid=76022767" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ACrossmr&amp;diff=76313704&amp;oldid=76022767" rel="nofollow">[97]</a> claiming I was incivil to him months ago on the AfD for the original article, I actually received a barnstar from another editor for remaining extremely cool on that AfD even though I was the brunt of several personal attacks and hostility for even suggesting the article might not belong here. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 23:43, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b>: Yy-bo's user page points to the user page of Nikemoto2511 on Wikisource, which links to a "closed" account <a href="../../../a/k/i/User%7EAkidd_dublin_1e95.html" title="User:Akidd dublin">Akidd dublin</a> here on Wikipedia.

<dd>I'm conflicted over which would be the more productive response to this user: blocking accounts, or pointing out that his command of the English language is so poor (e.g., "an unarguable Afd argumentation", "I stroked out his completely wrong argumentation") that some of us find it hard not to laugh at what he writes.</dd>

<dd>I suspect Centrix has confused WP:ESL with "English as a Second Language" when it stands for "Edit summary Legend". Or perhaps he is making a sly allusion to YBO's confusion over Wikipedia terminology. While I wouldn't object to someone attempting to mentoring him, the primary problem is that of communciating with him. I have read a number of his posts, &amp; beyond some vague impressions (e.g., he is upset about another Wikipedian nominating articles for AfD, he asserts that written policy permits him to do something similar to what he is doing) I honestly have no idea what he is talking about. I agree that he is enthusiastic, &amp; I so no reason to doubt that he sincerely wants to help improve Wikipedia, but until his English improves markedly, he helps Wikipedia by remaining a reader. To paraphrase Centrix's comment, Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> an ESL class. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 19:22, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I love the irony of your ESL vs ESL thoughts&#160;:) It would take a determined and patient mentor. Many have tried to communicate and many, perhaps all, have failed. Akidd dublin was his declared prior id, and he has similar issues there. I just feel as though we have somehow failed him. I know we don't have a duty towards him, rather he has towards "the greater us" of Wikipedia, but that does not prevent my wishing it could be different. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 21:09, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's been brought to my attention that this self-proclaimed <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_nationalist.html" title="White nationalist">White nationalist</a> has been editing disruptively on <a href="../../../p/o/n/Pontian_Greek_Genocide_8ec9.html" title="Pontian Greek Genocide">Pontian Greek Genocide</a>. For example, I note his comment that "...it's a <b>historical fact</b>. The Pontian Genocide did happen and [you]'ll better admit it" <small>(bold in the original)</small>, which far from advances civil discourse. I left the user a warning on their <a href="../../../m/i/t/User_talk%7EMitsos_358c.html#Disruptive_editing" title="User talk:Mitsos">talk page</a>, but I would appreciate anyone else looking into the matter. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 08:10, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Being a self-proclaimed white nationalist isn't in and of itself an offense (as offensive as it is), but judge solely on the nature of their edits. I have no opinion on this user's edits, if they are disruptive, then block him for that. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe">(talk)</a> 19:22, 17 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My suggestion is that Mitsos be tutored a bit on how to handle the problems. He seems to think that there is no reason to dispute the article. I would suggest to him to wait a bit, watch to see the EXACT problems that make the article disputed and then challenge him to find reputable sources to fix the disputes. That way wikipedia will be better for everyone. I absolutely do not believe his white supremacy feelings should enter into the issue at all. He is entitled to his feelings. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlue_Tie_f3b4.html" title="User:Blue Tie">Blue Tie</a> 02:49, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am sensitive to such things. I think that there are many such problems with wikipedia POV warriors. I have commented on it elsewhere. As far as I see it, there are two areas of concern: History and (relatively) current events. With current events, it is sometimes harder to find balance because not enough time has passed for the balanced views to be available. But with an historical event, enough time is there. If the next action you are contemplating is a block of sorts, I suggest a different path. Instead, Mitsos should be asked to read and explain the concepts in the relevant sections of WP:NPOV and WP:RS regarding such things and discuss his goals to resolve disputes amicably. I do not know him and I am not a participant in the discussion. I dont really care about it. But I would like to see him tutored before being punished. But I may not know what I am talking about. He may be impossible. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlue_Tie_f3b4.html" title="User:Blue Tie">Blue Tie</a> 03:22, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That was not really my intent. I saw you say "I guess I'm on my own" and I felt like it would be helpful to you to have another insight. I am concerned that I may not have much time in the next 5 days. But if I do and if I can be of use, I am willing to try. I have to admit though that I am not sure I would be any good at it. In particular, I already have a slight judgment that indeed Mitsos has been disruptive. But I am supposing that he / she needs some help in wiki-ettiquette. Sometimes it is also very difficult to "know" something is true and then to have to prove it by the hard job of research. If you think I might be ok at working this out, I will make an effort. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlue_Tie_f3b4.html" title="User:Blue Tie">Blue Tie</a> 04:00, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have been a user less than a few hours. I have made a half dozen edits, and this user has taken it uponhimself to unnecessarily reverse all of my edits. It was my understanding all of the edits were valid: enforcement of POV policy, deleting unnecessary "sic" term, removing clause that was not cited. All of my edits were made in good faith. Instead of even a polite mention of how they were edited, he gave me seperate warnings without basis that are absolutely absurd.</p>
<p>I do not know what actions the admins can take, but at least, I would like a warning given to him. I did not think I did anything wrong. Due to this, I will be deleting the warnings placed on my user page as I believe them to be made in bad faith, adn to be untrue. Thank you. I wouldn't do this if the user wasn't acting irrationally.Polmalo 00:27, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>As the original indef-blocker and primary hate object of Thewolfstar, I consider myself highly attuned to her voice and mannerisms. I'd say Disquietude is unmistakably her. For indications on other levels than "voice", I only have to read Disquietude's very latest edits to see her spamming <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">Anarchism</a> editors<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Hogeye&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=76366016" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Hogeye&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=76366016" rel="nofollow">[106]</a> with the suggestions that Lingeron's old friend, the somewhat notorious <a href="../../../m/s/t/User%7EMSTCrow_5721.html" title="User:MSTCrow"><tt class="userlinks" style="1.3em">MSTCrow</tt></a> (<span class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../m/s/t/User_talk%7EMSTCrow_0461.html" title="User talk:MSTCrow">talk</a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MSTCrow_3727.html" title="Special:Contributions/MSTCrow">contribs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">logs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../b/l/o/Special%7EBlockip_MSTCrow_e270.html" title="Special:Blockip/MSTCrow">block user</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">block log</a></span>), should be asked to "oversee" <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">Anarchism</a> (a wonderful idea). Note also that Disquietude appeared at Talk:Anarchism shortly (three days) after the unusually long-running and trouble-making wolfster sock active there, Whiskey Rebellion, was outed and blocked. Incidentally, I know the user knows about open proxies, but in herself, she has a stable unique IP.

<dd>Thanks for bringing this here, Aaron. I've requested a CheckUser, though I suspect the checkusers are getting bored with the wolfster sock-oh-rama... maybe next time is the time to start blocking all suspects at <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">Anarchism</a> on sight. It's always a little unnerving, I know, as the wolfster in any incarnation is always vastly indignant and "innocent" about it (even <i>with</i> CheckUser evidence...) <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 15:08, 18 September 2006 (UTC).

<p>What is this recent fetish with "verifiability" and having footnotes in every article these days? Not even the most minor article will be spared tagging with "unreferenced" if you dont provide any. When I started editing Wikipedia (on another account, I forgot the name) nobody gave a thought about footnotes and sources.

<dd>In response, to cite the official policy..."The burden of evidence lies with the editors who have made an edit or wish an edit to remain. Editors should therefore provide references. If an article topic has no reputable, reliable, third-party sources, Wikipedia should not have an article on that topic." I see the calls for verifiability as based on this policy and the underlying call for quality edits. <a href="../../../k/u/k/User%7EKukini_322a.html" title="User:Kukini">Kukini</a> 05:01, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Yes, thanks. But that policy has been part of Wikipedia as long as I can remember (pre 2005) and last year nobody really made too much a fuss over it, except on high-profile articles. Now people cite <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> ad nauseam even in regard to obscure ones.

<p>Wikipedia is evolving <i>into</i> a reliable encyclopedia better than Britannica. Verifiability is part of how we get there. That said, don't delete things you know are true, but don't restore (without an adequate source) inadequately sourced content another has deleted because they do question if it is true. Tell newbies unsourced stuff will eventually be sourced or deleted, but this is a coorperative venture and different people are good at different things so its ok to add stuff that someone else will either source or delete just as it is ok to add some data to an article without having to be responsible for making it perfect. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 10:01, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is not a social networking site - we are not out to recruit as many users as possible as Myspace is. Recruiting and retaining users is merely a means to an end, that being writing the encyclopaedia. Writing articles to the standard that is becoming less of a misty-eyed dream and more of a requirement takes some effort - I wouldn't say it's hard, but the fact that everyone <i>can</i> write something here does not mean that everyone <i>should</i>. If we scare off people because they can't or won't write encyclopaedia articles that comply with the cornerstone policies, well, that's not really a significant loss, though it may slow down the proliferation of fancruft.

<p>The way I see it, Wikipedia is becoming no longer the online encyclopedia "anyone can edit" -- which makes it fun. Its more like the encyclopedia "anyone can edit, with footnotes and sources," which really makes working on Wikipedia more like working on a school term paper. Therefore, more tedious, less fun, and less likely to attract new contributors. <a href="../../../p/e/w/User%7EPewlosels_77fe.html" title="User:Pewlosels">Pewlosels</a> 21:52, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>While I don't want to sound like a PE teacher from the 1950s, it's not exactly meant to be fun; though personally, I find writing sourced encyclopaedia articles interesting and rewarding. I can think of three important differences between this and homework; a) I can choose what I write about; b) what I write can be seen by anyone interested in the subject with an Internet connection, not just by the long-suffering teacher being paid to and c) whoever reads it hasn't just read the same thing from the 19 other bored kids in my class.</dd>
<dd>The fact is, not everyone will want to spend their time writing an encyclopaedia. The best we can do is create a community that allows those that do to get on with it and makes them feel appreciated when they succeed; if we tried to make it "fun" we'd probably either fail badly or turn Wikipedia into something it's not meant to be. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 23:27, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Verifiability is a very good policy to have when the accuracy of information is disputed or when it is about a living person and thus needs to be referenced... but I do think we go too far when people start putting 'cite' tags on every fact of which they were personally unaware - or even those they <i>have</i> heard of but don't have a reference for. Yes, eventually it would be wonderful to have direct easily verifiable references for every single fact stated in Wikipedia (though I note that Brittanica and the like go nowhere near that far), but insisting on such when there is no pressing need goes against what <i>made</i> Wikipedia such a major site. If we deleted everything which isn't properly referenced 90% of the encyclopedia would be gone and we wouldn't be so very popular. The vast majority of Wikipedia was and is written by those newbies who 'must' be bitten. As others have said above, we should use verifiability as a cudgel when it is needed to settle a dispute about accuracy or to avoid libelous comments, but the rest of the time we should just have faith that we will get there eventually. That's the root concept of wiki collaboration. We don't delete completely unreferenced three sentence stubs because eventually they can, and do, grow into perfectly sourced featured articles. Removing valid information during the 'transition' just annoys the people working on it and slows the process. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 11:34, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In some areas, it's brutal. Try editing any article related to Israel/Palestine/Jewish issues. There, even footnotes aren't enough. If the info isn't pro-Israel, editors are held to a very high standard. Otherwise, expect a tag-team revert. Read through <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Israeli_apartheid_073d.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Israeli apartheid">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Israeli apartheid</a> for a picture of how this works in practice. It's a group <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> thing. This intimidates many editors.</p>
<p>It's tough to deal with a group <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> problem. We have 3RR to deal with individuals trying to exert ownership, but we don't have a mechanism or policy in place to deal with teams. So we end up in messy arbitration proceedings, which wear down everyone not seriously committed to the issue.

<p>Stick has been involved in a content dispute over an article on the Stormfront website-- a white-supremacist forum. I got involved by responding to an RFC on the subject. The content-issues on that page can be resolved through the usual dispute resolution process, but more important are some of the behavior issues that have arisen out of the content dispute.</p>
<p>Stick supports the inclusion of a specific paragraph. As it stands right now, four editors oppose the inclusion of the dispute paragraph on the grounds that it may be consistent with NOR / NPOV. Stick has repeatedly inserted the disputed text. Yesterday, some other editors reported him for 3RR violation, resulting in him getting a 24 hr block . Today, he has again repeatedly re-inserted the same paragraph into the text, again violating 3RR. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stormfront_%28website%29&amp;diff=76381321&amp;oldid=76377803" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stormfront_%28website%29&amp;diff=76381321&amp;oldid=76377803" rel="nofollow">[112]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stormfront_%28website%29&amp;diff=76374019&amp;oldid=76372987" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stormfront_%28website%29&amp;diff=76374019&amp;oldid=76372987" rel="nofollow">[113]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stormfront_%28website%29&amp;diff=76363451&amp;oldid=76360304" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stormfront_%28website%29&amp;diff=76363451&amp;oldid=76360304" rel="nofollow">[114]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stormfront_%28website%29&amp;diff=76341413&amp;oldid=76312299" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stormfront_%28website%29&amp;diff=76341413&amp;oldid=76312299" rel="nofollow">[115]</a>.</p>
<p>His other behaviors have been even more disruptive. Because it was alleged that the disputed paragraph was Original Research / Unverified, Stick then deleted various non-controversial, easily-verifiable facts from the article on the grounds that they were un-cited. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stormfront_%28website%29&amp;diff=76349252&amp;oldid=76349050" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stormfront_%28website%29&amp;diff=76349252&amp;oldid=76349050" rel="nofollow">[116]</a> No prior warning was given for these deletions, no request for citations was made prior to the deletions, and the citations were immmensely easy to find with just a single google search. In short, the deletions seems to just have been a "if you delete my stuff, I'll delete random things from the article in retribution"</p>
<p>For deleting his paragraph, Stick has repeatedly accused others of Vandalism, and indeed reported me to AIV. Similarly, he tried to report me for 3RR violation. Both reports were unfounded and they resulted in no action.</p>
<p>As of this moment, I've warned him that he's in violation of 3RR, and asked for a self-revert, which has not occurred. But I don't just want to report this to 3RR, get another 24 hour block, and be right back here tommorrow.</p>
<p>So, what can be done to help him be more productive in this situation? I sincerely don't just want him blocked-- I just need help in helping him understand why his actions might not be appropriate. But since I'm now a party in a content dispute with him, I don't seem to be able to be a very effective communicator in this situation.</p>
<p>I also should point out that his feelings are very valid. The article is about a racist, white-supremacist, neo-nazi website. I find myself in the uneviable position of removing criticism of that site from the article, and Stick very legitimately feels that racism and white supremacy needs some criticism. So, certainly, if there's ANY subject that someone can be forgiven for getting a little over-zealous about, this subject is it.</p>
<p>So, anyone who can help him to understand the behavior policies and comply with them, please do so. He won't listen to me-- he probably thinks I'm a Nazi, and I doubt I would listen to someone _I_ thought was a Nazi either!&#160;:)</p>

In particular it states that the school was closed (It seems to still be running), that the offical inspectors highlighted "serious concerns" (Checking through HMIE's reports, they make note of things like improper security or lax maintenence, nothing near what the articel suggests), and that there's been ongoing sexual abuse (I couldn't find anything from, say, the BBC about that, and HMIE would DEFINATELY mention that in a report of theirs). Further ir mentions the principal and directly connects him to all of this (I've checked their site, the name is real). I don't know how potentially believeable this is, but it looked suspiscious to me. 68.39.174.238 21:05, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sigh. Edit warring is never good, and it takes two to tango. The VSO talkpage and the anon user's page are both nonexistent, so all I can see happening is anon is adding something and others are reverting, no discussion. Atavi, why don't you try leaving a note on those talk pages? On the content side, there may be confusion between VSO and the <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vienna_Philharmonic_Orchestra_0cd8.html" title="Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra">Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra</a>, which is or has been in the past considered by many to be among the world's top tier international orchestras. Success here would be not only "preventing a 3RR violation" but channelling discussion into making a verifiable NPOV statement on VSO prestige/quality/reputation in the article that everyone is happy with, and maybe link or figure out the right way to disambiguate with Vienna Philharmonic as well.

<p>I think this user needs to be blocked, and I would do it, but I'm too closely involved at this point. Here's what I've seen: this user was an editor of Roy St. Clair which was deleted after its <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Roy_St._Clair_%284th_nomination%29_5473.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Roy St. Clair (4th nomination)">4th AfD nomination</a>. The consensus was moderately in favor of deletion. Malber then chose to spend his day nominating the articles of the most prominent <a href="../../../m/t/g/MTG_1ccc.html" title="MTG">Magic:The Gathering</a> players for deletion, citing the Roy St. Clair "precedent" when challenged. A couple of these debates have been speedily closed as bad faith noms, one by me, the other by <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">User:Kusma</a>. I warned Malber that further <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> nominations would result in a block. Since then, he's put up 3 more articles for deletion, and started leaving user talk messages for those who wanted Roy St. Clair deleted (but not those who wanted it kept), informing them about these debates. We can talk <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> all day long, but I know sour grapes when I see them. Also, let me point out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nlu&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=76442607" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nlu&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=76442607" rel="nofollow">this edit</a>. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 21:42, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"For the purposes of WP:BIO, collectible card players are athletes" hahahahahahaha. Only on the Internets. Ah, sorry, you're not going to get any sensible advice out of me after that. When people say "why delete this when lots of other articles have as much merit" after we delete their pet article, our response is usually to give them our blessing to nominate equally bad articles. It's disturbing that if they do so they should be hammered with <a href="../../../a/b/f/WP%7EABF_c955.html" title="WP:ABF">WP:ABF</a>. Mind you, a pause after the previous nomination is usually diplomatic at least - if Malber had waited a week or two (and there's no deadline here), this probably wouldn't have happened.</dd>
<dd>I say leave those that haven't been closed open. Those that are obviously legitimate articles will get their keep results without needing premature closing, and for those that garner deletion arguments other than the nominator's, 'speedy keep, bad faith nomination' arguments should be discounted by the closing admin unless they also address how the subject meets policy - the nominator's good faith or lack of it is irrelevant if an independent editor whose good faith is beyond doubt agrees with the principle of the nomination. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 22:59, 18</dd>

<dd>I don't have any vested interest in the Roy St. Clair issue. I felt at the time that it was acceptable for inclusion based on my interpretation of certain points of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. If I felt strongly enough, I would have taken it to <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a>. I'm willing to accept community consensus that collectible card players are non-notable, however if this is the case we should review <i>all</i> articles on ccg players for notability and sourcing. The articles I've nominated do not have cited sources outside the <a href="../../../w/o/t/WOTC_2f6d.html" title="WOTC">WOTC</a> community. Also note that I have not, and will not, nominate <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Williams_%28card_player%29_98ff.html" title="David Williams (card player)">David Williams (card player)</a> because that article is properly sourced and justifies his notability outside of <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/TG" class="extiw" title="m:TG">M:TG</a>. I also believe that the debate on the speedily kept articles should be re-opened. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mangojuice</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice">contribs</a>) has peppered each discussion without discussing the issue with me on my talk page.

<dd>I think it's really good that those articles had their own nominations: they are not carbon-copy articles, and there's no reason to think that they should all share the same result. How do you explain your advertising the debates to the delete voters, though? <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 04:57, 19 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I haven't gotten around to them yet. But frankly there weren't as many keep voters and their arguments weren't much different from the crufty arguments already being made in the ongoing debates. Users are encouraged to invite interested participants to a consensus debate. Those who have a vested interest in these articles are already watching the M:TG pages. -- <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalber_d5cd.html" title="User:Malber">Malber</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMalber_7564.html" title="User talk:Malber">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Malber_b734.html" title="Special:Contributions/Malber">contribs</a>) 12:14, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>So you inform delete voters first, then go on to keep voters later? When I inform people of a deletion debate, I usually go down the list of participants top to bottom. Informing just the people who share your opinion is not acceptable, no matter what you think of their opinions. I don't caer about M:TG either, but that doesn't make cruft a good reason for deletion. The word "cruft" is non-specific and doesn't explain what policy the article is violating. We should have world champions for every game and sport imaginable, so I don't see why world champions of M:TG should be excluded (at least one of the listed players appears to be one). - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 12:22, 19 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Keep voters have been notified within 24 hours, but I think several of them were sockpuppets and/or are not actively editing. Votestacking would be where I was advising the editors how to vote. I'm interested in whether or not the delete voters will view Magic differently. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> draws a fine line at who is notable and who is not. Unfortunately, only the broadest interpretation of "athlete" would sanction inclusion of ccg players.

So you are not dogging another Wikipedian, you did not revert the infobox in question back into place, you are providing the references that prove that the content in question is valid thus justifying your revert, you are not filling talk-pages with vitriol, you are not adding signed comments to what is supposed to be a list, and you are not reverting any attempt to remedy the situation?

<dd>Perhaps it's funny, but it's nonetheless offensive to other people and should not be allowed on Wikipedia. Would you allow the behavior of someone making fun of the <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shoah.html" title="Shoah">Shoah</a> on Wikipedia talk pages? Checking into MarkThomas's contributions history, I also found out that this user's scornful and offensive language is nothing new. He seems to particularly despise Paris, as these past edits show:
<ul>
<li>In an message on March 3, 2006 (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:London&amp;diff=42067990&amp;oldid=41657801" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:London&amp;diff=42067990&amp;oldid=41657801" rel="nofollow">[127]</a>), one can find, among other niceties: " I think the <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_cities.html" title="Global cities">global cities</a> page on Wikipedia is in error as actually cities like Montreal, Sydney and Mumbai all have a better claim to be world cities now than does <b>poor isolated and declinining Paris</b>."</li>
<li>In a message on February 14, 2006 (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:London&amp;diff=39562170&amp;oldid=38907209" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:London&amp;diff=39562170&amp;oldid=38907209" rel="nofollow">[128]</a>), he argues that French people are "obsessed" by the issue of whether London is larger than Paris (first time I hear about such French national obsession!), and he states that his personal research has undeniably proven that London is much larger than Paris.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Probably the most bizarre of all is this message which he left on February 15, 2006 (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:London&amp;diff=39724260&amp;oldid=39647736" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:London&amp;diff=39724260&amp;oldid=39647736" rel="nofollow">[129]</a>) and in which he claims that the British government grossly underestimate the population of the UK. Says he: "I also decided the total popn of the UK at any one time is at least 70m not roughly 60 as given in official figures." Apparently, this is the result a major government conspiracy: "I think the UK Govt know about this but don't tell people as it would stir up claims of incompetence." Now that is really something, isn't it! <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHardouin_7fc4.html" title="User:Hardouin">Hardouin</a> 18:31, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One interesting aspect of this case is that the user apparently takes the view Wikipedia has some obligation not to refuse these links, because many online sources, from which our articles might or might not have taken their pinouts, are supposedly derived from his site. <a href="../../../f/e/m/User%7EFemto_bb69.html" title="User:Femto">Femto</a> 14:29, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

He seems to post links (and he only posts links - no edits or other contributions as far as I can see) to two sites (but one is a redirect) - the site in question is <a href="http://www.technick.net" class="external free" title="http://www.technick.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.technick.net</a> it seems entirely non-notable and the forum is dead (always a good rule of thumb for popularity).</p>
<dl>
<dd>Can you explain me what does it means non-notable? Technik.net is a piece of Internet history (as reported by some important magazines). We published the largest pinouts collection on the web since 1998 getting 10thousand visitors per day (that it was very hard to do with a no-profit technical site in later '90) --Nicolaasuni</dd>

<dd>Non-notable as in encyclopedic notability.

<p>Could you please read what I just posted on my talk page and give me your opinion? Expecially I would like to know why the editors have removed the links/references from technick.net site but not the links to other sites that points to the same resources cloned from technick.net. This is like they are saying that the cloned resources that uses our work (just to make some advertising revenues) are OK, and original resource on technick.net site is not. Can you explain me why? --Nicolaasuni</p>

<dd>I doubt you have much proof that anyone has used your website as a source of data; most of the articles where I've reverted your links are articles about well-known industry standards (or <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_facto.html#Standards" title="De facto">de facto</a> standards) where there are many sources for the pinouts, occasionally including a <a href="../../../s/t/a/Standards_organization.html" title="Standards organization">standards organization</a> or commercial company that regulates the pinout.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, whether or not an editor has (yet) gotten around to removing other linkspam has <b>no bearing</b> on whether your linkspam gets to stay. Given time, its entirely likely that more linkspam will be removed (but as you well know, it's an <a href="../../../s/i/s/Sisyphus.html" title="Sisyphus">uphill battle</a>).</dd>

<dd>One thing that was telling for me was the continuation of IP edits (also from Telstra/Australia yet again) that I had reverted with during the previous night. Sorry I'm being a bit lazy to quote all of the instances, but he seemed content to edit from 2-3 IPs two nights ago and began on a new tact of fighting over <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wild_card_%28sports%29.html" title="Wild card (sports)">Wild card (sports)</a>. When it became sprotected, he signed up for the above sock. A few times I named the IPs and BIHF as Pnatt in my comments and did not receive a "huh?"-style response.

<p>However, the current sock, which <a href="../../../e/t/a/User%7EEtaonsh_dab9.html" title="User:Etaonsh">User:Etaonsh</a> <b>has admitted to be one</b> (as well as the later ones)<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:AMA_Requests_for_Assistance/Requests/September_2006/Londheart#Summary" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:AMA_Requests_for_Assistance/Requests/September_2006/Londheart#Summary" rel="nofollow">[132]</a>, is not only not banned, but an Admin, <a href="../../../c/o/w/User%7ECowman109_5ea9.html" title="User:Cowman109">Cowman109</a>, has stated - if I read correctly - that for him, the previous multiple bans do not matter: <i>"Well I'm not sure of the details of the previous blocks, but I won't go on blocking you unless something you go on to break policy."</i>[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Londheart" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Londheart" rel="nofollow">[133]</a></p>
<p>As the previous blocks are easily checkable, as well as User:Londheart's self-confessed identity with them, what this means, in effect, is that a multiply perma-banned user (with a proven track record of racism, homophobia, physical threats, and vandalism) is allowed to come back as a sock if he only tries long enough and creates one fake identity after the next. Perhaps some other Admin can look into this case and react accordingly. <a href="../../../e/b/b/User%7EEbbinghaus_b4ec.html" title="User:Ebbinghaus">Ebbinghaus</a> 21:52, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ahah, I didn't have the time to look at the matter extensively when I was first made aware of it(I only came to his page as he was requesting an unblock when he was merely autoblocked), but now I see why he was previously blocked. His edits lately do seem tendentious, but he has expressed a desire to try to do better. He appears to be some sort of expert in his field, and while his attitude is a tad negative he has, as I've stated, said his intentions are to to better. I'm going to try AGFing for a bit to see if he really does want to change after my encounter with him. If he continues with the same behavior, by all means I'll reblock him indefinitely. It seems more efficient at this time to attempt some sort of limited mentorship. Was there ever a community ban in place for the user, or was he simply indef blocked for aggression? I'm not saying we should rely on process to do this, but if another administrator wishes to block him, go ahead. <a href="../../../c/o/w/User%7ECowman109_5ea9.html" title="User:Cowman109"><font color="DarkGreen">Cowman109</font></a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/w/User_talk%7ECowman109_260b.html" title="User talk:Cowman109">Talk</a></sup> 22:00, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

We'd like to be in the studio next year putting out another album." in the recent interview from July 2006, Harding is still in the band and there hasn't been any announcements if he has been out of the band, so this makes it likely that he would be present on Social D's new album.

<dd>Hmm, not good. This is a textbook violation of our verifiability policy:
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose you are writing a Wikipedia entry on a famous physicist's Theory X, which has been published in peer-reviewed journals and is therefore an appropriate subject for a Wikipedia article. However, in the course of writing the article, you contact the physicist and he tells you: "Actually, I now believe Theory X to be completely false." <b>Even though you have this from the author himself, you cannot include the fact that he said it in your Wikipedia entry.</b><br />
Why not? Because it is not verifiable in a way that would satisfy the Wikipedia readership or other editors. The readers don't know who you are. You can't include your telephone number so that every reader in the world can call you for confirmation. And even if they could, why should they believe you?</p>
</blockquote>
(emphasis mine). I find it rather baffling that such a fundamental principle of the encyclopedia—and, in particular, its most obvious and most clearly expressed point—is suddenly waived because some low-profile celebrity posted something to a talk page. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 11:32, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think I tend to agree with you Kirill. It's not that I don't believe/trust Phil and Amgine, as JzG said there's no good reason why they'd make it up. But it sets a bad example, methinks, in that the standard of verifiability is if J. Random User can go confirm the facts for themselves, and this is straying a little close to the line. In this case, to be verifiable, anyone would need to be able to verify that <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrammer_e354.html" title="User:Grammer">Grammer</a> is who they say they are.

<dd>That's a fair point, but the usual way to confirm that an account belongs to someone is for them to confirm externally that the account is theirs.

<dd>Kirill is entirely correct, and this is especially the case when we are not hearing of something from someone themselves, but an acquaintance. If there are no independant sources for this, it can't be included. There is a general agreement that <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> should extend to the reciently dead, also, for similar reasons as BLP but relating to the estate rather than the person. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> 15:45, 15 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I've been the main proponent of not including this until another source can be found (which won't be easy).

It is well known that she was indeed his "partner in all things," professional and personal. The issue should be verifiability. The information on Carter's planned gender change is unheard of elsewhere, and we can't expect every reader to verify <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrammer_e354.html" title="User:Grammer">User:Grammer</a>'s idenity.

<dd>I agree wholeheartedly that BLP applies - which is why I checked with the guidelines on BLP for adding material from the source themself (Which this basically is), and followed it to the letter. Note that they explicitly say that the material can come from the talk page. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 16:40, 15 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not convinced that "basically" is sufficient in cases like this. The statement in question was certainly not self-published in the conventional sense (meaning that the subject of the article did not actually release the information personally); and there have been any number of cases where information provided by close friends or family members has turned out to be incomplete or unreliable. At the very least, the information needs to be given as "According to Grammer, blah blah blah" in order to make clear that this is, indeed, a third party's perspective. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 16:52, 15 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Tracy Grammer was providing information on her relationship with Dave Carter - that is "the source itself" for all useful purposes.

<dd>First of all, the arbcom has also looked dimly on challenging things for the sake of challenging them. Second of all, we have been extra careful. We verified <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrammer_e354.html" title="User:Grammer">User:Grammer</a>'s identity, and drew from the single most reliable source in the world on Dave Carter's life and musical career.

The second is whether <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrammer_e354.html" title="User:Grammer">User:Grammer</a> is Tracy Grammer.

<dd>While I feel this particular fact is relevant and important to the article (and the public statement on the talk page is verified as from Ms Grammer), at best it should be stated as "Ms Grammer reports..." or some such equally awkward construction.

(As to the dismissal of the use of blogs as a publication, they are used extensively for just such within Wikipedia and are proven no more unreliable than newspapers or PAC publications which are likewise cited throughout Wikipedia.)

<dd>Of course Phil's argument is ridiculous, and it relies <i>once more</i> on treating electronic communication as if it were documentary. As an editor (I mean a <i>print one</i>), I could not accept any alledged representation of an author that didn't have autograph. Further, any statement from a lover/friend would be a footnote in an introduction to a volume and never, ever, ever a substantial part of any presentation. So, if there were an autograph letter from the lover, it would be a footnote. If there were an e-mail, it would never get that far. If there were e-mail from the subject of discussion, it would be a footnote. Again, those of us who have had to deal with actual figures with actually documented lives know damned well that friends tell lies. Stephen Spender went about for decades making his dinner on the lecture circuit swearing that Virginia and Leonard Woolf were as heterosexual as a <i>Playboy</i> orgy, that TS Eliot and Vivian were deliriously happy in marriage, and that all those people who said otherwise didn't <i>know the Bloomsbury circle,</i> weren't <i>there,</i> the way he was. Spender was, of course, fooling himself and no one else. One does <b>not</b> take a friend's word, and one never accepts any vapor communication. It's not verifiable, and verification isn't even the issue as much as <i>corroboration</i> is. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:30, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I mentioned this on the article talk page, but obviously it should be considered here as well given the above commentary. Much of the <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Wales_abf5.html" title="Jimmy Wales">Jimmy Wales</a> article is referenced to wiki edits made by <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">User:Jimbo Wales</a>. Seriously... go check. Above, this exact situation (referencing with wiki edits) is described as "absurd", "completely ridiculous", "unsourced", "ludicrous", et cetera. Should we not then revise the Jimmy Wales article and various others on 'Wikipedia related' topics where this has been standard practice for years? Remove as 'unverifiable' information which anyone can verify the accuracy of by clicking on the diff link in the references section and only include that which has appeared in third party news media. Oh, and BTW... just a wee bit of incivility flying around people. Maybe tone it down a notch? Or twenty? --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 11:47, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It does seem rather self-evident doesn't it.&#160;:] If material from a wiki (or blog) can <i>never</i> be considered a reliable source, as stated repeatedly above, then we need to make changes to remove such from <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Wales_abf5.html" title="Jimmy Wales">Jimmy Wales</a>... and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>... and <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Brandt_7979.html" title="Daniel Brandt">Daniel Brandt</a>... and <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_Sanger_037d.html" title="Larry Sanger">Larry Sanger</a>... and well, you get the idea. If citations from wikis <i>can</i> be used under certain circumstances, as they routinely have been for years now, then we should stop saying they invariably can't and work out the circumstances under which it <b>is</b> allowed. Apparently we all accept that <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">User:Jimbo Wales</a> is <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Wales_abf5.html" title="Jimmy Wales">Jimmy Wales</a> and treat things written by the former as 'self-published' and citable statements of the latter. Should we <i>not</i> be doing that? Is it really horribly against 'verifiability' and 'reliable sources'? And if it isn't, then what would be required for <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrammer_e354.html" title="User:Grammer">User:Grammer</a> to be acknowledged and referencable as <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tracy_Grammer_8a41.html" title="Tracy Grammer">Tracy Grammer</a>? There is a clear contradiction between many of the above stated beliefs and observable past practice. Resolving that contradiction can only help to avoid such disagreements in the future. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 16:54, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Phil says she is but he also said that BLP says that the Verifiability policy doesn't apply when in fact it says the <i>opposite</i> - that it is to be <i>rigorously</i> applied - so his word doesn't mean much here when he is getting stuff written in black and white exactly opposite. If it is Tracy, we don't know if she is lying or mistaken so we need corroberation for claims of her dead partner being involved to some degree (she doesn't give <i>any</i> details) in changing from a man to a woman. this is an extraordinary claim. Phil's word that he has her word for a vague extraordinary claim is ridiculous and in no way comparable to using a site (Wikipedia) to verify that a very public man many of us have met and who controls the site to verify that he said some very ordinary thing. And more rules can not help people who get exactly backwords the rules we already have. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 17:30, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I suppose it is rather obvious to point out that the bios that you've demonstrated are exceptions are for people for whom wikipedia is a primary component of their notability. Isn't the involvement of Jimmy Wales in this project well known through a multitude of sources? The involvement of <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tracy_Grammer_8a41.html" title="Tracy Grammer">Tracy Grammer</a> with wikipedia is truly unkown to anyone who hasn't e-mailed her to ask. Phil was right to verify her idenity to protect her against defamation, but we need more to say that <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrammer_e354.html" title="User:Grammer">User:Grammer</a> is verified in a way that should be acceptable to general readers. Let us render unto Wikipedia that which is Wikipedia. However, to make claims about a deceased small-time celebrity's sexuality when nobody involved has had anything to do with the project... just maybe we need another source. Why are we talking about this on an admin board? -<a href="../../../m/r/f/User%7EMrFizyx_3bff.html" title="User:MrFizyx">MrFizyx</a> 22:41, 19 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree that there is a verifiability issue with Grammer. I <i>believe</i> Phil when he says that her identity has been proven, but I can't actually click a link or look up a book to <i>verify</i> it myself. I <i>can</i> verify that Jimmy Wales has acknowledged various things said by User:Jimbo Wales as being his own and thus accept that they are the same. Some of the other cases may be less clear cut (e.g. Daniel Brandt as Phil points out), but in general people seem to be saying that we have to be able to really verify that user and person are the same. That is different then saying we can never reference a wiki source and makes more sense to me (not to mention matching past practice). I would say it is completely verifiable that 'User:Grammer' said certain things... that doesn't mean those things themselves can be verified, but that the user <i>said</i> them certainly can be. If it were verifiable that &gt;Tracy Grammer&lt; said those things then I think that is notable and ought to be included as a <i>claim</i> which has been made. <i>Where</i> she said them (wiki, blog, dinner party, whatever) strikes me as completely irrelevant provided 'Joe Citizen' really can verify for himself that she actually DID say them. Obviously it is an unusual situation, but I think it will become more common as time goes on and more 'notable' people are also Wikipedians. In this case the claims are unique / potentially incendiary enough that I understand strict adherence to verifiability requirements, but if Tracy Grammer were to publically say 'I edit Wikipedia as User:Grammer' then I really wouldn't see any reason to block that material from inclusion. If it were more mundane info I'd say we shouldn't barr it <i>now</i>. We should nail down 'user = person verification' standards though. If verifiable public acknowledgement by the person is required then we've probably got a few references that fail of that requirement scattered about. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 01:11, 20 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think I pretty much agree with you (I can't speak for others). If there was a post at tracygrammer.com saying, "come visit my user page on Wikipedia at 'User:Grammer.'" I would probably need to seriously reconsider my opposition. I also "believe" Phil, but "trust me I'm an admin," is not a high enough standard of fact checking as a general case, especially when there is nothing to corroborate a claim. -<a href="../../../m/r/f/User%7EMrFizyx_3bff.html" title="User:MrFizyx">MrFizyx</a> 18:00, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It is a shame that an excellent, insightful, tactful, diplomatic, productive, and hard-working editor, in harm's way by working in difficult areas, gets hammered at RfA over one comment.

(I'm not an admin, never want to be an admin, try to avoid RfA at all costs as I don't like to witness crucifixions, and can't opine on Republitarian and all his socks, but I should say I'm chagrined that I defended his edits to some articles, as I failed to recognize the socks; which only makes me further appreciate editors who have to do the hard chores, and still do them with diplomacy and tact.) <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 17:30, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Want some vinegar on that chip? As above, FSF has a mass of good edits under his belt. Adminship is supposed to be no big deal, right? If the process never made any mistakes whatsoever I reckon it would be an indication that it was too restrictive. As it stands we have what has been characterised as "arbitrary demands for shrubberies" in RFA, as a result of which many excellent editors are not given the tools; this is to my mind a worse problem than the very occasional mistake. This being a wiki, all mistakes can be remedied. My greatest regret here is not that FSF was an admin and was desysopped, it's that we can't think of a process which will allow him to continue contributing, and allow us to limit the problems his editing sometimes causes. William Pietri has some thoguhts about this which he's raised on my Talk page, but we don't have a proposal yet. Even clue-based adminship is not going to work with FSF because it essentially means that every edit has to be watched, and that is simply too much work. Ultimately, FSF has to respect consensus - and given that he apparently doesn't, the consequences are probably inevitable. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 08:32, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So... he stopped using the Ya ya ya ya ya ya account and started using the EFG account exclusively... and therefor he was in violation of the ArbCom ruling that he only use one account? How exactly? He even said that he was switching accounts. Does the ArbCom ruling require that he identify the new account? It doesn't say so, but I suppose it could be taken as implied. Even then... he sent me an e-mail about switching to EFG. Unfortunately, I've been away / had very limited wiki-time since Tuesday and missed the latest brouhaha. Was he required to post public notification? For some reason he's gotten the idea that there are people here who don't like him and would bother or block him if they knew what account he was using. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 08:34, 17 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>And yet, I who do not like or dislike him, strongly dislike the fact that he has edited under all these accounts, without being open about what he is doing until challenged, and using edit summaries like "Guess who's switching accounts? Guess. Guess. Guess. Guess. Guess. Guess. Guess. Guess." I think it might be good for him to have a long rest from editing. It would certainly be good for Wikipedia. He claims to think that "most if not all administrators on Wikipedia are worthless, destructive elements" (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Humus_sapiens&amp;diff=71937209&amp;oldid=71896871" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Humus_sapiens&amp;diff=71937209&amp;oldid=71896871" rel="nofollow">[141]</a>).

I can guarantee you that it will happen again.

<dd>The fact is though, you and I and many people have tried to enforce BLP and other policies but haven't done so by describing ourselves as "admin-hating" and so on, using 5 sockpuppets, and ending it all with ourselves community banned for (among other things) taunting everyone on AN/I. Sure, a lot of people oppose FSF out of spite... but he did do something to generate all that ill-will, it just didn't appear out of thin air. It's time for him to accept some responsibility for the fact that so many people are upset with him, rather than just continue to escalate the situation as if he's perfectly innocent. If he just said "Okay, I've screwed up, but no one disputes I do make a ton of good edits... can we just start from square one and I won't go around provoking people?"

<dd>The 'sockpuppet' issue is a bit of a red-herring. People associate all kinds of negative behaviours with the term 'sock puppet' which do not apply here. There was no 'multiple voting', 'joint editing', et cetera. He changed accounts because he believed he would receive unfair treatment if people knew who he was. Untrusting, but not particularly nefarious. As to the other, he did apologize for his actions on <a href="../../../v/i/c/Talk%7EVicente_Fox_e35a.html" title="Talk:Vicente Fox">Talk:Vicente Fox</a>... but it was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AVicente_Fox&amp;diff=75221692&amp;oldid=75221014" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AVicente_Fox&amp;diff=75221692&amp;oldid=75221014" rel="nofollow">reverted</a>. Presumably because of the rant at the end against admins (specifically including me) who had not removed the comments about him being a 'fascist dictator'. Personally, I'd rather if people had <b>not</b> reverted virtually every edit he made after getting unblocked. So he called me impotent and/or ignorant... that's ok. I'm a big boy. I can take it.

<dd>CBD, this started back in December, at the very least, when he suddenly started accusing other admins of sockpuppetry and vandalism. There was no substance to these allegations, nor did he even attempt to provide any. When questioned, he responds in a rage and with a new flurry of accusations. His behavior borders on paranoid and it's impossible to reason with him. Go back and read the original arbitration case which led to his desysopping. His behavior has not changed since then. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 15:30, 17 September 2006 (UTC)

Just saying you are upholding <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> (when in this case it was at best a wild misinterpretation of policy) is not an excuse for edit warring, attacks on other users etc. etc. Reading the general tone of his comments, they come across as little more than trolling, if as a result of that people get fed up and treat him as nothing more than a troll, then sorry I have little sympathy for him. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 15:39, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The argument that this text <i>did not</i> violate <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> perhaps led to his being less trusting of the good intentions of other editors on the BLP issue than he should have been. Though the fact that it was restored, sans references, after he was blocked might also indicate that he wasn't so wrong about that. For the link you provided I'd imagine the objection was probably over using a spanish language reference for the claim that Fox's second marriage was religiously controversial. Is 'La Crisis' a reliable source? I dunno. In any case, while <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> allows foreign language sources in limited circumstances I'm thinking that was probably not intended for extensive use in a major article / to address possible BLP issues. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 20:27, 17 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So his experience with other text and other editors (I had no other involvment with that article and none I remember with him), makes it reasonable for him to edit war, put people on his "black list" (for want of a better word), jump up and down about arbcom action etc. That's a great way for him to drive off good faith editors and did he deserve to be picked up on it and blocked, absolutley. As to the interpretation of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> allowing foreign language sources in limited circumstances, I suggest you reread it, it allows foreign langauge sources as being every bit as reliable as English language sources in every circumstance "However, foreign-language sources are acceptable in terms of verifiability, subject to the same criteria as English-language sources.". It expresses a <b>preference</b> for the readers <b>convenience</b> and indeed if he had sources in English I doubt anyone would have complained if the links were changed. As someone else pointed out the idea that sources in Spanish for the leader of a Spanish speaking country should universally (as was his contention) be considered unreliable is ludicrous. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 20:51, 17 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Pgk, you did not (as I understand it) add those references. Rather it was the same users he was in dispute with. No? As to the rest, I did not say it was "reasonable" for him to edit war/keep a black list/whatever. Indeed, I said that he should have been more trusting of the accuracy of their sources. However, that doesn't change the fact that there was an actual WP:BLP violation on the page... with the same users fighting to keep it in. As to foreign language sources... 'do not use them if there is an English language source' and 'subject to the same reliability requirements' strikes me as 'limited circumstances' by definition. Again, <b>is</b> "La Crisis" a reliable source? I have no idea. Do you? Being in a foreign language / less known to speakers of English makes establishing the reliability of the source that much more difficult. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 22:20, 17 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What has muy adding of them or not got to do with anything. His argument as spelled out in his edit summaries and on the talk page is that non-English language sources are always unreliable for well known people. We aren't talking about a mad 5 minutes where there is misunderstanding we are talking about his conduct there over a period of hours and overall a "vendetta" kept over a period of days. As I have said reactions like that are totally unacceptable, how many good faith editors have been driven away from the project by such activity? You seem to want to paint him as an innocent party or at least one we should be understanding of, sorry his action here and in the past warrants no such understanding. He is either willing to be part of a collabrative project (which involves stepping back, biting ones lip etc. once in a while), or he is not. It seems quite clear that he is not. Perhaps if you see someone who is constantly in car crashes you should consider perhaps it is their bad driving which is the problem, not everyone elses. As to <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> again. You reading of limited is obviously very different to mine, the sources are by the plain language measured for verifiability by the <i>same</i> standard as English language sources i.e. the same limit. The other "limit" is when English language equivelants are available and are prefered, this has absolutely nothing to do with the reliability of the source and certaintly is again by the plain language not a reason to remove those sources and anything based on them, it is an argument to replace them with the English language sources, something which of course was not being done here. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 06:41, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The relevance is that you said it was "other editors" who were arguing with him over whether accusations of racism require references... it was not. The tired accusation that I 'want to paint him as an innocent party' is plainly false (I said he was wrong about foreign language sources not being allowed and had violated civility standards right from the start) and completely misses the point. That being, this attitude of 'that user bad - punish him' only serves to make things worse. When he was blocked, for doing exactly the same thing Chacor (who was not blocked) did, the article went back to <b>blatant</b> violations of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. The only thing preventing that was the 'bad' user. None of the people who villified him bothered to follow up to see that he had a point and that not taking him seriously caused a bigger problem (IMO) even than his civility issues. Very few users <i>set out</i> to be disruptive... and none of those rack up thousands of positive contributions. Dismissing someone as a "troll" when they plainly <i>want</i> to help the encyclopedia is IMO very short-sighted, clearly against what our policies actually say, and itself damaging to Wikipedia. Freestylfrappe's incivility absolutely IS a big problem... but it is not the only problem. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 11:01, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think you'll find it was you who suggested that his removal of the material here was due to the earlier dispute, not me. I certainly haven't discussed that particular matter with him. Since you are tired of that suggestion that you are trying to paint him as the innocent party, perhaps you should look at what you are saying and how it is likely to be interpreted. He was blocked as he was very aggressively edit warring, immediately before the block he had edit warred on this particular item, nothing to do with accusations of racism. Look at his final edit summary before blocking, it is directly referring to this accusing individuals of deliberate violation of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> in this matter, something which clearly it is not. The fact that it was reverted afterwards given the reason that those involved felt so uncomfortable with his overly aggressive approach to it should tell you something about the damage actually being done outweighing any good. As to your stuff about punishment not working, what do you suggest then? Let him run rampant attacking good editors on false premises because of previous problems with an article? How many good editors does he have to drive off before you suggest we take some action? How many good editors have already been driven away by him? A user wanting to help Wikipedia and actually helping are different thing?s, again how many good editors who want to help wikipedia do we let him drive off with his overly aggressive attitude before we say enough is enough You know I agree with you the bad-behaviour punishment cycle in this case is ineffective, he quite clearly is unable to work with the acceptable norms of wikipedia, you've convinved me that permenant removal is the only option. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 14:51, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

We're supposed to be the calm / level-headed / 'tough' ones... so why is it always like sharks with blood in the water?

<dd>Sadly (sorry CBD!), you are right. I totally sympathise with CBD and JzG trying to let FSF edit in peace under a new account. I don't think either of them is being "contrary just for the sake of being contrary". I would be as happy as anyone if he was able to just get on with things, I just think he has shown himself incapable of that, or of showing any real appreciation of the amount of trouble he has (seemingly gratuitously) caused. By consistently getting involved in controversy under each of his new accounts, he has certainly exhausted my patience, if not the community's. I agree he has made good edits, which is why I tried to support him in the past. I just think the ratio has been in the wrong direction for a while now, and shows no good prognosis of improving. I'm not saying I'm sad about that in any rhetorical sense, I am genuinely sad that we cannot support this talented editor better than we have. However, I think we have done what we can at this point and the onus is on FSF to demonstrate reformed behaviour, and I just don't see evidence of that. --<a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinnog_5d26.html" title="User:Guinnog">Guinnog</a> 18:10, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Do you really think <i>this</i> sort of thing is going to change my 'judgement' that some admins act on anger and behave in incivil ways that damage and disrupt the encyclopedia? I'm sorry that you 'do not have faith in my judgement', but the fact that a "significant number" of admins blow up and violate Wikipedia's standards of behaviour in ways that would get regular users blocked is the <b>cause</b> of my concern - not something to get me to reconsider it. We, meaning Wikipedians as a whole, aren't supposed to act this way. Admins doing so because they can get away with it / not even being able to discuss it civilly is, in my opinion, a very serious problem. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 22:20, 17 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>CBD, you're first in line to defend troublemakers when they're accused of the very things you attack admins over. When a "regular user" is rude, you absolve them so you can blame admins... when an admin is doing the same thing, suddenly they're damaging the project. You make it sound like admins are what's wrong with Wikipedia, and troublemakers are all just innocent victims of us evil admins. That's simply not good...

<dd>Unfortunately, what you say is completely untrue. I "absolve" no one. Regular users who swear and attack and harass are bad too. Obviously. But <i>that</i> gets dealt with... swiftly and sometimes harshly. Admins doing the same generally does not. If a user objects to being told they were incivil or to a block for the same they are labelled 'disruptive' and get another block... an admin responds by telling people "Fuck you" and you think there is a problem with the behaviour of the person pointing out that this is bad? Several people have said that they object to 'my giving bad users a free pass'... but as I don't actually DO that, and they aren't actually 'getting away' with <i>anything</i> you're right - I don't put a lot of stock in that claim. Any stock really. To me it seems more like some admins just don't like being challenged or told that they should be nicer. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 23:33, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And anyway, I think the main reason you see so much more administrator behavior than the rest of us is because you consistently incite it yourself. It's like poking a beehive and then being shocked that bees are coming out and stinging you. What you seem to want to attempt is to somehow "fix" the bees ... rather than just stop poking the beehive. In short, you seem to be on some sort of crusade against all of this perceived administrator malfeasance, but rather than getting any closer to fixing it, you're just causing more of it. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 22:26, 17 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Aren't they? Did I tell <i>them</i> "fuck you"? Was it me who said "assholiness"? Do they never act this way in interaction with users? I think the answer to all those questions is clearly 'no'. I agree with the logic of your 'poking the hive' analogy though... I've been going with 'baiting the bear', but same concept. The problem is that if admins can act like this in response to the 'poke' of mere polite discussion... how exactly do they justify crucifying regular users for doing the same in response to put downs and blocks?

<dd>No Cyde, you are apparently misunderstanding me somewhere in the analogies... "when you said you were 'baiting the bear'"... I <b>didn't</b> say that. I said that there is validity to the logic that criticizing a user/users (aka 'poking the hive' / 'baiting the bear') can sometimes cause the behaviour we are trying to prevent. It's a point I've raised myself several times in relation to harsh admin criticism of users. I did <i>not</i> say that increasing bad behaviour was my goal and don't agree with your characterization. I am not "purposefully ticking off admins". That some respond to attempts to explore the causes of 'problem behaviour' or any criticism of their own actions with explosive rage is an observed reality, but neither my goal nor fault. I don't exercise mind control over other admins... we require users to not respond to criticism (often much more harshly delivered than mine has been) with angry rants (or they get blocked) and I don't expect any less from my fellow admins. I assume they will be able to respond to criticism of their actions politely and reasonably... as I have stiven to do in response to the criticisms of myself for daring to do so.&#160;:] Please stop assuming bad faith - your claim that I am "trying to make people mad and disruptive" in response to my direct statement to the contrary suggests both that I am lying and that this is a 'nefarious plot to trick admins into behaving badly'. I would hope that you <b>know</b> that is not the case, but if not then you really should try harder to 'assume good faith'. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 17:28, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I understand that FSF has wounded the feeligs and exhausted the patience of many editors, and has often behaved unbecomingly; but as an editor who has worked a lot with him in developing WikiProject Chad, I feel I should speak of all the good work he has done as an editor, countering systemic bias that, as well known, is rampant in Africa, and countries like Chad more than other African countries. I feel that if we consider the good and the bad, the good, in the sense of useful and valuable contributions to the encyclopedia, is far bigger.

<li>El C is right. I invited CBD to this discussion as soon as I proposed it, and I'm dismayed at the treatment he has received here. These ad hominem attacks on somebody trying to stick up for a clearly troubled individual (who has, in fact, made lots of good edits) are not a good thing. If you have an issue with CBD's larger behavior, take it to his talk page, but allow him to discuss FSF without personal harassment. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 15:23, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No worries Bunchofgrapes. Obviously, trying to get people to see the positive aspects of a 'troublemaker', the reasons that he reacted the way he has, and how we as admins contribute to the problem is going to be less than popular. I knew that going in, but I think it is worth doing... so I can take a little heat. Compared to various things I've seen in over twenty years in online forums (going back to Compuserve and local BBSs with my high tech 300 baud modem) the incivility here was nothing and I don't hold any anger towards those who disagree with me. Mostly I'm just confused by the continued insistence that I "refused to see anything wrong with FSF's behaviour". I can't fathom that at all in the face of my numerous direct statements to the contrary. On the original issue, I think all the known accounts should remain indefinitely blocked - there's no benefit to anyone in unblocking them. I think he should be allowed to edit under some other account - in part because... he will anyway, and knowing who it is would at least allow an eye to be kept out for civility problems. Also, I'm not fully convinced that he <i>couldn't</i> have been gotten to remain within acceptable bounds of civility and collaborative effort if he'd received more of each himself... though I begin to fear that may be impossible and we are evolving towards a system where we cut users loose not only if <i>they</i> are incapable of reforming, but also if <i>we</i> are incapable of allowing them to do so. At this point there seems little hope that everyone will 'forgive and forget' and thus a 'community ban' might be a way of 'cutting our losses', but to me it feels like giving up and admitting that <b>we</b> failed. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 18:16, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I think its important that this users positive contributions be weighed against any negative actions of recent. If even admins have shown and argued taht a few uncivil remarks do not out weigh the contributions they make here everyday, then one would think it applies to all parties. I have been looking over their edit history and think the idea of letting them resume from a new account that only one or maybe two admins, who they feel have not been bias against them, will know is a worthwhile proposal. As for the F-Bomb I just hope everyone can remain civil and take this as an example of what at least "perceived goading" can cause.

I've interacted with CBD on his talk page before and always been frustrated with his responses. I don't take back I word I said regarding CBD's behavior; over the past week he has refused to see anything wrong with FSF's behavior, and I find that perverse. I hope it's obvious from above that separate parties were being engaged. I regret that I distracted from the primary focus of the discussion; I hope that in the future CBD will try to understand why his actions and words can so obviously enrage other people. If he can't see why FSF is deserving of a ban at this point then no power on heaven and earth can ever make him see, and I for one will stop trying. Given FSF's stated support for de-sysoping the first thousand admins on Wikipedia I'm not sure if there is such a thing as an uninvolved admin, but I suppose you can try. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 15:46, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>My apologies, my comments were not meant to be directed jsut at you. As for his support of desysopping anyone, that really should have no affect on an admins decision when looking at his situation here. Its odd because to insinuate it would is almost stating he is not paranoid after all, and in fact admins dont like him for mroe then whats being discussed openly here. As for CBD I am happy to hear you and him have resolved that.

<p>It seems to me that it's hardly a sociological mystery that admins should often be uncivil to problem users. All other things being equal, an admin who's invested considerable time and effort in the process of dealing with a disruptive user (and likely received in return a torrent of abuse, protestations of good faith, accusations of bad faith, conspiracy, cabalism, Freemasonry, and so forth), is considerably more likely to lose their temper or be uncivil in describing behavior than an uninvolved party. This is simply human nature. Furthermore, judging from my perusal of this noticeboard over the past several months, there seems to be a relatively small cadre of admins willing to tackle particularly disruptive users. When the Civility Police swoop down crying "You said <i>troll</i>!" without acknowledging that there is, generally, a long history of provocation from the insulted side, it should hardly come as a surprise that they get blown off by the targets of their criticism. There's a certain Dilbertesque air to the proceedings, which seem to be based on the same principle as the idea that, since you can do one minute's work without mistakes, you can do it *every* minute, and that perfection is, therefore, expected of you. I think a more realistic solution to the problem of incivility is to lead by example. The greater the number of persons willing to navigate the processes necessary to curb a contumacious user, the wider the pool over which their obloquy will be spread, and the less isolated individual admins will feel in dealing with such a user.

<dd>When you scan the noticeboard you see the usual cries: "Waa, Clyde spoke harshly to me;" "Kimmy said I should be desysopped;" "Tommy deleted my page." It is easy to spot an uncivil remark by an active administrator. It is hard to come into an on-going dispute, wade through the diffs, wait for the pages to load, and then find out after two hours of tedious research that the admin was right all along. After a while you want to just ignore the whole business, write articles, and revert vandalism when you see it. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 16:24, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The uncivil remarks are never right however, or so the arguement has been. The idea is that uncivil admins create an atmosphere where users feel they can be uncivil and people who are being accused of being uncivil feel justified. How can you ban person X for being uncivil when your ban message is that they partake in "assholiness", quite an uncivil remark in itself. However I think we should get back to the issue of FSF and his contributions and recent acts. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">User:Zer0faults</a> 16:35, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I suppose the model of ideal conduct in Wikipedia follows the dictum "be conservative in what you transmit, and liberal in what you accept". That is, we should endeavour to be civil in our dealings with other people, and, conversely, we should not allow the incivility of others to divert us from civil and productive behavior. Obviously, this is an ideal that we don't always live up to. The protests here against admin incivility implicitly admit that users will not react with perfect <i>sangfroid</i> when rudely addressed. But if we extend this doctrine to administrators, then we must acknowledge that their behavior, under provocation, may also fall short of the ideal. As for the question of how they can ban someone for "incivility" while acting incivil themselves, the answer is obviously that it's a question of degree. Banning every editor who has ever been uncivil would, obviously, be seriously counterproductive. However, banning someone discontented by <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> who abuses and stalks other people who edit their pet article is clearly beneficial to the encyclopedia. Minor incivility is, if not admirable, an ineradicable feature of Wikipedia, indeed of any collaborative project. Gross incivility may merit blocking or banning — instances where the "friction" of interpersonal contact has caused the local system of collaboration to seize up. The precise dividing line between the two is, necessarily, subjective. Anyway, my point in writing this was to point out that the recent practice of hunting for minor incivilities in handling long, messy cases of user conduct and using them here as a club to discredit the admin and/or process is pernicious, to some degree self-contradictory, and more likely to provoke and disrupt than to encourage increased moderation and tact among admins. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChoess_95be.html" title="User:Choess">Choess</a> 19:34, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Choess, you say that it is not surprising that an admin might eventually lose their patience and slip into incivil conduct after long tiresome efforts to help a user behave better. Certainly reasonable. But tell me... how long had Zoe been trying to 'help' Freestylefrappe before blocking him for "assholiness"? Long time? Tiresome efforts? Or was <i>she</i> the relatively "uninvolved party" and just being nasty because she can get away with it? &gt;I&lt; have been trying to get him to improve his civility (off and on) for a long time. He recently accused me of being incompetent and irresponsible. Why am I not flying off the handle and violating civility? Why am I not cursing out Mackensen and Cyde for saying mean things about me? Because <i>that wouldn't do anything to improve the situation</i>. It should <b>never</b> be 'ok'. Not when a user feels persecuted, not when an admin is exasperated, not when you are in a position to get away with it, NEVER. Yes, we can forgive the lapses which we all make in varying degrees (and should extend that forgiveness in <b>equal, if not greater, measure</b> to the USERS)... but we <b>do</b> need to say something about it. You suggest that is 'nit picking' which only serves to inflame the situation, but extending the same logic would indicate that we should not ask users to be more civil either... let alone go around strongly <i>warning</i> them to do so, blocking them, et cetera. Surely these things also are likely to aggravate people, 'destructive', and thus to be avoided?&#160;:] Or perhaps we should politely tell people when they are contributing to a problem? Nor, when a user is being criticized and faced with an indefinite block for switching accounts, does the <b>reason</b> they did so seem to me unworthy of mention... that reason being the reversion of more than a dozen of their edits. Apologies, an ArbCom request, talk page notices, article improvements... all reverted. Then the user is called "paranoid" for saying that they <b>had</b> to change accounts to be <i>allowed</i> to contribute. That is not "minor incivility". That's a problem of the admin community collectively pushing users into behaviour which they then ban and/or ridicule them for. You can say, 'oh but there were reasons for all of those reverts' (though I'd call several of them questionable)... but even the <i>slightest</i> effort to 'put yourself in the other guy's shoes' would reveal that it <i>certainly</i> wasn't going to look that way from <b>their</b> perspective. It seems to me completely wrong that we should go so far out of our way to ignore our own mistakes and avoid any suggestion for improvement which might cause annoyance... while expecting the users to calmly deal with harsh criticism, ridicule, and humiliation... or face further blocks for responding poorly. You cite the 'ideal' of Wikipedian conduct, remaining civil even when faced with incivility, almost as if it were some lofty near impossible challenge for admins to live up to (though, in truth, most do just fine)... but it is simultaneously not a 'remote ideal' but the 'general standard' against which <i>user</i> behaviour is measured. Too often we mete out blocks when users fail of this standard and congratulatory support when admins do. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 11:03, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Essentially, one can view Wikipedia as a form of international diplomacy. Since we cannot actually see each other face-to-face, and therefore must express our emotions and thoughts in written (or typed) words, others may mistake a seemingly benign comment for a hostile threat or equivalent action. Admins, as editors whom the Wikipedian public has entrusted with additional tools, and hence are to be held at a higher standard than other editors, are to be much more careful with their words, as a slip of the tongue or a different choice of words can indicate and/or differentiate between a genuine interest in helping a besieged editor or an intent to further trample upon the oppressed (or any other interpretation).</p>
<p>While minor incivility can never be eliminated from Wikipedia, I believe that gross and/or blatant violations of policy and/or a declared or implicit intent on conducting disruption and incivility cannot be tolerated in Wikipedia. Just like diplomats, a sensible editor of any rank should be able to express one's viewpoint with a clear declaration without offending the listener(s). Wikipedia is a collaborative project; minor incivility is to be expected (but not condoned), but blatant violators or policy and basic human ethics should not be defended. --<a href="../../../p/h/y/User%7EPhysicq210_ccba.html" title="User:Physicq210">physicq210</a> 01:16, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b><font color="#0000FF">It seems to me that it's hardly a sociological mystery that admins should often be uncivil to problem users. All other things being equal, an admin who's invested considerable time and effort in the process of dealing with a disruptive user (and likely received in return a torrent of abuse, protestations of good faith, accusations of bad faith, conspiracy, cabalism, Freemasonry, and so forth), is considerably more likely to lose their temper or be uncivil in describing behavior than an uninvolved party. This is simply human nature. Furthermore, judging from my perusal of this noticeboard over the past several months, there seems to be a relatively small cadre of admins willing to tackle particularly disruptive users. When the Civility Police swoop down crying "You said troll!" without acknowledging that there is, generally, a long history of provocation from the insulted side, it should hardly come as a surprise that they get blown off by the targets of their criticism. There's a certain Dilbertesque air to the proceedings, which seem to be based on the same principle as the idea that, since you can do one minute's work without mistakes, you can do it *every* minute, and that perfection is, therefore, expected of you. I think a more realistic solution to the problem of incivility is to lead by example. The greater the number of persons willing to navigate the processes necessary to curb a contumacious user, the wider the pool over which their obloquy will be spread, and the less isolated individual admins will feel in dealing with such a user. By contrast, it's unlikely that the current approach will achieve anything more than aggravation.</font></b> I just had to put that in bold, and in blue, because it's so bang-on accurate that I would hope everyone reads it. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 02:29, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's quite a colour, and it's very like what Choess said above! I liked it too; worth highlighting and repeating as an insightful summary of where we are. How can you not like somebody who uses words like contumacious and obloquy? In all seriousness though, I think it's easier always to agree we should lead by example, than it is always to do it. I do think we can all aspire to improve how we get on with each other as a community; using positive language to describe even problem editors seems important to me in that regard. --<a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinnog_5d26.html" title="User:Guinnog">Guinnog</a> 02:56, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Often it is not hard for someone to give constructive criticism (that is, if it is worded correctly and carefully). In many instances that I've seen through my 11 months of Wikipedian experience and as a (sort-of inactive) member at the Mediation Cabal, it is hard for the person given constructive criticism to accept it for what it is: advice designed to better them. It is hard for many to swallow the bitter medicine of learning from positive admonishment from their peers and fellow editors, and many stubborn editors refuse it and end up destroying their Wikipedian careers. --<a href="../../../p/h/y/User%7EPhysicq210_ccba.html" title="User:Physicq210">physicq210</a> 03:20, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>El C does have a good point. However, I also see a double standard here, in that it seems as though Wikipedia is all too willing to give one side a "free pass" while being quick to pass judgement on the other. Things work inversely as well; there are so-called "problem users" who respond with incivility due to harrasment and abusive behaviour by admins. Uncivil behaviour, by it's nature, is disruptive. It is reasonable to say that there are situations were it is understandable that one may stoop to incivility, given the weaknesses of human nature, the nature of Wikipedia, and the determination of trolls, but the community should be cautious about being overly tolerant of uncivil behaviour. It should also be realized that attacking so-called "trolls" may goad these users into more abusive actions; it is far better to respond with reason and tact. A situation is seldom defused by incivility, but rather by calm, rational discussion - and a ban hammer, if needed. Speak softly, and carry a big stick. --<a href="../../../7/2/2E/User%7E72.160.108.167.html" title="User:72.160.108.167">72.160.108.167</a> 10:22, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Unacceptable behavior by anyone is unacceptable, but a consistent pattern of unacceptable behavior by an administrator is particularly problematic, in that the behavior of those individuals is implicitly endorsed by the community which "promoted" them, and that they set an example for how other users should behave. Yes, it's a hard job, and yes, provocations are bad, but if you're blowing up in response to trolling, then maybe you should devote your efforts to other tasks on the encyclopedia where you're less likely to be trolled, and leave contentious admin tasks for other users with thicker skin. The watchmen for any society (real or virtual) need to be pure beyond reproach like Caesar's wife if things are to function the way we'd like them to function. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 21:22, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Drini, what you did was perform a move without discussing it first, without announcing it. You just <i>moved it.</i> That looked a lot like deletion to most folks. This is in addition to making errors in the move. The topic was very, very hot, and therefore being edited like crazy. That should have been a warning by itself that folks were not interested in scattering their comments. Further, moving some things to a user page was <i>way</i> out. Pump is not where anyone thinks of going for the discussion of how <i>administrative tools</i> were used or misused by a <i>particular set of administrators.</i> They thought, instead, of AN. Getting some consent before the move would have been key, and then there would have been the subject of where to do the move.

<dd>Actually, it does, which is why I have resisted having it deleted. This whole thing is rather thick in subtext and bizarre in liminal text. On WP:AN, there was a discussion of <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">user:Tony Sidaway</a>'s behavior with regard to <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_dc9f.html" title="User:Giano">user:Giano</a>. For some reason unclear to most, if not all, Drini moved the discussion to Tony Sidaway's user page and to Village Pump, and, during the moves, several posts disappeared. No one actually accused Drini of intentionally deleting posts critical of Tony but amazingly preserving all in favor of Tony, but it sure was annoying. If one or more persons thought that Drini needed to be arbitrated for his insistence, it's not shocking, although it's probably without merit. Now, Drini here proposes that "let's desysop X" is a common absurdity and that it needs to be moved. Therefore, people who didn't know the AN incident will miss the context, and those who did will be a little miffed to see the very serious issues around Tony Sidaway treated as if they were IP anon's ranting for the heads of people enforcing policy. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 10:55, 19 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>Could someone with some knowledge of football (or soccer for us Americans) please have a look at the edit histories of <a href="../../../8/2/2E/User%7E82.168.59.236.html" title="User:82.168.59.236">User:82.168.59.236</a> and <a href="../../../8/2/2E/User%7E82.92.94.108.html" title="User:82.92.94.108">User:82.92.94.108</a>? They have been alleged to be the same person, have been blocked multiple times before, etc. I don't know anything about the topic so I don't know if all the changes (without edit summaries) are in fact vandalism as has been claimed, but someone who knows about this subject should evaluate whether some long term intervention or blocking is needed.

So 3 of them are long term vandals. Their edit patters show everything, even if they are not sockpuppets they are meatballs. There is a minor thing to show the harm of them, Galatasaray article has edited more than twice before they start editing, but improvement is near zero:) --<a href="../../../u/g/u/User%7EUgur_Basak_b749.html" title="User:Ugur Basak">Ugur Basak</a> 12:52, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

He continuously adding <i>The TFF has made a agreedment with Ertuğrul Sağlam to take over the national team from Fatih Terim after Euro 2008, besides his contract with Kayserispor is till 2008</i>, i add fact tag but he removed it, even after warnings he did the same. Before that he is adding <a href="../../../s/u/a/Suat_Kaya_73b7.html" title="Suat Kaya">Suat Kaya</a>, ex-Galatasaray player, will be new Gala coach etc. Once Galatasaray article was vandalising by one of that ips, he was reverting an outdated version that include rumoured transfers and other predictions. I request for protection of article or an admin semi-protected it (now i don't remember). Just after article semi-protected, Burak18 started to edit same artice and reverting it to same version.

<p><a href="../../../n/f/i/User%7ENfitz_2215.html" title="User:Nfitz">User:Nfitz</a> keeps putting bogus warning templates on my talk page, and this has gone into a edit war on MY OWN TALK PAGE. I am NOT a vandal; I am former administrator here with a lot (Something like 8000) of edits. Nfitz has done this elsewhere as well; <a href="../../../k/p/r/User_talk%7EKprobst_fd7f.html" title="User talk:Kprobst">User_talk:Kprobst</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarrens_9305.html" title="User talk:Warrens">User talk:Warrens</a> (there is discussion here as well about the warnings on my talk page; for those who are curious this centers around a "personal attack" which was "Please take your crusade elsewhere"). There has been long, drawn-out painful discussions about the validity of those warnings (my talk page, the other two as well); I would really just like to blank it at this point and take a wikibreak without looking like I'm some kind of vandal. So, could somebody please revert any nonsense that is on there and protect the thing? MY DEITY you know its gotten bad when you ask your own talk page to be protected... <a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">RN</a> 22:08, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'll go protect it. If you want the revision with the wikibreak notice restored I can do that too, and I'll make the protection log note this was at your request so it can be unprotected when you return. <a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 22:18, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>I had been debating on whether I should follow this up or not, and I had decided that it is wasn't worth it ... as I just can't understand <a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">RN</a>'s motives. However now that <a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">RN</a> has made this accusation, I feel I have no choice but to raise this issue here. User RN has been blanking his talk page; which in addition to my warnings about his personal attack on me, also contained links to his archives, where previous warnings have been posted in the past, including details of his previous block. My understanding, is this stuff shouldn't be deleted from Talk pages, without providing Links to an archive. <a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">RN</a> has continued to do this, despite being warned. Now he is accusing me of placing bogus warning templates; the warning templates were not bogus. <a href="../../../n/f/i/User%7ENfitz_2215.html" title="User:Nfitz">Nfitz</a> 22:24, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>None of that material has been deleted, it is still accessible from the history for anyone who is concerned...and any blocks are easily accessible from his block log. As much as I personally dislike people blanking valid warnings, I also don't have a tremendous amount of sympathy for people who persist in hounding other editors. He clearly saw your warnings as he had to revert them, and it is in my opinion reasonably poor wikiquette to use standard templates on established editors and threaten them with vandalism blocks. You can of course contact me to unprotect his talk page if RN returns to editing, since people would not be able to communicate as easily with the user concerning their edits.

<dd>But why is he above the rules, and allowed to wipe warnings? I haven't been hounding him, BTW. I've popped in occasionally, to see if he's followed up the discussion ... but when I see that he has simply wiped the warning, and removed the links to his archive which have always been there, then I don't see any alternative than restoring the warning, and raising the warning level. Is this not the procedure in such cases? <a href="../../../n/f/i/User%7ENfitz_2215.html" title="User:Nfitz">Nfitz</a> 22:56, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My advice is to let this one go. You're both productive editors when you're not clashing with eachother. Whether or not his comment can be considered a serious personal attack is questionable in my eyes despite its hostility. You saw it as an attack, he didn't, and you both were already frustrated with eachother. Because you were the one to warn him rather than someone impartial in the matter, I think it fanned the flames so to speak. A short break, a calm demeanor, and a liesurely skimming of <a href="../../../w/q/t/WP%7EWQT_eef8.html" title="WP:WQT">WP:WQT</a> might help. As a side note not related to talk page warnings per se, I've noticed that we're generally pretty lax about talk page archiving for established users, I know some who simply "purge to page history" as their method of choice. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigNate37_8426.html" title="User:BigNate37"><b><span style="color:#DF2F2F">Big</span><span style="color:#3F3F3F">Nate</span><span style="color:#DF2F2F">37</span></b></a><sub><a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigNate37_d4bc.html" title="User talk:BigNate37">(T)</a></sub> 22:54, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I had decided to let it go, as I noted above. But now he has gone and made this accusation, and I've got Admin's using the word harrasment, then I don't think it can be let go. The guidelines are quite clear that warnings should not be removed; or links should be provided to the archiving. Why should established users be above this. And if this were true, then that should be noted in the guidelines. Perhaps more serious, than my warning; is that there are other warnings in his archives, that are not linked. <a href="../../../n/f/i/User%7ENfitz_2215.html" title="User:Nfitz">Nfitz</a> 22:59, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The only guideline I could find regarding this is</p>
<table align="center" style="border-collapse:collapse; border-style:none; background-color:transparent;" class="cquote">

<td width="20" valign="top" style="color:#B2B7F2;font-size:35px;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;font-weight:bold;text-align:left;padding:10px 10px;">“</td>
<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">Actively erasing non-harassing personal messages without replying (if a reply would be appropriate or polite) will probably be interpreted as hostile. In the past, this kind of behavior has been viewed as uncivil, and this can become an issue in arbitration or other formal proceedings. Redirecting your user talk page to another page (whether meant as a joke or intended to be offensive or to send a "go away" message), except in the case of redirecting from one account to another when both are yours, can also be considered a hostile act. However, reverting such removals or redirects is not proper and may result in a block for edit warring. If someone removes your comments without answering, consider moving on or dispute resolution. This is especially true for vandalism warnings.</td>
<td width="20" valign="bottom" style="color:#B2B7F2;font-size:36px;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;font-weight:bold;text-align:right;padding:10px 10px;">”</td>

<p>(from <a href="../../../t/a/l/Help%7ETalk_page_601e.html" title="Help:Talk page">Help:Talk page</a>). We had quite a large discussion on whether to make a proper guideline covering this, and it really didn't lead anywhere. The only example I can give is this: while RN did remove your notices from his talk page, in reality this is more of a content dispute than vandalism... You felt he was incivil, he disagreed, you started placing vandalism notices which he probably viewed as incivil, and the situation devolved from there. Previous warnings are previous warnings, and if there is anything true about Wikipedia its that people have long memories. If there is a reason to dig up old warnings, someone will. Does that help? <a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 23:44, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not sure how else I can explain it to you, and suspect that we may just have to disagree. There are at least two users who have asked you to drop the matter, and I've been holding off making further comment here to see if someone else would have some insight. As for reverting the page to show the archive notices, protection isn't a pick and choose which version. The version that exists when the admin applies protection is what gets protected, with no endorsement by the protecting admin of the page content. <a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 14:44, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I am unsure why the matter should be dropped. The only explanation I can fathom, is that former administrators are not subject to the same rules as others. If that is the rule, that is fine, and I will go adjust the guidance documents to reflect this. Sure, I can understand the protection is frozen issue, and all that. And as I have noted myself, my own warnings are not the issue here (not sure where <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a>'s comments are coming from - he seems to be ignoring the prime issue) ... the issue are there are other warnings that are now not there, nor are they on linked archive pages. <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia:Vandalism</a> seems quite clear on this; or should I be editing that as well. One way or another, further action needs to be taken, either in cleaning up guidance, or dealing with <a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">RN</a>. I'd have thought a simple revert to his earlier Talk Page, which is pretty much blank except his Wikivacation, and the archive links would have been a decent solution - but I guess (and I'm not quite sure why) this isn't an option - so further action seems to be the only available course. Now do we do that here, and if not, where do I start this? <a href="../../../n/f/i/User%7ENfitz_2215.html" title="User:Nfitz">Nfitz</a> 17:36, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have to agree with the others who've commented that this seems a non-existent problem, and the vehemence with which it's being pursued is unbecoming. If the user resumes editing constructively, the warnings are irrelevant. If the user resumes editing and there are difficulties, the warnings (meritorious or not) are in the history to be called up if needed. If the user does not resume editing, the matter is moot. In no case is it a difficulty that the page does not bear the warnings. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 23:15, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'll just note for the bazillionth time that the line from <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia:Vandalism</a> cited above actively encourages edit warring on other users' talk pages and inevitably leads to situations like the above where a user trying to 'enforce policy' winds up doing things that look very much like (and in some cases <i>are</i>) harassment to the person on the receiving end. It is a horiffically bad idea that never should have been inserted into the policy (without consensus) and ought not to have been restored after any of the dozens of times it has been removed as inappropriate. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 16:14, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm loath to bring the matter up, but I would like to know if I making too big a deal over nothing. As some may know, I lashed out in a rather unprofessional manner on this noticeboard several days ago. Since then, I've made what apologies I thought appropriate and actually interacted with CBDunkerson again, so I'd call that progress. My generally good feeling about the progress made came to halt this afternoon when it was drawn to my attention that <a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0faults</a> (<a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_ecbe.html" title="User talk:Zer0faults">talk</a>), with whom I've had little interaction (save commenting in the same thread), had created a page whose sole purpose appears to be to document the stronger two of the outbursts: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Zer0faults/admin&amp;oldid=76423115" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Zer0faults/admin&amp;oldid=76423115" rel="nofollow">[151]</a>. I queried him about the overall purpose and intent of this page, but received no response: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zer0faults&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=76619182" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zer0faults&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=76619182" rel="nofollow">[152]</a>. Taking matters into my own hands, I edited the page to add context: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Zer0faults/admin&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=76620474" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Zer0faults/admin&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=76620474" rel="nofollow">[153]</a>. This change was reverted by Zer0faults later this evening: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Zer0faults/admin&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=76620474" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Zer0faults/admin&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=76620474" rel="nofollow">[154]</a>. Noticing that he was active again, I immediately made a follow-up query on his talk page: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zer0faults&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=76619182" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zer0faults&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=76619182" rel="nofollow">[155]</a>. I have yet to receive an answer to either question.</p>
<p>What I'd like to know is whether I'm taking this all too seriously. I'm not used to being on lists, or having a deliberate record of this kind made of my mistakes. Perhaps I'm just supposed to expect this as par for the course. I'm somewhat disturbed at what has to be a deliberate lack of communication on Zer0fault's page: he must have seen my first query on his talk page; he saw and reverted my edit to his sub-page. Am I wrong in asking for and expecting an explanation? <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 03:30, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The fact that his revert, with a curt edit summary, removed simply a reference to your apology suggests that he's determined, for whatever reason, to cast you in a bad light. He renders this goal somewhat absurd by his refusal to reply to your reasonable requests for elucidation, and by his removal of a clearly significant piece of information. The page has the look of the start of an arbcom evidence page, though I doubt he'll find much more material in your edit history, as I have always found you eminently reasonable. As he's ignored your comments, I'd suggest just deleting it. — <a href="../../../r/d/s/User%7ERdsmith4_389f.html" title="User:Rdsmith4">Dan</a> | <a href="../../../r/d/s/User_talk%7ERdsmith4_959f.html" title="User talk:Rdsmith4">talk</a> 03:50, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If it's an RFC, then please label it as such. We all need to summarize in private before going through the rigors of an RFC or RFAR. If the page is properly labelled, it probably won't get deleted. I suggest (and it is with a heavy sigh) that Mackensen mirror the page and add context and follow-through in his own space. However, if there is no RFC in a month or so, Zer0faults should be aware that anything he's assembling will be stale and probably no use in an RFC. The longer it goes without an RFC, the more it becomes just an "enemies list." <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 10:42, 20 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Getting involved in edit disputes over someone assembling evidence against you strikes me as a poor strategy.

FWIW, Mykungfu has an RFC currently pending against them at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_NinjaNubian_82c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/NinjaNubian">Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/NinjaNubian</a>. <a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 20:16, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

Warnings of what, I do not know. However, I've had nothing other than continual harrasment by this user, on effectively no basis other than his own perception of me, and I'd like something to be done about it, if possible. There is also substanial evidence that he has a sock puppet army, which I can provide if required, although having done this at the complex abuse page seemingly acheived nothing. --<a href="../../../k/i/a/User%7EKiand_8457.html" title="User:Kiand">Kiand</a> 20:49, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
