<dd>The law in question makes repeated reference to "obscenity".

Every image on Wikipedia will either pass the Miller Test on the grounds of literary or scientific merit, or the image will be listed on IFD as being unencyclopedic.

<dd>I'm afraid y'all are a little out of date or optimistic. While the Miller Test led to the development of "community standards" as the judge of obscenity, that, by itself, has been used specifically to cripple online endeavors and mail order. (When a federal action is sought, they pursue simultaneous prosecutions in 4-5 communities where standards are offended, thereby bankrupting the commercial concern and using "community standards" as a weapon.) Additionally, the new attempts at chilling online adult content, in particular, have largely sailed past the courts in <i>de facto</i> destroying the Miller Test (although not <i>de jure</i>). This does not mean that I agree with the template, but simply saying "free speech" is naive these days. If our educational/artistic merit would be judged in aggregate or in detail is also unclear. I would hope it would be the former, in which case we'd have no worries, but the winds blowing through the US in the last decade are fickle and freezing. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:45, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This VFD is doing wikipedia no good. People are voting and bickering over the existance of this project as if they were voting over a proposed wikipedia guideline or policy. In my opinion a way to end this mess (and the sooner the better) would be to create a wikipedian club instead and replace this project with that. Along the lines of <a href="../../../h/a/r/Wikipedia%7EHarmonious_editing_club_c3f6.html" title="Wikipedia:Harmonious editing club">Wikipedia:Harmonious editing club</a>. Call it Wikipedia:Decency concerned wikipedians club or something, and then people can just sign up there as they would with this project. I personaly don't understand why these people can't have their own Wikipedia Project (so I voted keep), but a wikipedia club should be an acceptable compromise and nobody can't possibly deny a club from existing. Or can they? <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShanes_8450.html" title="User:Shanes">Shanes</a> 04:46, 18 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It's not really about whether the WikiProject or club is or should be endorsed, it's about keeping things civil. Several RFC's can be filled out with the amount of personal attacks and flaming that have been occurred in this thing, and there's plenty of vote-changing, sockpuppeting and personal attacks to keep admins busy around the clock. This VfD is only a day old, and with it exceeding 100 KB by now, the frenetic pace of it isn't going to change in the foreseeable future. It is probably the most intense discussion in Wikipedia right now. --<a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito</a><a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd"><font color="#008000">xd</font></a> 04:58, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's manifestly obvious to anybody who looks that any WikiProject is simply an association of Wikipedians with similar interests. The only issue here should be whether WikiProjects should be extended to cover people with similar opinions; there's no question that "we" don't endorse any WikiProject. Incidentally, does "we" mean The Community? Does the community have to agree on something, or have a majority in favor, for it to exist? If so, why do we have inclusionist and deletionist associations? — <a href="../../../r/d/s/User%7ERdsmith4_389f.html" title="User:Rdsmith4">Dan</a> | <a href="../../../r/d/s/User_talk%7ERdsmith4_959f.html" title="User talk:Rdsmith4">Talk</a> 19:29, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The whole thing is just an absolutely dismal display. I cannot believe so many people are voting to delete a wikiproject just because they have different views. Views have nothing to do it, because both sides' views regarding decency are compatible with Wikipedia; it's all a matter of consensus to be worked out, policies and practices to be developed, etc. The VfD is nothing beyond a single question: should these people be allowed to have a project promoting their views about obscenity issues and so on? You could ask the same question if people formed an "anti-censorship" wikiproject. The answer should of course be yes in both instances. I'm stunned that this is actually a matter of contention. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 05:21, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Well, no. This Wikiproject's sole goal runs counter to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. That's entirely different. Virtually every other WikiProject or related organization is about adding or organizing content, or both (or isn't actually doing anything at all, as the WikiProject Inclusion mentioned above). All of that is constructive.

<p>Discussion on the merits of the project are <i>not</i> to spill over here, please.

The problem here is that <i>if</i> you agree the project is in fundamental contradiction of Wikipedia's goals, you'll be inclined to think VfD has something to say about it. But if you don't, you won't. The VfD can't settle the meta-issue and it's not trying hard either; instead people are happily flaming each other on the "decency" issue itself. <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Polls_are_evil" class="extiw" title="m:Polls_are_evil">Polls are evil</a>.

<dd>They did! The outcome was "banana". Or "no consensus", I forget. But that page illustrates exactly why this VfD will do anything except have a constructive outcome. Of course, <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> made the mistake of asking people whether it should be closed, thereby ensuring nobody could do it without getting shouted down, and possibly reverted.<br />
The real trick will be containing the flamewars, trolls and other assorted nonsense after the nomination has run and getting some decent (pardon the word) discussion on track. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 11:27, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Read the article. It doesn't say "don't ever use polls, ever, because they can never come to any good", it says "if you want consensus, a poll is the last thing that should be on your mind". Polls have their uses as census-takers and opinion-gatherers; constructive discussion is a thing they only support as an afterthought, however, and only by generating enough heat to power something more productive. The article should really be titled "polls have limited areas of application and should be used with care", but that's a whole lot less catchy than "polls are evil".

<p>Hmph, people advised me against closing this VfD early. I guess the advice could have been better.&#160;:-P</p>
<p>The conclusion from this VfD is already <i>No Consensus</i>, there's already too many keep votes for anything else. Hmm, would some folks be interested in getting together and actually declare that (and more importantly, patiently explain why)? It doesn't even need to (all) be admins, anyone can close a VFD.

<li>There needs to be a clearer definition of "consensus", or at least a consensus definition of consensus depending on the issue. You can make it loose, but at least set some paramaters. The vote has been steady at around 60-40, but is that enough? Doubtful? Possible?</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/g/r/User%7EAgriculture_50fc.html" title="User:Agriculture">agriculture</a> apparently won't come back regardless of the end vote, thus making all of this moot unless someone officially takes over the project for him.</li>
<li>A clearer policy on preventing sockpuppets from voting is needed, and it needs to be clarified if IP address votes should be considered as sockpuppets regardless of edit tally.</li>
<li>What would Wikimedia do if someone brought legal action on Wikipedia?</li>
<li>This is an amazingly diverse community, and regardless of the failures shown by this vfd, the fact that that so many people care about trying to address these failures show the success of this project in my opinion: a large amount of users want to protect and advance this project however they can.</li>

<li>A clearer definition of consensus is not needed, certainly not here. The outcome is quite obviously <i>no consensus</i>, which defaults to <i>keep</i>, or rather, <i>VfD isn't the right tool, use something better</i>. VfD operates by "rough consensus", which is deliberately not chiseled in stone with unmoveable percentage thresholds to discourage gaming the system and getting tangled up in borderline disputes over whether consensus was "really" reached (in such cases, the answer is almost always "no").</li>
<li>Wasn't aware projects were owned by people in the first place. It's obvious this project can't simply muddle on in its current form, if only because it triggered a heated VfD. I suggest all of us "officially take over".</li>
<li>What's wrong with the existing policies? Sockpuppet votes are routinely ignored. Again, in this case, it hardly matters. Users who are clearly not sockpuppets couldn't reach consensus on the matter; a barrel full of sockpuppets won't change that. The issue for IPs is even clearer: the majority is cast by sockpuppets and people who have no idea what Wikipedia is about. They are still free to voice their opinion, but their votes are not important as far as raw numbers go. Those few IP addresses used by people who are knowledgeable of Wikipedia's policies are another matter, but they are rare as hen's teeth on VfD. In any case, closing administrators are expected to exercise good judgement in deciding what votes were cast in good faith and what votes were motivated by malice or ignorance, and they generally succeed. Other people are free to point out edit tallies, possible motivations and their opinions on whether the vote should count, but ultimately this is just extra information.</li>
<li>Challenge them? I don't see the issue here. Legal action is distinct from legal threats, though. We get a lot more of the latter than of the former. And as Jimbo has pointed out, the chance of someone taking legal action against us is close to zero, since it's a) highly doubtful any laws are being broken in the first place and b) in nobody's best interest to challenge Wikipedia over them.</li>
<li>That's not how I read it. I voted <i>keep</i> and certainly do not wish to "protect" and "advance" the project. In its current form, it's severely misguided. It needs to be retargeted and the inflammatory/ambiguous "decency" nonsense (whose decency?) should go. If by "success" you mean "generates discussion", then yes, this project is <i>amazingly</i> successful. Discussion doesn't build an encyclopedia, however. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 21:09, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I just looked at the VfD now--I voted keep very early and hadn't really been back since then. It's a mess and the collateral damage is in my opinion much worse than would be the possible effects of either keeping or deleting this project. On the other hand deleting it would have just annoyed everybody. There's nothing for it, this just has to run its five days (not a second longer) and be quietly tallied by someone who is patient enough to do so. It's been about three days now so I suggest that anyone who fancies taking on the challenge should get started now--there are hundreds and hundreds of edits on that VfD. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 13:25, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not sure if this is the most appropriate place for this, so if there's a better place please let me know.</p>
<p>There's a problem arising in the <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_W._Welch_Jr._a662.html" title="Robert W. Welch Jr.">Robert W. Welch Jr.</a> article. What appears to be a single anonymous poster has posted an atricle which is a direct copy from this site: <a href="http://www.robertwelchuniversity.org/content.php?con=40" class="external free" title="http://www.robertwelchuniversity.org/content.php?con=40" rel="nofollow">http://www.robertwelchuniversity.org/content.php?con=40</a> . In addition to being a copyright violation, the information from the site appears to be highly biased on a controversial subject. I have attempted to post a more NPOV article on this subjcet (see the Revision as of 02:13, 12 August 2005) but the anonymous poster keeps deleting any information except his or her own.</p>
<p>In addition to the Welch article, it appears this same poster has created similar problems at the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Birch_Society_d54f.html" title="John Birch Society">John Birch Society</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Kernan_ad17.html" title="Joe Kernan">Joe Kernan</a>, and <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitch_Daniels_0675.html" title="Mitch Daniels">Mitch Daniels</a> articles.</p>
<p>This poster (assuming it is one person) posts anonymously using addresses starting with 63.134.129. Among the variations on this are 63.134.129.90, 63.134.129.13, 63.134.129.11, 63.134.129.112, 63.134.129.142, 63.134.129.158, 63.134.129.191, 63.134.129.223, 63.134.129.31, 63.134.129.223, 63.134.129.189, 63.134.129.75, 63.134.129.191, 63.134.129.210, and several others.

<dd>after everybody was really fed up with the topic, I think both sides were grateful for the face-saving compromise of "link, but don't inline". I don't think any other result will come of it if we go through the excrutiating debate again, apart from more workforce and nerves lost to more productive use. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 19:28, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The decision was on the basis of an earlier image that we held a vote on. If I recall correctly the vote was headed for a no consensus and there was some argument over how to interpret that. Jimbo Wales intervened and said that the image in question was unencyclopedic in his opinion and if not deleted it should at least be linked rather than inlined. He has since then expressed his personal satisfaction with the eventual outcome--that the old image was deleted as a copyright violation, a drawing was placed inline and agreed to be generally suitable, and a new image was obtained with a compatible licence, and this new image was linked rather than inlined. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 17:48, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. Just to let you admins know, I've created a handy template at <a href="../../../3/r/r/Template%7E3rrblock.html" title="Template:3rrblock">Template:3rrblock</a>. It includes links to the reverts and everything, so it might be useful in dealing with 3rr vios.

<dd>This appears to be redundant to {{<a href="../../../3/r/r/Template%7E3RR3_e0ec.html" title="Template:3RR3">3RR3</a>}}, though the new one has a bit more.

<dd>No, it wasn't intentional. I do believe my template ought to be used, however, because it puts the onus on the blocking administrator to provide evidence of the reverts and thus quells any unnecessary squabbling. <a href="../../../v/a/c/User%7EVacuum_abf8.html" title="User:Vacuum">Vacuum</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Vacuum_f424.html" title="Special:Contributions/Vacuum">c</a> 20:43, August 19, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>If in the process you lose essential copyright information, such as the list of original authors, then yes we would all mind. Moving a GFDL image to commons means more than just uploading it over there, so one needs to check that all the neccesary steps were taken before the image is deleted. For the most part, people have been discouraged from deleting NowCommons images while we await the magic MediaWiki tool that will make it simple to move the authorship and version information to Commons. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 20:30, August 21, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Remember that a controversial name may colour other users' perspective on your own credibility or political viewpoint.

<dd>Wikipedia recommends that users avoid
<ol>
<li>names of politicians, military or religious figures or events;</li>
<li>any other names that may be seen as potentially offensive, or endorsing or opposing the politics, policies or beliefs of a public figure.</li>

<dd>People should be able to judge you purely on your contributions, not an emotional response to a potentially controversial nickname.

My point is that it should not be in the domain of admins to police this area of policy in such a rabid fashion.</p>
<p>This whole 'offensiveness' topic is obscured by subjectivity. For example, the user name Nunh-huh could be construed to be offensive to large numbers of disabled people. I work with disabled people, many of whom are speech impaired, and that particular user name resembles a phoenetic reconstruction of some profoundly speech impaired people's attempts to vocalise.</p>
<p>But that would be political correctness gone mad, which is precisely what this admins debate about an honest users name is. PC GONE MAD.

<dd>No, you're probably one of the many concerned citizens who wants to keep people honest by heaping scathing commentary on them. Ascribing nasty motives and clamoring for sanctions whenever people don't keel over immediately to cater to your demands is not a good way to go about things. Admins are volunteers too, you know. Two wrongs don't make a right -- just because you see admins misbehave doesn't mean you can beat your chest in self-righteous indignation pointing it out and expect people to accommodate you. 69.46.0.40 13:16, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Relax 69, let's get back to the point here. This discussion started about a possible violation of WP user name policy. No concensus has been reached that this particular name breached the policy, yet the user has been banned. This is wrong. A responsible admin should rectify this, that is my point. You are the only one engaged in chest beating as I see it. --81.76.39.113 13:29, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>A friendly reminder to those who are doing speedy deletion: Images are not redundant, and therefore should be placed on IFD instead, if they are <a href="../../../i/u/p/WP%7EIUP_e163.html#Format" title="WP:IUP">merely similar</a>, such as <a href="../../../p/r/e/Wikipedia%7EPreparing_images_for_upload_4608.html#Why_you_should_not_save_diagrams_as_JPEG" title="Wikipedia:Preparing images for upload">JPEG versions of PNG images</a>.

<ul>
<li>OK, I was told that the wording on that policy on <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#Images.2FMedia" title="WP:CSD">CSD</a> is a little ambiguous, so I copyedited and added "or any other picture that has been saved in a different <a href="../../../i/u/p/WP%7EIUP_e163.html#Format" title="WP:IUP">image file format</a>" to make it more clear. If you can make it more clear, be my guest. The point, as I recall, is that different file formats each have their own pros and cons (which are listed on <a href="../../../i/u/p/WP%7EIUP_e163.html#Format" title="WP:IUP">WP:IUP#Format</a>), and thus when you convert an image from JPEG to PNG, some of the resolution and quality may change. That is why they should not be candidates for speedy. <a href="../../../z/z/y/User%7EZzyzx11_e7c4.html" title="User:Zzyzx11">Zzyzx11</a> <a href="../../../z/z/y/User_talk%7EZzyzx11_0d23.html" title="User talk:Zzyzx11">(Talk)</a> 16:31, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Actually, if you convert from JPEG to PNG there is a 100% chance of quality loss, so the image could be deleted without remorse. If you compress them separetely from the same matrix, that's a different story. --<a href="../../../s/n/0/User%7ESn0wflake_8d39.html" title="User:Sn0wflake">Sn0wflake</a> 18:07, 24 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Really? JPEG is the lossy format, not PNG, so you lose information when you convert from PNG to JPEG, not the other way round. If you convert from JPEG to PNG, you just end up with a bigger file. <a href="../../../r/l/_/User%7ERl_43ae.html" title="User:Rl">Rl</a> 18:30, 24 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I believe you might be missing my point, somewhat. I am not some JPEG advocate, I am merely implying that any compressed image which is converted to another compressed standard produces a result worse than the original. The best you can hope for is that it <i>looks</i> just as good, but pixel-level that's not true, right. So unless the two versions are generates from the same PSD (for example), you can rarely win anything by keeping the replica. Unless maybe pngcrush is very wisely and carefully used? --<a href="../../../s/n/0/User%7ESn0wflake_8d39.html" title="User:Sn0wflake">Sn0wflake</a> 19:05, 24 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>While Rl is correct, the point is that not everybody knows that, so the CSD should simply state that having two identical images in different file formats is not grounds for deletion (e.g. GIF is also lossless, but converting JPEG to GIF can nevertheless lose quality because of the lower color depth). <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 08:01, August 25, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>On the Vfd page a former user is being accused of making anonymous antisemitic edits in two places on the page by Users "Witkacy" and "Schwartz und Weiss". The edits were actually made by 80.130.xxx.xxx who is unlikely to be the user concerned (although this is not Witkacy's belief). The situation could easily be remedied by removing the user's name. Luckily this could be done without affecting the discussion or the vote and ordinarily I would do it in accordance with the "No personal attacks" policy. However because this is on a page which would not ordinarily be edited, I thought I should run it past people to see what they think about the situation before I jump in with both feet and remove the offending name. Note that there is no doubt about the antisemitic comments. The doubt lies in the identity of the person making them.

<dd>I guess so, but what struck me was the decision that looks like it's going to pass: he will be "banned for one year from Wikipedia". I find that staggering.

<dd>So you personally have not seen any problematic behavior from this user, therefore he must be an all round good guy who dosen't deseve banning. He I've got an idea - let's get rid of the evidence pages for the AC to read documenting such minor things as deliberately breaking the sandbox, posting libelous remarks, Encoraging harrasment of his teacher by email, mailbombing admins, taunting vandals, vandalising user pages, etc. Why bother with that when we could just ask you?

<dd>Everyking, Theresa Knott really does have a point, even if she didn't present it in the best of fashions. This is JarlaxleArtemis's second arbitration case, and if you look at the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_JarlaxleArtemis_2_Evidence_687d.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/JarlaxleArtemis 2/Evidence">evidence page</a>, you'll clearly see that the sheer volume of evidence that is being presented against Jarlaxle is ludicrous.

<dd>The point isn't to punish him for misbehaving, the point is to prevent him from making it harder to build an encyclopedia. If he's causing problems now, nothing will have changed in a month.

<dd>Do you think he is doing more harm than good to the encyclopedia? I think it's totally unjustifiable to impose a one year ban on a good faith contributor.

<dd>Wikipedia was recently a subject of intensive research of an huge international human right organization. A team of people from different nationalities and ages were acting on Wikipedia for 20 days, investigating previously noted anomalities of Wikipedia free editing and forming a final report, which (between the others similar reports) will later be a guide to all future moves of the organization concerning Wikipedia. Acting under an account of a real person, their privacy is to be held private. Therefore, very few private information will be revealed.</dd>

<li>That's great, but a question: are there differentiated guidelines for namespace deletions? I'm not being snide; I really think that having no avenue for establishing communal feelings about a namespace page is only half the problem. The other half is that the same criteria have not applied to namespace pages as article-space pages, and that has left namespace in a no man's land, where anyone could put up anything and expect it to last as long as electrons flow or be deleted by the first offended admin-level user. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:38, 29 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>There are certainly differentiated guidelines for non-main namespace <i>nominations</i>. The text at the top of <a href="../../../n/f/d/WP%7ENFD_3660.html" title="WP:NFD">WP:NFD</a> on what avenues to investigate <i>before</i> nominating something for deletion reflects what is said on <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> on the subject. How markedly differentiated the nomination guidelines are is a subject for discussion.

<li>Procedures for deleting non-main-namespace pages have always lagged behind procedures for deleting articles. The issue just hasn't come up often enough for consistent procedures to evolve. The standards, though, are different from article-space deletions since the content and purpose are entirely different. I don't think there are many cases where we really need to delete a page in the User or Wikipedia namespaces; usually redirecting or putting a "historical" tag should be enough. That said, I like the new page since the handful of non-main-namespace pages that end up on VfD usually provoke large, disruptive discussions. <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsomorphic_e88d.html" title="User:Isomorphic">Isomorphic</a> 05:20, 29 August 2005 (UTC)

<p>The MilkMan (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MilkMan_53f5.html" title="Special:Contributions/MilkMan">contribs</a>) seems to be Willy under a new name or a copycat. He is creating a bunch of sleeper accounts on a daily basis. I have indef blocked all the new ones I found today. I also decided to block "Milk"-named accounts with zero contributions, on the grounds that when a legitimate new user first creates an account, it's usually for the purpose of making an edit.</p>
<ul>
<li>Curps, why do you say he is Willy? I have no objection to your blocking the various milkpuppets. He spent a couple of days sending me copious "fuck you" emails after I blocked ten or so of them. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreplySpang_52d7.html" title="User:FreplySpang">FreplySpang</a> <a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreplySpang_a627.html" title="User talk:FreplySpang">(talk)</a> 17:21, August 29, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, it's characteristic of Willy to register a bunch of sleeper accounts, then let them age for a while and make a few edits with them (often minor vandalism or short taunts on the user or talk page). By doing so they pass the non-newbie threshold checking to be able to do page moves, and hence pagemove vandalism. There really isn't any other reason to register sleeper accounts unless you have long term plans to use them for pagemove vandalism. That's Willy's style. It's also very telling that many "MilkMan" accounts started appearing on August 26, the very day we staved off the latest wave of Willy pagemove vandalism. Anyway, if it's not Willy, it's a copycat who wishes to do much the same things. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 18:19, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>fear the copycats, though. We are relying rather too much that there will not be a hundred willies ante portas one fine morning.

<ul>
<li>That would be great. Maybe not all admins, but at least all bureaucrats. We're going to have to keep finding ways to combat sneaky vandalism. As Wikipedia gets more and more popular (as it is obvious that will continue) there will increasingly be more and more people willing to be more and more persistent in vandalizing. The only way to keep this place sane will be to make sure that on the whole fixing vandalism is cheaper than vandalizing. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 19:21, August 29, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I am being harassed by user:ginadana who is trying to advance an anti-blog adgenda along with user:dreamguy (see how he votes to delete blogs). Gina Dana has written to my talk page with warnings. Aparently I misunderstand some secret policy. But rather than warn once, she advanced to the final warning right away in her next edit. I hadn't even made any more edits or responded. She also claims that users are not allowed to edit policy, but this is clearly untrue because how would policy get there otherwise and why would access be allowed? please help! 12.111.139.2 23:39, 30 August 2005 (UTC)--</p>

<li>As per your request I deleted what you uploaded here. There is no revert button because the image you uploaded was actually the first image saved under that name here on en.wikipedia.

<li>By the way, <a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwanner_e32b.html" title="User:Mwanner">Mwanner</a>, if you did not know, the feature that we are discussing allows users to use images from Wikipedia Commons without ever having to upload a local copy here on to en.wikipedia. The bug in this feature is that similar situations can occur in which someone can upload an image with the same filename that "blocks" the one from Commons. <a href="../../../z/z/y/User%7EZzyzx11_e7c4.html" title="User:Zzyzx11">Zzyzx11</a> <a href="../../../z/z/y/User_talk%7EZzyzx11_0d23.html" title="User talk:Zzyzx11">(Talk)</a> 00:05, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>For the past several days, I have been one of the only ones working on clearing the backlog (although there has been some significant help today). Since I am no expert on copyright, this can be somewhat problematic and it tends to result in me leaving items on the list when I'm not sure what to do with them. With pages needing wikification listed as the collaboration of the week, the list is growing faster than I can clear it. Assistance is definitely needed. After a concerted effort the size is down a bit, but it's going to keep growing fairly rapidly for at least the duration of the week.</dd>
<dd>Would it be reasonable to have transcluded daily subpages like at <a href="../../../c/f/d/WP%7ECfD_3468.html" title="WP:CfD">WP:CfD</a> and other similar pages? (They could even be deleted as they are cleared, since it takes admins to finish the clearing already.) One of the problems right now is that the page is so large that any changes are slow. This makes it difficult to add new entries or to add useful comments to old ones. -<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranel_6303.html" title="User:Aranel">Aranel</a> (<font color="#BA0000">Sarah</font>) 18:24, 31 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I started working on the backlog yesterday -- I'm making it my major project at least until we bring it back down to manageable levels (and I do intend to go on working <a href="../../../c/p/_/WP%7ECP_e7b9.html" title="WP:CP">WP:CP</a> after that, too). I think the best plan is to work through the backlog and ignore things that are too potentially complicated to deal with quickly. That might mean leaving a few entries for each day, but I think it makes more sense to deal with those after the backlog is sorted rather than drawing out the whole process. Incidentally, there's currently a discussion on WikiEn-l about good practice with regard to confirmations of permission that you might be interested in, Aranel. --<a href="../../../n/g/b/User%7ENgb_4a87.html" title="User:Ngb">Ngb</a> <sup><a href="../../../n/g/b/User_talk%7ENgb_2abf.html" title="User talk:Ngb">?!?</a></sup> 18:36, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Curps is currently running a block bot which automatically blocks all non-admins that make too many page moves (and it promptly blocked me when I was undoing a page move spree too).

The traditional Willy pagemove vandalism always stopped after around 40 or so pages, even when we didn't block him in time. On August 26, as User:Dieseldrinker, he was doing 75 pagemoves per minute, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=move&amp;user=Dieseldrinker&amp;page=" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=move&amp;user=Dieseldrinker&amp;page=" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> and didn't stop until he was blocked. It took several admins and non-admins a few hours to undo what he did in only 2 1/2 minutes. He then launched 8 more attacks on the same day, however by this time I was running the bot and stopped him each time after about 20-30 pagemoves.</dd>

<dd>This is a new level of vandalism that we can't cope with by traditional means. As an urgent practical necessity, I am running a block bot. I hope that we will soon have pagemove throttling or some other mechanism that will make this unnecessary. Abstract principles have to be weighed against the need to prevent massive vandalism on a scale never seen before.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have raised the trigger threshold for page moves to a new and higher level that will almost certainly prevent the triggering that happened to Fvw (who moved more than 16 pages per minute). By the way, the bot intentionally avoids blocking admins, but because Fvw was listed as "inactive" at <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_administrators_8c59.html" title="Wikipedia:List of administrators">Wikipedia:List of administrators</a> I had not added him to the list; I have now added all "inactive" admins to the do-not-block list as well.</dd>

<li>I tend to think the bot should be OK in this instance as long as the set number of moves is higher than what any normal editor can reasonably be expected to make and also lower than or equal to the number of moves Willy usually makes in a minute. It may be tricky to find that balance; Curps should be careful to check and quickly unblock any legitimate user affected by it. The problem, which occurs to me, is that the bot may ironically end up blocking people who are trying to move pages back to where they should be. Is there a way to deal with this? <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 09:10, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I did indeed unblock fvw right away. However, I am running the bot 24/7, which means it is occasionally unsupervised. This is unfortunate, but I am arguing urgent practical necessity.

<dd>The only reason why I even post in <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_fd71.html" title="Wikipedia:Bots">Wikipedia:Bots</a> is to make certain that they can indeed prove their bot is harmless. I've been following a general rule of allowing a test run of a given period, then if they have no complaints during their "trial run" -- they can apply for such a bot flag. The given period depends on the purpose of the bot, bots which seem to be more experimental or have the damage to cause harm yet may be still useful are given a longer trial run period. Personally, I'm taking the view that the <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EBots_fed8.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Bots">Wikipedia talk:Bots</a> page is a proposal for your bot to run. Therefore, people requesting for their bot to run must detail their proposal, and why they need a bot in the first place. Before this, we just allowed comments to sit a week, and everyone got their bot flag within a week. I intervened when I saw that there are some users who do make mistakes, who do use outdated bots, and who do not pay attention to warnings. Case in point, <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlacus_7d8f.html" title="User:Flacus">Flacus</a> with <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlaBot_747f.html" title="User:FlaBot">FlaBot</a>. However, <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlaBot_747f.html" title="User:FlaBot">FlaBot</a> seems to be in line now. The rules generally are that you have to have two accounts. One for your bot, one for yourself. There have been cases where people are requesting a bot flag for their own account. There are requests for people attempting to establish bot accounts with no user page. Bot accounts should always have user pages, because they need to describe the work they are doing, allowing an admin immediate insight to what the bot is doing and can it be blocked. Supposely, we are to block bots on sight... But that seems to be less the case now... I don't want to feel like I'm the only one posting their to approve bots... but that's what it seems to result as now. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 11:22, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As I told you on your talk page, I think the bot is a good idea. But you should get it vetted on <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_fd71.html" title="Wikipedia:Bots">Wikipedia:Bots</a> <i>first</i>, so it doesn't do things like block me when I'm trying to restore page move vandalism. It's not some hurdle invented to keep the bureaucracy happy, it's there so people can check your ideas and make sure you don't cause collatoral damage like you did this morning. --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 09:51, September 1, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I think this bot is an excellent solution to a long-running problem, and should be kept active until the developers have a more permanent solution against pagemove vandalism. Several are being discussed on bugzilla, by the way. At present the track record is 11 succesful blocks and one mistake, which was quickly corrected. Collateral damage of Willy is far larger than that of Curps's bot. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 10:30, September 1, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>fvw, you were reverting page moves by User:Acid, who simply capitalized page titles in a way not in accordance with Wikipedia's usual style. Apparently a misguided newbie (his first edit was August 18) and not a vandal... nobody, including you, has ever blocked him. So calling Acid a "vandal" is misleading and unfair to him.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Furthermore you were doing these reverts three days after he did the original moves. You are making it sound as if you were accidentally blocked in the midst of urgently repairing Willy-style pagemove vandalism; that was not the case at all.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I apologize for the accidental block; you were doing pagemoves at a very fast rate which I would not have thought possible to do manually, as you say you were doing (especially considering that you have to click a button to confirm each page move). I have since raised the threshold even higher.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The urgency of the situation did not permit a leisurely discussion at Wikipedia:Bots or waiting a week for approval. That is a relatively quiet corner where very few eyes would see it. As I pointed out earlier, I posted a message about the bot at AN/I and it was discussed by those who were most involved with the August 26 willy cleanup. I am disappointed that you are being narrowly legalistic in the face of an unprecedented problem: as of a week ago, Willy can now move 75 pages per minute and that's far more than we can cope with by traditional means.</dd>

<dd>You know, because it seems that it only requires one community member to approve your bot, you could have easily fired me an email. Or left a message on my talk page.

I feel that it's kind of stupid to have a user wait a full week for no one to say anything. I believe the policy should be allow the user run the bot immediately, if anyone says "STOP!" Then the user should immediately stop using it. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 11:27, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agreed. We understand the bot would have admin rights, but it is important to distinguish those blocks, and I agree with AllyUnion, several admins should have access/control of it. That would help make sure the bot doesn't exceed its mandate. The bot policy is clear all bots should be run as bots. And if it looks like a duck... I also don't understand why you are so reluctant to have this not run under your account.

<p>Back to left. Thats fine to. I don't think that part of it is such a big issue. Make it bcrats, make it the first 10 admins in alphabetical order plus Curps and AllyUnion, or make it the first 7 admins that volunteer and know how to deal with bots (I not being one of them). We're all trusted members of the community, with the ability to block users, so I don't see the problem. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 19:59, September 3, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>By several "admins", I mean those who volunteer to do so and have the technical expertise to fix the code. The issue of a separate account is more of a bot flag issue, which typically bots should run as a different account. The reason why I'm suggesting a community collaborative account is that we can pick a bot name that clearly indicates that the blocking was done by a bot, rather than an actual administrator. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 18:49, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you're going to have a bot running around blocking people, I agree it definitely needs its own account. Personally, I wouldn't have problems with granting a bot sysop powers (after all, all it means is <b>we trust the bot</b>: isn't that all sysop powers are?). Recommendation: the bot should have a mechanism where any sysop can terminate the bot in case it starts going beserk.

<p>An anonymous IP-user from the range 203.164.18x.x. (an Australian dial-up, I believe) is refusing to discuss a rather minor, but still fairly relevant layout issue concerning the <a href="../../../l/a/n/Template%7ELanguage_39a6.html" title="Template:Language">language infobox</a> and has reverted at least two users, including myself and <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">bishonen</a>. The conflict is whether to actually write the full name of sub-families of <a href="../../../l/a/n/Language_family.html" title="Language family">language families</a>, such as "North Germanic" or "South Slavic". The anon user insists on a format used by <a href="../../../s/i/l/SIL_9319.html" title="SIL">SIL</a> in the <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnologue.html" title="Ethnologue">Ethnologue</a>, which simply shortens the sub-divisions to "North" or "South". To not state the obvious in an infobox strikes me as being very non-sensical and in the case of <a href="../../../s/l/o/Slovenian_language.html" title="Slovenian language">Slovenian language</a>, it's a very potential <a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKarmosin_2125.html#Slovenian_or_Slovene" title="User talk:Karmosin">source of confusion</a>, since the language is a <i>Western South</i> Slavic language. There is such a thing as <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Slavic_languages_07cf.html" title="West Slavic languages">West Slavic languages</a> and the following format is definetly can definetly be puzzling to the average reader:</p>
<ul>

</ul>

<p>The only argument presented against writing the full names has been along the lines of "it's looks ugly the other way" or simply "fix class." and no attempt at talkpage discussion has been made.

<li>Yes. This was one of those VFD votes that attracted a number of suspicious votes (not new ones though; in particular, accounts that were several months old, had very few edits other than VFD voting, and resurfaced after long inactivity to vote again, which could easily be an attempt at gaming the system).

<p>Hi. Someone recently blocked <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> for a 3RR violation on <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality.html" title="Homosexuality">Homosexuality</a>. The user asked me to look into it, believing the block was inappropriate, and having looked over the page history I'm inclined to agree. Having been involved in disuputes at that page recently I'm reluctant to unblock him/her myself though, so if someone could look into it...

Looking at the edit history there does seem to be a lot of reverting by Lulu; I think the issue is that he claims that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Homosexuality&amp;diff=22377761&amp;oldid=22377249" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Homosexuality&amp;diff=22377761&amp;oldid=22377249" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> is reverting vandalism (by its edit summary) and therefore shouldn't count. That, however, is a false claim. The main issue seems to be about a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Homosexuality&amp;diff=22422745&amp;oldid=22413613" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Homosexuality&amp;diff=22422745&amp;oldid=22413613" rel="nofollow">single word</a>, which does make it a candidate for <a href="../../../l/a/m/WP%7ELAME_0afb.html" title="WP:LAME">WP:LAME</a>.

<p>Gabrielsimon (under any username) is banned from editing Wikipedia for one month. When he returns he may chose another username if he wishes. If problems evidencing immaturity emerge with the new username he may be banned for up to an additional month by any three Wikipedia administrators who, based on his edits and behavior, identify him and feel an additional month's ban may aid him him in gaining maturity. This remedy shall continue until he has edited Wikipedia for 6 months without being banned. A log shall be maintained on the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Gabrielsimon_Proposed_decision_3858.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Gabrielsimon/Proposed decision">decision page</a> of all bans. He is also is limited to one revert per day per article. In addition he is limited to three reverts in total per 24 hours. He is instructed not to revert war at all and instead engage in dialogue on the talk pages of articles.</p>

Should Gabrielsimon violate the revert limit imposed on him he may be banned for a short period, up to a week in the case of repeat offenses.</p>

<dd>He's not allowed 3 reverts. That's part of the provisions and he would have been blocked under this decision before that.

<li>That's bad though, now it's a GFDL vio. I've added a comment about the original poster on the talk page, but I do think we need some policy on this fast.

<ul>
<li>And there has been in the past. I'm an admin who was some months ago contacted by a more famous porn star who wanted her recently added real name stricken from the article on her for the sake of her and her family's safty. Wikipedia was the only site on the net that had her real name (and it was obviously the right one since she was worried). I wasn't sure how to handle it, and decided that making a big fuss about it then would just make matters worse, so I just let her edit it out her self. It made most sense to me then, but I'm not sure how to handle cases like this. People will scream bloody censor and that wikipedia should simply state facts, but, well, maybe we shouldn't state every fact at all cost.

<dd>True, but we also have to consider how the original poster obtained the information. If illegally, it would not be covered under GFDL to begin with.

<p>The present version of the software allows any who visits a page to see the "X deleted versions" link in the history and follow it to see the page history log for those deleted edits. They can't see the content of those edits, but they are able to see who made them and the edit summaries.

<p>Are you kidding me about this? In the US anyway, their names are already a matter of public record because of record keeping requirements. Are you really suggesting we should have a policy saying that we can have biographies of people and yet censor their actual name?

<dd>Those records are not public. They are required to be kept and be presented to the attorney general or his agent upon request, but the rest of us have no access to them. In many cases the persona associated with these roles is an entire fabrication, and totally disconnected with their real life identities. Since their real life identity is both unverifiable and unconnected with what they are notable for then yes, an article on a notable porn role has no business discussing the life of the actress playing that role. The situation would of course be different for entertainers choosing to use their real name, but that is not the case here. Don't think of it as a biography, think of it as an article on a fictional character. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 12:18, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Doesn't much of this breach the no original research requirement? The argument that "The person who posted the material has agreed to licence it under the GFDL; if we violate that agreement <b>we</b> are violating the copyright of the original uploader." would, if taken to its logical conclusion, preclude all editing of text once submitted, plus all page deletion, so it has no validity. <a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFiliocht_c3e2.html" title="User:Filiocht">Filiocht</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/l/User_talk%7EFiliocht_11a7.html" title="User talk:Filiocht">The kettle's on</a> 12:49, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, sure, everything must pass the verifiability test. But <i>if</i> the actual names were verifiable (and other standard biographical information such as date and place of birth), they should be included. The expectation of privacy in the case of porn stars is not in principal different from that of any other public figure.

<p>Well the point is that this is what <i>uninformed</i> people may say about the state. Such folklore is probably not on the list the things about a US State that are significant enough to belong to the article on the state. Do we list under <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_5c73.html" title="African American">African American</a> the common legend about male penis size? Under <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poles.html" title="Poles">Poles</a> do we have a list of Polish jokes? There's no reason in principle why not, but we don't. We don't do so, I would guess, mostly because giving such myths prominence would cause needless offence.

<dd>Informed people often think of this as the second thing that the state is known for, right after skiing. When it comes down to it, major corporations don't make shirts about Black penis size, or pole jokes. The WV jabs have made it onto popular clothing lines, and are the reason why UVA no longer has a pep band (the Governor of WV was outraged by an inbreeding joke made by the pep band during a UVA vs. WV game). It's significant and notable and belongs there. Evidently Tony doesn't feel so strongly against the page on Wikipedia which lists slang terms for penis and masturbation, but then again as I wasn't the author of it, <a href="../../../v/e/n/Vendetta.html" title="Vendetta">Tony isn't against it</a>. <a href="../../../a/g/r/User%7EAgriculture_50fc.html" title="User:Agriculture">Agriculture</a> 18:46, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I'll reiterate: deleting your own valid edits cannot be undone once made because you're angry or you've decided to leave for some other reason. Once submitted, you release your edits under the GFDL which cannot be retracted as further edits on the article are based on the assumption it stays that way. Exceptions can be made for people who added their own copyrighted material without this knowledge and reconsider. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 11:18, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdrigo_bd0f.html" title="User:Adrigo">User:Adrigo</a> is specifically mentioned in the RfArb, though admittedly only by the 'accusers'. The username does not deny it. It edits the same pages in the same style as Dot6, and established editors have reverted its edits with comments along the lines of "revert Dot6". -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 15:24, 25 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I've looked at Adrigo's edits, either it's him, or it's someone who should be blocked for the exact same reasons as Dot6, (it's him, though). <a href="../../../f/u/n/User%7EFunc_268d.html" title="User:Func">Func</a>( <a href="../../../f/u/n/User_talk%7EFunc_0951.html" title="User talk:Func">t</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Func_dbc4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Func">c</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Func_6e40.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Func">@</a>,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;user=Func" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;user=Func" rel="nofollow"> </a>) 15:38, 25 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>I think these edits are telling: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Agnosticism&amp;diff=23925655&amp;oldid=23918860" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Agnosticism&amp;diff=23925655&amp;oldid=23918860" rel="nofollow">[50]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Agnosticism&amp;diff=23948355&amp;oldid=23927489" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Agnosticism&amp;diff=23948355&amp;oldid=23927489" rel="nofollow">[51]</a>. Also Adrigo uses many of the same mannerisms and tactics as DotSix: Insistence on pointing out "logical fallacies" in articles, adding the {{dispute-resolution}} template to discussions, etc. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Atheism&amp;diff=23788296&amp;oldid=23777206" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Atheism&amp;diff=23788296&amp;oldid=23777206" rel="nofollow">[52]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/DotSix/Workshop&amp;diff=21865910&amp;oldid=21722436" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/DotSix/Workshop&amp;diff=21865910&amp;oldid=21722436" rel="nofollow">[53]</a>. I'm convinced that Adrigo = DotSix, and he should be blocked per the injunction. However I'm still not sure about this "Donald Alford" business - I think that the user who edited under that name was an impostor and it shouldn't be held against DotSix. Nate, I think you've been too hasty in assuming that Donald Alford is DotSix. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 16:54, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It isn't necessary to do anything about those right now. If the page they point to is deleted (which it very much looks like it will be, going by the AfD), then they can be speedied as <a href="../../../c/a/n/Wikipedia%7ECandidates_for_speedy_deletion_c969.html#Redirects" title="Wikipedia:Candidates for speedy deletion">redirects pointing to a non-existant page</a>. Most admins, I think, check for redirects and deal with them as necessary every time they close a deletion anyway. If you <i>do</i> want to delete redirects directly, you don't nominate them on AfD; there is a special <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirects_for_deletion_955c.html" title="Wikipedia:Redirects for deletion">Redirects for Deletion</a> page specifically for redirects.

<dd>I've been trying to work with him to develop an Rfc on the issues he contests and with little luck. I haven't given up hope as I think he may realize that the only way to get his way is to follow procedure.

<dd>Sock puppet tags are pointless and an endless source of conflict. Just leave the tag off; if the user is a sock puppet of a user that has been blocked or banned and there is concensus that they're a sock puppet the same counts for them; if the user they're a sock puppet of isn't blocked or banned, just mentally substitute the name when you're reading their signatures. --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 05:10, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

<p>A group of editors from a message board at "commandofans.com" have recently teamed up to continuously revert a copyright violation at <a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloodsport_%28film%29.html" title="Bloodsport (film)">Bloodsport (film)</a>. Although I've messaged all of them about this with {{nothanks}} and pointed them to the <a href="../../../b/l/o/Talk%7EBloodsport_%28film%29_5877.html" title="Talk:Bloodsport (film)">talk page</a>, which explains the issue, they seem dedicated to pasting re-pasting the copyvio (which is the description from the back of the DVD, also rather unencyclopedic in style) and totally non-responsive to my explanations. (On their message board they have even suggested a "war on wikis" and threatened to mail-bomb me <a href="http://commandofans.proboards37.com/index.cgi?board=Chat&amp;action=display&amp;thread=1127766617" class="external autonumber" title="http://commandofans.proboards37.com/index.cgi?board=Chat&amp;action=display&amp;thread=1127766617" rel="nofollow">[58]</a>!) They have also introduced copyvio text to <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vernon_Wells_14c1.html" title="Vernon Wells">Vernon Wells</a> and perhaps other related articles. So, my question is, what is the right way to deal with it? Page protection? My reverts get re-reverted in a matter of minutes, and WP:CP seems wrong because both pages have useful history. <font size="-2">— <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange"><font style="padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #FFE7B0; background: #FFFFFF ; color: #FF9600">brighterorange</font></a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrighterorange_9de6.html" title="User talk:Brighterorange">talk</a>)</font> 17:36, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think that the reverse of a DVD is probably fair use, being promotional material, but not when used in whole since we must use the minimum necessary. I think it would be ok to edit it down, to meet copyright and NPOV etc. I left a message to that effect on the talk page already. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 17:53, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Note that repeated and persistent reinsertion of copyvio material–particularly after a warning has been issued–would fall under our vandalism policy. The editors involved can be blocked and the article protected, should it become necessary. I would suggest that we can't reprint the promotional text from a DVD under fair use <i>unless</i> we're actually commenting on the promotional blurb itself. Speaking as an editor rather than an admin, I would have to say that we should all be ashamed and embarrassed if we're so desperate for content that we'll accept a trimmed-down box blurb as an article.... <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 19:57, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If he is not a sock of LJS it is kinda strange that he is the only other person to introduce a stealth article into the 'First responder' redirect page LJS version history</p>
<p>The not very subtle objective here is to redefine first responder to absolve federal officials from blame in the Katrina matter. That is why he created the page on Mayor Nabin and the Katrina School Buses Controversy - a controversy only he sees.</p>
<p>This is not merely POV it is an attempt to bend wikipedia into a propaganda platform. If you look at the work of his other sockpuppets you will find similar schemes under way on [ANWR oil reserves] and [Ronnie Earle]. Its the same MO, ridiculous claims from extreme partisan organizations are introduced as unbiased fact. Anyone who objects to them is accused of bias, sockpuppetry etc. The astroturfing of the VFD on nagin buses is yet another example. See Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not Fox News</p>
<p>Finally, I have been regularly accused of being a sock of Aquilon by this individual. I don't know where Acquilon is but anyone who looks at our IP addresses will quickly see that most of my posts come from one IP address (my house) and unless by some strange chance he lives close his IP address is entirely different. --<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGorgonzilla_0cd8.html" title="User:Gorgonzilla">Gorgonzilla</a> 19:16, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sockpuppetry is used to deceive, break Wikirules and influence voting, etc.. There is simply no evidence of it from Larsoner. Please stop deleting my account. Thanks.</p>
<p>Also: RESTORE TALK EDIT:</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>1) Larsoner's edits at <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Lindbergh_87dc.html" title="Charles Lindbergh">Charles Lindbergh</a> can all be sourced directly from "Lindbergh" by A. Scott Berg (ISBN0425170411). The book was winner of the <a href="../../../p/u/l/Pulitzer_Prize_e802.html" title="Pulitzer Prize">Pulitzer Prize</a>. The reverts by contoversial editor Jayjg are pure POV, done without any sources or discussion.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>2) Wikipedia has a no personal attack policy. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> you should speak for yourself. Your disgraceful actions speak louder than words.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>3) No fly-by comments without knowledge. Have you researched this issue?(no) Can you prove an edit that has broken Wikpedia's rules? Prove it. Show all the Admns. the rules violation with Larsoner's edits.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>4) Sockpupperty cannot be proved. And I repeat, as per Wikipedia polcy, show where sockpuppetry was used in any article to violate Wikipedia policy. When is the last time David Gerard that you read that page? You may need to refresh yourself with what it actually says. You are not applying it correctly.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>5) Controversial editor Jayjg should be removed from being an Admn. He abuses his position, and works in a clique. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a>, your actions speak to this. You know absolutely nothing about the situation, but are willing to act based on no information.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Prove Wikipedia rules have been broken, before you make abusive moves. How can I even reply? Could someone look into <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Lindbergh_87dc.html" title="Charles Lindbergh">Charles Lindbergh</a> remove Jayjg's POV edits and unblock Larsoner? I'd be glad to note the exact pages from what is considered the best source ever written about Charles Lindbergh. Berg writes: <i>"Grateful acknowledgement is made to Anne Morrow Lndbergh for permission to quote extensively from the unpublished papers of Charles and Anne Morrow Lindbergh."</i> Yes, Jayjg knows better? but provides no source? Not unusual for an editor that rarely provides sources and has many edits but little time spent in between them. <a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarsoner1_fcd0.html" title="User:Larsoner1">Larsoner1</a> 22:30, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I was recently blocked by the administrator Lucky 6.9. The reasons he stated was that I violated the 3RR rule. He also said I had a history of questionable edits. I believe he was mistaken, and I emailed him twice about these happening and have got no response. I then looked at his user profile.

<dd>I was on RC patrol the day the anon created doyoudo. Literally saw it being created. It was immediately apparent to me that he was likely a very experienced user, and had some familiarity with WP policies. The article was pretty NPOV, the language balanced, the text wikied, the sources cited—he was careful to put in references to independent sources (eg. the patent, some magazine reports etc). None of the usual hallmarks of crude spamming. I debated whether to AfD, but decided not to because it met guidelines—and I've seen business articles with far less clear AfD. Of course, since Aaron's AfD we've seen what else he has been up to: he's placed links and bits of text about this company and the concept all over the place, even when they were quite inappropriate or only peripherally related. And the relevations on AfD and elsewhere have been quite disquieting: he was even making article edits and AfD comments <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/DoYouDo&amp;diff=24283761&amp;oldid=24282152" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/DoYouDo&amp;diff=24283761&amp;oldid=24282152" rel="nofollow">driven</a> by personal financial considerations.

In either case, Encephalon, if you definitely think that the article should be deleted, can you vote on the AFD page? At 6 Keep:9 Delete right now, the case for consensus is not as clear as I'd like it to be before the debate is closed once and for all. --<a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDropDeadGorgias_33d3.html" title="User:DropDeadGorgias">DropDeadGorgias</a> <a href="../../../d/r/o/User_talk%7EDropDeadGorgias_66ce.html" title="User talk:DropDeadGorgias">(talk)</a> 15:00, 29 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Obviously he shouldn't do that.

<p>It is wrong that the article claims to being protected against vandalism. Duncharris' post protection edit, while strictly not by the books, doesn't affect the dispute, was minor and including spelling centre correctly. I think he shouldn't have reverted just before protecting but if it is unprotected right now I would guess further warring may break out, and maybe it should be frozen till tomorrow (it doesn't matter to whicvh version, but <b>do</b> change the template.

<p>Jeez. As someone completely uninvolved in the dispute (and having no particular opinion on the matter) I find it pretty unsettling that an administrator would use their access to lock others out of an article and push their own opinion on something as <i>petty</i> as a naming dispute.

<dd>De-sysopping him over one incident is insane, but yes, we should desysop admins who repeatedly blatantly abuse their privileges. The arbitration committee has done this in the past, to my knowledge. Anyway, what was Duncharris thinking? He should know better. :( Anyway, I think we should just let him know that we don't approve of this behaviour, and remind him that admin powers are intended to be used to uphold what the community wants. They are not editorial privileges. Also, edit wars are silly. I've never reverted more then once in my entire wikipedia career. --<a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhroziac_d326.html" title="User:Phroziac">Phroziac</a><sup>(<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhroziac_3a1f.html" title="User talk:Phroziac">talk</a>)</sup><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Phyzech_Republic.svg_15ec.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/c3/Flag_of_Phyzech_Republic.svg/25px-Flag_of_Phyzech_Republic.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Phyzech_Republic.svg_15ec.html" /></a> 17:05, 29 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well, he has edited the page in the immediate past prior to the current dispute so he's obviously been involved in the page. I don't know enough about the dispute to know whether he's been involved or not in what could substantially be called a content dispute, but he obviously thinks whatever is going on is vandalism or he wouldn't have used the vprotect tag. I'd say protecting the page and then editing it is fairly irregular from what I've seen so far (which is a cursory look), but let's let him defend himself here before we pillory him. · <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0"><b>Katefan0</b></a><sup><a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKatefan0_4566.html" title="User talk:Katefan0">(scribble)</a></sup> 17:20, 29 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>As a participant of that dispute, I can safely say that the protection was unnecessary and somebody should investigate the matter. Oddly enough, I agree with Duncharris' views on this matter but I think that reverting-protecting-editing is something that goes against Wiki-spirit and maybe desysoping him is too extreme but a very stern warning is surely warranted. The sad part is that by doing this he makes the argument he was defending weaker, not stronger. --<a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESebastiankessel_8c89.html" title="User:Sebastiankessel">Sebastian Kessel</a> <sup><i><a href="../../../s/e/b/User_talk%7ESebastiankessel_cf55.html" title="User talk:Sebastiankessel">Talk</a></i></sup> 17:52, 29 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>He didn't make any argument: unlike the other participants in this content dispute, he has not commented on the article's talk page at all.

<dd>Having started the problem by inluding the Argentine names, I am suprised how aggressivly such a name issue is handled in the English Wikipedia. I only wanted to do the same as in the German Wikipedia: To give both side (the British and the Argentine) the same amount of space because both have a valid claim on these islands.

<p>To claim Argentina and the UK both have an equally valid claim to the islands is very POV, wrong (the UK are the actual rulers) and should be dealt with at <a href="../../../s/o/v/Sovereignty_of_the_Falkland_Islands_23b4.html" title="Sovereignty of the Falkland Islands">Sovereignty of the Falkland Islands</a>, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 19:52, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is really not my business to defend the Argentine point of view, but only so much: Look at a world map. To which country are these islands closer? And if you read <a href="../../../s/o/v/Sovereignty_of_the_Falkland_Islands_23b4.html" title="Sovereignty of the Falkland Islands">Sovereignty of the Falkland Islands</a> I think there are enough arguments as valid for the Argentine claim as there are for the British claim. Current rule does not make the point. With the same argument all of Africa would be still under European rule. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EALE%21_796e.html" title="User:ALE!">ALE!</a> 20:11, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Alright, I admit that I acted hastily and did not explain my actions properly. I should have used the two versions tag not the vandalism one. However, those changes went against what the established consensus has been on that page to use the English, with the Spanish mentioned quite soon afterwards. The addition of the name <i>Puerto Argentino</i> which was a name applied by the Argentines to the capital in 1982, and has no basis for its use (unlike the name <i>Las Malvinas</i> which has a proper origin in the French <i>Iles Malouines</i>, Puerto Argentino has its origins in Argentine nationalism). He may not have realised this and so the "vandalism" was unintentional rather than deliberate. I unprotected it a few hours afterwards after I returned. As for the other language Wikipedias, they can and do have NPOV problems too. <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncharris_e9cb.html" title="User:Duncharris">Dunc</a>|<a href="../../../d/u/n/User_talk%7EDuncharris_8aa7.html" title="User talk:Duncharris">☺</a> 20:32, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<hr />
<p>I'd like to complain about the behaviour of the above admin <b>Alteripse</b>. He has not helped in resolving the issue, instead choosing to inflame it even more. It should be obvious that the author in question does not want her name published, otherwise she would not have published under a pen name. In addition, in one of the articles linked to on the page, she notes that her name was originally published without her permission.</p>
<p>The author does not limit her subject matter to Christianity; she writes about religion in general, including Islam. It is a very controversial subject, and her privacy should be respected! She has received threatening emails along the lines of 'we know who you are' which link to the Wikipedia article in question. It's disgusting that Wikipedia would be used this way. When I point this out, his response is along the lines of a dismissive 'I don't believe you.'</p>
<p>In addition, besides refusing to remove her name, (and in fact, inserting it back in after it was deleted... in bold no less!), the above admin <b>Alteripse</b> has acted (I believe) inappropriately in his (or her?) capacity as an admin in other ways. For instance, he replaced a list of the authors credentials:</p>
<p><i>Acharya S was classically educated receiving an undergraduate degree in Classics, Greek Civilization, and received her Masters Degree from Franklin &amp; Marshall College. She is a member of an institute for the study of Ancient Greek Civilization, the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, Greece. She has served as a trench master on archaeological excavations in Corinth, Greece, and Connecticut, USA, as well as a teacher's assistant on the island of Crete. Acharya S has traveled extensively around Europe, and speaks, reads and/or writes English, Greek, French, Spanish, Italian, German, and Portuguese.</i></p>
<p>with:</p>
<p><i>Acharya S is... an American critic of Christianity, and amateur "historian, mythologist, religious scholar, linguist, and archeologist".</i></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Acharya_S&amp;diff=23158313&amp;oldid=23156577" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Acharya_S&amp;diff=23158313&amp;oldid=23156577" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Acharya_S&amp;diff=23158313&amp;oldid=23156577</a></li>
</ul>
<p>When confronted with the above not-so-subtle attempt to smear the author, he says:</p>
<p><i>"I am curious as to why you think calling her an amateur is a "smear" or is inaccurate. It means she doesn't work as a professional religious studies scholar or academic classicist. It changes the standards by which we judge an author's work. Why is that a smear?"</i></p>

</ul>
<p>Oh phuleease! That's not what my dictionary says...</p>
<p>All this leads me to suspect that <b>Alteripse</b> is biased and has an axe to grind. However, that's not for me to decide. I am just writing to alert you to his behaviour. As it stands, he has agreed not to repost her name, for which I am thankful.</p>

<dd>Acharya S is not an 'amateur'. She is a professional. Consider her credentials. She is highly trained, and gets paid for researching and writing books. I realize you are amateurs; this is wikipedia after all. I just expected that efforts would be made to help protect the privacy of <i>living authors</i> who are routinely threatened by religious fanatics, from different denominations, due to the controversial nature of her work. BTW, I hear that Natalie Portmans privacy was protected here on Wikipedia. Please extend the same courtesy to this author!</dd>

<dd>I'm asking as a courtesy. Her name was originally published without her permission and against her wishes. She receives a steady stream of hate mail and threats due to the controversial nature of her work. While her name is disseminated on fringe Christian websites and message boards such as 'RisenJesus.com', I was hoping that the admins here would not allow Wikipedia to be used for that distasteful purpose.</dd>

<dd>Your requests are unreasonable. We can't "remove" information, because it's still stored in the page history. Thus, we'd have to delete it. However, the person in the article appears not to fit into deletion criteria: she seems to be notable, no one has nominated the article for deletion yet, so it would against the goals of Wikipedia to remove the article. Publishing a persons last name, books they have written, and a brief background of academic endeavours is not an unreasonable look into someone's life for any Encyclopedia article. <b>And last and foremost of all, this belongs on the pertinent article's talk page.</b> — <span style="font-variant:small-caps;font-family:sans-serif;"><a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbush_Commander_08e2.html" title="User:Ambush Commander">Ambush Commander</a></span><sup style="font-family:serif;">(<a href="../../../a/m/b/User_talk%7EAmbush_Commander_60e0.html" title="User talk:Ambush Commander">Talk</a>)</sup> 01:10, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Short answer, no. Long answer, no, because we don't have the technical capabilities to do it, and the developers (if they have the capabilities, which I'm not sure they do) are unwilling/unable to do it because edit summaries are supposed to be a permanent record and may be important in GFDL citations, etc. <a href="../../../f/l/c/User%7EFlcelloguy_1bb8.html" title="User:Flcelloguy">Flcelloguy</a> | <small><a href="../../../f/l/c/User_talk%7EFlcelloguy_7b23.html" title="User talk:Flcelloguy">A <font color="brown">note?</font></a></small> | <a href="../../../f/l/c/User%7EFlcelloguy_Desk_89ed.html" title="User:Flcelloguy/Desk">Desk</a> 22:44, September 12, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For what seem to me transparently disruptive reasons, the rejected policy proposal <a href="../../../t/o/b/WP%7ETOBY_abd3.html" title="WP:TOBY">WP:TOBY</a> now has two forked talk pages. Although one claims to be a version of the other with images removed, this is in fact not the case; discussion has forked, with people replying on one page or the other.</p>
<p>This state of affairs is disruptive.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as far as I can tell, J. Random User like me can't fix it with a couple of page moves, because of the (perfectly reasonable) restrictions on page moves. (I actually haven't tried, for fear of breaking it worse.) So it needs administrative attention.</p>
<p>The current state of affairs is likely to lead to or worsen a dispute, since there currently is starting to be a bit of Bad Reverting Behavior on the proposal page itself, over whether the page is a {{proposal}} or a {{rejected}}. In order to resolve disputes we need to have a working talk page without anyone bozoing it up with "censorship".</p>
<p>The idea of a "censored talk page" is contrary to Wikipedia policy anyway.</p>
<p>So would some fair-minded administrator please move the "uncensored" page to <a href="../../../t/o/b/Wikipedia_talk%7EToby_c11d.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Toby">Wikipedia talk:Toby</a> and the "censored" one to something like Wikipedia talk:Toby/"Censored" Archive? Or something? Anything?</p>

<p>Hi, I've blocked this user from editing, and I am quite sure he is going to complain loudly. I believe I was very justified in making the block based on the user's continued and very clear history of SEO and linkspamming. It is clear his only intention is to get as many links to Omni Nerd as possible, in fact promotion is one of his roles at that site. Please read through <a href="../../../u/r/i/User%7EUriah923_ON_b465.html" title="User:Uriah923/ON">User:Uriah923/ON</a> (the bottom is pretty easy to start with and follow the user's contributions.

So, if someone doesn't like that I did the blocking, go ahead and unblock but only if you've reviewed the situation and are prepared to block him yourself. I also reverted the linkspam from those four edits, which in hindsight wasn't the best idea, so I'll fix that in a minute, but still remove the link. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 17:36, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To add a bit more, I was the one that unblocked this user when Dmcdevit blocked him for similar behaviour.

<dd>Don't worry Taxman, anyone familiar with the preceding events and discussions knows that Uriah was pretty much just a role account, and deserved to be blocked on that score anyway.

<dd>I just want to add a comment to express the consent from this non-admin's point of view that Uriah definitely needed to be banned. The promise on his talk page that the bans will get longer and longer until they are permanent must be carried out unless he spontaneously decides to edit Wikipedia for purposes of creating an encyclopedia rather than adding links. Uriah doesn't respect Wikipedia policies at all, so complaints from him or anyone else that Taxman was too "involved" with the situation to ban him are laughable or uninformed, and certainly disingenuous coming from Uriah. Taxman's "involvement" has been only that of an admin enforcing Wikipedia policies. We need quicker and swifter action like this against linkspammers. <a href="../../../j/d/a/User%7EJdavidb_f8c2.html" title="User:Jdavidb">Jdavidb</a> 20:55, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>After a subsequent 72 hour block by Happycamper, Uriah has agreed not to promote ON at all. In return I've agreed not to post to his talk page. But some of his recent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Uriah923" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Uriah923" rel="nofollow">contributions</a> look like they could be copyvio's also, but simply from better sources. Or it could just be more ON material. Anyone mind taking a look? In one case it just seems like too much added material from one source to not be a copyvio. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 17:50, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Who is the "taxman posse" he refers to on his talk page archive? Am I considered part of your "posse" because I signed the ON log?

<dd>Consider this scenario: A user inserts copyrighted material into a whole bunch of articles from various sources. Say, a paragraph or two, snug in an article somewhere.

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The reason why we have this situation here today, is because we have here a perfectly grey area, and an extremely messy beehive to tame. Notice how my posts to the user were constructed to reflect this. The fact that the semantics were not lost indicates that these vandals are extremely keen - and they are quite aware of it. It will be a tremendous mess to clean up, and I indeed consider this a form of vandalism that is exceptionally chronic and extremely malicious. I can see no reason for it other than to hurt Wikipedia, or for selfish promotion.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My suggestion? Lay low, don't do anything, and just observe. The first edit that crosses the line, we'll ban the user indefinitely. Then, most certainly due to the controversy of it, there will be copious discusson on the user's talk page. We can only do this, provided that we are prepared to devote time and energy to to explaining the block. Regardless of whether the user understands the ramifications, once we have explained Wikipedia's position, there is no need to further negotiate or listen to the non-compliant user. In this case, this user has had plenty of chances to do this, and I am inclined to feel that we should not prolong this situation any further by allowing compromises. Take a look at his talk page right now for example. Links to that site everywhere. Does that constitute enough of a violation for a ban? I'd be willing to bet you that they were posted deliberately to test the boundaries of permissible activities on Wikipedia. Their defense will be as follows: "You <i>dare</i> do this to me, you'd better do this to everyone else! Hah!". To counter this, essentially, we need to explain the interpretive difference between equity and equality, and how it has been applied specifically for this user.</dd>

<dd>Now, we don't need to do things the way I have outlined them here. It's only one of many alternatives I'm considering at the moment.

<dd>As I think he has removed all pretenses of good faith now, I blocked him for 2 more weeks for linking to ON on his user page. It becomes clearer each time that his only goal is to get links to that site, and he is just brainstorming different ways to try to get away with it. I didn't have time to confirm, but it looks like some of his recent contributions are copyvios too. I suggest we extend the block because he hasn't shown any desire to contribute according to our policies, but I'll leave that to someone else. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 12:30, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>That may be more on the edge. Generally I think we pretty much allow anyone to link to any websites they want from their user page, right?

<dd>As far as I'm concerned, we need to express the sentiment clearly that Wikipedia is not open to be used for promotional purposes. There are other venues for it - using the encyclopedia and its associated resources for this is simply not acceptable.</dd>

<dd>It is not a coincidence that <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkMcB_4180.html" title="User:MarkMcB">MarkMcB</a> edited on the 26th, during Uriah's block. What I think we should do is block these two users indefinitely, and place a template on their pages identifying them as using Wikipedia in an unacceptable manner. If they wish to talk about this further, they can always do so on their talk pages, or on the mailing list. However, the fact is that their contributions on Wikipedia were not intended to further Wikipedia - they were premeditative and intended for promotional purposes.</dd>

<dd>Finally, Wikipedia is not a babysitting service. It is exceptionally draining having to monitor a user's contributions for extended periods of time to ensure that they are in compliance. The amount of leniency shown has been more than adequate over this 3 month period, and I feel very comfortable in enforcing a ban here. --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> 00:51, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Do we already have such a template for users who have misused Wikipedia?

<dd>That's part of his pattern, but ok if you're willing to watch him closely enough. If you follow his contributions more closely it would have been obvious why I could no longer assume good faith with him. Not sure why you'd want to waste more of yours and other's time giving him yet another chance though. He is going to continue to find ways to exploit Wikipedia, and I still haven't had a chance to see if his recent contributions are copyvios like his previous ones have been. There is a difference in how long standing positive contributors should be treated vs repeat offenders. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 23:39, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First, I apologize if you feel I've wasted anyone's time. Really, I think this all could have been accomplished much more quickly if someone had been willing to have a decent and straightforward conversation with me instead of screaming 'spam!' and erasing everything. I was doing what I thought would be a win-win for WP and ON. In my mind, WP needed content that ON had and ON could use the links. However, it is now clear that ON articles aren't wanted, so I will (according to the agreement) not promote them.</p>
<p>Next, the recent edits I've made are from an established philosophy textbook. All of the information I added has been reworded to avoid copyright violations and I've included the book as a reference. As far as I know, that's how WP is supposed to grow. But, it wouldn't be the first time that I've done something that I thought was within policy and found out later it wasn't. If that is the case here, just drop me a note and I'm open to discussing it.</p>
<p>Lastly, two admins (Jmabel and Jdavidb) both are at least not opposed to me including links on my home page to articles that I've written. I have authored three articles that I'd like to include on my user page: <i>The Soy Switch</i>, <i>A Talk on Latter-Day Saints' View of Modern Day Revelation</i>, and <i>Cheap and Effective DIY Underground Sprinkler System Installation</i>. I also have oil paintings displayed in two different articles that I'd like to include: <i>Three Oil Paintings</i> and <i>Second Round of Oils</i>. I really don't think there should be a problem with this (as Jmabel said, hundreds if not thousands of users do this), but if it's going to cause another big raucous, then I'll refrain. <a href="../../../u/r/i/User%7EUriah923_8a36.html" title="User:Uriah923">Uriah923</a> 01:47, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I feel the problem is you have acted in such an irresponsible and actively unhelpful manner in promoting your site at all costs that you now give up the right to link to it. There were many straighforward conversations, you simply ignored all of them. You had many many chances to have let this end in a better way, but you chose again and again to waste everyone's time instead. As for contributions, if you take too much material that is not fact from a single text it is still a copyright violation.

<p>This is so lame that I hesitate to mention it. But here's a basic history. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAvengers_fan_40a1.html" title="User:Avengers fan">Avengers_fan</a> (<a href="../../../a/v/e/User_talk%7EAvengers_fan_7c86.html" title="User talk:Avengers fan">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Avengers_fan_afb4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Avengers fan">contribs</a>) created the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Avengers_e37e.html" title="New Avengers">New Avengers</a> article, which is based on a comic that is a continuation of the old <i>Avengers</i> book. I proposed that it be merged with <a href="../../../a/v/e/Avengers_%28comics%29.html" title="Avengers (comics)">Avengers (comics)</a>, and despite vocal opposition from him, the consensus was that the articles should be merged, and it was done. In the process, a large portion of the writing in New Avengers was removed, because it was already summarized in <a href="../../../a/v/e/Avengers_%28comics%29.html" title="Avengers (comics)">Avengers (comics)</a> in a paragraph or two which, as far as I'm concerned, retains all the essential information.</p>
<p>Now, <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAvengers_fan_40a1.html" title="User:Avengers fan">Avengers_fan</a> (<a href="../../../a/v/e/User_talk%7EAvengers_fan_7c86.html" title="User talk:Avengers fan">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Avengers_fan_afb4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Avengers fan">contribs</a>) is insisting on reinserting his expanded edits, even though I and another editor have broken down his edits and explained why they should be condensed, are redundant, etc. Tempers are fraying because of this, but there's no 3RR because the edits are being inserted and revered about one every 24-48 hours or so. My question is: how do we deal with this? And can someone else objective have a look at it and offer an opinion on this? The <a href="../../../a/v/e/Talk%7EAvengers_%28comics%29_9c81.html" title="Talk:Avengers (comics)">Talk:Avengers (comics)</a> page contains the arguments that have been going on. --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> (<a href="../../../k/h/a/User_talk%7EKhaosworks_e07b.html" title="User talk:Khaosworks">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Khaosworks_06d3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Khaosworks">contribs</a>) 00:35, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

However, despite disagreeing strongly with Gordon on his pet issue - <small>i.e. Terry Shiavo's guardian (her husband) should make decisions on her behalf and if the parents had any proof they should have brought it before the judge ruling on whether he could remain guardian instead of pulling all the political shenanigans etc</small> - his nomination deserved to run the normal time - and the comments on it (as well as ending it early) show that idealogy is an important deciding factor for some. Now I don't have time to know all the things he did - but <b>the early closure and protection speak volumes about some within wikipedia's desire to control debate</b>. I find it completely unwiki. <i>Back to editing anonymously-<a href="../../../a/b/e/User%7EAbeo_Paliurus_864b.html" title="User:Abeo Paliurus">Abeo</a> 20:48, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</i></p>

<dd>Agreed with Cesar and Tuf-Kat. Holding a nomination open, when the overwhelming majority votes to oppose, has no useful effect on the community, and only serves to spread poison and ill-will. I fully support early close of these affairs.

<dd>I know that ending the debate early is the standard - and I hadn't followed or voted because I assumed it would end quickly. However, he seems to want to hear the criticism - hopefully to be influenced by it. And doesn't seem to be phased by the vitriolic nature of some of it - a better man than me. If one purpose is to protect the nominee, and the nominee vehmenently opposes it, I see no reason to force it closed with a page protect - let it run its course - and let Gordon waste his time responding - I doubt many of those opposed would bother to read his stuff - then it will whimper out of existence. I see no logical reason for not letting him use the page to respond to the accusations, and ending it early just makes everything more suspect and supports the cabel accusations - when it is 4/100 it will be clear that there are not untapped masses waiting to support his adminship. And if socks gather - those will be easily discovered.</dd>

<dd>Well, it's pretty clear that continuing with a request for adminship is not going to succeed at this point. Hm. An RfC seems to be the proper forum for general criticism—perhaps an informal one similar to the one <a href="../../../b/m/i/User%7EBmicomp_RfC_a660.html" title="User:Bmicomp/RfC">Bmicomp has set up</a>? I don't know. But it has ceased to be a viable request for adminship, and if Gordon just wants a community forum for criticism, he can set one up somewhere else.

<dd>J.O.K.E. I'm pretty sure whoever wrote the gosple of of john never edited wikipedia. Dto Thomas Paine (Ths is wikipedia. You have no "rights"). The people who make the descission that a vote should end eary (basicaly buracrats and admins) belong to a group large enough to make sure that anyone who they don't want as admin doesn't become one (well unless jimbo or the comitte intervens). Your RF was going to fail (at an absolute minium you would have needed 68 support votes). Complaints about it being removed atchive nothing other than provideing cover for someone who really did want to abbuse the system by removeing one (and for that the cabul thanks you). Your Editcountitis bit is odd since your data shows that people with far less edits than rejected candidates can get through (to mess up your claim even further I had only 1200 edits). The raw number of admins thing ignores the role that non admins can play in looking after pages. FWIW Jimbo can pretty much do what he likes.

<dd>Unless this has been fixed very recently (say the last month), then it is a quirk of blocking that the <i>shortest</i> block takes precedence.

<dd>As far as new user patrol is concerned, any accounts that are not supposed to be used (whether created by impostors or to prevent impostors) should be blocked so that they don't show up as suspicious accounts on anyone's radar. Better yet, don't create any doppelganger accounts: it's unlikely that you'll cover all the bases (with Unicode, there are just way too many options), and it just creates more work for everyone.

<dd>There are 12,000 images in one of those cats and uncounted many thousands in the other. Giving out messages is wildly unfeasible. As it is we have to check the images history to see that it was tagge &gt;7days ago and then remove it from the article and then delete it, and give a delete summary for why.

If we can achieve the goal (eliminate unsourced images) without alienating more users, I think it's worth a little inconvenience on our part in the interim. We may even be able to create lists sorted by user, showing the date of the user's last contribution.

<p>I don't think users should necessarily be notified, but these images should be deleted manually, I've already found and tagged a number of PD images (and reuploaded 1 that was deleted).

<dd>Good idea. Two suggested tweaks: 1) bot checks uploaders contribs - if user hasn't edited in a long time, there's no point in warning them, and deletion can proceed immediately. 2) it's probably better for the bot to generate an "images to be deleted today" list (perhaps divvied up into handy blocks, so labour can be efficiently divided), as people might be squeamish about such an extensive deletion bot. -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinlay_McWalter_466b.html" title="User:Finlay McWalter">Finlay McWalter</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/n/User_talk%7EFinlay_McWalter_a93f.html" title="User talk:Finlay McWalter">Talk</a> 10:51, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The deletions should not be done by a bot. Firstly, the images have to removed from articles, and I wonder if we have bot that is capable of searching the code reliably for a particular image and removing it without causing carnage. Secondly, just occasionally, there is some sort of info in/around the image that <i>does</i> indicate its license status (or likely status) and we wouldn't want to discard those. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 14:21, 20 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I posted sample lists, linked from the above-mentioned Village Pump page. I also agree that user notification (but not irreversable image deletion) would be a good job for a bot. The upload form could also be better designed to prevent this sort of problem. Really, the thing to ask most people is whether or not they 1.) took the picture or made the drawing themselves, 2.) downloaded it from the web, or 3.) got it from an offline source. If 1, then we can presume GFDL based on a click-through license, unless they specify something different. If 2, we can ask for the URL, and then someone can find the copyright holder's original license, or at least e-mail their webmaster. If 3, we can ask for the name of the copyright holder, and whether or not the uploader has personal knowledge that the copyright holder has declared that the image may be used by anyone, for any purpose, without fee or restriction. I really don't think just tagging an image "CC" or "PD" or "GFDL" really gives enough information, especially if there's a dispute. I think due diligence would include at least trying to gather some evidence that the claimed license is correct, or having some way to verify that. There's absolutely no guarantee that the uploader will be around a month or a year or even a day from now to answer questions. -- <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBeland_b814.html" title="User:Beland">Beland</a> 05:15, 21 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>To notify folks about this, how about if rather than a talk page message we include a note in one of the "trim" messages displayed with a user's watchlist (e.g. MediaWiki:Watchlistsub) or something similar to the "please donate" messages? Something like "NOTICE: Any images that do not have verifiable source and copyright information will be deleted on &lt;date&gt;. Please make sure this information is provided for any images you've uploaded. See &lt;somewhere&gt; for details about this." Where &lt;date&gt; is perhaps <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_1.html" title="October 1">October 1</a> and &lt;somewhere&gt; is a page including at least a link to the upload log for the user.

<p>If we only do a blanket watchlist notification, I'm sure a lot of people won't get it. <i>I</i> certainly wouldn't - my watchlist is too large to check regularly. I'm sure many people who are unaware of proper procedure for image uploading don't regularly use their watchlists, either. Putting a message on the user talk page also has the benefit that you get the message even if you are doing casual reading and not intending on editing. The blanket notification is perhaps useful in the near term, but unidentified image deletion will be an ongoing issue, so I think a bot would still be useful. Having one would allow admins who want to clean these categories to just delete images that have been sitting there the requisite length of time without comment, knowing the uploader has been duly notified without having to check. -- <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBeland_b814.html" title="User:Beland">Beland</a> 03:29, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, actually, all the bot would need to do is use the "What links here" and remove the image appropriately off the page. Such a bot can be programmed reasonably using the Python Wikipedia Framework, although it's a fair daunting piece of code work that would need to be done for it to do so properly. I whole hardly agree on the fact that the bot should not be deleting the image, but I think a proper solution is for the bot to post the list of images, what pages it is being used on, confirm the notification to the user, and indication of when it can be deleted assuming no response at a certain page. I am also in agreement here with Beland on the implementation of the bot, as there are several unresolved issues that need to be addressed before the bot can be properly programmed.</dd>
<dd>Although... I do have a thought for two separate scripts:
<ol>
<li>A script for the assistance of notification of unverified or unfree images</li>
<li>A script that removes the image from all linked pages where it is being used and generates a link for the deletion of the image.</li>
</ol>

<p>I wasn't going to bring this up here (or anywhere), but it might be worth forewarning people. I corrected some edits made by <a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnittas_0872.html" title="User:Anittas">Anittas</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/i/User_talk%7EAnittas_d652.html" title="User talk:Anittas">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Anittas_6f15.html" title="Special:Contributions/Anittas">contribs</a>), and copy-edited an article that (it turned out) he though that he owned (<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Vaslui_4a27.html" title="Battle of Vaslui">Battle of Vaslui</a>). He reacted extremely aggressively and insultingly (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAnittas&amp;diff=23306543&amp;oldid=23303126" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAnittas&amp;diff=23306543&amp;oldid=23303126" rel="nofollow">[76]</a>), and reverted my edits wholesale(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Vaslui&amp;diff=23380997&amp;oldid=23364581" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Vaslui&amp;diff=23380997&amp;oldid=23364581" rel="nofollow">[77]</a>). So far, so depressingly familiar. He's also gone on to try to enlist other editors and admins against my appalling behaviour in editing his articles (e.g., <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ATaniwha&amp;diff=23653965&amp;oldid=23541096" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ATaniwha&amp;diff=23653965&amp;oldid=23541096" rel="nofollow">[78]</a>),with little success, and then went in for a bit of stalking, leaving messages full of hysterical vitriol against me for editors with whom I was in disagreement (e.g., <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABryan_Adams&amp;diff=23688453&amp;oldid=23666519" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABryan_Adams&amp;diff=23688453&amp;oldid=23666519" rel="nofollow">[79]</a>, etc. He's been trawling through edit histories, trying to find anyone with whom I've been in disagreement (mostly banned vandals such as <a href="../../../e/n/v/User%7EEnviroknot_8620.html" title="User:Enviroknot">Enviroknot</a> (<a href="../../../e/n/v/User_talk%7EEnviroknot_7918.html" title="User talk:Enviroknot">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Enviroknot_53a7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Enviroknot">contribs</a>) and his sockpuppets), and leaving messages on their Talk pages trying to enlist their help against me. A number of editors have tried to reason with him, but to no avail. At the moment he's just a nuisance, even mildly amusing, but it might escalate, so I'm explaining here in advance. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 21:07, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Of course, he never actually got a 6 months block since it collided with a 1 week block and our quirky software is such that shorter blocks always win. I agree with the others here though.

<dd>I saw you reblocked for 24 months.. I think that's better than indefinite. At least it'll expire at some point.

<p>I'm beginning to question the wisdom of the 15 minute limit on blocks to AOL IP addresses. I don't know if this has already been discussed, but the lack of effective blocking on AOL IPs in general makes AOL vandals pretty much untouchable from an admin perspective. I'm also concerned that this limit may not be totally necessary. The idea, of course, is that AOL-dialup users can change IP addresses on every page load. However, the growing class of AOL-DSL users should presumably be the same as any other broadband users, and probably retain the same IP address until they manually renew it. Can we isolate out the block ranges for dialup users, and just list those on <a href="../../../b/l/o/Special%7EBlockip_59cc.html" title="Special:Blockip">Special:Blockip</a> rather than extending the block protection to <i>all</i> AOL users?

<dd>My understanding is that while individual AOL users may retain the same local IP address for their entire session (for DSL users, that may well be days or weeks) all of the AOL connections are passed through a limited number of proxy servers. It is the IP address of those proxies that we see on Wikipedia. Two problems seem to arise.
<ol>
<li>A large number of AOL users will pass through a particular proxy, making collateral damage due to AOL IP blocks severe.</li>
<li>In some cases, AOL will route a particular user through several different proxies on successive edits, making an IP block even less effective.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Correct me if I am mistaken in my understanding of AOL's network architecture.... :I'd love to be able to block certain IP ranges from anonymous editing; that would solve both problems. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 14:03, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This may not be popular, but what I'd like to see is a block of all the AOL proxies with instructions on how to disable proxies in your browser. For the few people still using the AOL branded browser which allegedly forces you to use the proxies, either find some technical fix or educate them on how to use a different browser. It might deviate a little from the basic anyone anywhere anytime can edit, but it would at least force vandals to redial/re-dhcp/repptp/whatever and put a serious dent in AOL's unblockability. If they have any sensible IP assignment structure it might even be possible to block certain vandals by area, at least for the DSL customers, meaning they really have to find a different ISP or open proxy to continue vandalising. --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 14:14, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No. I've every sympathy with the sentiment that we should remove personal info from article where that information isn't generally in the public domain (or where it's published in some very minor venue, such as a chatroom or non-notable blog). But where such information is in general circulation (which is really another way of saying that it's verifiable) we should include it. This was the test we applied to the name of Kobe Bryant's accuser. It's a policy consistent with our mission to collect published information (rather than publishing new facts). I <i>don't</i> think an actor's real name is merely trivial - we publish the real names of <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cary_Grant_b5ee.html" title="Cary Grant">Cary Grant</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_Hudson_18bb.html" title="Rock Hudson">Rock Hudson</a>, and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marilyn_Monroe_4162.html" title="Marilyn Monroe">Marilyn Monroe</a>, for example. On looking at our pornstar cats, we publish the real names of <a href="../../../t/e/r/Tera_Patrick_b0a7.html" title="Tera Patrick">Tera Patrick</a>, <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silvia_Saint_dc2b.html" title="Silvia Saint">Silvia Saint</a>, and <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linda_Lovelace_f18d.html" title="Linda Lovelace">Linda Lovelace</a>. These are all generally well known (although there are spelling variances on Saint's real name). IMDb publishes them all, as do plenty of other sources. I think the real name of a person notable enough to have a wikipedia article is itself a notable fact (generally their address and where they work now and stuff like that clearly isn't). This test (the test of verifyiability) wouldn't have prevented us from removing the material from Jordan Capri et al (as they weren't from reliable sources). JIP's test (if taken literally, as some would be wont to do) would result in our removing perfectly encyclopedic information that's widely available from respectable sources. -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinlay_McWalter_466b.html" title="User:Finlay McWalter">Finlay McWalter</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/n/User_talk%7EFinlay_McWalter_a93f.html" title="User talk:Finlay McWalter">Talk</a> 16:31, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agree with Finlay. An encyclopedia shouldn't be trying to reveal well-kept secrets (e.g. Jordan's real name), but it also shouldn't hide from information that is already well-established in the public sphere.

<dd>To clarify my point, I'm certainly <i>not</i> in favour of publishing stuff like actresses' addresses or present occupations. That's a general policy we seem to have arrived at by (mostly unspoken) consensus over the years - we don't publish the same details about politicians, actors, movie stars, sportsmen, or anyone else. There's a few exceptions to that, where the information is itself notable - our article on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dakota_05cc.html" title="The Dakota">The Dakota</a> being such an example. I'm really saying that porn performers aren't a special case, and the same criteria for inclusion and exclusion should apply to them as to everyone else. -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinlay_McWalter_466b.html" title="User:Finlay McWalter">Finlay McWalter</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/n/User_talk%7EFinlay_McWalter_a93f.html" title="User talk:Finlay McWalter">Talk</a> 16:51, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To clarify my point, I am only suggesting removal of real names of those porn stars who haven't revealed it themselves. If <b>we</b> are the primary source of a porn star's real name, it must be deleted. But if another notable online source has already revealed it, it's not so important. I too have looked at Jordan Capri's personal blog. She blatantly admits to having been a famous porn star. However, as far as I have seen, her blog never mentions either her real name or her porn pseudonym. What I disagree with her in, is the "amateur" status. She had a full-time contract with a porn studio, and was earning more on a single photoshoot than I earn in a year. That makes her a professional, like it or not. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP">— <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 17:41, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>JiP's right. There's absolutely no way we should publish someone's real name if it's not available elsewhere. That would be a breach of the policy on original research and would make Wikipedia a primary source, which is something I hope we can all agree should be avoided. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 00:18, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Anybody think it would be appropriate to contact the girls in question and let them know what happened?

<dd>I thought of doing so by adding a comment on Jordan Capri's blog, but then I found out it required joining some sort of community and couldn't be bothered.

<dd>Why does it matter that it is non-Wikimedia? It just means that they are mirroring our content. And considering that it is also MediaWiki and GFDL, it is just a mirror site with more documentation and compliance than most. You object to listing it on the TL? That's not a big deal at all, though I don't really mind. I also have a hard time believing Uncle G has attacked anyone, so what is that supposed to mean? 134.10.44.224 08:06, 24 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>So why do we care? If I copy an article to another wiki, I should let the world know about it at Wikipedia:Transwiki log/Articles moved from here?

<dl>
<dd>(That anon was me, btw). I have to admit this is the first time I've ever seen the <i>transwiki log</i> referred to as a privilege. Take a look at some of the horribly unencyclopedic articles that have languished there for months. The transwiki log exists for two purposes. To aid in the transparency of the traanswiki process, which is good ofr GFDL compliance as well. And to (in my dreams) serve as a place where such unencyclopedic articles that needed transwiki could be combed through and deleted/merged/fixed somehow. Neither of those are concerns that are only for Wikimedia projects, as they both apply to that wiki as well. Try to do some cleanup at the TL and you'll see that it isn't a privilege. Again, I simply don't see why it would even matter. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 00:12, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Because nothing has yet been transwikied to other non-Wikimedia properties. If you can find another GFDL wiki, feel free to start suggesting appropriate things be sent there.

<dd>(after edit conflict) Why should another GFDL wiki be seen as a competitor? Seems to me that we would inherently be friends with any other source of GFDL content.

<dd>I'd say to be considered friends in this sense wikis should not only be GFDL but also once they reached a nontrivial size they should provide bulk content dumps.

<p>Just to make my concerns clear: I have no problem with people copying GFDL content from Wikipedia to any other GFDL site in the world. My objections are to the use of the term "transwiki", which implies an official relationship, and the setup of an official page to indicate the copies. Just do it and don't mention it, why should anybody care? <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 04:24, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well since "transwiki" seems literally to mean just moved from one wiki to another, I've never assummed the word was limited to just Wikimedia wikis. Is there some reason for thinking the word does imply an official or priviledged relationship, cause I've never read it that way. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 04:34, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Come on. Did you read what I wrote above? I gave two good reasons. There is no implication of officiality. Indeed, I am highly suspicious that only I and two or three other editors ever look at the TL. And I don't see why this is even on the AN in the first place. It should have been brought up on the TL talk page, on individual editors' talk pages, or even the village pump or something. Bu it hasn't got a thing to do with administrators, and is not really important at all anyway. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 07:35, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The copyvio'ed material must be removed, which you did. Since he was edit warring to put it back, coming to us was the right thing to do. Based on his statements, and an assumption of good faith, I am going to assume he thought using that material was okay, but it clearly does not look that way. If he continues to readd it without some substantive proof that it is some how free content, then he should be blocked for a reasonable amount of time. If after that he still doesn't get the point, well Jimbo considers intentionally violating the copyrights of others to be grounds for a permanent ban, so admins have quite a lot of discretion in dealing with an issue such as this. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 14:49, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Wiglaf. When one of the Skulds is clearly more notable than the other, perhaps you can just provide a short disambig sentence on top of the article, like at <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barak.html" title="Barak">Barak</a>. If there are several disambig articles for the same subject, it's much better to just create a seperate disambiguationarticle, like at <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Doe_9973.html" title="John Doe">John Doe</a> (which provides a link to <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Doe_%28disambiguation%29_eba4.html" title="John Doe (disambiguation)">John Doe (disambiguation)</a>). --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 16:56, 26 September 2005 (UTC) <small>forgot to sign</small>

<p>Hi, I very, very foolishly got involved in a content dispute with Jack Sarfatti (the person) about his <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Sarfatti_a43b.html" title="Jack Sarfatti">wikibiography</a>, and this "dispute" has gotten waaaaay too crazy for me (legal threats, veiled death threats, mailbombing). So I cave.

I left a message on his <a href="../../../f/l/c/User_talk%7EFlcelloguy_7b23.html#Jack_Sarfatti_2" title="User talk:Flcelloguy">talk page</a> asking him to unlock the article so JS can change it back to whatever he pleases, but so far no response. Can someone please unlock the article? If that would violate the page protection policy, can someone at least revert the article back to Jack Sarfatti's latest version? I just want Sarfatti to stop bullying me, but he clearly won't do that until the biography is changed back to some version he approves of. Can someone help get him off my back?

<dd>Well, can someone please revert the entire article to his 'approved version'? Sorry, you'll have to search through the messy history or the messy talk page to find that. I don't want to touch it. Can some admin then <i>temporarily</i> lock the article to Jack's approved version? He seems to blame me for everything no going his way, plus some weird hate mail he claims to be getting (needless to say I have nothing to do with that, if he is indeed getting nasty emails and not just making that part up), so I am concerned some other user will revert the page to some version he doesn't like and he will blame me and keep harrassing me. I just want him to stop bullying me.---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> <a href="../../../h/i/l/User_talk%7EHillman_8f8b.html" title="User talk:Hillman">(talk)</a> 21:39, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Perhaps this is a matter to be taken to Jimbo or the foundation's lawyers; someone harassing an editor off-site so much that he wants it put back to a non-consensus version? --<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolbez_ce9f.html" title="User:Golbez">Golbez</a> 21:47, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, exactly, he is way too scary for me (death threats, lawsuits). That is why I am asking am admin to revert to Jacks' 'approved version' (sic) and to <i>lock it</i> at least until he is convinced that I have indeed caved and stops harrassing me (and all those people he has apparently been mailbombing). He is way too scary for me.---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> <a href="../../../h/i/l/User_talk%7EHillman_8f8b.html" title="User talk:Hillman">(talk)</a> 22:08, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi, Tony and Nickptar, you both misunderstood the off-wiki harrassment, but never mind. Tony, thanks for making the factual corrections Sarfatti had demanded (you probably <i>do</i> understand why <i>I</i> don't want to edit teh article any more!). And Flcelloguy, thanks for unprotecting the article. I'll report back if I think I need help with anything else, but at least for now, AFAIK this episode has blown over, sheesh.

<p>This valid stub seems to have had a load of tinfoilhat stuff added to it - and then what appears to be a request from a lawyer demanding deletion, stating that the garbage was added from a IP in his client's office and his cliant has been getting legal threats. I've reverted to the stub - and suspect the letter may be bogus, but perhaps others should check it out.

<dd>Yeah, I don't think that is a question for us to address. Even if we assume the situation is what it claims to be: i.e. an anon editor is being threatened with libel for statements he wrote in Wikipedia and now wants those statements expunged, then I don't think the answer of what to do is obvious. On the one hand, I doubt we really need that rant and removing it from the history may help the guy out. On the other hand, it is an ugly precedent (allowing people to withdraw their contribution is certainly not okay in general) and we might even be regarded as complicit in trying to hide evidence from the agrieved party. Since, we do not seem to be under any present legal obligation to act in this situation, I would suggest we do nothing except direct them to contact the Wikimedia Foundation. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 17:51, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
