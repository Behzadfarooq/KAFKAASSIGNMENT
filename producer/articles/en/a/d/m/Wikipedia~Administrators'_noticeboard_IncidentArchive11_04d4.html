<dd>Extreme cases make bad law. People <b>can</b> be blocked for personal attacks. The ArbComm can do it; Jimbo can do it. It cannot be done by a regular administrator. This is another example where it is a problem that the ArbComm acts only through a slow-moving, super-cumbersome judicial process. I can't really fault the admin for wanting to get rid of this guy, but it chips away again at the policies and consensus we have set up. There should be a relatively fast way to establish community consensus that someone is a troll or a serious behaviour problem and have him removed from the community quickly. At least temporarily while the more slow moving processes confirm the decision. Otherwise, admins will take it onto themselves to make up policy as they go along; so that they can get rid of people they think are "obviously" objectionable. Sometimes, as in this case, it will be obvious, and there will be no disagreement in the end, and in other cases it will only be obvious to the admin concerned. Sometimes it will just be impatience and hot temper, and sometimes the admin will be correctly predicting the consensus (or at least Jimbo's eventual opinion). But that isn't how it should be. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 12:57, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree that this block was contrary to policy: it was a personal threat to Violetriga, for which the user can be blocked indefinitely under the <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html#Personal_attacks_which_place_users_in_danger" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">blocking policy</a>, since we have no way of knowing whether the threat was a joke or not. — <a href="../../../r/d/s/User%7ERdsmith4_389f.html" title="User:Rdsmith4">Dan</a> | <a href="../../../r/d/s/User_talk%7ERdsmith4_959f.html" title="User talk:Rdsmith4">Talk</a> 13:04, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>the comment was obnoxious, no doubt. It would get anybody in an American workplace instantly fired for sexual harassment. Or if it didn't, some company would be getting sued. On my web site, where I am the God-King, I would just ban this person for this since it would be an obvious violation of the Terms of Use of my site. But it is really stretching the point to see this comment as physically "threatening". For one thing it is an exchange between two anonymous handles on an Internet site. Wikipedia's current structure is that this kind of case has to be dealt with by Jimbo or the ArbComm. If that is a problem, and I agree it is, we should fix that problem. Meanwhile, lets not just make shit up so that admins can whack people that they want to whack, popular as that might be in some cases. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 14:29, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>agree with BM, not a threat, that's really stretching it. rather an illustration of why we do need a policy to block such jerks, along the lines "admins may issue short blocks for repeated, extremely unambiguous attacks or insults". Hey, there is no community consensus for <i>not</i> blocking these idiots, look at it this way. There is, rather, a decided majority in favour of it. In general, "no consensus" should default to "don't block", but I argue that there are cases where "no consensus" definitely defaults to "block"!. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 14:36, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>
<dd>hey, and BM, <i>we</i> (WPians, including you) make up policy as we go along, that's the idea! And sometimes we do trade some justice for manageability.

<dd>While rules and policies are important to any community, especially one with as many disputes as Wikipedia. I don't think we should be hamstrung by them. If we know someone is a troll and is making extreme personal attacks, why should we <i>not</i> block the person for a short time? Because of some policy? I think <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">Wikipedia:No personal attacks</a> is deliberately ambiguous (<i>may</i> be blocked) to allow admins the descretion of blocking someone for personal attacks. Quoting rules and regulations as <s>an excuse</s> a reason not to block someone that we (from common sense) know should be blocked is one of the reasons why <a href="../../../i/n/s/Instruction_creep.html" title="Instruction creep">instruction creep</a> is a bane. As long as the ban isn't long term (ie, greater than 24 hours), and is performed by a third party, I think it should be fine. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 15:38, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, I'm saying (and when I read my comments above, I can see how things aren't clear at all) that there are some things that don't need policy. I agree that once a policy is set, we should follow it. But there are some things where following common sense or discretion is better than turning to a policy and following chapter 2.4, section 3a, paragraph 5. That a clever and smart troll can turn up and possibly inflict a lot of damage while we argue over which policy applies to the individual's actions is, quite frankly, a little frightening. I have pretty thick skin, but there are some good editors who may leave over the actions of such trolls. That's why I'm glad that <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">Wikipedia:No personal attacks</a> is deliberately vague to show that in some cases, users engaging in such activities <i>may</i> be banned. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 18:32, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A skilled troll can do a lot more damage when a system is based on subjective judgement and "common sense". Yes there are times to turn vigilantly but it is important to know when these times are. I my opinion this was not such a case since the problem was limited to a small area. Such cases can and should be dealt with through normal means (RFC mediation arbcom).<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 20:06, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Which is why, IMO, some things are policy, and some things are not. Speaking hypothetically, if I were subject to a personal attack, and there were more to come, I'd prefer that the attacking user be blocked for 24 hours until the problem has been addressed. 24 hours seems to be a "tempban" anyway. I don't see how a skilled troll can do more damage in my example than if several admins had to go look up a policy and debate its merits and applicability while the user continutes to make personal attacks against me. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 20:11, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So what's wrong with an admin using discretion to temp-block the personal attacker for 24 hours, especially because doing so doesn't violate any policies? <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">Wikipedia:No personal attacks</a> allows for admin's discretion in such cases, and if other admins disagree, they can unblock the user anyway (although there is a danger of getting into block-wars in this case). Most admin blocks for personal attacks that I've seen have been responsibly done because if the target is an admin, they'll post a request for some other admin to do the block. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 21:31, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It saddens me greatly that some people believe that any user should be able to get away with making such strong personal attacks. We are a group of people trying to add content to an encyclopedia, not looking to have to defend ourselves against little kids with no sense of how to communicate with people. He should be banned, and even if it's not along with current policy then I think most people would agree that this troll isn't worthy of being let off. Virtually all the edits have been part of a revert war, and I think there can be little doubt that he also abused users and broke the 3RR under IP 64.6.186.242. Thanks to <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_73_2ea7.html" title="User:Chris 73">Chris 73</a> for blocking him, and I think that some people need to stop thinking that policy is a hard and fast set of rules that must be followed 100%. <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 18:26, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Perfectly good editors can argue back and forth about which policy applies to what situation.

<dd>Blocked user:68.61.150.80 for 24 hours. Cumbey did not violate the 3RR, unless she is also the anon IP adress, which is likely since she did the same reverts. SqueakBox also had 4 reverts, which do not look like simple vandalism to me, but then I am not familiar with the topic. I would support a block of <s>both</s> Cumbey <s>and SqueakBox</s>, but would like to hear a second opinion first, or alternatively have another admin block them. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_73_2ea7.html" title="User:Chris 73">Chris 73</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChris_73_0282.html" title="User talk:Chris 73">Talk</a> 11:25, Mar 11, 2005 (UTC)

<p>Cumbey reverted to a version riddled with inaccuracies. This is not a straightforward edit war. Cumbey is a multiple IP address user inserting a POV thesis on Solana being the Beast in deliberate violation of wiki policy. Her version is full of inaccuracies such as that a Ferdinand González was a Spanish President; it is <a href="../../../f/e/l/Felipe_Gonz%C3%A1lez_f58f.html" title="Felipe González">Felipe González</a>. She claims the EU have a vote on the UN security council. I wish, but it is not so. She also deliberately misplaced the section on the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barcelona_Conference_4e5b.html" title="Barcelona Conference">Barcelona Conference</a>, making it appear Solana initiated this as EU foreign minister. All this had already been discussed on the talk page, where she only engages in insulting me. She vandalised my home page yesterday. See <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_User%7ECumbey_aa5d.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/User:Cumbey">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/User:Cumbey</a>. I was merely ensuring the article was not vandalsied, as was RickK. User:Cumbey is not acting in good faith, she is acting in bad faith, deliberately trashing wikipedia policy to prove he is the beast, with all it's anti-EU rants. The America contributors would not tolerate this being done to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Condoleezza_Rice_57ca.html" title="Condoleezza Rice">Condoleezza Rice</a>. I would prefer to be formally told I was wrong, but I did act in good faith. If I did something wrong I apologize. It was the middle of the night (something here woke me), and I could not ask for help, I just wanted to go back to bed. This is her <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:SqueakBox&amp;oldid=10989038" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:SqueakBox&amp;oldid=10989038" rel="nofollow">contribution</a> to my home page.--<a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 16:13, Mar 11, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>If you block me for 24 hours I can live with it (just go and work on Spanish wiki), and recognise I need a break from this. I am even dreaming about it. But I ask people not to impose a longer block on me, and not to block me while unblocking User:Cumbey. I am convinced when she is unblocked she will return to her everts. I don't feel I should be blocked for trying to stop her machinations, even if I went too far by reverting 4 times. As I say, I apologise for any wrong doing. I am unhappy at her insulting my good edits to this article, and then removing them without explanation, starting an edit war. --<a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 20:50, Mar 11, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Comment: User:68.61.150.80 and Cumbey appear to be the same person - User:68.61.150.80 signed edit summaries "CEC" (=Constance E. Cumbey). In defense of SqueakBox, this appears to be a long-running dispute in which Cumbey is guilty of POV-pushing, Original Research and Personal attacks (e.g., <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Javier_Solana#Cumbey" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Javier_Solana#Cumbey" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>). It's hard to see just by comparing the diff's - the two versions are very different, but based on the (extensive) Talk pages, it would appear that Cumbey admits to trying to link Solana with the anti-christ and to the New Age movement by including his mother's links to <a href="../../../r/a/j/Rajneesh.html" title="Rajneesh">Rajneesh</a>. Cumbey appears to be protecting an earlier version of the page, and keeps reverting it to that (compare the Feb 20 and March 10 versions <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Javier_Solana&amp;diff=11011797&amp;oldid=10847663" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Javier_Solana&amp;diff=11011797&amp;oldid=10847663" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>). Cumbey's version appears to be trying to connect Solana with the rise of the anti-christ re-uniting the Roman empire, etc. SqueakBox was a little overzealous in fighting extremist POVs, but appears to be acting in good faith in defense of accuracy and NPOV, and I would argue against a block. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 18:45, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>User:SqueakBox, after reasearch, admits he was wrong. He should have posted something here or just left it in the hands of others. If he is blocked for 24 hours he will accept it gracefully. He will not in any case break the 3RR rule again. he recognises that is not the way to do things here, that technically Cumbey was not vandalising the Solana article (only his home page), and that he must follow wikipedia procedure if he is to prevent Cumbey's thesis from infecting the Solana article. --<a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 18:53, Mar 11, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>From my point of view, as a non-administrator but with 12 months editing experience at Wikipedia under my belt, that the <a href="../../../j/a/v/Javier_Solana_a15f.html" title="Javier Solana">Javier Solana</a> article is being continually vandalised by User:Cumbey and maybe others. User:Squeakbox may have made a few mistakes but he has acted graciously and in good faith throughout this process. Please examine his detailed work in tracking and reporting this problem. Like many users who are subject to hostility by vandals, User:Squeakbox is getting very frustrated and may give up on Wikipedia if this problem is not solved. Like me, he cannot solve this problem and must rely upon the Wikipedia hierarchy to act. I implore anyone who has responsibility in this area to act to prevent this blatant vandalism. If someone does a detailed check of User:Cumbey's and User:Squeakbox's editing you will discover for yourselves the vandalism that is occurring and the efforts of User:Squeakbox in repairing this damage. --<a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Salient_Oversight_dc71.html" title="User:One Salient Oversight">One Salient Oversight</a> 21:26, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

The largest quantity of vandalism consists of replacement of prominent articles with obscenities, namecalling, or other wholly irrelevant content.</i> I think that is what is going on here. Cumbey may think she's doing the right thing, but she is refusing to compromise, refusing to listen to others and treating the Solana page as her own private article.

<dd>Reply to User 'Squeakbox': Global Elite Wiki employs the Wiki process but is a separate board. In addition to being so extremely controlling and insulting to me on this board, he has gone over there with vandalism to the article. I am concerned about his apparently megalomanic view that he is entitled to globally control all information reaching the public on Javier Solana, including the right to eliminate the references Wikipedia instructs its authors to use 'so others may check the accuracy of their work.' He eliminted those footnotes and instead placed footnotes, EVEN ON THE GLOBAL ELITE BOARD to his various slanders. If this is Wikipedia's editorial preference, so be it, but it will eliminate credibility as a scholarly encyclopedia as to Wikipedia. Question for Squeakbox: Why don't you apply for a job at Google and Yahoo in their search engine department so you can really do a hatchet job on the available Javier Solana information?! <a href="../../../c/u/m/User%7ECumbey_f99f.html" title="User:Cumbey">Cumbey</a> 20:20, 12 Mar 2005</dd>

<p>SqueakBox has not attacked Cumbey at wikielite. he doesn't want her tagging her version there as being from wikipedia when it is her POV version. She on the other hand left this</p>

<dd>BEWARE OF USER SQUEAKBOX'</dd>
<dd>The person making changes and reversions demanding that Wikipedia post only his own vandalized version of the Javier Solana information is a New Ager. He is complete with Alice Bailey, 'Core Process Therapy,' Rastafarianism, and astrology. He is a historical revisionist and an internet megalomaniac who resorts to threats and bullyings on the Wikipedia Board. He utterly ruined the article on Wikipedia and frankly I lack the stamina to keep up with him there, but he clearly does not belong on Wiki Elite board. He claimed he could get away with his vandalism there because of his claimed friendship with "Jimbo" and other board regulars. Knowing Europeans rebutted him and he also erased their work. I am going to seek his permanent banning from Wiki Elite! His agenda is to kill truthful information, not to foster it.

<p>Probable sockpuppets of Willy on Wheels have been trying a new method of vandalism, since we've made it harder to perform page-move vandalism without using up old accounts. The MO is to create redirects to (for example) [[de:en:Image:Autofellatio.jpg]]. Using the multiple language prefixes causes redirection to occur in a way that makes using the normal user interface to undo the damage impossible. The changes can be backed off using URL-mangling to create appropriate editing commands, but this assumes a high level of admin skill, and is slower than just using the normal Web user interface -- which is surely WoW's intent. This probably requires developer involvement to make this kind of to-and-fro redirection impossible. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Interwiki redirection is used on the images on the main page, for example. This kind of vandalism can be dealt with by clicking the history links in the user contributions, not the article links. From there you can perform page operations as usual. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilsor_f92e.html" title="User:Silsor">silsor</a> 14:21, Mar 12, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

This kind of redirect IMHO should not work - they are too difficult to edit (only via the user edit history), nor do they show in any "what links here" list. Who knows how many of redirects to the Autofellatio image are still hidden in the database now, not found after cleaning up the vandalism runs? It's impossible to tell without searching in a database dump, or by SQL commands. Do we really use <i>this</i> kind of redirects on the main page? <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 17:01, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Rick, I really wish you didn't take such a ham-handed approach to blocking people. 198 and I were discussing the situation on the talk page. A dialogue was taking place and I feel that we were moving towards an understanding about the drawing. 198 agreed not to violate the three revert rule in his last edit before you blocked him. You chose to ignore that remark and instead base your block on an earlier statement on his talk page. Your block is not supported by policy. We have enough of a problem with crazy POV warriors accusing people of vandalism. You of all people should know better. You know that his edit wasn't vandalism, and you know that you chose to ignore the ongoing discussion on the talk page. I have unblocked 198. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 07:19, Mar 15, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I try to keep an open mind. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 07:23, Mar 15, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Rick, I also think you are going too far here. Saying "I don't care about the 3RR" in anger is not disruption. actually breaking the 3RR will get you blocked for a day of course, but only <i>after</i> you do it. This is an unresolved content dispute, with <i>both</i> sides reverting (you can't do a revert-war all on your own), and taking sides is not appropriate. In the view of 198, adding sexually explicit iamges is disruptive, and removing them is cleanup work. We need to find a compromise in this issue, but getting tough on 198 is out of line: toughness is alright when used on trolls, vandals or nazis, but clearly 198 is neither, but an editor sincerely concerned about what he regards as inappropriate content. The way to go in cases of edit wars is <i>protection</i>, not blocking of those in the minority (who will be more likely to break the 3RR. It is also no marvel that the 'prudish' side is in the minority in this case. What mindset do you think is typical for people with Autofellatio on their watchlist??). <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 07:51, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>I DID protect the page, and it was immediately unprotected because it was felt that blocking 198 was the way to go. See above on this same page. You can't have it both ways, people, we either protect the page or we block people who are vandalizing it repeatedly. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 08:13, Mar 15, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I'm sorry, are you saying this is all a misunderstanding? I was under the impression that <i>you</i> thought it necessary to block 198. His very opponents seem to think that he should not have been blocked before actually breaking the 3RR. In my understanding, in the case of an edit war (not vandalism), you first block people for 3RR violations a couple of times. If the edit war persists, i.e. if you repeatedly have to block the same people for 3RR, or if people just settle for reverting every 6 hours, you (blindly) protect the page at some point. I'm sorry if I'm basing this on false assumptions, I thought you had blocked 198 for <i>threatening</i> to break the 3RR. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 16:09, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)</small>

<dd>I blocked 198 because he 3RRs every day. This is repeated disruption of Wikipedia. I was perfectly happy with protecting the page and letting the entire discussion play out on the Talk page, but that was apparenlty unaceptable. You DID read the section above where I protected the page and it was immediately unprotected, right? If the page can't be protected and the vandal continues to insist on playing out the letter of the rule and not the spirit by 3 RRs a day, then what else would you suggest? <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 20:25, Mar 15, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Someone aggrieved by his 3RR's per day should apply to the arbcomm for relief, perhaps first going through mediation. Administrators are authorized to block people for violating the 3RR, meaning 4RR's in a 24 hour period. But there is no policy against "3RR every day" and if the community had wanted a rule like that they could have created one, and still can. One can still be guilty of edit-warring without overstepping the 3RR, and persistent edit-warring is certainly a behavioural problem. But it is one for the ArbComm to deal with, with collection of evidence, etc, etc. They have dealt with it in the past, such as in <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Charles_Darwin-Lincoln_dispute_c2f2.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Charles Darwin-Lincoln dispute">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Charles Darwin-Lincoln dispute</a>. Stretching the blocking policy to define "3RR every day" as disruption is stretching that policy too far. That policy isn't intended to allow administrators to assume the duties of the ArbComm by allowing them to define any behaviour they find objectionable as "disruption" and block the offending editor. What is the point of even having an ArbComm, with elected arbitrators, etc -- if any administrator can impose a one month block on any other member merely by declaring his behaviour to be "disruption"? --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 22:53, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

The three revert rule is an electric fence, not an entitlement.
The 3RR is intended as a means to stop sterile edit wars. It does
not grant users an inalienable right to three reverts every
twenty-four hours or endorse reverts as an editing technique. 
Persistent reversion remains strongly discouraged and is unlikely
to constitute working properly with others.

<dd>I am not arguing that "3RR every day" is acceptable behaviour. However, it is not a violation of the 3RR policy. Administrators have the right to block under the 3RR policy. There is edit-warring that can occur that is still not a violation of the 3RR policy. There is no policy that gives administrators the authority to deal with that edit-warring by blocking. They have some other means, such as page protection, but not blocking. Edit-warring, other that 3RR violations, must be be dealt with by the ArbComm, as it has been in other cases. The quote from Calton is precisely from an edit-warring case decided by the ArbComm. The ArbComm decision did not create new authority for adminstrators to block people; it was the rationale for a decision by the ArbComm. If RickK is "having nothing to do with the ArbCom" (a position I don't agree with but for which I can imagine the reasons), it still does not grant him authority to block people according to his ideas of what is right. As an administrator he has authority to block people in very particular cases, such as 3RR violations, vandalism, disruption, etc. RickK knows this, of course, which is why he is trying to define the behaviour he targetted as "disruption". But that simply doesn't wash, since this is not a case of disruption. This issue is important because more and more we see administrators inventing policy and authority to bring about a result that they consider "common sense". Jimbo actually made this situation worse by recently blessing as "common sense", retroactively, another blocking action by an administrator outside of policy, and implicitly criticizing the people (including me) who objected to the violation of policy. But we can't have 400 administrators all substituting their own views as to what is common sense for the policies and procedures that have been established, hoping that their decisions will somehow be blessed retroactively by consensus (or Jimbo). If there are super-administrators who are not constrained by policy and have authority from Jimbo to impose sanctions on other members based on their own "common sense", I would like to know about it, and I would like to see a list of these administrators. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 00:25, 16 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>More rules are just about the last thing we need. Look at all the stupid, time-wasting arguments we have other whether something is a revert or not. More rules just mean more wiki-lawyering. We should simply have said "people can be blocked for edit-warring", and left it at that. Yes, we do need to come up with some way to prevent block warring; I liked <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html#Block_wars" title="WP:AN">your idea</a>. Also, maybe we ought to create two classes of admins; normal "janitors" who just do stuff such as deletions, protection, etc, and <i>small number</i> of "policeman", who are carefully selected for their reasonable nature, and given the authority (by the Wikimedia board, or some group they appoint - i.e. <b>not</b> an election) to block people for behaviour (edit warring, abuse, etc); the actions of the latter group can only be undone by the policeman who took the action, or by appealing to the ArbComm. (If something like this happens, I cheerfully volunteer to be demoted to the former; I have no major desire in riding herd on people.) <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 13:04, 17 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Growing necessitates more and better rules. I never heard of a society yet, or an organization, that made the rules simpler as it got more complex. It doesn't work that way. Improving the nature and scope of the laws is a natural part of improving our functioning as a community. Clear and comprehensive rules are a protection for all editors against the petty tyranny of those who like to play politics or carry on a grudge. I'll take wiki-lawyering over petty tyranny anyday.

<dd>Prior to today, I had not reverted any edits of the sort for several days, possibly upward of a week. Indeed, I didn't revert (Or even look at your contributions) over the weekend. Today, I did, removed the infoboxes once again, and then noticed that, after repeated accusations of stalking, you've mysteriously wandered off of your usual focus on alternative medicine and expressed an interest in beef and Internet pornography. I never knew such matters interested you. Perhaps you should bring up your objections to my edits on the talk page, and we can discuss them. I'm particularly surprised to find that you don't think a top 4000 website is notable - it's one of the most successful and important erotic websites on the Internet.

<p>RickK, for anyone that has ever <b>really</b> been <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stalking.html" title="Stalking">stalked</a>, or even <a href="../../../c/y/b/Cyberstalking.html" title="Cyberstalking">cyberstalked</a>, your accusation is probably seen as insulting. I'd like to illustrate the double-standard being put forth here. If you take a look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;hideminor=0&amp;namespace=0&amp;target=Snowspinner&amp;limit=250&amp;offset=0" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;hideminor=0&amp;namespace=0&amp;target=Snowspinner&amp;limit=250&amp;offset=0" rel="nofollow">what Snowspinner has been doing</a> regarding <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Gohde_2a7a.html" title="User:John Gohde">User:John Gohde</a>, you may get a hint of what true Wiki-stalking is. That poor guy, who may be misguided, is trying to edit in his area of speciality. Snowspinner is systematically using reversion, deletion, and good old fashion editing to remove tones of that guys work. The only way Snowspinner is doing that is by pulling that user's contribs and going over every single one, reverting most of them and removing anything that guy does. I would suspect if you count up, Snowspinner is a much bigger stalker than TRT, and more blatant. So please stop using the term "stalked", since it is nothing of the sort. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 00:53, 2005 Mar 10 (UTC)</p>

<dd>nothing to see here...

If you are so upset simply by people disagreeing with you, maybe it's your turn for a wikibreak? Also, rollbacks are hardly an abuse of admin power. It's not like you have been inappropriately blocked or something.

<ul>
<li>The fact they are roll back reversals doesn't change a thing. A revert is a revert no matter who makes it. You make it sound like making a rollback on non-vandalism is a bad thing. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 16:29, Mar 13, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is when used to facilitate an edit conflict. Roll-backing a non-vandalous edit expressly fails the "<a href="../../../r/e/v/Wikipedia%7ERevert_d321.html#Explain_reverts" title="Wikipedia:Revert">Always explain your reverts</a>" policy. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 17:19, 2005 Mar 13 (UTC)</li>
<li>Rollbacks are a way of dealing with vandalism.They really shouldn't be used for non vandal reverts. I've done it myself from time to time, but I regret doing it as a non explained revert rarely helps the situation. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">(ask the rotten)</a> 17:27, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The reason for objection was made pretty clear by me on several occasions - it's an inappropriate use of series boxes. It seems assumable that David's reversions amounted to "Agree with Snowspinner." He may even have indicated that once in an edit summary - I don't recall, quite honestly. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 17:32, Mar 13, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You have to ask yourself, "why doesn't every editor have access to rollback?" I think we all know it is because it would be abused to facilitate unproductive edit wars. Admins are supposed to be able to handle themselves better, and so are given this tool for vandal-fighting. It is not a "voting tool" in an edit conflict, so the "Agree with Snowspinner" assumption, though probably correct in David's mind, doesn't make it a proper action. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 17:46, 2005 Mar 13 (UTC)

<li>Most were hand-reverts in the conventional manner, actually - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 18:55, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>I don't treat with respect anybody who treats me with disrespect. And, I am calling you a Liar Point-Blank because most if NOT all were admin reversals.

<ul>
<li>If you have access to a technical method of telling edits done one way from edits done the other way with the same summary text, then, since you're making the assertion, I'm eagerly awaiting your evidence - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 13:40, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>You are the person making an assertion that is contrary to common sense, therefore you have the burden of proof. If it looks like an Admin Reversal/Rollback, it is one unless David can prove otherwise. -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Gohde_2a7a.html" title="User:John Gohde">John Gohde</a> 15:09, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<p>Well then how about telling me <i>the reason</i> for David repeatedly reversing my edits. Are the project's infoboxes too shiny for David's taste? How about a reason that belongs on planet Earth? Inboboxes are a totally accepted part of Wikipedia by policy, guidelines, and style guides. Show me one thing wrong with replacing the old infobox design with a new single purpose design. These boxes were already there. They are not going through a list. They are intentionally harassing me for no good rational reason. And, I am talking about Admins, NOT an editor. Admins must be held to a higher standard of conduct. -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Gohde_2a7a.html" title="User:John Gohde">John Gohde</a> 16:47, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I've looked at the "infoboxes" and they aren't actually infoboxes they are navigation boxes. As such they are a duplication of the category links and are therefore redundant. Please stop adding them. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">(ask the rotten)</a> 17:34, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So, have I. They are positively NOT navigation boxes. The new design is positively a pure infobox. And, the blocking is actually keeping all the old navigation boxes from being updated to a pure infobox design. -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Gohde_2a7a.html" title="User:John Gohde">John Gohde</a> 04:10, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>this is bogus. On the risk of sounding "territorial" again, there is no need to come here just to ask David what he thought was wrong with the boxes, and could he please comment on his reverts. He has a Talk Page for that. After he <i>refuses</i> to give his reasons, the option to complain, formally or informally, will still be open. As it is, this is just abusing this board to get a wider audience for your whining, or for exposing the buddying-up of admins. Let me tell you, if any sizeable subset of this motley crew of admins buddies-up against you, you must have a <i>really</i> weak case. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 20:12, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)</small></p>

<ul>
<li>They are in fact enhanced navigation boxes, i.e. templates, except you've constructed them as the HTML rather than as templates. They are redundant with the categories and so don't belong on articles. They serve only as vanity decorations and statements of article ownership - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 18:55, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>First of all, a pure navigation box was just voted on in the recent TvD vote on Buddhism.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion/Log/Not_deleted&amp;oldid=10932737#Template:buddhism" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion/Log/Not_deleted&amp;oldid=10932737#Template:buddhism" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> Even though <a href="../../../b/u/d/Template%7EBuddhism_5980.html" title="Template:Buddhism">template:buddhism</a> is a prohibited use of an article series box, both of you Admins voted to keep it.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion/Log/Not_deleted&amp;oldid=10932737#Template:buddhism" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion/Log/Not_deleted&amp;oldid=10932737#Template:buddhism" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> That pure navigation box survived squeaky clean. So, there is absolutely nothing wrong with using a pure prohibited navigation box in Wikipedia in any subject area. Second, the new design is clearly an infobox rather than a navigation box. I researched the topic, and I removed all imperfections from it. The new design is a pure infobox by all policy, guidelines, and style guides on Wikipedia. Infoboxes by policy, guidelines, and style guides are not redundant with categories becuase they have nothing in common with categories. Third, Lists are allowed by Wikipedia guidelines to be redundant with categories. Thus, being redunduant with a category is not a crime on Wikipedia. Fourth, the ONLY reason you insist on disrepecting me with your openly bigoted comments about the new AM infobox design is that you clearly are a bigot by your own above words.

<dd>Why don't you just let it be, since, as you said, it isn't official evidence? You can make a note of things that you think should be corrected and provide a list of corrections if it <i>does</i> become official evidence.

<p>I completely agree with Aranel here. What exactly is wrong with waiting until he's got his evidence collected and filed the RFAr? You'll have an entire section in which you can respond to this thing without getting reverted once the evidence does become official. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 22:07, Mar 13, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To be honest, I wouldn't have expected this kind of response from him. It's quite venomous. If this was my own page, and the "opposition" made these corrections, then I would have thought it was fair and balanced. There are certainly other responses I would make if this goes anywhere, but I don't see the point of leaving in such a gross (and maybe unintentional) mistake. As it is, I myself don't want to violate 3RR, so I'll not edit anymore. My reply above makes the case just the same. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 22:09, 2005 Mar 13 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Of course I doubt whether this report will result in anything (I have reported 3RR violations by him before), but these are clear reverts/removals of signed comments and good faith edits. Worse yet, it was done using the rollback anti-vandalism tool. This may be his subpage, but he doesn't "own" it enough to warrant this. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 00:56, 2005 Mar 14 (UTC)</li>

<li>This is in his User space. He has the perfect right to do whatever he wants to do in his own space. 3RR rules do not apply to your own User space. Leave it alone, editing other people's User space is in and of itself a blockable offense. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 01:00, Mar 14, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Since when? Vandalising another users user space is blockable, but editing isn't. Having said that, I'd advise Netaholic to leave Neutrality's evidence alone and instead counter that evidence on the RFAr page or by creating an evidence page yourself in your own space. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">(ask the rotten)</a> 06:20, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Adding evidence to a page isn't a personal attack. People remove comments from their own talkpages all the time.

<li>I didn't mean to imply his page was a personal attack. I probably should ahve quoted it as "<i>Community policies... apply to your user space just as they do elsewhere.</i>" I am specifically meaning that 3RR certainly applies to user space, since 3RR is a community policy. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 16:17, 2005 Mar 14 (UTC)

<li>I have no problem with applying the three-revert rule to user space, but in general I would see removing unwanted edits from a subpage in my user space as the equivalent of reverting vandalism to an article. That to me is the sensible consequence of the latitude we allow people in deciding what goes in their user space. So I feel that this particular situation falls under the exemption to the rule.

<p>Everyking has reverted <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autobiography_%28Ashlee_Simpson_album%29_994e.html" title="Autobiography (Ashlee Simpson album)">Autobiography (Ashlee Simpson album)</a> again, in violation of <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Everyking_3166.html#Revert_limitation" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Everyking">the arbitration ruling against him</a>. As is typical, this is not a simple revert that can be shown using a single diff:</p>
<ul>
<li>On Feb 27, Snowspinner converted four paragraphs of reviews into a single paragraph, and I reduced the number of reviews quoted from six to three. Alkivar made some unrelated changes (I shrank the # of reviews in the table to make it fit on 1 page <a href="../../../a/l/k/User%7EAlkivar_1b76.html" title="User:Alkivar">Alkivar</a> 05:25, 14 Mar 2005). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Autobiography_%28Ashlee_Simpson_album%29&amp;diff=10765666&amp;oldid=10637092" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Autobiography_%28Ashlee_Simpson_album%29&amp;diff=10765666&amp;oldid=10637092" rel="nofollow">[26]</a></li>
<li>On March 4, Everyking made some unrelated edits to the article</li>
<li>On March 13, Everyking reverted the "reviews" part of the article back to the pre-Feb 27 version, with the removal of a single sentence and movement of a second sentence. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Autobiography_%28Ashlee_Simpson_album%29&amp;diff=11117229&amp;oldid=11092318" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Autobiography_%28Ashlee_Simpson_album%29&amp;diff=11117229&amp;oldid=11092318" rel="nofollow">[27]</a></li>

<dd>Excuse me if I'm a little cynical here, but the last time you used words like "compromise" and "mutually agreeable", the result was having to run a poll every time someone wanted to change or remove a sentence, interspersed with the occasional complete revert of the article. Since you're still using your old tactics of uncommented reverts, reverting a section and claiming it wasn't a revert, calling a revert "restore a bit", and avoiding the talk page, I find it hard to believe you're sincere about wanting to compromise. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> 18:08, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>See the first three bullet points. It's a little hard to see, since there were a number of edits to other sections of the article, but the net result of Snowspinner's edit, my edit, and Everyking's edit was to change the position of one sentence and remove a second, despite the fact that each edit affected the entire "reviews" part of the article. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> 18:08, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Everyking gave his word to me online, so I unblocked him at 20:27, after just over three hours blocked.

<p>This is getting a little melodramatic. I'm not going to comment on who is in the right and who is in the wrong here; in some ways, it does not matter, because blocking wars like this make all administrators look bad. What moral authority will administrators have to inspire other editors to work harmoniously when there are blocking/unblocking wars going on like this between administrators? I agree with silsor's comment in the following blocking log: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3AEveryking" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3AEveryking" rel="nofollow">[31]</a> . --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 23:00, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't know, Theresa. If you look at 14 March in the blocking log, you see: block - extend to 100 days - unblock - block - unblock. One admin blocking, two different admin's unblocking. How many times do they have to go back and forth before you would call it a blocking war? --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 12:45, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>You have to look at the comments as well. Silsor unblocked the 100 day block, although he didn't reblock, he said it would be ok to block for 1 day.

<p>It's pretty normal for an administrator to unblock someone who is displaying genuine contrition. It's how we build trust. If someone had gone against this and blocked again I would not have fought it. If people want to play block wars I'm not interested. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 08:19, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Tony, in this case, the contrition was expressed to only one of 400 admins (you), using the IRC channel. There is something wrong with a process where in order for a block to stick, all 400+ admins must agree. If someone violates the 3RR and is blocked for it, the other admins should let that stand, UNLESS it was actually an error. (e.g. there weren't really 4 reverts.) The process is broken if any of 400 admins can undo a block because he thinks the person is "contrite" or that a block within policy was "too harsh". Presuming that the block was according to policy, why would you ever substitute your opinion for that of the person who imposed the block? A person violating the 3RR (or in this case Everyking violating his parole) should expect to be blocked for 24 hours, not counting on being able to appeal to one soft-hearted person in the admin cadre. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 16:48, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Although I'm no fan of making decisions on IRC, I didn't mind this particularly (also keep in mind that if Everyking is blocked, he <i>can't</i> say anything on the wiki). It's one thing for you to unblock when Everyking tells you, "I won't revert anymore", which he can do on the mailing list, IRC, or by private email. Quite a few people have been unblocked based on similar communications. It's different if you start a conversation on IRC that amounts to asking people, "Everyking promised to stop reverting so should I unblock him now, what do you think?" That discussion is more helpful with greater transparency. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 03:26, 16 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The main threat User:Cumbey is makingis via email against User:SqueakBox is to tell the police here in <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_Ceiba_0958.html" title="La Ceiba">La Ceiba</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honduras.html" title="Honduras">Honduras</a> that I have a stash of marijuana; this based on my interest on <a href="../../../r/a/s/Rastafarianism.html" title="Rastafarianism">Rastafarianism</a>. I think it is an empty threat as she doesn't know where I live, only in <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_Ceiba_0958.html" title="La Ceiba">La Ceiba</a> in <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honduras.html" title="Honduras">Honduras</a>. Things are not like in the UK/US here. No-one wants the negative attentions of the police. She has absolutely no justification for thinking I am in possession of marijuana, i.e. just attacking. But to unjustly and without cause bring the police here would, in my opinion, be a threat to me and my family. I have no idea whether making false claims to the police is an offence here, I would guess so, but getting the police involved in one's life by making false claims can do a lot of damage to the other party.</p>
<p>The other email charge she is making is that I hacked into the wiki data base; she wants to see me go down for a long time for this one. I I know the Honduran authorities would not investigate this without hard evidence.</p>
<p>On wikipedia she also accuses <a href="../../../h/i/e/User%7EHierarchypedia_2bac.html" title="User:Hierarchypedia">User:hierarchypedia</a> of being my sockpuppet. These last 2 spurious allegations make me question her mental health, which is partly why I am concerned.</p>
<p>She knows my name (from my talk page) and is threatening to smear it all over the net. She writes my name all over her talk page, and I removed all the references.</p>
<p>The basic problem as she sees it, I think, is that I am working for <a href="../../../j/a/v/Javier_Solana_a15f.html" title="Javier Solana">Javier Solana</a> in order to remove the evidences she placed in the article proving that he is the antichrist, and thus not letting the public no the truth about him.</p>
<p>Cumbey has told me she is going to write to Jimbo Wales demanding to see the hard discs (to get evidence that I have been hacking in and contaminating them, doctoring the evidence, etc, and also to demand that he reinstate her version of the Solana article. And I thought I was here to write encyclopedia articles. She thinks I have befriended the new editors on the Solana article, because they are not telling the truth the way she sees it either. If she goes ahead with pursuing Jimbo she may then start to blame him for manipulating evidence, etc, as well. I think she thinks I am a personal friend of his (don't know him). I hope she will just go away, but am concerned she won't. --<a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 23:30, Mar 14, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>after seeing these mails, I am not so sure this is a serious case. Sure, Cumbey indulged in personal attacks, but these were on email, and thereby outside wikimedia's jurisdiction. the 'threat' seems to consist of <i>"perhaps the local authorities need to investigate your increasingly clearly existing stash."</i> which to me sounds rather like a polemic turn of phrase than a serious threat of taking action. Just my impression, though, I'll happily stay uninvolved in this ;) the "hacking charge" is of course cranky, though <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 11:24, 16 Mar 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd>One's perception is determined by one's situation and cultural background. Perhaps because of my unusual background, I find that I can understand both your perspective and SqueakBox's. Part of my family—including myself—fled Czechoslovakia in 1968, but part of my family was unable to escape. I know that my Czech relatives would have found a threat like this to be a devastating event, and one that could not be taken lightly. I don't know what the situation is like in Honduras, but SqueakBox is obviously very upset and concerned by the threat. Nor do I know Cumby's background and motivation: she may just be joking, or she may be quite serious. Personally, I would prefer us to err on the side of caution, rather than on the side of complacency. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeStepanek_8612.html" title="User:GeorgeStepanek">GeorgeStepanek</a>\<sup><a href="../../../g/e/o/User_talk%7EGeorgeStepanek_0414.html" title="User talk:GeorgeStepanek"><font color="gray">talk</font></a></sup> 08:48, 17 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Having read all this I am a bit taken aback by Squeakbox's whinging. I have not seen <i>any</i> actual threats in any of the emails, nor serious accusations/threads or personal attacks on the talk pages. It appears rather that Squeakbox talks a lot of the time to himself and pursues just as much as Cumbey his personal POV pushing, it is just that his POV is slightly more socially acceptable than hers. I personally would like them to get on with it and just come down heavily onto them if they go beyond 3RR etc. <a href="../../../r/e/f/User%7ERefdoc_5ef2.html" title="User:Refdoc">Refdoc</a> 10:34, 17 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think the email address should be considered genuine. See <a href="../../../s/q/u/User_talk%7ESqueakBox_767a.html#Private_conversation" title="User talk:SqueakBox">User talk:SqueakBox#Private conversation</a>. The reality is I did and do feel intimidated by what she said; and that she said it because she does not like my religious beliefs. I certainly do not agree that I threatened her. When she earlier at wikipedia on the Solana talk page told me to read the new age books when I was not in an altered state I made it clear (as if I should have to) that I do not take drugs, and that if she kept libelling me like that she'd end up in a Honduran jail. Libel is a criminal offence here; I did not mean I would try to put her in a jail, but obviously if she libels my reputation as a law abiding character I do have the right to sue her for libel, and would probably feel it necessary to do so (not necessaarily in Honduras) in order to salvage my reputation, not in order to look for trouble. She has absolutely know right to even threaten to persecute me for my religious beliefs. This is not an atmosphere in which I find it easy to edit the Solana article, and I would argue that her attempt to intimidate because of my religious beliefs is nothing more or less than an attempt to intimidate me into stopping being a contributor to the Solana article (which is why it could be a blockable offence). I think <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nieves_de_Madariaga&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nieves_de_Madariaga&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">here</a> as <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions__68.61.150.80_6a2f.html" title="Special:Contributions/ 68.61.150.80">User:68.61.150.80</a> she let me know she had a Spanish speaking contact, but it is pretty unlikely that they are Honduran, and therefore, as Guettarda assured me, pretty unlikely they would be able to persuade the local police to go out and look for me, only with my name and 2 other bits of info that Cumbey has; that I was hospitalised by a machete attackin October, and that my partner lost a leg; in the UK the police could probably find me with such info (though they would not do so for mere possession of a class c drug) whereas it is unlikely a foreigner could persuade the Honduran police to act. Yet I still feel threatened, which I believe was the point of the exercise from her point of view. She has neither proof nor reason to think I have a stash. Assuming I don't, the mere fact of having the police here could still bring me a lot of trouble, andd cost me money (though unlike many wiki contributors I do have the resources to contract a (my) lawyer, pay an instant fine, etc). I am clear that I do not deserve to be even threatened with having the police called on me by Cumbey solely for expressing to her a belief in the divinity of Haile Selassie, and to prevent me from editing the Solana article. That strikes me as religious bigotry. I am waiting for mediation, and if she doesn't meet my demands there, including a retraction of this email statement on a wiki page and a promise not to persecute me for my religious beliefs, I will pursue this to arbitration with the aim of trying to get her banned from the Solana and <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barcelona_Conference_4e5b.html" title="Barcelona Conference">Barcelona Conference</a> articles. I am not sure if people here are able to read from my email links (the fact that my computer reads them does not mean anyone else can, but if any admin wants a copy they should contact me on my user page or at the scuiqui address. I am aware she is a <a href="http://www.michbar.org/memberdirectory/detail.cfm?ID=25494480%2D4614%2D23%2DDETAIL" class="external text" title="http://www.michbar.org/memberdirectory/detail.cfm?ID=25494480%2D4614%2D23%2DDETAIL" rel="nofollow">member</a> of the state bar of Michigan, and I doubt whther they condone threats of religious persecution; right now I am not looking for trouble, but I am very concerned to protect my reputation. I will think about some of the other suggestions; I didn't realise the issue had been moved here.

I did call her a Nazi apologist for comparing Solana to Hitler, but I believe I got to her because I wanted to remove her original and POV thesis from what she was claiming was her article. her desperation showed in the edit war she started last friday night, and for which she was givena 24 hour block. --<a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 23:32, Mar 17, 2005 (UTC)</p>

Curps has removed 2 of them. I did not and could not hack into any data base. I have no idea why wiki elite have gone offline, but it was definitely Maisie who changed the database, as she has the ability to do. BTW, I do not use cannabis, you don't have to use cannabis to be a Rastafarian, you to have know who God is. Christ returned and you missed the event. Have a look at Rev 5.5 and 19.8. In the old testament it clearly states the messiah will return as a great king, and he was the greatest. Anyone who knows me knows I don't use drugs and am incapable of hacking (limited technical skills). So your threats are empty. Instead of attacking me, debate any changes you want on the Solana talk page. The new contributors are like me; Europeans interested in Solana the politician, not Solana the Beast. At least one of them claims to have contributed to the article before, so be careful before you start claiming any version of it belongs to you, SqueakBox to which she replied</p>
<p>Your writing is so fascinating. And you had the nerve to ridicule Judeo-Christian beliefs! Want to talk about silly religious beliefs? Let's discuss yours!</p>
<p>That article was a stub and a 3 line one at that when I wrote the Solana article as it existed before Solana probably paid you to do the hatchet job (surely you don't expect me to believe that Ra Sta Fari came back from the dead to inspire you, do you? Who knows what personality you assume in what communication to any person? Three faces of Eve? Twelve Faces of Sybil? Heck, you've probably got fifty faces -- all plastic. Your dogs have more integrity than you.</p>
<p>If you told the truth about anything other than your confessions to me that you knew Alice Bailey's works, it was probably about the Rastafarianism and I still have your old communications where you denied even that before you so strongly professed it this morning, although it has occurred to me as a lawyer that you could be setting up an insanity plea -- ditto about your machete bump on the head. Don't know what to believe about you anymore, so I believe nothing other than you are a dangerous lying fool -- trolling the boards and then accusing others of precisely your own acts -- sock puppets, faking personalities, using false identities, vandalising/vandalizing the board.</p>
<p>But, in the event you really are a Rastafarian, I would hardly believe you didfn't participate in the best known sacrament of your religion -- the 'wisdom weed', ganja, marijuana, you name it!

<p>I also resent strongly the insinuation that I am POVing at Solana. Or is tring to make the article into a political article POV? I don't really have a point of view about him. Cumbey thinks he is the antichrist, and is determined to prove it in the article. I want an article about a politician with many contributors. to turn a fringe belief about an EU politician into just one of various POV's about this article, is, in my opinion, jus´plain not true. I may believe Queen Elizabeth II is the <a href="../../../w/h/o/Whore_of_Babylon_ec5d.html" title="Whore of Babylon">Whore of Babylon</a> but I don't obsessively try to insert that POV into <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_II_of_England_4a63.html" title="Elizabeth II of England">Elizabeth II of England</a>, because that is also a political article, and neither article, I assert, should allow itself to be dominated by religious POV. I have taken a different path with Haile Selassie, but he is (a) dead, asnd (b) I have done it ina very non POV view. --<a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 21:51, Mar 17, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>GeorgeStepanek obviates his credibility by changing his story on whether he thought my comments are personal attacks.

I even pointed out in the talk page for that article that they weren't to be taken as such. But those opposing me weren't interested in the facts. I could by their logic take their opposition to my rational edits as a personal attack. But I'm not the irrational one, I'm defending my edits rationally against an alternately specious and blind appeal to consensus.</dd>

<dd>His claim of attempting to forge a consensus is further proof of prevarication. He persistently reverted to a known-bad version of the article rather than questioning my edit and amending it as consensus determines, nor even editing it to add those facts he thought unnecessarily deleted. Since I was blocked, he has in fact accepted almost all of my edits, showing that he did not disagree with them, and that he was merely trying to control their inclusion as though the page were his personal publication.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>His claim that I am not willing to work with other editors is likewise false. I was perfectly willing to work with them; but he was not willing to work with me, as indicated by his flat reversions and denials of facts that he accepted only after achieving his goal of constructing a false case against me for a 3RR violation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Most importantly, I did <b>not</b> revert the article to the same text three times. I made substantive, good-faith changes incorporating the gist of <a href="../../../s/f/a/User%7ESfahey_e531.html" title="User:Sfahey">Sfahey's</a> suggestions from the talk page in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Weight_training&amp;oldid=11169234" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Weight_training&amp;oldid=11169234" rel="nofollow">08:13, 15 Mar 2005</a> edit.</dd>

<dd>I don't see this as a 3RR issue so much as a content dispute issue which is not really amenable to resolution by 3RR enforcements or not. All the editors appear to be editing the article in good faith, even if they strongly disagree. I'm hoping that everyone can put aside the proceedings to this point and hash this out. One suggestion is to propose wording changes in talk, to see if all accurate information can be properly represented. There are other measures we can take if need be that can deal with the material instead of the personalities. -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> | <a href="../../../c/e/c/User_talk%7ECecropia_0e8d.html" title="User talk:Cecropia"><i>explains it all</i> ®</a> 09:41, 16 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Without getting into the 3RR issue, in my opinion those edit summaries were extremely uncivil, and Blair's behavior since then seems to suggest that we have a serious editor attitude problem. I hope nobody takes Blair's demand for an apology seriously. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 10:10, 16 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Whatever has caused this fuss, it certainly has not been a false 3RR report. My comments on Blair's conduct also stand. Orbiting planet Luser without a <a href="../../../c/l/u/Cluestick.html" title="Cluestick">cluestick</a> can be hazardous. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 12:51, 17 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I never claimed I didn't revert more than 3 times in 24 hours; I claimed I didn't violate the 3RR. Those are <b>not</b> the same claim. The 3RR has since been amended (by Tony, three hours before posting this "evidence" here) to change it from the "Ko-rule" version I interpreted as allowing me to make the fourth revert after making a substantive and cooperative change to the page. As for that cluestick, Tony, just make sure you remember which end was which, and don't forget to apologize. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlair_P._Houghton_f78f.html" title="User:Blair P. Houghton">Blair P. Houghton</a> 05:31, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have removed the Ko Rule allusion because it misled you into believing that you could revert-war indefinitely as long as you made minor changes every two or three edits. Nobody owes you an apology. Get a clue. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 14:08, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have a clue, and it's that you're unwilling to admit that you're being insulting by claiming I have an "attitude problem." <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlair_P._Houghton_f78f.html" title="User:Blair P. Houghton">Blair P. Houghton</a> 02:34, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>This guy seems to guard 24/7 standing ready to to keep the introduction to the article just how he wants it without little or no flexibility. I've been trying to chip away at it to get some changes in but to no avail. He's reverted more than this but these are the obvious technical reverts where he actually announced it. As you can see, it's not just me he's reverting. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 22:00, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
