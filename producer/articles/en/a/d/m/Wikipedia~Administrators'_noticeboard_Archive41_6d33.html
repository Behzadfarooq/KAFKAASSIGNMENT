<dd>This is, in fact, a local linguistic variation. British English commonly uses "Group are adjective"; American English uses "Group is adjective".

<p><a href="../../../t/r/a/User_talk%7ETravb_6387.html" title="User talk:Travb">User talk:Travb</a> is now being developed into an attack page, which includes several false statements and deliberate lies. (True, the user he's attacking, he doesn't name, but that only makes it less bad, not acceptable.) Example:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The admininstrator A admitted he was guilty of a 3RR violation, stated he was going to voluntarily boot himself, then three minutes later unbooted himself, stating he "changed his mind" Another administrator B then unbooted him.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is a statement that Travb has acknowledged to be false under <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_feeb.html#Decision_not_to_have_a_fellow_admin_blocked" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard">Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard#Decision not to have a fellow admin blocked</a> above.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Statements between myself, Administrator A, and Administrator B were erased on his user page. They are no longer in the history of Administrator A talk page.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Just as Travb has demonstrated an inability to check block logs before making false statements about what they contain, he also has an inability to check <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Philwelch&amp;action=history" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Philwelch&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Philwelch&amp;action=history</a> page histories before making false statements as well.</p>
<p>This all stems, not only from his obsession with me stemming from a recent dispute, but also from his repeated insistence to use a fair-use image on his user and talk pages, even after repeated admin intervention. Given my past with this editor, it would be inappropriate for me to intervene, but something must be done. — <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Phil Welch</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">t</a>) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Philwelch_0d8d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Philwelch">c</a>) 16:59, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Complaining about (what they see as) unfairness isn't the same as making a personal attack. I've been watching this too, and while I don't see that his complaining is helpful, I'm struggling to see how it's harmful. If someone thinks they're being treated unfairly, we only escalate the problem by blocking them for complaining about the unfairness. If he were spamming this stuff onto other's talk pages, that would be a problem, but as it is?

<p>Thank you for your comments <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0">User:Katefan0</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">User:Friday</a>. I agree with you both that this behavior does not helping build the encyclopedia. Deleting thousands of images from user pages with little understanding of copyright law, with the users own interpretation of copyright, with no consensus at all, does not help build an encyclopedia, and causes a lot of ill feelings and bad will between dozens, maybe hundreds of people. I also agree that ignoring a {{inuse}} tag and causing a page to be reverted 3 times also does not help build an encyclopedia. Applying the rules in what I see as an arbitrary way, also does not help build an encyclopedia, and creates a lot of bad will toward others. Please keep in mind that <b>I did not start either of these arguments.</b> Phil did, and the other user did, as I wrote above. If anyone misses this point, I will repeat is as many times as needed to drill this point home, I will also provide all pages and all information to back up <b>any</b> claim which I make.Travb 19:29, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As I understand, the image deletion was not due to copyright law, but rather due to Wikipedia's more-restrictive copyright <b>policy</b>. Yes, one can argue that posting that image in your userspace didn't violate copyright <b>law</b>.

<p>Complaining about unfairness is perfectly fine. Making false statements about other people's actions isn't, especially when one has already acknowledged those statements to be false. That's something we call <b>lying</b> out in the "real world". Bizarre obsessions with me are also rather unwelcome. — <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Phil Welch</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">t</a>) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Philwelch_0d8d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Philwelch">c</a>) 17:10, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Further, I did not "lie". I was mislead.

<dd>I would call that an accidental misstatement, much like the multiple misstatements you have made in (for instance) confusing Admin B with Admin C. As you can see, I have corrected myself. I suggest you accept it as an honest mistake, just as I have accepted your honest mistakes as such. You have had ample opportunity to read my block log. You stated at one point that I didn't unblock myself. And then you repeat this allegation you know to be false. That is lying.

<dd>AGAIN: I RELIED ON YOUR STATMENTS instead of <i>"... read(ing)(your) block log."</i>: that you would voluntary block yourself, and then that you "changed your mind" 33 minutes later you blocked yourself, then 5 minutes later Jareth unblocked you.

<p>This all stems from Phil ignoring a {{inuse}} tag, and beginning a revert war, and violating 3RR, which he admitted he did, blocking himself, unblocking himself 6 minutes later citing that he "changed his mind, then blocking himself again(?) and being unblocked by Jareth after a few minutes.</p>
<p>Umm Phil, the creator of that image: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Uncyclopedia_logo.png" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Uncyclopedia_logo.png" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Uncyclopedia_logo.png</a> has just given the permission as the creator to allow it as a free use. If the other user would have simply asked the creator premission, instead of deleting the image from many pages (I don't know how many) this intrusive and unproductive argument between myself and another user would have never started.</p>
<p>So the other user who interprets fair use so strickly, cause a huge, huge, huge scandal, similar to the Time magazine fair use scandal, not only with my but with dozens, maybe hundreds of users.</p>
<p>I may point out, that none of these people who are deleting these images citing fair use, to my knowledge, have any legal training. Further, they (mis)interpret the words of Jimbo in the strictest possible way, and cause a lot of contention and bitter feelings by their unilateral approaches. Further, there is no comprise with these people, none at all, despite me mentioning appelate court cases on point, which interpret fair use quite differently, they ignore these posts, and are quite agressive when dissent is pointed out. See my protected user talk page for examples.Travb 18:35, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Please keep in mind that both <a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">User_talk:Philwelch</a> and the other User <b>instigated these disagreements.</b></p>
<p><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">User_talk:Philwelch</a> started a revert war, which he admitted guilt for, he also repeatedly ignored a {{inuse}} tag.</p>
<p>The other user began to delete hundreds of images from user pages. Instead of asking the creator of unencyclopedia for permission, he simply began to delete them. I reverted, he deleted it again, I deleted, he reverted again.</p>
<p>Tony, who protected my own userpage, is a strict copyright violation person, who interprets the law strictly. He was involved in some other copyright violation disputes involving Time magazine covers, which were promenent here. He is one of the admins that I emailed, who never responded to my message. He had been involved on the same side as me in the <a href="../../../w/s/i/WSI_ed56.html" title="WSI">WSI</a> arbitration. I felt that, dispite our minor disagreement about copyright, that he would be a fair and impartial judge of me being blocked today. For whatever reason, him, and another admin who did not punish phil for starting a revert war and a 3RR, never responded to my emails. (Tony was never directly involved in the revert war of my blocking, I felt he was an imparial third party)</p>
<p>The admin who blocked me, despite my apologies, felt like I should "cool down". Despite 4 emails, he refused to remove the block. So: there is one admin who starts a revert war, ignores an {{inuse}} tag. and has been banned twice before for 3RR reverts, and also has told other users to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard#Admin_harassment_block" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard#Admin_harassment_block" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard#Admin_harassment_block</a> "fuck off", and gets off scot free. I was shocked at some of the behavior of Phil above, but yet many admins come to his defense, stating he may have had a bad day, etc. Myself, on the other hand, get the full 24 hours.</p>
<p>Favortism? You decide.</p>
<p>I would also like to mention the repeated deletions of what I write on this page by certain admins.</p>
<p>Or, you can just prove my point and try to silence me, as user <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> pointed out above, making the situation worse, and proving your own blatant hyprocricy.</p>

<dd>As I explained at <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a>, I think Travb to have been exceedingly decorous in his postings here, and I think, irrespective of one's differences with him apropos of Wikipedia's fair use guidelines (which he seems to have come to appreciate are stricter than those Wikipedia would otherwise or by law be required to implement), one must concede that he has attempted, on the whole, to make his case through logical argument, rather than through vituperation. The substance, IMHO, of his subpage, talk page, and post supra is Wikirelevant, and his criticisms seem to be directed at the actions of various editors, rather than at those editors themselves. From his posts here, I infer a genuine desire to help to grow the encyclopedia; these are neither the posts we typically get from those intent on disrupting nor the posts we typically get from disgruntled editors simply upset about having had images removed, for example, from their talk pages. I surely think that we ought to treat Travb in the fashion Friday sets out above, with the hope that he might better understand WP policy (and the reasons behind it), in order that he might then contribute productively. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 18:25, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Decorous? Perhaps? Accurate? Not a snowball's chance. As the aforementioned "Administrator B", I have never blocked Travb, the unblocking of "Administrator A" was to reverse a punative block that Travb still cannot let go of and finally, I did respond to his email the moment I got online, it simply wasn't the answer he wanted. I have no problem with his discussion of policies, I do have a problem with the continued disruption, attacks and lying.

<dd>You may wish to review your above table; it current states "I was blocked by Administrator B for WP:POINT. I never "vandalize pages (user or otherwise) to make a point" again." Apparently you got which admin you were accusing of what by which fake name confused while writing it since you used B for me everywhere else. As for the 3RR incident, as before, blocks are not used as punishment, they are to stop disruption. Since the disruption was long past, blocking was completely uneccessary and your continued rallying for such and continued whining is frankly rather silly at this point. Had you been willing to consider that your current conduct might be disruptive and stop the behavior, I would have been happy to unblock you. I'm glad you were able to find the email -- junk filters can be bizarre at times. And I'm having white tea with pear; rather refreshing actually. .:.<a href="../../../j/a/r/User%7EJareth_d262.html" title="User:Jareth">Jareth</a>.:. <sup><a href="../../../j/a/r/User_talk%7EJareth_7e10.html" title="User talk:Jareth">babelfish</a></sup> 19:59, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As mentioned before, I gave in to Phil, and stopped the revert war, which he started, and reported him to 3RR, hoping that, since he obvoiously broke 3RR, which he later admmited readily, his actions would be punished. That is the entire reason why the disruption stopped completly. So because I had the good sense to stop the 3RR, and report it to 3RR, Phil gets off, scot free, and is not punished for his actions.</dd>

<dd>Hi--I assume you are talking to Phil, who brought this up on this page today? I am simply defending the accusations of the opposing parties here. Phil said he would use my RfC as "toilet paper", so I don't know how effective it will be. I like the RfC discussion, but what should the RfC entail? We are covering a lot of issues here:</dd>

<dd>Well, not a single RFC on both concerns that you have, that's for sure. See <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Example_admin_ad1a.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Example admin">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Example admin</a> for how to file an RFC on an admin. I suppose <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Policies_4e76.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Policies">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Policies</a> would be the right place for the other one. Do read all of <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a> first, however. I understand that a "toilet paper" comment doesn't inspire confidence, but the point of an RFC is get feedback from community members who aren't an involved party; to guage how that broader community feels about an issue. Having said all that, my guess would be that lots of users would wish for less crankiness, less <a href="../../../e/w/_/WP%7EEW_c046.html" title="WP:EW">edit-warring</a> and more civility, and it may not be worth the effort of an RFC to establish that. Don't, however, decide that a real RFC isn't worth the time and then put up a malformed one in your userspace and thereby feel that you get to <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> its content. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 19:38, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't know if this is the right place for this request, and if not would appreciate a pointer to what would be the right place.</p>
<p>I'd like to put in a good word for restoring User:Dzoni's account. He was banned for being a sockpuppet of the Communism vandal, but he pretty clearly is not the Communism vandal, mainly because he hasn't been following the modus operandi: <i>vandalizes with references to communism and/or the hammer and sickle</i>. He's had a noticeable tenure here at Wikipedia, so would have had plenty of chances to do that if he was tCv. His only connection to the Communism vandal is that he mentioned him in admiring tones. He hasn't vandalized following the tCv model.</p>
<p>He is a well meaning, if somewhat rash and hot-tempered editor, which has earned him a few temporary blocks. However blocking his account forever for that plus mentioning tCV is like convicting a jaywalker wearing a <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Manson_8fd5.html" title="Charles Manson">Charles Manson</a> tshirt of homicide, and will dilute the impact of blocking real sock-puppets of tCv.</p>
<p>He's been blocked for quite a few days now. That should be sufficient punishment. His attempt to get his account reinstated is accompanied with promises of better behaviour and moderation. Given that he was convicted of a false charge, I recommend giving him that chance. If he is punished, it should be for something he genuinely did, not for guilt by association. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <small><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></small> 18:03, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm inclined to think the sockpuppet allegation to be, although not unfounded, unpersuasive. Dzoni may eventually exhaust the community's patience and merit an indefinite block (his talk page is replete with warnings and short blocks for disruption [though normally only in the form of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a>, which I think, on the whole, to be minimally disruptive]), but I don't think such a block is in order now, and so I'd concur in the assessment that he should be unblocked. Of course, if his intemperate behavior proves disruptive, either in mainspace or at the sundry AfDs in which he participates, we'd do well to rethink that; I'll hope, of course, that disruption won't occur, and I'll surely <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume Dzoni to be editing in good faith</a> and genuinely to want to contribute productively. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 18:15, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>If I get another admin's support, I'd consider unblocking Dzoni. I agree that he doesn't look like the communism vandal, and if he is fooling us and vandalizes like communism we'll just reblock.

<dd>It's kind of a gray area. Some admins prefer to delete the pages, particularly when there are personal attacks or other inflammatory content on the page or in the history, and some just blank them or blank them and protect them so that all users are able to see the history. Cases like this have been brought to the administrators' noticeboard before and when there is a lot of participation in the discussion, the page is usually restored and blanked (in my possibly faulty perception). However, some longtime admins and Jimbo have deleted user talk pages. I think a good policy would be to blank them in most cases, with or without protecting them, and delete them only when necessary, especially considering that pages deleted before the database crash on June 8, 2004 cannot be viewed or restored by admins. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 02:36, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's standard practice on talk pages not to intersperse your replies with the original post, as it gets confusing. In the edit on top there, I'm actually rearranging *my own reply* to conform to this rule. It's also standard practice to post replies in chronological order—i.e. not to post your reply before an earlier reply, which is what you were doing. The formatting was getting confusing and I was fixing it. Furthermore, you removed my comments—I never removed yours. Once again, your obsession with me and compulsive need to pick a fight is somewhat disturbing. — <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Phil Welch</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">t</a>) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Philwelch_0d8d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Philwelch">c</a>) 20:08, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(After edit conflict) Phil's certainly correct here (btw, Travb, for future reference, if you meant this as a specific 3RR complaint and not a general admin conduct complaint, you ought to have noted it instead at <a href="../../../a/n/3/WP%7EAN3_1491.html" title="WP:AN3">WP:AN3</a>); remember also that 3RR blocks are imposed to prevent disruption, not to "punish" perpetrators, and Phil's reverts seem to be neither disruptive nor improper. By continuing to clutter AN and AN/I, you make it ever harder for those of us who have found the treatment afforded you by some others to have been, at times, undeservedly harsh, to defend some of your actions and certainly to impute good faith to them. You might do well to <a href="../../../c/o/o/WP%7ECOOL_e649.html" title="WP:COOL">stay cool</a> and focus on behaviors that concern you and that also harm the encyclopedia. A debate over what WP's policy w/r/to fair use ought to be (even if the debate stems simply from your wanting to use certain images on your talk page) or over how poll data ought to be represented at <a href="../../../n/s/a/NSA_call_database_227a.html" title="NSA call database">NSA call database</a> is useful; relatively petty carping about hypertechnicalities, especially where your interpretation is likely inconsistent with that for which a consensus exists, is not. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 20:15, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I consider it fairly self-evident that your complaint here relates to the fact that your other complaint on <a href="../../../p/a/i/WP%7EPAIN_2701.html" title="WP:PAIN">WP:PAIN</a> was not dealt with the way you wanted.</li>
<li>No, Malber is not an administrator, but non-admins may deal with any 'administrative' task except those requiring administrative tools. Admins are not anything particularly special, they just have some extra buttons.</li>
<li>If an admin declines to block someone on <a href="../../../p/a/i/WP%7EPAIN_2701.html" title="WP:PAIN">WP:PAIN</a>, they won't necessarily announce it, especially if someone (even a non-admin) has adequately addressed the case. If no-one posts to disagree with the first person to reply, then that almost certainly indicates agreement.</li>
<li>If you really want the voice of an administrator, here it is. Malber's analysis is correct.</li>
<li>Your own comments are far from civil: for instance, saying that Malber has <i>"been accused of making personal attacks yourself"</i>, then giving a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Malber&amp;diff=52356926&amp;oldid=52170791" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Malber&amp;diff=52356926&amp;oldid=52170791" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Malber&amp;diff=52356926&amp;oldid=52170791</a> diff which showed a user <i>quoting</i> an NPA warning by Malber, presenting it as if the quoter was issuing an NPA warning. That misrepresentation of the facts is then followed up by a healthy dose of well-poisoning with <i>"I recommend admins taking this user's comments with a grain of salt"</i>. For your own good, I would recommend that you drop this. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 22:37, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Or maybe the fact that I did not get an administrator response on an administrator notice board. Would I be making my comments if I hadn't posted on PAIN? Obviously not. However not only were my notices not addressed by an administrator, no one else’s have been for four days now. That only compounds my point. Especially since I have brought this to your attention and other people's complaints are still waiting to be addressed. To the point of <a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESophia_f2ef.html" title="User:Sophia">Sophia</a> resorting to shouting! Is <i>user has restored the material [5] AGAIN! Help!</i> not notice enough? My notice was never addressed by an administrator and I was simply saying "hey! look at all of us waiting for administrators!" Your blatant accusation that I am just doing this because I am not happy with the handling (or lack thereof) is just bad faith and incorrect. In short, the first line of the page says <i>This page is intended to get administrator attention quickly when dealing with personal attacks.</i> If no administrators comment on issues lasting days you actually think the page is being properly monitored?</li>
<li>Pot meet kettle. Below you say that I was misrepresenting the facts (which I will address) yet you say <i>By claiming that admins ignored your complaint when Malber took the time to look into it, you do him a disservice.</i> Hmm... post on admin notice board, user comments, poster saying admins ignored him does said user disservice. Explain to me how that doesn't imply said user is an admin. At the very least show me how it could be reasonably interpreted that Malber wasn't an admin. <i>non-admins may deal with any 'administrative' task except those requiring administrative tools.</i> Really? Show me the Wikipedia policy that says non-admins may make rulings on admin notice boards, not comments, rulings. Show me the policy.</li>
<li>Do you actually expect me to believe that? That's just faulty logic plain and simple. If an admin removed the notices that would be an indication. But four days of users saying "is anyone reading this? help!" is hardly admins agreeing with comments. At the very least they would remove the notices or say something.</li>
<li>Now, now, did you really think that would be satisfactory after I asked Malber to justify his remarks? You haven't even shown any indication that you've even read the notice. So basically you are agree with a user that doesn't provide justification. In any case, the reason why I've been asking for justification is simple. Just for kicks (not really), in your own words, define ad hominem, because I have a strong suspicion you have no idea what it is.</li>
<li>And I will apologize for that, I read it over too quickly and though Malber was being warned, not quoted. But please, don't try to intimidate me with that "for your own good" crap.</li>

<dd>Let's see - taking the recent ones, H8 wasn't addressed because it was a throwaway account that had already been discarded, but just to please you I blocked it anyway. Gnetwerker had already been dealt with by Malber, EnthusiastFRANCE archived the personal attack warnings rather than removing them (he does not wish to have a talk page) and is trying to move on, so no administrative action would be productive, and RyanFreisling asked a difficult question in a perfectly civil way. Now that's over with, you don't bring up anything new. Non-admins may always offer comments (no-one makes 'rulings' around here, except the Arbcom), this is a generally accepted principle everywhere, and, if that doesn't satisfy you, has been formally accepted at <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Administrator_intervention_against_vandalism#Appropriate_for_Non-Admins_to_Remove_Alerts.3F" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Administrator_intervention_against_vandalism#Appropriate_for_Non-Admins_to_Remove_Alerts.3F" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Administrator_intervention_against_vandalism#Appropriate_for_Non-Admins_to_Remove_Alerts.3F</a> . And it's very simple - if no admin posts, that means "no action necessary". If a non-admin posts, and no-one posts to disagree, that means "we agree". This is a wiki - "I agree +1 editcount" isn't as commonly seen around here as on Internet forums. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 10:05, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>This is ridiculous. How do you expect me to reach a consensus with you if you are going to pick and choose which points of mine you are going to address? You addressed most of my first point but not my points raised by Sophia's complaint. I can't see how you even attempted to address my third point, and you completely ignored my fourth point which is the cause for this debate. In addition to your comment of "If a non-admin posts, and no-one posts to disagree, that means "we agree"." Completely supports my point. I was the last responder to Malber. So since no one disagreed with my insisting he provide some justification for his views, according to your statement the admins agree that he didn't provide a good justification.</li>
<li><i>Non-admins may always offer comments (no-one makes 'rulings' around here, except the Arbcom), this is a generally accepted principle everywhere, and, if that doesn't satisfy you, has been formally accepted at WP:AIV [60] .</i>. If it's been "formerly accepted", why is there no policy on it? At the very least there would be a guideline no?</li>
<li>In any case, back to the point at hand, no one has even offered a measly sentence to try to explain how Gnetwerker's comments were not personal attacks. The fact that you have refused to offer an explanation that you even know what an ad hominem is even when you could have copy-pasted from Wikitionary makes me doubt your sincerity in trying to offer a balanced view. I handed that one to you and you still didn't bother to address it.</li>
<li>I don't find it objectionable if someone disagrees with my views. However on every level of non-fallacious arguing and just plain honesty, picking and choosing points to address is indecent. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Cyr_2f7a.html" title="User:Paul Cyr">Paul Cyr</a> 05:16, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

No one from my opposing side has given a single response with justification and free of cherry picking. In summation I feel the chain of events are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gnetwerker made personal attacks against me.</li>
<li>I asked Gnetwerker to stop multiple times.</li>
<li>Gnetwerk continued making personal attacks.</li>
<li>I brought the attacks to the attention of <a href="../../../p/a/i/WP%7EPAIN_2701.html" title="WP:PAIN">WP:PAIN</a>.</li>
<li>The user Malber commented that they were not personal attacks.</li>
<li>I asked him to explain his views because he wasn't providing any justification, he did not.</li>
<li>After a few days without any action being taken, I felt the page was being disregarded and brought it to the attention here.</li>
<li>After the above discussions, Samuel's comments appear to be an <a href="../../../i/g/n/Ignoratio_elenchi.html" title="Ignoratio elenchi">ignoratio elenchi</a> which were full of unexplained and bad-faith remarks and cherry picking.</li>

<dd>xfD discussions are <i>not</i> votes, and admins are not required to give a damn about the tally (I make a point of <i>never</i> knowing how many users "voted" one way or another when closing these sorts of discussions). Mackensen closed it with a solution that, he thought (based on how he read the discussion), would satisfy all participants. This was entirely appropriate behaviour on his part.</dd>
<dd>Of course, the magic word "delete" appeared and so, regardless of the <i>practical</i> effect of the TfD close, we now have a swarm of userbox fans on DRV saying "you're deleting our userbox even though we had a majority of votes to keep!".

<dd>20+ people voted keep, 12 of whom said in no uncertain terms that they were talking about the template itself. In the ensuing discussion on <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRVU_4543.html" title="WP:DRVU">WP:DRVU</a>, I added up the votes from the TFD. 12 people said unambiguously keep, meaning keep the template itself. 6 people said unambiguously delete the template itself. 11 said keep and didn't specify what they meant by "keep". This is a real problem we have here. If anti-userbox administrators are just going to delete userboxes, in clear defiance of a supermajority or they are going to speedy userboxes they don't like for no particular reason, why are we even having a discussion? They're doing the same thing whether the vote is keep or delete. Regardless of your opinion on userboxes, out of process deletions are dead wrong and need to stop. To delete userboxes out of process or, in this case, flying in the face of overwhelming consensus, is arguably an abuse of administrative powers. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 12:37, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>One thing I should add here, since not everyone reads DRV and elsewhere, <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">User:Mackensen</a> said on <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a>, "I'm halting all further administrative action on my part regarding userboxes" and agreed on <a href="../../../m/a/c/WP%7EMACK_60e9.html" title="WP:MACK">WP:MACK</a> with a statement of mine about out-of-process deletions ending as a part of the policy discussion, so as far as I'm concerned, there is no longer an administrative issue to be dealt with - it's not in danger of happening again, so there's no incident to be dealt with. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 12:57, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It <i>is</i> in danger of happening again since, as Tony said, it was perfectly consistent with the practices of many xfD closers. I'd rather not see a "but he didn't count votes!" issue blow up ever again, even if on a subpage divorced from the userbox issue. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 13:42, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This close was in line with current closing practice on xFD; needless to say, all closes are subject to review. I like it for its solomonic quality, keeping the content (which is perfectly acceptable for a user page) and disposing of the problematic template. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 18:19, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>But that's the problem - this "current closing practice" is inventing a new policy that doesn't exist and is reading into the votes something that isn't there. Rather than assuming good faith, the administrators are assuming that everyone voting is a mindless robot who will vote keep arbitrarilly on every userbox. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 00:01, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As one of several admins who have been known to spend far too many hours of our lives closing xfD discussions, I take exception to your characterisation. Perhaps you'd like to review all my closings in the past six months, on AfD and elsewhere, and provide me a list of cases where I've acted in bad faith or violated policy and accepted community norms? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 13:42, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li><a href="../../../h/3A/f/Template%7EH%7Ef_Help_8ad4.html" title="Template:H:f Help">Template:H:f Help</a> says that people are entitled to copy the <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Footnotes" class="extiw" title="m:Help:Footnotes">master help page</a> at any time.</li>
<li>It also says "don't edit this copy" with respect to the <a href="../../../f/o/o/Help%7EFootnotes_8d93.html" title="Help:Footnotes">copied help page</a> here.</li>
<li>The user claims to have been reverting vandalism, but I feel that it is definitely not reverting simple vandalism (which is the only thing the 3RR excludes other than self-reverts), and may not be vandalism reverting at all.</li>

<dd>It's an odd case. There <i>were</i> four 'removals of one or more words' (the most restrictive definition of 'revert'), but Omniplex was following standard procedure in editing the meta page and copying it down... the other user was incorrectly editing the local page directly without updating the meta page. Omniplex did repeatedly cite the proper procedure to follow... and the template does say that the main meta page may be copied down 'at any time'. Given the conflicting instructions and technicality (I've had <b>admins</b> tell me they <i>didn't</i> violate 3RR when the first was a 'new edit' like the above) I'd probably have given it a pass. Wouldn't say you acted <b>in</b>correctly though. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBDunkerson</a> 14:03, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

After correcting all this, I checked his other edits, as his English was very poor, and I suspected that he might have created similar problems elsewhere. Sure enough, i found a few pages with poor English (to which I added {{<a href="../../../c/o/p/Template%7ECopyedit_5e3f.html" title="Template:Copyedit">copyedit</a>}} templates, an unsourced/uncited change to another article, and a dab page in very non-MoS style.</p>
<p>Eiorgiomugini immediately reverted my changes, removing the templates, etc. After some attempt to explain to him that this wasn't acceptable, I realised that he was just goijng to remove the templates, etc., come what may (his English is too poor for him to see the problems, but he seems not to believe or understand this). I applied a 15-minute block in order to get him to cool down, and asked him, when the block expired, to discuss the issues. instead he immediately reverted everything again. I applied a one-hour block, and made the same request.</p>
<p>It's pretty obvious, though, that this won't get through to him. Although I'm not involved at most of the articles in question, I'm reluctant to apply a longer block — and in any case I don't think that blocking is the solution. If there's anything else that I could do (or should have done differently), I'd be glad to get advice. If anyone else thinks that they might get through to him where I've failed, I'd be glad of the help. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 16:51, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with Zoe. Mel was not <i><b>"involved"</b></i> in the sense of being in a content dispute. I doubt if the article is one he has a strong POV about, and it wasn't a case of his having a longstanding grudge against a user because of past disagreements.

<p>The conclusion of the ArbCom case (ZAROVE) has removed one of the principal figures in the struggle over page content there. However edit warring has continued, and almost everyone involved can be said to be partisan and on the line of infraction of policy. I have handed out one 3RR block recently of 24 hours, and have just blocked an IP number editor User:66.174.79.233 (signs as el Lobo) for talk page comments saying I'm biased by Christian beliefs. (I have never discussed religion on WP and don't intend to start now.) Another participant <a href="../../../r/p/s/User%7ERpsugar_c3a3.html" title="User:Rpsugar">User:Rpsugar</a> is technically unblocked (but is mailing me saying not).</p>
<p>The page itself seems about as good as it may be, given the paucity of first-rate sources. There is a fair amount of off-site commentary about the dispute. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">Charles Matthews</a> 11:07, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>An IP number editor trolling, after warning? I think this is a block out of hand. There is some chance of getting a compromise version accepted. This provocative stuff on the talk page is just obstructing things. (Anyone with the stomach can go through the dozen archives and note the pretty much daily posts from el Lobo. These have not helped at all.)</p>
<p>By the way, both sides in this have attacked the 'referee'. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">Charles Matthews</a> 19:32, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>OK then. I don't feel that my one recent edit to <a href="../../../a/c/h/Acharya_S_da0e.html" title="Acharya S">Acharya S</a>, attempting to broker a compromise, puts me in a false position if I then enforce policy. It is standard practice to regard non-logged in editors with less tolerance than those editing here under a user name. If the complaint is that I have not blocked <a href="../../../a/2E/j/User%7EA.J.A._7b79.html" title="User:A.J.A.">User:A.J.A.</a> for infractions under 3RR, or for the v-word, then I would say that I want his input on the compromise version. I'm not obliged to block anyone, by the way. Discretion is the whole issue in admin action.</p>
<p>Since there is a huge amount of past history and back-story to this page, I doubt whether an admin coming fresh to it would quickly get it all. Brokering an end to the constant edit warring is substantially more useful in this context, than point-scoring and box-ticking exercises.

<dd>I've been looking into the page since last year, and Charles have been extremely neutral in keeping peace between the warring parties. I have full confidence in his mediation. Apparently, the pro-acharya group also had the same confidence when their opponent ZAROVE was being sent to Arbitration. The whole article is a quagmire ... whoever tries to bring any sanity gets pummeled by both parties, and a whole www.truthbeknown.com/wikipedia.htm website is out there lambasting any editor not liked by the subject. Similarly, before he was banned, ZAROVE filled page after page of gibberish into the talk page, making any fruitful discussion impossible. I think Charles have been more than fair in handling the page, and has not shown any bias in editing the page. Therefore <a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESOPHIA_915a.html" title="User:SOPHIA">SOPHIA</a>'s comment on Charles being an "involved" admin is misdirected. He is involved in mediation, not active in taking sides, and his placement of 3RR bans is therefore entirely within policy.

<dd>I was refering to the fact that he was the object of the supposed insult and therefore <i>is</i> directly involved. It is never a good idea for the insulted party to act unilaterally as it is possible they have responded emotively. A.J.A. has made it plain that he will not work with the other editors on this page. How is banning them, unless it is permanent, going to help? If this is the objective then it should be made plain and this can then be discussed. <a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESOPHIA_915a.html" title="User:SOPHIA"><font color="purple"><b>Sophia</b></font></a> 21:07, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I said a few days ago that I was calling the discussion to order. That I intend to do. I want to get comments on what is wrong with the current article version, and stop the warring. I'm not particularly worried about having my actions scrutinised. I never said 'insult': it was a classic <i>ad hominem</i> argument that I had acted in a biased way. As such it was both fallacious and contrary to basic policy. I'm surprised anyone should think that making full public disclosure of what I think about the situation would actually help, in one of the most intractable disputes in en-WP. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">Charles Matthews</a> 21:27, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Fact is, you should have backed down long ago, just as you said. We can't undo the past, but you can still back down now and avoid causing harm in the future.

<dd>Wow, that does seem biased. Given the amount of power admins have and the general lack of recourse available when an admin does something wrong, it seems particularly harmful for admins to block people who question their neutrality.</dd>
<dd>Thank you for clarifying some details. You've changed my mind. Initially, I suspected that the block might be sound but Charles was the wrong person to make it. Now it looks like the whole thing is Charles' error.</dd>
<dd>Once again, I request that he remove the block and recuse himself. He is clearly not unbiased here. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Al</a> 08:41, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>'Recuse' is the wrong word here. I'll gladly take the page off my watchlist, where it has been since a couple of hours after its creation, any time I feel I'm the wrong person for the (completely thankless) job.</p>
<p>I was offline for nearly all Thursday and half of Friday, which is why I wasn't tracking edits to the article. That's it. The 'el Lobo' edits could have been blocked many times in the past, for disruptive intent, soapboxing and so on. Have a look and see how few are actually discussing the page content, with a view to resolving the issues. However, they rarely stepped over the line, into obvious policy violation.</p>
<p>Also have a look at how the actual article content has been gradually brought towards NPOV, and better conformity with the guidelines on biographies of living people. I honestly think my stewardship, if I could call it that, has been of benefit to the article. I'm quite happy to have other admins operate there: I got <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">User:Oleg Alexandrov</a> involved in the past, to protect the page, when things were really bad. I accept no claim of bias against me. I think <a href="../../../%5E/%5E/j/User%7E%5E%5EJames%5E%5E_807e.html" title="User:^^James^^">User:^^James^^</a> has a partisan but rational approach to the content, and I consider that most of the points he has raised in the past have been met. I don't see that he has much to war for, on the article as it now stands. I think most of <a href="../../../a/2E/j/User%7EA.J.A._7b79.html" title="User:A.J.A.">User:A.J.A.</a>'s concerns have been met, with the inclusion of an account of critical reviews (these should be there, the question has only been in what way). I suppose he still may think the page too 'promotional' in tone. I don't want that, either, and I hope he will specify what he sees as necessary changes. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">Charles Matthews</a> 09:42, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Charles, I choose my words carefully, so when I chose "recuse", I did so quite consciously. According to m-w.com, to recuse is to "to disqualify (oneself) as judge in a particular case; broadly&#160;: to remove (oneself) from participation to avoid a conflict of interest".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I'm saying that there is an apparent conflict of interest here, which is why you should remove yourself. As others have pointed out, there is the clear and reasonable perception of unequal treatment of participants. I'm not asking you to drop the article from your watch list. However, if you're going to participate in its ongoing construction, I think you need to decide whether your role will be that of editor or admin, and stick to it.</dd>
<dd>If you're an editor, you can't wave your sysop bit around; and if you're an admin, you can't act in any way that suggests you care who wins out in the content dispute. Right now, there is at least the appearance of admin rights being used to support editorial goals, and that is bad for everyone. The cure is simple, and I've suggested it repeatedly. It surprises me that you're so resistant to it.</dd>
<dd>The relevant cliche is "if you love somebody, let them go". I urge you to show your love for <a href="../../../a/c/h/Acharya_S_da0e.html" title="Acharya S">Acharya S</a> by letting go. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Al</a> 15:13, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I believe you when you say that you have no bias on the article, but I do think some of your actions <i>appear</i> unequal. You blocked '^^James^^' for edit warring when he reverted four times in a little over 24 hours. That's alright... he just missed a technical 3RR violation, but we <b>do</b> also block for edit warring in general and he'd done so on prior days (and indeed again since the block expired) as well. But... you <b>didn't</b> block 'A.J.A.' - who was also guilty of edit warring that and previous days (and indeed has <i>also</i> continued to do so). Likewise you removed the comment by 'El Lobo' which implied that you were being biased and blocked him for the personal attack, but at the same time <i>only</i> removed 'A.J.A.' calling '^^James^^' and 'El Lobo' "vandals" and "trolls" <i>without</i> blocking her for the personal attack. Now, there may well be reasons for a judgement call that the two blocked individuals have ignored more prior warnings or been more consistently disruptive or whatever, but that is always going to be a subjective assessment and in any case is not going to be apparent to sympathetic partisans or even someone looking in from outside. When there is a dispute and you make a judgement call that 'A will get a warning' but 'B will be blocked' everyone who agrees with 'B' is inevitably going to suspect bias... and the closer the actions of 'A' and 'B' to each other the louder the howls about unfairness will be. As such I'd suggest: <b>don't</b> make judgement calls in such cases. Even if personal views <i>don't</i> color the assessment it will absolutely be perceived that way and generate further disruption. Warn 'em both or block 'em both unless there is some <b>absolutely clear</b> non-subjective difference (e.g. both edit warred, but one violated 3RR and the other did not). --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBDunkerson</a> 11:52, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I wasn't refuting the part that anyone can edit, just anyone can create an account and give their personal information. Although it would help if I read the text of COPPA better and saw "does not include any nonprofit entity that would otherwise be exempt from coverage under section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45)." Wikipedia is under the Wikimedia Foundation which is non-profit right?

<dd>I think we are exempt because we are a nonprofit (although I saw no clause 5 in the FTC act), but COPPA is pretty clear on the matter: <i>(1) IN GENERAL.—It is unlawful for an operator of a website or online service directed to children, or any operator that <b>has actual knowledge that it is collecting personal information from a child</b>, to collect personal information from a child in a manner that violates the regulations prescribed under subsection</i> - The only things we ask are for a username, password, and an optional email address.

<li>I think there should be a <i>minimum</i> age of 21 years. It seems to me that the younger users tend to either (1) use Wikipedia as their message board, sulking around pages like this, (2) vandalize pages randomly until they're blocked, or (3) write articles that only teenagers care about (e.g., non-notable bands or anime characters.) I find it disappointing that many of these younger users tend to become administrators simply because they're good at popularity contests. The older users never get praised because they aren't "cool" enough, I guess.--67.15.183.8 02:27, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

Furthermore they are from the same country, and a recent investigation by an admin revealed significant similarities between the first two. This could be another indication that these alleged users could be actually one user. The abovementioned users are being involved in rever wars, and are disrespectful of Wikipedia rules, something they proved in the near past. Additionally, they have been blocked several times, sometimes even offending administrators that carried out that action. Furthermore, some of the "users" are recruiting meatpuppets to wage their revert war. Taking any action would be appreciated, for the sake of stopping revert-warriors and users that are sworn to work against Wikipedia.

<dd>Agreed.

Personally I don't find it too garish ... I've seen worse. Or was it some other signature from Nathan? In any case, the sig looks fine to me, and as long as the user is not breaking up anything, I don't see a reason to block him for that.

<p>I'm surprised that you have to ask. Have you seen it? The signature is unnecessarily large and garish. It is stupidly large, at about 730bytes. It contains several switches of font and mode and three included images,and it also breaks vertical spacing, It distracts the eye and thus makes discussion more difficult to follow,. Nathanrdotcom had been politely asked to change it, but persisted in flaunting it while complaining about those who had requested the change. The degree of disruption caused by this ongoing monstrosity easily merited a brief block to persuade the obviously reluctant editor to stop inflicting it on the shared environment of the wiki. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 05:36, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I thank you for your insight. Yes, I have seen this "stupidly large" signature. So now we can cut to the chase; Nathan is <s>asked</s> ordered into changing his signature. Then, when he protests and simply asks for people to consider politely asking, this whole fuss comes about, and he ends up getting blocked. Why? Do I really have to ask? Yes, I do. You blocked him for bringing up a valid point, and then you have the guts to say that he was disrupting Wikipedia? Well, for future reference, trying to defend yourself politely isn't disruption. Just thought I'd let you know. Ironically, know what is disruption and violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">some Wikipedia policies?</a> I know, blocking someone because you don't like what they're doing!

<dd>My entire point is: Cyde or Kelly Martin could have rephrased their request into something a little more tactful like "Your signature contains images which are not against policy but discouraged. This is why they're discouraged: They're a strain on the servers, etc etc. Could you please change it?" <b>instead of</b> "Your sig is against policy. Change it now or else." My thanks go to Charlie.

<p>Without taking sides here, I'd like to point out that the above signature actually intrudes into the text of your own post, making it hard to read. Quite apart from the fact that it can be annoying to scan all those lines of code when posting a reply, and aside from the fact that fancy signatures can be distracting, there are some contributors whose vision problems would make reading the above post near impossible.

<dd>Personally, I'm for stripping admins who disobey policy of their sysop status. But hey, Wikipedia isn't governed by "personallies"; its the community that decides. Mr Sidaway should probably start fixing this by composing a nice, fat apology. Also, remember that <a href="../../../b/e/a/WP%7EBEANS_2a59.html" title="WP:BEANS">WP:BEANS</a> is there for a reason; if the guidebook says, "Don't push the big shiny block button unless you have a good reason to do so," that doesn't mean push the button to annihalate all people you don't like just because you can. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_of_Puppets_db54.html" title="User:Master of Puppets">Mopper</a> <a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMaster_of_Puppets_098b.html" title="User talk:Master of Puppets"><sup>Speak!</sup></a> 05:32, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Mopper. Tony Sideawy has not been desysopped for unjustly blocking a user, but Jimbo Wales desysopped a user for unblocking someone.

<dd>Hi Tony, I'm sorry, but I also feel that blocking was uncalled for in this case. While the situation did get a bit out of hand, blocking for a 1.5KB signature size is uncalled for because if you want it to be fair, you would need to block everyone with a large signature. There are cases where 1 image is larger in bytesize that 3 are. I feel a user should be free to to express themselves (within reason) in their signature and on their user page. To be fair to nathanr: Samir, I'm not sure if you realized this, but the one image in your signature (as downloaded) is 7.2 KB in size, it would be awesome if you would consider removing or replacing it (see my comment in <a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENathanrdotcom_1777.html#Images_in_sigs" title="User talk:Nathanrdotcom">User talk:nathanrdotcom#Images in sigs</a> for reasoning) but again, it's only a humble request and observation. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlie_Huggard_5a3a.html" title="User:Charlie Huggard">Charlie</a><sup>(cirl.missouri.edu/wiki/User:Charlie @CIRL | <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7ECharlie_Huggard_1b04.html" title="User talk:Charlie Huggard">talk</a>)</sup> 05:41, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>I see no good reason not to block users who persistently flaunt egregiously large and distracting signatures on discussion pages. It's not something to do often, but sometimes it is necessary.

<dd>I see a reason; policy. Find somewhere where it says you're allowed to block just because you see no reason not to do so, and I will worship you and cover the earth you walk on with rose petals. However, the sad truth is that in order to be an administrator you should obey policy. And you should know this. Administrators are the face of Wikipedia; they represent us.

<dd>Hey Exploding boy. In fairness for Nathan, his user page says he is on wikibreak so he's only coming back in limited capacity (unless he's a wikiholic like myself). Out of curiosity, Might I ask which screen reader(s)/browser(s) are you using and would you be able to point us to compliance guides for them? I'm sorry that my viewpoint on signatures continues to be it's a way for wikipedians to establish their own identity and give first expressions of themselves. For example in mine, I include my talk page so it'd be easier for people to respond to me or something i've said, as well as a link to My Bio on my research lab's site (As it's important to me and also happens to be how I got into editing wikipedia (as I installed the MediaWiki software and loved it)).

<dd>Does absolutely no-one care that Nathan has posted on his talk page that he's having a bit of a hard time at the moment?

Should shorter signatures be encouraged - maybe - but projects like <a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EEsperanza_48d5.html" title="WP:Esperanza">Esperanza</a> positively encourage you to link them in your signature. They may not be visable but when you edit the text you get the same long text problem mentioned above. I have a long signature as there are a few things that are important to me that I want people to be able to link to.

<p>Yes, I know. I'm just trying to make the point that signatures should be the least of our concerns here, and that exotic signatures can actually cause problems for some users.</p>
<p>As to your questions about my browser, I'm using IE6 and that's about all I can tell you. ("Compliance guides"?)</p>
<p>In terms of my issues with signatures, they are, I suppose, threefold: first, all that extra code in edit mode is distracting and confusing; second, they cause problems in regular mode ranging from buggering up how text is displayed to making it confusing to identify a given user, to distracting the eye when you're reading; third, I just don't see why it's necessary to modify the basic signature at all. If I want to know about you, I'll click your user name and read your user page. If I want to talk to you I'll navigate from there to your talk page. What could be more simple? And actually, fourth: I agree with the above user; whimsical signatures do nothing to promote our image (to readers or potential users) as a serious enterprise; it's bad enough we get to edit anonymously... <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExploding_Boy_5421.html" title="User:Exploding Boy">Exploding Boy</a> 06:58, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Large sigs distract when in edit mode, and if it is long in rendering length, are annoying and distrating when reading pages. This user <i>may</i> be too inclined to get into fights with "the oppressor admins" while not doing much editing, like many semi-trolls here, <i>but</i> he may also just have had a long silly sig and found him self making comments at the wrong time. A good talk comment supported by several (2-3) admins should be given, and then blocks may be handed out if a day goes by and no change.

<p>Can we please calm down the vitriol? Anyone saying Tony needs to be blocked or desysopped is just making themselves out to be reactionary and unreasonable. Let us not forget that this whole thing would've been avoided in the first place if Nathan had simply modified his sig to conform with the established guidelines upon first being asked. It's not too unreasonable to expect that editors don't have sigs that take up five lines of code in the edit window. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#0055AA"><span style="cursor: w-resize"><b>Cyde&#160;Weys</b></span></font></a> 08:17, 15 May 2006 (UTC</p>

<dd>Tony doesn't need to be blocked or desysopped; at least, not yet. Yes, this did start partly because of Nathan, but thats a point of view. For example, had you asked politely, this also could've been avoided. Not saying its your fault, but look what happened when Charlie asked; he suggested a compromise, and voila! A reaction. I realise you may think you didn't bully him or anything, but if you want someone to do something the best action to take is to try to be polite. So to sum up, lets forget the could've-been-avoided-if thing, as that won't help, and try to drop the conflict. Tony still hasn't apologised, by the way. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_of_Puppets_db54.html" title="User:Master of Puppets">Mopper</a> <a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMaster_of_Puppets_098b.html" title="User talk:Master of Puppets"><sup>Speak!</sup></a> 08:22, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I did ask politely. There was not a hint of malice in my initial contact.

Again, something like "Hi, I just saw your signature and it seemed a little disruptive... I was just wondering if you could remove the images, as they can slow down load times, etc. I respect that it is your property however. Thanks, ~~~~". Something like that would've gone a long way.

<dd>Just to be a bit of a devils advocate in this segment of the discussion: according to <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html#Don.27t_sign_what_you_don.27t_own" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> the signature is a place to "own" your input on a discussion or vote. It's true that the content of wikipedia and even of this discussion is GPDL licenced, but like a regular signature the text signature here I feel is akin to a calling card. Hypothetically If i changed my signature to read "Jimbo Wales" with a link to his user page, that would get me banned for impersonating another user, likewise if I started forging others signatures on checks or illegitimate paintings I'd be thrown in jail. While I may find some signatures to possibly be in poor taste (l33t is just of my peeves), I recognize the fact that they are how that user has chosen to portray themselves in the community and barring impersonation, extreme bandwidth load, and breaking of other text and formatting on the page, I feel a signature should be how the user desires it to be. I do not understand the argument that over the top signatures reflect poorly on wikipedia, because I see it as a reflection of the individual. Someone reading this discussion could see that there is a pretty good balance between those with fancy and rather plain signatures, so I don't think large signatures reflect poorly on the community as a whole. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlie_Huggard_5a3a.html" title="User:Charlie Huggard">Charlie</a><sup>(cirl.missouri.edu/wiki/User:Charlie @CIRL | <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7ECharlie_Huggard_1b04.html" title="User talk:Charlie Huggard">talk</a>)</sup> 15:31, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Tony's block seems fine to me. Posting a lot of useless, space-consuming crap on many talk pages seems to fit the definition of disruption. In this case, we even have a specific guideline on the issue, which means it's doubly bad. If you keep being disruptive after being warned, you'll be blocked. And if you keep doing it after that, you'll be blocked again. The lesson: don't disrupt Wikipedia. This doesn't seem very complicated. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 19:43, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>(ec) Sorry I'm a little late to the discussion, but I feel that this block was also unnecessary given the circumstances. Blocks are supposed to be a last resort and are not supposed to be punitive; generally, you warn people that they will be blocked if they continue (i.e. the {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest_d929.html" title="Template:Test">test</a>}} system, etc.). While I also frown upon images in signatures (I've also asked a few people in the past to modify their signatures), a block for having a heated discussion was uncalled for at the time; though I'm not condoning Nathan's actions here, the fact was that his signature and his actions were not disruptive enough to justify a block, given that he disagreed with the guideline and was talking about that with other people on his talk page. For what it's worth, I thank him for finally removing the images, and feel that the two people who initially talked to him were perfectly civil; Kelly Martin was especially tactful and correct. Finally, just a note: "persistently flaunting a stupidly large and garish signature" is an <i>opinion</i>, and comparisons to Ril's signature aren't valid because Ril's signature was mimicking wiki-syntax (~~~~), while Nathanrdotcom's was not.

I don't really know how to handle this , I've put some user warning templates on his talk page (or those of his ip's) as I came across restoring his POV spamming, but he has removed warnings before, and I suppose he'll just continue his personal vanity article and small unnoticed additions in some other articles... --<a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimoWreck_58ea.html" title="User:LimoWreck">LimoWreck</a> 18:09, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

I will assume good faith with this Wiki's Avillia. <a href="../../../d/g/x/User%7EDGX_7ea7.html" title="User:DGX"><font color="#00FF00">D</font><font color="#000000">G</font></a><a href="../../../d/g/x/User_talk%7EDGX_0a84.html" title="User talk:DGX"><font color="#00FF00">X</font></a> 03:53, 23 May 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>YTMNDWiki's structure (ANI, CSD, STUBS) and it's similarity to Wikipedia easily suggest that those who got the Wiki created have a fair grasp of Wikipedia's <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> bureaucracy.</li>
<li>My userpage comes up first in a Google search for Avillia, a search query which mostly contains references which are mine, by the way.</li>
<li>I'm at least somewhat known on the YTMND forums, for my direct involvement there once apon a time and my involvement in a break-off forum.</li>
<li>And, just for the sake of Tinfoil Hattery, do you really think I would go on YTMNDWiki with the name Avillia and blatantly vandalise <i>again</i> <i><b>knowing</b></i> that YTMNDWiki was under watch by Wikipedia? Compare to the IRC exploitation just before the second attempt to indefinite block me.</li>

<dd>I am currently online. The block isn't based directly on the willy on wheels connection but as per <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUsername_0c30.html#Inappropriate_usernames" title="Wikipedia:Username">Wikipedia:Username#Inappropriate_usernames</a>, "Names of religious figures such as "God" or "Allah", which may offend other people's beliefs". "Mohammed on wheels", "Allah on wheels" etc. would be similarly offensive. The fact that he is known under that name elsewhere makes it no less offsensive, if we got someone here saying they had always been known as "fuck you" (to choose an extreme example) we'd still block as an inappropriate username. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User%7EPgk_d0c7.html" title="User:Pgk">pgk</a><sup>(<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk"><font color="mediumseagreen">talk</font></a>)</sup> 17:15, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dunno if that's so cut-and-dried—millions of people are named Jesus.

<p>He should certainly change his username. Any of us who sees 'Jesus on Wheels' in their watchlist will be automatically reaching for the banhammer. It's unfortunate that he's had it for so long, but this is because he hasn't made many edits and few of them have been in articlespace. Now that he's been noticed, the name needs to be changed. Although it's an old account, WoW is a year older than him. I don't believe <a href="../../../u/_/_/WP%7EU_ebb9.html" title="WP:U">WP:U</a> has a statute of limitations. (after edit conflict: plus what Pgk pointed out about religious names). --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 17:22, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>After some discussion, I've decided to unblock as I've seen his edits and they seem fine. If someone can convince him that he should change his name, that'll be even better, but judging by his comments on his user page and talk page, that seems unlikely (but I tried anyway). --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 17:29, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>He will probably get blocked over and over again, that's just the way things are, because of our experiences with WoW. He can either accept that and change his username, or not accept that and accept getting blocked everytime an admin sees his name come by. It might be his username in other places, but on Wikipedia, it just won't work. --<a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoanneB_e69b.html" title="User:JoanneB">Joann</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../j/o/a/User_talk%7EJoanneB_dae6.html" title="User talk:JoanneB">B</a> 17:49, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
