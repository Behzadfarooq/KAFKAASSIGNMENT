<p>Kiand along with others has just been engaged in stopping Mr. Work's endless POVs and abuse of people in articles with whom he disagrees.

He himself was put on notice for his potentially litigiously injurious remarks, <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Archive19_88cc.html#User:Aidan_Work" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Archive19">Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/Archive19#User:Aidan_Work</a>, where user Chris O said prophetically in closing on Dec. 12 that "no doubt we'll be hearing more of Mr Work in due course".</p>
<p>Despite much reversion, and notes on his talk page, and blockings, and notes in the history summaries of pages he has worked on, Aidan Work persists in 1) violating Wikipedia Style guidelines such as placing links in section headers, 2) mis-using the English written language in an encyclopediac context ("&amp;", "2" instead of "two", semicolons in place of colons), 3) The term British Commonwealth has not been the official term since 1946 and therefore is not applicable to periods or entities since then, 4) Pushing the name Ulster beyond the proper bounds of its use, 5) Pushing the term "Dominion" in contexts where it has been abandoned, 6) pushing a monarchist agenda by introducing and over-emphasizing references to royalty and peerage even where un-warranted, 7) making vicious homophobic remarks on talk pages, 8) equating the Sinn Fein (and by extension any republicans) to "sub-humans", hence his attempt to insult Kiand that way in this very notice, 9) abusing the notice board process with bogus notices because he is upset his agendas are being thwarted on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it often happens that this type of personality maintains a high degree of anger and grievance at the world until possibly, but not even then necessarily, old age brings a small measure of wisdom. I move that his note here be ignored and that special attention be focused on his edits, in an effort to get Mr. Work to understand that pushing an agenda uphill doesn't work and that cooperation is much more effective. <a href="../../../h/u/_/User%7EHu_5903.html" title="User:Hu">Hu</a> 01:28, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

Aidan Work reacts very badly to these changes, with anger and spurious charges of vandalism.

<p>Aiden Work has created a lot of work for editors and administrators on wikipedia by persisting in not following conventions and policies, for instance the rfc stated previously details some of them. Many people had in the early stages realised he was a new contributor and deserved some consideration as is usually given, however he has repeatedly insisted on not following conventions and policies (using outdated and pov terms, and ignoring the manual of style - for instance using the period for article titles) and theirfore I would have to conclude that any complaint against Kiand is unfounded. <a href="../../../d/j/e/User%7EDjegan_c54c.html" title="User:Djegan">Djegan</a> 01:48, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>For what it's worth, I agree with this. I've also seen Aidan's POV-pushing on various Irish republican-related pages, his bizarre attempt to label Sinn Fein a fascist organisation, and his refusal to cite sources (e.g. "You don't need sources, as Gerry Adams' bigoted views are common knowledge anyway"). See some discussion on <a href="../../../t/a/l/User_talk%7ETalrias_Archive_2006-01-18_11b7.html#Sinn_Fein.2FI.R.A._is_a_fascist_organisation.." title="User talk:Talrias/Archive 2006-01-18">my talk page</a>. I think Aidan is fundamentally missing the point that this is an encyclopaedia. <a href="../../../t/a/l/User%7ETalrias_6b30.html" title="User:Talrias">Talrias</a> (<a href="../../../t/a/l/User_talk%7ETalrias_9ef0.html" title="User talk:Talrias">t</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Talrias_7d2c.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Talrias">e</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Talrias_2658.html" title="Special:Contributions/Talrias">c</a>) 10:46, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I more or less agree with Talrias; mr. Work seems to be of the opinion that he somehow has ownership regarding articles he's started, and generally disregarding (ignoring?) the whole concept of Wikipedia by refering to <a href="../../../k/i/a/User%7EKiand_8457.html" title="User:Kiand">Kiand</a> and <a href="../../../h/u/_/User%7EHu_5903.html" title="User:Hu">Hu</a> as vandals when they corrected/edited some of his articles. I've also tried to contact him via his talkpage on a few occasions, to offer any advice on where to find guidelines, but have not recieved any answer from him. <a href="../../../b/j/e/User%7EBjelleklang_549f.html" title="User:Bjelleklang">Bjelleklang</a> - <a href="../../../b/j/e/User_talk%7EBjelleklang_ea22.html" title="User talk:Bjelleklang">talk</a> 03:02, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Had I not been so close to the action I'd have blocked Work indefinitely a long time ago. How many more times will good editors be subjected to his abuse before he gets his just desserts? Abuse like the following -- <i>"as seen as you had the cheek to make a personal attack on me,I will be putting your name at the top of the 'Bigoted Wikipedians' list. As far as I can see,you're a low-life scumbag! Do you know why? Firstly, because you've admitted to being a Commie,a republican pig who supports Sinn Fein/I.R.A. terrorism,&amp;,of course,you've admitted to being a pro-faggot,which in itself means that you will burn up in the Lake of Fire in Hell along with the Nazi Pope of Rome! There is one good faggot - a dead one! One which has either been shot or blown up!"</i>.

<p>That is just a small selection of his antics in <i>January 2006</i>!!!</p>
<p>He has also set up phoney redirect pages in ludicrous forms (eg, all in capitals but with no links, articles including a period at the end of the title, etc). He has posted large amounts of garbage, made rascist attacks, pushed blatently POV agendas in articles, tried to turn pages into propaganda, etc etc.</p>
<p>Given the abuse, the attacks, the breaking of Wikipedia policy, the demands that users seek his permission to edit "his" articles, and now above a phrase against gay people that would lead to his presecution in many jurisdictions over "incitement to hatred" I have blocked him indefinitely from the site. We have enough to be dealing without having users constantly abused by a rascist homophobic bigot day after day. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:#006666; background-color:orange"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 04:27, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If there is something remotely suitable to redirect to, you can do that and protect that too. The policy on the deletedpage template seems to imply it should only be used temporarily, which I find a bit odd. Either way if a really good reason comes up to have the article it can still be discussed on the talk page so there's no major problem. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 15:57, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think {{<a href="../../../d/e/l/Template%7EDeletedpage_0567.html" title="Template:Deletedpage">deletedpage</a>}} should be used indefinitely. It's not like any admin should be arsed to come back in a week and remove the template from GEORGE BUSH SUCKS DICKS because someone might have a good reason to create an article with that title, and most of the time someone used the template, it was on an article that should never be created in any form. Maybe we need to revise the policy. --<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_Delaney_f359.html" title="User:Ryan Delaney">Ryan Delaney</a> <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyan_Delaney_8333.html" title="User talk:Ryan Delaney"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 03:31, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's what I think obviously. I guess the downside is it makes a blue link, but that's not really a problem for readers of Wikipedia because they should never see a link to an article with deletedpage on it.

I suspect that if we can engage him we will end up in a better position than if we lock him out, so you might want to reconsider on the sole grounds that no warning was issued on his Talk page and he wasn't properly warned on the article's page either.

<p>Outdenting again for clarity. I have had an email from him: it does seem that he knows (or knew) pretty much nothing about policy, and is in a blind panic about the article because of the timing, which may have been deliberate on the part of person who posted it. Here is his email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most of this stuff is total nonsence. There are references to it but not genuine ones. It is being put up by a character called Richard Woods who originally used the identity of a photographer who works for me to post it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The original posting was put on Wikipedia on 6th January. It was then edited and then sent out separately by e mail to 3,000 readers and cutomers at a crucial time for our business when we are trying to renew subscriptions. The impression was that this was an independent biography published by Wikipedia.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This is turning into a disaster and if you leave this up we will go out of business and ten people will lose their jobs.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The people who have done it have also managed to move it up the Google search list so when people are googling the first thing they see is this.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If this was a genuine biography the people who posted it would not need to steal someone else's identity to post it. And they would be open with their own identity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Can you please do something about and put the stub up until this is investigated. I don't mind a fair biography but this is hurtful rubbish.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, I'm not suggesting that ten jobs outweighs policy - if the man is a shit, we should say so, in neutral terms of course, but this does highlight that he saw a pressing need to fix the problem. It is also largely my fault that he violated 3RR because I rolled back when I should have reverted to Tearlach's stub - Tearlach was absolutely right to do that, I have seen Jimbo do the same and I have been there before so I should have known and have now fixed it. So I think the 3RR could legitimately be put down to a combination of clueless newbieism and me inadvertently pouring petrol on the flames. I have advised him that debate is best conducted on talk pages, and that <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> is not there for fun, so I'll see how he responds. Meantime, I'm trying to get some neutral biographies (profiles from business papers etc.) It is undoubtedly the case that he has been sued, but so have <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Ingrams_6204.html" title="Richard Ingrams">Richard Ingrams</a> and <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Hislop_1212.html" title="Ian Hislop">Ian Hislop</a> (many times), and I note that his travails were at least partly at the hands of Carter-<s>F</s>Ruck and partners (<a href="http://www.carter-ruck.com/recentwork/Donnelly-Judgment.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.carter-ruck.com/recentwork/Donnelly-Judgment.html" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>) so I am almost sympathetic; the phrase "his legal costs, which are likely to be substantial" is a masterpiece of understatement where Carter-Ruck is concerned&#160;:-)</p>
<p>Anyway, I'd like to suggest that at least the block be shortened to the original 24h, since I am to blame for the escalation.

<p>I'm pleased to see Google now shows the stub version. Worth putting a block on the article itself for the moment? (I'm also partly to blame, by temporarily restoring a slightly toned-down version of the "bad" one because it looked superficially OK as references had been cited).</p>
<p>This is a pretty nasty attack, as it was obviously professionally written. As I've said to JzG, the details, individually, mostly check out; a skim of the NewsBank newspaper archive shows these legal cases aren't made up. However, with the "bad version" it looks well likely that they're cherry-picked to give a uniformly negative impression, and there's a lot of weasel phraseology. For instance, you don't get "prosecuted" (terminology from criminal law) for civil cases. <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a> 15:23, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Input would be appreciated regarding when it's appropriate to block over a fair-use copyright disagreement (text or images).</p>
<p>On January 11, Alkivar added to <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">Wikipedia:Blocking policy</a>: "Jimbo has stated that any user with a repeat history of copyright violation can and should be blocked. The blocking admin should use their best judgement regarding the prior giving and heeding of warnings as appropriate."</p>
<p>Some admins have interpreted this to mean that they're allowed to block an editor who restores an image that they have removed, which is getting close to using admin powers over a content dispute. I would therefore like to word the section so that it offers more protection to editors who are acting in good faith, where the copyright status of the material has not been established. The suggested compromise on the talk page is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Editors who repeatedly add to articles text that has been plagiarized, or images the use of which would clearly amount to a copyright violation — or where a formal complaint from the copyright holder has been received by the Wikimedia Foundation — may be blocked under the disruption provision of this policy. In cases where an editor is acting in good faith and the copyright status is unclear, the editor should not be blocked.

<dd>The above version seems fair, I would add that an emphasis on the word <i>clearly</i> is put in the first sentence. Copyright law is filled with grey areas, and I don't trust any grey areas to the current state of mob rule many editors try to impose on others around here, good faith or not. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist"><font color="#4682B4"><i><b>Karm</b></i></font></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_03e8.html" title="WP:ESP"><font color="#00FF00"><i><b>a</b></i></font></a><a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKarmafist_6c43.html" title="User talk:Karmafist"><font color="#E32636"><i><b>fist</b></i></font></a> 21:52, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think anyone would attempt a block where the user was acting in good faith. You can't act in good faith and knowingly upload a suspect copyright violation at the same time.

<dd>That doesn't make sense. You can easily be acting in perfectly good faith and be blatantly violating copyright. Believe it or not, most people don't know the first thing about copyright law. Also, in many cultures copyright is so diminished that no one even thinks about it (say, in China). You would have these people blocked because they're ignorant of our laws regarding copyright? I think that's a bit extreme. --<b><a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde">Cyde Weys</a></b> <a href="../../../t/w/o/Wikipedia%7ETwo-millionth_topic_pool_6995.html" title="Wikipedia:Two-millionth topic pool"><font style="background: #000000" face="Impact" color="#00A5FF">2M-VOTE</font></a> 14:07, 18 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hello all.

If you don’t, that’s fine: we can try waiting and see if he’s learned his lesson. Given the diff is one of his first ten edits back after a year’s ban (and I’d encourage you to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Irismeister_c7b7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Irismeister">review the others</a> if you want to see how else he’s spending his time), I feel as though his meaning is pretty clear. Thanks in advance for any help you care to offer (and any advice you may offer, if you think I’m overreacting—I would be open to hearing such an argument). Unless/Until he's banned, I'd humbly suggest somebody keep an eye on Irismeister's contributions: having played that role twice to the limits of my ability to handle stress, I doubt I'll be as proactive this go-round. <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 07:24, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, I find that statement "<i>And you thought you can spread lies and libel endlessly, without yet another judicial procedure and without your being personally and financially accountable in a court of law...</i>" a blatant threat. I have blocked for three days, to give us time to discuss block duration here (meaning I'm not saying I think it should necessarily be three days). I have a further question though, and it's this: why is Irismeister back? This case is from a while back, but looking at the history of <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrismeister_1f35.html" title="User:Irismeister">User:Irismeister</a>, where the log of ban resets was being recorded, I find that the ban was reset in March of this year <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Irismeister&amp;diff=10894780&amp;oldid=10827644" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Irismeister&amp;diff=10894780&amp;oldid=10827644" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> by Theresa Knott, and as such Irismeister should still be banned. In fact, any of these edits he's been making may as well reset the ban another year, and considering the immediate legal threat, I don't see a great reason why not to.

<dd>Well earliest should be 5th March 06 as that's when the ban was last reset.

<dd>OK. As an administrator I consider that to be a legal threat.

<p><br />
In three years I have found the people who are easiest to work with, and most honest to deal with, are those who are totally open about their viewpoints. It didn't matter whether they were liberal or conservative, Catholic of Jew, pro-life or pro-choice, being open about who they are and their viewpoint enabled a reasoned, intelligent debate to ensue and meant people knew what viewpoints x or y would add into an article. I have found userboxes a godsend in that regard. Rather than having to write a long explanation of who they are, they can communicative their viewpoint quickly and effectively using a userbox. Others can use them to A line has to be drawn but most user boxes IMHO are perfectly valid. The genie is out of the bottle on userboxes. They cannot now be deleted without provoking a Wikipedia civil war. All we can do is try to ensure <i>extremely offensive</i> users (eg, <i>This user hates queers</i>, <i>This user wants Israel wiped out</i>, <i>This user hates blacks</i>) aren't used. The last thing WP needs is about outbreak of political correctness on WP, whereby users are banned from saying what their political or religious identity is. Allowing people to state their preferences also would enable WP to disprove claims of bias by showing that it has conservative users and liberal users, pro-israel and pro-palestinian users, pro-life and pro-choice, etc. Imposing censorship would frankly be a disaster that would drive many users away. Already the forced deletion by a cabal of a reference to a pro-life group on users has offended many and driven away some of our best contributors. People should be entitled as of right under free speech to say who they are and what their views are. Either user pages are deleted <i>altogether</i> or people should be given the right to reveal as much as they wish about their views. <b>Free speech in a free encyclopaedia demands no less.</b></p>

<p>It <i>you</i> feel hostility because of a box, then <i>you</i> have the issue. People are perfectly entitled in an open society to express their opinion. Saying you oppose Bush, the House of Saud, abortion, Scientology, or whatever is your right. Saying Bush should be killed, the House of Saud all massacred, that pro-choice people are child killers, that scientologists are a threat to mankind, etc moves from free speech to incitement to hatred. <i>That</i> is unacceptable. Most of us much prefer knowing that 'User:v' is right wing, 'w' is left wing, 'x' is pro-life, that 'y' is pro-Bush and 'z' is anti-Bush, to not knowing.

<p>To give a practical example, three editors I can think of hold strongly republican viewpoints on Northern Ireland. One is up front and honest and is respected by all sides for his honesty he strives to use neutral language in all his edits. Two others never declared their POV but spend their time sneaking into articles to change NPOV language to pro-republican language, deleting links that don't support their agenda, all while <i>pretending</i> to be neutral. So while when the first guy enters, Irish users (a) know his viewpoint, and (b) know his trustworthiness, when either of the other two edit the edits have to be checked line by line to see what little barbs and POVs have they sneaked in <i>this</i> time. The first guy has never been involved in an edit war, even though he holds strong views. The other two, who feign neutrality, provoke edit wars everywhere they go. I am always happy to see POV userboxes on pages because it tells me the person is being upfront and honest about any agendas or viewpoints they have. It is when I see no userbox explaining their views, yet find they are engaged in heavy POVing, that I get suspicious about what is going on. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:#006666; background-color:orange"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 21:00, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Couldn't users just tell people about themselves on their talk pages, without having to use userboxes? Do we need such rapid characterization of users, or are users so lazy that they can't write a little about themselves and have to resort to userboxes? "I'd like to tell other editors I hate Eskimos, but I'm just too lazy." ;-) But seriously, you'll be able to tell whether they are biased by their edits. Having a userbox just tells you their beliefs or where they're from, not whether they will add NNPOV content. All content should be checked, regardless of who it comes from. Userboxes should not be used to identify which users may be biased (by their presence or absence). Who the content comes from does not matter. What matters is the content and whether it is verifiable.</p>

<p>Also, userboxes make it look like Wikipedia supports the user's beliefs because the template makes it "official looking".

<p>Ok, I just stubbled upon this category. This is probably the most broad category ever made on Wikipedia. Do you know how much of a hassle it's going to be to list EVERY single person who's alive. That's a pretty useless, if you ask me. I don't think we need a category to help us divide the people who are alive. I think Categories should group people/things that are unique. Unique in bieng able to list a few people/things into a category of something specific that not everyone has. Something that broad like if their alive or not is hardly useful. IMHO, I think this should be deleted, but I wasn't sure if everyone would agree with me or not so I posted the message here. <a href="../../../s/w/d/User%7ESWD316_5e06.html" title="User:SWD316"><font color="#FF0000">S</font><font color="#EE0000">W</font><font color="#DD0000">D</font><font color="#CC0000">3</font><font color="#BB0000">1</font><font color="#AA0000">6</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/w/d/User_talk%7ESWD316_2795.html" title="User talk:SWD316"><font color="#0000FF">talk to m</font></a></sup><sup><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#00FF00">e</font></a></sup> 06:46, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I prefer it too, by much, but it seems to me more pious than useful to eschew IRC and the Mailing list to that end, and encourage others to do the same. If there were no IRC and no Mailing List, editors would surely simply e-mail one another through the "E-mail this user" feature even more than they do now, <i>and</i> they would continue to discuss Wikipedia business in these mails. Would you disable the e-mail feature? And also, how hard would it be for users to find other real-time internet venues? I don't believe it's anyways possible to stop Wikipedians from talking Wikipedia business privately. IMO it's a little better that they do so on IRC and the ML, where there is at least continual open discussion which reminds people of the ethical issues involved, than to be driven wholly underground (or into venues that only the techiest among us can find). Let's avoid separating the admins off into special channels, let's keep them visible to at least those non-admin who do choose to frequent the same spaces; I think that's the best we can do. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 01:11, 23 January 2006 (UTC).

<dd>Well, I disagree. I'd blow up the IRC channel in a minute, if I had the chance. For every piece of business done there that couldn't be done on the project (VIP, DR, AN, AN/I), there are ten pieces of distortion, chat, and piling on. If I go to IRC, I chat, as, other than emergency issues, it's fairly useless to actually unlimber an argument. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:09, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Playing devil's advocate, the only possible reason to do something like this is to have a page protected so that only admins can discuss (still readable to public) is to help reduce the signal to noise ratio (if there is any). — <span style="font-variant:small-caps;font-family:sans-serif;"><a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbush_Commander_08e2.html" title="User:Ambush Commander">Ambush Commander</a></span><sup style="font-family:serif;">(<a href="../../../a/m/b/User_talk%7EAmbush_Commander_60e0.html" title="User talk:Ambush Commander">Talk</a>)</sup> 04:28, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Since I suggested that admins wishing to make changed to Mediawiki: space pages should run them through here, I thought I'd do so.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, a couple of days ago, <a href="../../../p/r/o/MediaWiki%7EProtectedpagewarning_f91d.html" title="MediaWiki:Protectedpagewarning">MediaWiki:Protectedpagewarning</a> began being very confusingly displayed on semi-protected pages, which people can and are encouraged to edit. Presumably the devs tweaked something for us. Anyway, it needs rephrasing until the problem is fixed. So I'd suggest some phrasing like:</p>

<p>I have made the following <s>official complaint</s> (this is somewhat misleading... what I really meant here is that I made a formal complaint. It's been pointed out my sig maybe somewhat misleading, however it is not: I am a Wikipedia admin) to the BBC (form can be found <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/complaints/make_complaint_step1.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/complaints/make_complaint_step1.shtml" rel="nofollow">here</a>, I recomend that as many people as possible fill this out so they will know our disgust at such irresponsible behaviour: UK people are <i>especially</i> encouraged to fill this out):</p>
<dl>
<dd>I wish to make a formal complaint in regards to your radio show "The Scott Mills Show". On January 19 they made various edits to the free online encyclopedia, Wikipedia that were false and/or ridiculous (for instance, they wrote "Edith has been romanticly linked with an ironing board." on the Edith Bowman article).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I can provide exact links of where they did this, we maintain an audit log of every change that we make. They also had to create an account "Joshworkinghard". When they log in to the site, they are expected to follow certain site policies: these can be found at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Policies_and_guidelines" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Policies_and_guidelines" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Policies_and_guidelines</a> One of the policies is our policy on adding absurd or ridiculous information, which we class as a form of vandalism. They appear not to have followed this policy.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>My complaint is that a media organisation appears to have decided that it is OK to vandalise our website, with the participants seemingly paying no thought to the consequences of their actions, or the reputation of the BBC. After all, I was not aware that the BBC, a respectable institution, condoned and encouraged vandalism!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Would Scott Mills and Mark Chapman create an account on Kuro5hin or slashdot and then proceed to add malicious or ridiculous information? There are similarly easy ways of gaining accounts on these websites, methods in which you will not be identified. The point that Scott and Mark were apparently trying to make was that anyone can edit the website with impunity.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps I should put this a different way. You can go to a public space where there is no surveillance underway, grab a can of spraypaint and then vandalise the wall. You would do this with impunity. Does this mean that the DJs of radio shows should broadcast that they are vandalising public property because they can get away with it? I think that the answer here is fairly clear.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So, to summarise: I would like to make a complaint about the conduct of your employees, Scott Mills and Mark Chapman when they vandalised various pages, of which I can provide detailed evidence. I would like to know what the BBC's position is on the deliberate vandalising of Wikipedia, or of any other website that are publicly available. Does the BBC encourage or condone such actions?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, I would like to request that you cease and desist from such actions. We provide a valuable service to the public, and while we have some issues of vandalism from individuals, we NEVER expected to see such an august institution as the BBC participating in such petty and irresponsible actions.</dd>

<dd>Yes, they continued to vandalize after being reverted several times in the span of a few minutes.

<dd>When you sign a letter Wikipedia Administrator you are writing on behalf of the organisation, or so it appears.

No-one is denying that you have the post of administrator within Wikipedia, what you don't have is the authority to speak <i>for</i> Wikipedia. I'll try and give an example to make things clearer. If one is elected as an officer of a trade union for example - you can support a campaign without the permission of the Union by signing it (Personal Capacity).

<p>I wish to make a formal complaint regarding your radio show 'The Scott Mills Show'. On the 19th January, Scott Mills and Mark Chapman made various edits to the free online encyclopedia, Wikipedia that were false and/or ridiculous. For instance, they wrote 'Edith has been romantically linked with an ironing board.' in the article regarding Edith Bowman). The Wikipedia has a number of policies to help guide people towards producing a better encyclopaedia, when logging in it is assumed that these will be followed. A copy of these policies and guidelines can be found at this url: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Policies_and_guidelines" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Policies_and_guidelines" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Policies_and_guidelines</a>. One of the policies relates to adding plainly ridiculous, insulting or obscene material to articles. This is described as vandalism and is not allowed. In the process of their editing they ignored this rule. Logs are kept of every change made and details can be provided of exactly when, where and from which IP the vandalism was made. Presumably if they are editing the encyclopaedia whilst working at the BBC, they are editing it in a professional capacity. I would assume that you have some clause in their contract which explicitly forbids them from certain actions while working as they are your representatives. I would like to know what the BBC's position is on the deliberate vandalising of Wikipedia, or of any other website that are publicly available. Does the BBC encourage or condone such actions? I'm sure that the BBC would not be particularly impressed if a 'hacker' were to vandalise the BBC home page to make a point. While editing false, misleading or obscene content into Wikipedia is not illegal in the same way as 'hacking', the principle is the same, disrupting a website in order to make a point. I would appreciate it if the stars of your radio show would refrain from vandalising the Wikipedia and also refrain from inciting others to vandalism.</p>

<p>I don't understand this reference to MOS at all. Mackensen,have you reviewed the MOS section you link to recently, are you sure you remember it right? As far as I can see, it shows that there is no policy, and no recommendation, for such cases; it says "The inclusion of some honorific prefixes and styles has proved controversial". That's it. How do you figure Giano is "acting against" <i>that</i>? The only actual policy mentioned by the MoS is that for royalty and popes we <i>don't</i> include comparable honorifics. That obviously doesn't mean that we do include them for nobility; theoretically it's not relevant at all, and insofar as it's a hint, it implies the opposite.<br />
OK, this issue should go to the policy pages in question (where, again, are they?), but Giano's "moan" is appropriate on this page in regard to the behavior of <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProteus_e939.html" title="User:Proteus">User:Proteus</a>, who has been persistently reverting him over many pages. Proteus isn't — just — in breach of the 3RR (it takes 4 reverts within 24 hours to be that) but he's certainly keeping just inside the 3RR<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arthur_Wellesley%2C_1st_Duke_of_Wellington&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arthur_Wellesley%2C_1st_Duke_of_Wellington&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[34]</a>, reverting the same change persistently on a number of articles, referring bad-temperedly to policy<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arthur_Wellesley%2C_1st_Duke_of_Wellington&amp;diff=36146049&amp;oldid=36144704" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arthur_Wellesley%2C_1st_Duke_of_Wellington&amp;diff=36146049&amp;oldid=36144704" rel="nofollow">[35]</a> without saying where it's to be found (apparently nowhere, so I can understand that), and some of the time using admin rollback to revert<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Murray_Beauclerk%2C_14th_Duke_of_St_Albans&amp;diff=36138523&amp;oldid=36109932" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Murray_Beauclerk%2C_14th_Duke_of_St_Albans&amp;diff=36138523&amp;oldid=36109932" rel="nofollow">[36]</a>, implying that Giano's edits are vandalism.

<dd>I would disagree with your interpretation. Unexplained deletions from articles, when there is strong consensus that they should remain, is hardly the way to go about things. The manual of style notes that such usage, while not universally accepted, is common. That's pretty solid for the MOS. I would also note that <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Peerage_7ab7.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Peerage">WikiProject Peerage</a>, which does its level best to keep articles on peers, baronets, and British politicians in order, regards the use of honorific prefixes as standard practice. Giano's complaint against these prefixes seems to be that of many Americans; he regards them as antiquated appendages. That may well be, but they're still in use today. If he wants to get ride of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Most_Noble_e29c.html" title="The Most Noble">The Most Noble</a> then he's going to have to delete <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Right_Honourable_66e6.html" title="The Right Honourable">The Right Honourable</a> as well. I think Proteus was perfectly justified in reverting these unexplained deletions. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 19:19, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The Manual of Style doesn't force you to do anything, but stand this on its head: <b>nowhere</b> is there justification for just removing honorific prefixes. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 19:22, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm strongly against the use of these prefixes. I have checked all the main encyclopedias and biographical dictionaries and they are not used in these so I don't see why Wikipedia should use them. Arniep 19:30, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you for responding to me above, Mackensen. I'm glad to see you back-pedalling on the claim that Giano's "acting against the Manual of Style". Looking for the "wider community involvement" you mention: I see a very modest discussion on the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Peerage_c8b4.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Peerage">Project Peerage talkpage</a>, under "Honorific prefixes", dating from last summer and with four (4) users taking part, wherein Proteus suggests honorifics be used, the others appear well enough pleased, and Proteus dismisses a question from one of them about how/when to decide on this "proposed policy" by saying: "We don't normally have a formal approval process. As it's been here for a while and no one seems to have objected, I suppose it could now be considered an acceptable policy." Is <i>this</i> the consensus you refer to ...? Then perhaps you need to bear in mind that consensus is subject to change, especially if it consists of four users on an, uh, not high-profile talkpage. Style <i>policy</i>, AFAIC, is the MoS.</dd>
<dd>On the rollback issue: Giano removed the honorific with in every case an at least somewhat explanatory edit summary<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Churchill%2C_1st_Duke_of_Marlborough&amp;diff=36110534&amp;oldid=34941578" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Churchill%2C_1st_Duke_of_Marlborough&amp;diff=36110534&amp;oldid=34941578" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Somerset%2C_11th_Duke_of_Beaufort&amp;diff=36110068&amp;oldid=31379280" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Somerset%2C_11th_Duke_of_Beaufort&amp;diff=36110068&amp;oldid=31379280" rel="nofollow">[39]</a> , <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Murray_Beauclerk%2C_14th_Duke_of_St_Albans&amp;diff=36109932&amp;oldid=34278142" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Murray_Beauclerk%2C_14th_Duke_of_St_Albans&amp;diff=36109932&amp;oldid=34278142" rel="nofollow">[40]</a> (A fuller argument by Giano on talk would have been better, I agree.

Proteus rolled him back without any explanation at all. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Churchill%2C_1st_Duke_of_Marlborough&amp;diff=36138496&amp;oldid=36110534" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Churchill%2C_1st_Duke_of_Marlborough&amp;diff=36138496&amp;oldid=36110534" rel="nofollow">[41]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Somerset%2C_11th_Duke_of_Beaufort&amp;diff=36138507&amp;oldid=36110068" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Somerset%2C_11th_Duke_of_Beaufort&amp;diff=36138507&amp;oldid=36110068" rel="nofollow">[42]</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Murray_Beauclerk%2C_14th_Duke_of_St_Albans&amp;diff=36138523&amp;oldid=36109932" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Murray_Beauclerk%2C_14th_Duke_of_St_Albans&amp;diff=36138523&amp;oldid=36109932" rel="nofollow">[43]</a>. Are you defending the position that Giano's edits were <i>vandalism</i> and therefore rollback was appropriate? I'm not talking merely about reverting them (though I personally have some doubts about that as well, with so <i>much</i> reverting) but using the admin rollback button, which is only to be used to revert vandalism. Do you have any comment on the talkback message that I linked to, protesting Proteus previous misuses of rollback ? Or on the low information content and poor courtesy of Proteus' edit summaries on those occasions that he didn't use rollback? (I won't offer any diffs here, since the histories of the pages I've already linked to are easily viewed). Is this "perfectly justified" admin behavior? I'd be grateful for a bit of feedback from other admins, and other community members, here, if possible. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 20:46, 22 January 2006 (UTC).

That's by no means everything that was said on the matter, just what I was able to find. Styles have been in the MoS for a long time. They are frequently removed by users who are either unaware of this fact or who do not approve of them. I would note that it is not yet accepted that rollback can only be used for vandalism, and that said discussion is still on-going (I myself try to only use it thusly, but there's no requirement that admins do so). I can say that I would have reverted Giano myself, but Proteus beat me to it. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 20:54, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, the general consensus, as well as the general feeling, is that use of rollback ought to be restricted right down to cases where it is obvious as to the reason for the reversion. First of all, rollback is not a simple revert, so you need to understand that it's all too easy to do some serious damage. If you try to revert a single edit with it, depending upon the pattern of edits, you may end up reverting a whole string of them. Second, rollback provides no scope to give a summary, leaving only the daunting <i>X rolled back edits by Y to last version by Z</i> - the preferred option is to use a manual revert and provide at least some sort of summary, if only to avoid being damn rude.</dd>

<li>Yeah I bet you would strongly advise - Incidentally I am not American, and I may know a great deal more about the peerage than you. so please do not be patronising. British Dukes do not refer to themselves as Most Noble or expect others to do so. Most Noble is only used today in documents issued by Buckingham Palace when conferring even greater honours of chivalry on an existing Duke. Or in the very rarified language of the courts of Heraldry. It was used in the House of Lord's on occassions, but they have now expelled Dukes, si it will not be happening again there. At <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Wellesley%2C_1st_Duke_of_Wellington_10be.html" title="Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington">Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington</a> after being reverted I changed to "The late and most Noble" which incidentally was the correct term for a dead duke when "Most Noble" was in common parlance has again been reverted - very odd. Dukes no longer even have Most Noble placed on their own tombstones. So there is absolutely no reason for an international encyclopedia to use these antiquated and near obsolete terms of deference. If the Pope cannot be His Holiness how come the distant (and sometimes dubious) descendents of British heros and King's bastards can be " Most Noble". <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_dc9f.html" title="User:Giano">Giano</a> | <a href="../../../g/i/a/User_talk%7EGiano_a5ff.html" title="User talk:Giano">talk</a> 20:14, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm sorry if you found my tone patronizing, let me back up and try again. What you are describing here is a content dispute. The issues you have raised were raised six months ago and hashed out in what has become know as the "Style Wars." I'm not sure where the relevant talk page archives have ended, but I'll start looking this evening. Incidentally, the Duke of Montrose still sits in the House of Lords as an elected hereditary peer, and there is no bar on Dukes now entering the House of Commons. If you want to re-ignite the Style Wars, a good place to do so is <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia_talk%7ENaming_conventions_%28names_and_titles%29_58d7.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (names and titles)">Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (names and titles)</a>. I remind you again that this would also cover <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Right_Honourable_66e6.html" title="The Right Honourable">The Right Honourable</a>, which is hardly antiquated and indeed in almost constant use. The Manual of Style, in my view (and I'm not alone in this), as presently written, backs up Proteus's version of the article. Perhaps he could have been friendlier about it, but consider his actions in light of the above. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 20:41, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>We are not discussing "Right Honourable" but "Most Noble". Please let me assure you of one thing for dead certain without debate or confusion, the British House of Commons will never, has never and never will refer to any of its members as "Most Noble". The Duke of Montrose may well sit as an elected peer, but I suspect he is not about to begin a campaign for the return of "Most Noble" - not if he wants to remain in the House of Lords. The term is antiquated, it is dead, it is gone, only on Wikipedia does it seem to remain. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_dc9f.html" title="User:Giano">Giano</a> | <a href="../../../g/i/a/User_talk%7EGiano_a5ff.html" title="User talk:Giano">talk</a> 20:54, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well I don't think we should use Right Honourable either. The only prefix that does seem to be used in mainstream encyclopedias and biographical dictionaries is Sir.

<dd>Jtdirl, it differs from "other policies" in not existing. At least no one has been able to point to this policy, to link to it, or to quote it. Unless you mean to repeat yet again Mackensen's claim that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_(biographies)#Honorific_prefixes" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_(biographies)#Honorific_prefixes" rel="nofollow">this</a> is a policy in favor of using honorific prefixes? I'm baffled to hear anybody say that their "interpretation" allows for such a random, contrary-to-the-words-on-the-page reading — I don't know how to respond, really. Dear reader, please click on the offered MoS link — <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_(biographies)#Honorific_prefixes" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_(biographies)#Honorific_prefixes" rel="nofollow">here</a> it is again — as Sannse did.

<dd>My two penn'orth: Proteus's position, as a matter of English usage, is ludicrous.

If you revert for the same reason twenty times, I don't see any need to do it the slow way after giving a reason on the first occasion. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkalexander100_03f8.html" title="User:Markalexander100">Mark</a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkalexander100_f98a.html" title="User talk:Markalexander100"><sup>1</sup></a> 22:09, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The policy as written does not say what is claimed here. It lists some that are "viewed by many (but not all) as acceptable", and lists some that should <i>not</i> be used. It does not say "these titles <i>must</i> be used". I can see that the dispute over this was heated and can understand that everyone involved is sick of the whole argument - but that doesn't change that the quoted link does not support the change. I've looked at the links provided to old discussion, and it's a complete mess that seems to lead nowhere. Unless there is an agreement to change the Manual of Style, then there are no grounds to insist on one form or the other. Certainly there are no grounds to use rollback - as said above, for a non-vandalism edit, that's just plain rude. -- <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESannse_0094.html" title="User:Sannse">sannse</a> <a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESannse_2ae9.html" title="User talk:Sannse">(talk)</a> 22:11, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, and those it lists are royals and popes. Only royals and popes.

<dd>However, note that the users above would remove <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Right_Honourable_66e6.html" title="The Right Honourable">The Right Honourable</a>, which is one of those listed as acceptable to most users. That would definitely be against consensus. Moreover, it's clear from the wording that while you do not have to use styles, there isn't support for going through and taking them out. The <a href="../../../p/e/e/WP%7EPEER_b8b0.html" title="WP:PEER">peerage project</a>, for one, has a made a point to use them, because it aids in describing historical figures. My impression, unless someone inserts diffs which prove otherwise, is that Proteus didn't use the rollback button until the removals continued. The matter of styles is settled at the present. The usage of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Most_Noble_e29c.html" title="The Most Noble">The Most Noble</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Most_Honourable_5cea.html" title="The Most Honourable">The Most Honourable</a> was never explicity stated because it did not appear necessary to do. The distintinction in the MoS at present is between royal and papal styles on the one hand and all the rest on the other.

Whatever the rights or wrongs of roll back (I don't know what that is incidentally or that he had done it) that if three or four admins can decide on a obscure talk page that a living human being, who has often done nothing more than be born (remember even today a baby can be a duke) has to be referred to in 2006 as The Most Noble, then the whole encyclopedia looks sycophantic and ridiculous - and that definitely should be discussed here. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_dc9f.html" title="User:Giano">Giano</a> | <a href="../../../g/i/a/User_talk%7EGiano_a5ff.html" title="User talk:Giano">talk</a> 22:31, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

Also, Arniep is correct that this <i>particular</i> title is spoken, not legal, so perhaps what we can do is have the <i>audio version</i> employ it, in a "Masterpiece Theatre" imitation, and the written version not? <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:08, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>At this point, what we have is a policy dispute. Policy disputes don't belong here. Before this degenerates into a revert-war (moreso, at any rate), let me try to state the situation as I see it and suggest a way to handle this.</p>
<p>A number of Wikipedians, particularly those active in articles concerning the British peerage or British government (and the two do overlap quite a bit), are in the habit of including styles and honorific prefixes in articles. These range from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Most_Noble_e29c.html" title="The Most Noble">The Most Noble</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Most_Honourable_5cea.html" title="The Most Honourable">The Most Honourable</a>, which designate nobles only, to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Right_Honourable_66e6.html" title="The Right Honourable">The Right Honourable</a>, which can refer to both nobles (e.g. Earls) and commoners (members of the privy council). Furthermore, these Wikipedians believe that the Manual of Style backs them up, to say nothing of common practice. Other Wikipedians dispute this interpretation, or, more broadly, do not agree that styles should be included in articles. <s>The Manual of Style does not seem to support their interpretation, but that matter is not entirely clear.</s> The Manual of Style is silent on removing styles, but the which styles are approved may be an open question.</p>
<p>Two things need to happen at this point. One, I think we need to agree that Proteus could have been kinder about his reverts, but that from his point of view they were entirely justified (and he did give reasons in the beginning). We've ceased to discuss him in all of this, at any rate. Two, we may need to re-examine the policy on styles, but that's something that should be done at <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_1cd9.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions">Wikipedia:Naming conventions</a>. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 23:06, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Is there any point continuing this discussion anywhere. As far as the noble peer pushers are concerned grey is both black and white, and it does not really matter if it isn't as a noble admin can come along and use magical tools. No where else in Wikipedia would such a ridiculous charade be tolerated. Quite rightly Kings, Queen, religious leaders etc all have no honorifics, (no disrespect intended to them, just a level playing field) yet somehow it seems on Wikipedia the British monarch's "support cast" can have all kinds of Ruritanian prefixes, not given them elsewhere. A limited discussion on the subject seems to have started at this popular debating forum <a href="../../../a/r/t/Talk%7EArthur_Wellesley%2C_1st_Duke_of_Wellington_0d09.html" title="Talk:Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington">Talk:Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington</a>.

<dd>One Modest Proposal would, of course, be to eat the peers. However, arguing that "there is no law against calling them by honorifics (where there is for Popes and Kings), so there is a law calling them by honorifics" is the worst kind of offense against logic and common sense (something that Swift's Projector would not do, as he is entirely logical and thoroughly immoral). We call saints saints only if they are <i>known as saints</i> primarily (e.g. if Mother Theresea gets the nod, she won't go in as Saint Theresea of Calcutta, but rather Mother Theresea, saint, as a job title). In the cases of kings and popes, the <i>job title</i> is included ("king" and "pope"), but not an honorific. If the honorific <i>is</i> an indication of job title ("sir" or "knight"), then it should be present. However, an article that honors its subject by using exaltation in its description violates NPOV. I don't get to say that the 3rd Earl of Sandwich was honorable (or honourable) or noble or pure of heart. I get to say that he was an earl. Anything more than that implies my encyclopedic value and my desire to stroke his vanity. Well, he's long dead and has no vanity to satisfy, so there's no need to please him, and NPOV prevents my flattering him. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:18, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>While I do not disagree with the DA block, I think that T-Man should just as equally be blocked for provoking him in a multiplicity of instances. I don't think "stalking" really is made out - it's simply that T-Man and DA both tend to watch the same pages and this almost inevitably puts them in conflict. I've "clashed" with T-Man before over his Bat-Embargo edits, and have tried to give him advice which he ultimately rejetced as unhelpful (which is his right), so he's probably going to say I'm biased, but my assessment of the situation places the cause directly on T-Man. His sub-standard command of English, his verbosity as opposed to encyclopedic style, his insistence (as a self-proclaimed expert) on POV-pushing and speculative info is all producing high levels of tension on the various comic-related pages. It's nearly impossible to sift out and copyedit the good stuff from the dross when sometimes it it hard to tell precisely what he means in the first place. T-Man has also derided, insulted and outright abused people other than DA. By only blocking DA, you're sending the message to T-Man that he has done nothing wrong; and that is a wrong message, not to mention an unfair one. --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> (<a href="../../../k/h/a/User_talk%7EKhaosworks_e07b.html" title="User talk:Khaosworks">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Khaosworks_06d3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Khaosworks">contribs</a>) 04:56, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I didn't realise this was being discussed here as well as at the RFAr. I'll paraphrase my thoughts over:</p>
<p>I would question the block on a couple of grounds. Was dyslexic properly warned that he would be blocked on grounds of personal attacks? I still fail to see evidence of a clear warning that either party would be blocked for personal attacks. The best I can find is from Benon who states <i>it is not nessasry to stoop to the level of a personal attack so please don't do, i dont want to but anymore personal attacks and i will be asking admins to impose sancations on either of you</i>. This prompted the reply from Dyslexic that saw him blocked, namely: <i>Benon, it's not a personal attack to say that T-Man's edits are bad, a waste of everyone's time, and that he only knows the animated series, not the comics. These are obvious facts. They affect our ability to edit and spend time on other important matters.</i></p>
<p>I've been wary to block either user on grounds of personal attacks because my reading of policy was that it wasn't implicit that such blocks are allowed in said policy. I'm also unclear on which user is stalking which, both having claimed the other as stalker. I also have to question why one user is blocked for a personal attack which comes during a period which the blocker in question agrees has been inflamed by personal attacks from the opposite direction. I certainly agree with Khaosworks that you're sending the message to T-Man that he has done nothing wrong; and that is a wrong message, not to mention an unfair one. It also sends the message to Dyslexic that he is unfairly singled out.</p>
<p>Now, taking all things as even I think this initial block was therefore somewhat ill judged. There should have been at least one more warning stressing that the language Dyslexic had used did indeed constitute a personal attack. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">talk</a> 16:32, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you for voicing your concerns. Looking back, perhaps I should have given Dyslexic agnostic one more warning before blocking, although in my defence I did not know the extent to which T-man provoked him (at the time). I'm also not sure who is stalking who; they both seem to be following each other. Since blocking them both, they have both emailed me. Dyslexic agnostic, while scarcastic, admitted his frustration. And T-man seems to have realized that he should not respond to personal attacks in kind. I hope they can sort their differences out once their blocks expire.--<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShanel_222a.html" title="User:Shanel">Shanel</a> 22:15, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Fair play, it has been a hard situation to follow, and I probably should have posted my concerns here, so I'm probably a bit to blame, I was hoping they were going to resolve it amicably, there seemed a period just after New Year when they were treating each other fairly well. I agree it is impossible to tell who is stalking who. I've certainly learnt from this one, and I apologise for being somewhat harder on you in the above text than you deserved. If the case does get accepted by arbcom and resolved, it'll be because you got involved, so that's certainly a plus. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">talk</a> 19:22, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>My compassion for this kind of story is growing thinner with time. Primary schools don't make a lot of useful edits because, you know, primary school kids don't know much yet. I'm leaning toward a "fire and forget" policy, explain the situation to the school administrators if they ask about it, and if they can keep their kids in check then they can edit Wikipedia. It's not our responsibility to babysit them on the internet in the meantime. --<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_Delaney_f359.html" title="User:Ryan Delaney">Ryan Delaney</a> <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyan_Delaney_8333.html" title="User talk:Ryan Delaney"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 19:12, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I see your point. However is this a <b>primary</b> school? I had the strong impression, based on the other edits of <a href="../../../l/e/d/User%7ELed-zep_8dd4.html" title="User:Led-zep">User:Led-zep</a>, who says that he is a student there, that this is a <b>secondary</b> school, aka high-school or perhaps Junior High-school. School kinds an research and write decent articels on soem topics, although many of them do not do so.

<p>Hi David,</p>

<dl>
<dd>The IP address 208.183.105.11, which is registered to the State of Tennessee Department of Education, and which seems to be used for providing network connections to various in-school computers, has been used on a number of occasions to vandalize Wikipedia...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>208.183.105.11 is a filtering/caching proxy machine that is managed by us, Education Networks of America as the ISP for the Tennessee public schools. It is one of two machines that proxies traffic for approximately 805 schools in East Tennessee (all grade levels). There are a total of 6 such proxies on our network servicing most of the public schools in the State. Each proxy also passes X-Forwarded-For information containing the closest available IP address to the workstation making the request if you can ban on that (either the workstation itself or a NAT/Firewall device at the school or district).</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>While we are just the ISP in this case with minimal enforcement ability, we do have an understanding of how computers are used in the schools and I believe the above request to be unrealistic on a system-wide scale. Computer use is not monitored as strictly as such a policy would require in all cases, computers are not assigned 1:1 nor are unique logins required in most cases making follow-up on vandalism incidents difficult or impossible (not to mention firewalls/NAT that could mask the origin workstations).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>We do have the ability to bypass traffic destined for Wikipedia around the proxying devices so that you can see the most specific public IP available for any request. That may be a workstation, school NAT IP or District NAT IP depending on how each District has their internal networks built out. While not a perfect solution, it does provide for the ability to create a more specific block in the event of vandalism and wouldn't affect large sections of the network as the current block does. Additionally, the IP information could allow us to identify and inform the Technology Administrators in the specific District for additional follow-up if possible.</dd>

<dd>I understand the limitations involved (I am a professional programer myself). Such a bypass might well allow for more specific and more limited blocks, so that at least fewer people would eb affected by each one.

<li>I think that the bypass solution suggested above might be a good idea. At present this block seems to be affecting users at "most of the public schools in the State of Tennessee" (at all grade levels) which is not good if there is a better choice. The solution proposed would at elast allow more specific blocks, and perhaps dealign with authorities at specific schools or districts. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 21:33, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>If it minimises the impact of individuals blocks I can't see (from a wikipedia view point) a downside, it might be nice to know the new IPs and where they relate in advance, so we can tag the talk_pages appropriately. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User%7EPgk_d0c7.html" title="User:Pgk">pgk</a><sup>(<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk"><font color="mediumseagreen">talk</font></a>)</sup> 21:54, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</li>
</ul>
<p>The use of the x forward for information was, if I recall correctly, what allowed individual IP blocking on NTL's network instead of blocking the proxy. So talk to the developers and they should be able to get it working here. It was what allowed the blocking of Marmot. Also go see the <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_proposal_01f4.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy proposal">Wikipedia:Blocking policy proposal</a> that would further limit collateral damage, and write a patch if you are able. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 22:10, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>From what I recall the x-forward information is effectively a list of ip adresses from source, through eash proxy and on. The software looks backwards through that list until it finds the first IP not on a list of "trusted" forwarders, that is the IP which the edit is considered to come from. In the NTL case the NTL proxies are added as trusted and so it all works, if the devs would be willing to add these proxies to the list of trusted is of course a different question. If they are I doubt they'd trust anything beyond that so if I understand the above correctly we'd probably get the same result as the bypass solution. The bypass solution of course requires no changes at the wikimedia end and wouldn't be open to abuse in the case that those proxies are ever compromised since we aren't extending any trust. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User%7EPgk_d0c7.html" title="User:Pgk">pgk</a><sup>(<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk"><font color="mediumseagreen">talk</font></a>)</sup> 22:56, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

This is not the first time they have been blocked, and Led-zep's friend is not the only person who has vandalized from these IPs; it's been going on for over a year. I think it would be great if the school bypassed the proxy for Wikipedia, or set up X-forward. I'm not familiar with X-Forward but it sounds like a good solution. However, if the school doesn't take these steps, these IPs shouldn't be unblocked. They've been a steady source of vandalism for over a year. Remember that students can still read Wikipedia, they just can't edit it. I think that's a small price to pay to stop this vandalism. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 19:16, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Rhobite, I feel that since the semester ended a month ago, you should judge the ban on vadilzims that have happend since the New Year. I also am fine whith the solution that all of you have come up with. I know my oppion doesn't count, because I have only had an account for a week or so, but since I was the one that wrote the letter to DES and started this thing, I feel that I must do as much as I can to try and see this through.

We need to be *very* careful with blocks longer than 2-3 hours. I think it's something many admins forget about until something like this happens. It looks like it's a dynamic IP that shifts among just a few users, which happens sometimes. I removed the template on the IP page and replaced it with a warning that this is a dynamic IP.

<p>I just want some clarification on some edits which occurred recently at the <a href="../../../f/r/o/From_Hell_433b.html" title="From Hell">From Hell</a> article.

One user disputes that he has reverted more than once, and I'd just like clarification that these edits <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=From_Hell&amp;diff=36435564&amp;oldid=36369147" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=From_Hell&amp;diff=36435564&amp;oldid=36369147" rel="nofollow">[60]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=From_Hell&amp;diff=36484195&amp;oldid=36440963" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=From_Hell&amp;diff=36484195&amp;oldid=36440963" rel="nofollow">[61]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=From_Hell&amp;diff=36548988&amp;oldid=36498932" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=From_Hell&amp;diff=36548988&amp;oldid=36498932" rel="nofollow">[62]</a>, support my reading of the situation.

<dd>Warnings all around is probably a good thing; even if they're not skirting the 3RR, revert wars are harmful; they should attempt to resolve the dispute on the talk page. Protecting the article for a bit may be a good call instead of blocking one party or the other. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a> 22:58, 24 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>A seemingly hotheaded and clearly passionate <a href="../../../d/a/r/Daredevil.html" title="Daredevil">Daredevil</a> fan is making wholesale reversions, being intemperate on the Histroy page, being personally insulting on my Talk page, and making a large number of what seem to be subjective statements, backed with partial citations if at all, and solipsisms.</p>
<p>Since he's making wholesale changes at a quick rate, not reading the article thoroughly before adding repetitious paragraphs, and since I've take then steps of trying to reason with him and of bringing in an administrator, who said "if the editing gets hot and you can't resolve matters on Talk:Daredevil, please notify me and consider visiting the administrators' noticeboard". I have now taken those recommended steps.</p>
<p>Following is one example of the exchange. It got more heated on the <a href="../../../d/a/r/Daredevil.html" title="Daredevil">Daredevil</a> history page.</p>
<p>This particular Kirby-credit example is only one example of of my trying to reason with GodzillaWax. He's currently in <a href="../../../d/a/r/Daredevil.html" title="Daredevil">Daredevil</a> putting in opinions of questionable encyclopedia value, behaving beyond discourteously and well into insultingly.

<p>Marvel doesn't give Kirby credit for a lot of things. <i>Everett</i> said Kirby contributed -- including coming up with the idea of the <b>billy club</b>, and the record shows Kirby helped designe the costume, a highly integral part of any character's creation.</p>
<p>I footnoted the source in the first graf. I understand you may have missed seeing it. Here's the quoted source, from someone who spoke personally with both Kirby and Everett:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Comics historian and former Kirby assistant Mark Evanier, investigating claims of Kirby's involvement in the creation of both Iron Man and Daredevil, interviewed Kirby and Everett on the subject, years before their deaths, and concluded <a href="http://povonline.com/jackfaq/JackFaq4.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://povonline.com/jackfaq/JackFaq4.htm" rel="nofollow">[63]</a> that, "in both cases, Jack had already drawn the covers of those issues and done some amount of design work. He ... seems to have participated in the design of Daredevil's first costume. ... Everett did tell me that Jack had come up with the idea of Daredevil's billy club. ... Jack, in effect, drew the first page of that first Daredevil story. In the rush to get that seriously late book to press, there wasn't time to complete Page One, so Stan had Sol Brodsky slap together a paste-up that employed Kirby's cover drawing. ... Everett volunteered to me that Jack had "helped him" though he wouldn't — or more likely, couldn't — elaborate on that. He just plain didn't remember it well, and in later years apparently gave others who asked a wide range of answers".</dd>
</dl>
<p>I can see you've been a faithful contributor to the Daredevil entry, going back months. That's a good thing. Sometimes that can make it difficult to accept others edits, even when well-sourced and factual. That's OK. People of all different ages and temperaments work on Wiki, and by and large they make it work. As long as we're all courteous and can back up what we say.</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to more of your work on Daredevil, and I know the more you do, the more interested you'll get in digging into sources. - <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenebrae_e666.html" title="User:Tenebrae">Tenebrae</a> 18:32, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>First off, you need to calm your nerd rage. Second, in your effort to revise Daredevil, you continually omit facts under the claim that they need sources. Fine. But do a modicum of research on these things to find the source before you remove them completely. You clearly have google at your fingertips, so use it. Third, Kirby is not recognized as a creator of Daredevil. At most he did a sketch on page 1. Marvel does not recognize him as a creator, so neither should wikipedia. Fourth, "style" is not in violation of wiki guidelines. Incoporate some into your work. My dig that you 'must write algebra textbooks for a living' is not a dig at writers. I happen to be one in real life, as shocking as that might be to you. I was suggesting that you are removing any element of readable prose with paint-by-numbers drivel. <a href="../../../g/o/d/User%7EGodzillaWax_7133.html" title="User:GodzillaWax">GodzillaWax</a> 18:34, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>As required, I'm putting a notice of this on GodzillaWax's page now.</p>
<p>I request he be blocked from the Daredevil page until some sort of resolution can be reached. The page as it is now is extremely fannish, to fancruftian detail in some points.

<p>He is now making an unwarranted accusation that I "seem to have broken a number of picture links on the Daredevil entry." He has no factual basis for saying this -- one picture I inserted doesn't show up, though it shows up fine in another article, so I put in a big report. That's not "a number of picture links", and no one knows why it doesn't work.</p>
<p>If you read his posts on the <a href="../../../d/a/r/Daredevil.html" title="Daredevil">Daredevil</a> Talk and History pages and on my Talk page, you will see him hurl a number of insulting, inflammatory, and often plain untrue remarks, while I have -- and read for yourself -- refrained from doing likewise back.</p>
<p>In addition to his unsubstantiated allegations, he says he reported me to an Adminsistrator. That's fine. But when I did so, I adhered to the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_1b83.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration</a>'s statment, "You are required to place a notice on the user talk page of each person against whom you lodge a complaint", and <a href="../../../g/o/d/User%7EGodzillaWax_7133.html" title="User:GodzillaWax">User:GodzillaWax</a> did not.</p>
<p>I have been one Wikipedia's most credible comic-book editors, giving the sorts of proper and confirmable footnotes and source citations Wiki asks for, for nearly 50 neglected comics creators, including the Golden Age likes of <a href="../../../l/o/u/Lou_Fine_46de.html" title="Lou Fine">Lou Fine</a> and <a href="../../../s/y/d/Syd_Shores_a387.html" title="Syd Shores">Syd Shores</a>, and important Silver Age creators like <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Friedrich_8301.html" title="Gary Friedrich">Gary Friedrich</a> and <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Dillin_f4b4.html" title="Dick Dillin">Dick Dillin</a>, among the many that were amazingly missing.
