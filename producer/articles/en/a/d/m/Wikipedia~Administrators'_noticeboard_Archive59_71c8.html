<p><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElalan_06ee.html" title="User:Elalan">Elalan</a> had placed a warning template on my talk page for what he says is vandalism.

<dd>To put it bluntly, admins can block people and delete pages. It doesn't sound like the situation is ready for that yet (hopefully, not ever).

<p>I didn't mean block him. That's why I said I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask for help. I mean the warning templates.

<dd>There is dispute in the community about whether people should be allowed to remove warnings in general, but everyone seems to agree that 'invalid warnings' can be removed. Though whether something is 'valid' or not is often subjective. In any case, please go ahead... IMO if you don't want them on your talk page you shouldn't have to keep them there. Your talk page exists for people to communicate with you, not to permanently house embarassing / annoying accusations that any user feels like making. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 10:57, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OK Thanks CBD I'm removing the tags.

<p>Hi - if anyone knows the template magic to create a link to the Talk page of the editor substing a template (so as to create a working "my talk" link which can be used in talk page templates) can they please let me know. This has been suggested as an enhancement to the {{<a href="../../../n/n/-/Template%7ENn-userfy_41e0.html" title="Template:Nn-userfy">nn-userfy</a>}} template, and I'd hope to add it to some other bite-minimising templates. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 09:18, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Can't be done unfortunately. There is no 'magic word' or 'wiki markup' for &lt;CURRENT USER&gt;. I doubt they'd add one because it could have page caching implications and would definitely allow situations where pages displayed different content depending on the person viewing them. The closest currently available is the standard sig markup, '~~~'... which usually contains a link to the user and/or talk page. Having the sig markup inside 'includeonly' tags (i.e. &lt;includeonly&gt;~~~&lt;/includeonly&gt;) would then cause it to 'autosign' when substituted, but generally isn't done because people would likely type, '{{subst:templatename}} --~~~~', and wind up with <i>two</i> signatures. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 11:34, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>For completeness - You <i>could</i> create a talk link if you included a parameter for the username, (i.e. {{subst:templatename|user=CBDunkerson}}), but the person subst'ing the template would have to type in their username each time. Presumably not what you were looking for. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 11:41, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>Will the block (even on his Talk Page!) on Sussexman remain now that the contentious article (Gregory Lauder-Frost) has been deleted? It seems most unfair as he has worked on quite a number of good articles, not all of them political. Having looked at the reasons for his block it states that he <i>personally</i> sent a solicitor's letter to someone else on Wikipedia. Is that actually true? Is there positive proof that he was even involved? Is this an unfair witch-hunt? This is one of many issues from what I can see which are not being dealt with in a decent manner. 86.129.82.48 14:13, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>As far as I am concerned Ya ya ya ya has been banned by the community. Don't you find it slightly weird to suggest unbanning one of his accounts in response to massive sockpuppetry? The ArbCom can help us deal with problem users. But we are free to deal with them on our own, too, and if their remedies aren't strict enough and the person keeps on misbehaving, we are free to impose tougher penalties without having to go back to the ArbCom again. And given this character's consistent problems over months now, I don't think there's anyone who can sanely argue that this community ban is unjust. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 21:38, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello. I am a user from the Greek Wikipedia. I noticed that when typing "Βικιπαίδεια" (the name of the Greek version of Wikipedia) in Google, the following result appears on top: User:Βικιπαίδεια είναι κομουνισμός (Greek for User:Wikipedia is communism). I am requesting the immediate or in-a-short-time deletion of this page and its talk page (4th result in Google). It is obvious that this high ranking is a result of Googlebombing. This way Wikipedia is connected with a certain POV, which is against its basic policy. And also prevents certain groups of users to contribute to the project. I think also that this user page should have been deleted a long time ago (the user who created it was blocked on 14 October 2005, and the standard period for retainment of the temporary user pages is 1 month). --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDead3y3_5da7.html" title="User:Dead3y3">Dead3y3</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDead3y3_897c.html" title="User talk:Dead3y3">Talk page</a></sup> 01:28, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Fresh admin seeks advice: I've just deleted &lt;&gt;John Angello per CSD G11 and CSD A8. However, what to do with the talk page, as well as images created by the author (PR of the small company, all copyvios from <a href="http://www.aulle.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aulle.com" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>) , user Moroccathiopian (<a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMoroccathiopian_5662.html" title="User talk:Moroccathiopian">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Moroccathiopian_8895.html" title="Special:Contributions/Moroccathiopian">contribs</a>).

<dd>It's a judgment call. In this case the chances of there being any properly encyclopaedic use of those images is between zero and none at all, "Aulle Corporation" is all but invisible, so speedy deletion under G11, along with the article itself, is not unreaosnable. You know for sure that the author will be back if he feels he has a prayer of success, and will upload them again. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 19:05, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Guy, though I would tend to delete. If they can be used, they will be used as illustrations of general "company" sorts of articles. I.e. they can't illustrate the specific, because we're not going to have an article on the specific. So, do we have lots of images on the general subject or few? The fewer, the more likely these will be useful. I'd say we have plenty, so it's exceptionally unlikely that they're not redundant (truly redundant). <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 01:46, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>About 2 months ago, I raised the issue of a huge number of stamps being used in biography articles, where there is no mentioned of the stamp, or only a small sentence saying that "this govt has issued a stamp on the subject" or something equally brief.</p>
<p>An example can be found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bhagat_Puran_Singh&amp;diff=79683500&amp;oldid=79614690" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bhagat_Puran_Singh&amp;diff=79683500&amp;oldid=79614690" rel="nofollow">here</a>, for the article <a href="../../../b/h/a/Bhagat_Puran_Singh_eb0a.html" title="Bhagat Puran Singh">Bhagat_Puran_Singh</a>. Here, the article mentions only mentions "Indian Government issued postal stamp in honor of Bhagat Puran Singh in 2004.", and this sentence is being used to justify the "Fair use" of the stamp image.</p>
<p>According to <a href="../../../f/a/i/Category%7EFair_use_stamp_images_b60a.html" title="Category:Fair use stamp images">Category:Fair use stamp images</a> and {{<a href="../../../s/t/a/Template%7EStamp_917c.html" title="Template:Stamp">Stamp</a>}},</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>stamp images in this category should not be used solely as a cheap way to illustrate articles. In addition to the problem that images are often altered for artistic reasons and thus may not be factually accurate representations of their subject, <b>Wikipedia:Fair use criteria does not allow for it.</b></i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>In some cases, the issuance of a stamp is itself notable, and the stamp may be allowable in the article (for instance, if the issuance of the stamp was an overtly political act, with the design chosen for political purposes). For these images, the image description page must describe this as part of its fair use rationale, and the article(s) using the stamp must do so also.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>So, my question is, is providing a single sentence like "the govt of x issued a stamp on Y on year z" sufficient justification of including a fair use stamp image in a biography article? This type of usage has again become prevalent since the last cleanup 2 or 3 months ago. I'm waiting for some more comments from other admins to go on and remove these again. The last time I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=67703624#Stamps_wrongly_claimed_as_Fair_use:_serious_copyright_problem" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=67703624#Stamps_wrongly_claimed_as_Fair_use:_serious_copyright_problem" rel="nofollow">raised the question</a> here at ANB, most of the people opined that there needs to be more coverage of the stamp rather these "one sentence description"s to justify inclusion of the stamp under fair use.

<p>You understand things correctly.

<dd>However, if the image is indeed in the public domain, as one editor of that article has asserted, the image page needs to be retagged and you can use the image for whatever you like, as long as it benefits the article.

<dd>Actually, the assertion made by that editor that Indian postage stamps are in PD, is incorrect. In fact, the copyright for such material lasts 60 years, so anything post-1946, as all of these Indian stamps are, still are under copyright. This is not the case with some other countries, in which case PD tag applies easily. Thanks. --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 21:43, 5 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd><i>Re-production of stamps is allowed for illustration purposes in <b>Philatelic Publication or in an article relating wholly on postage stamps</b> which may appear in any magazine, newspaper or publication of a general character. Such reproduction should however, be only in black. If stamps are to be produced in colour for publicity purposes, prior permission of the Director General of Posts must be obtained. To avoid similarity with the postage , such reproduction must be distinctively in smaller or larger sizes than the actual stamp and must be without perforation on the edges. Further, across bar will also be placed on one- corner of the stamp, obliterating the denomination. It must be noted that reproduction of the stamp in colour of the actual size of the stamp with perforation of the edges may be deemed to be taken as production of the actual stamp</i></dd>

<p>Conversely, I'd like to point out that often (though not always) the issuance of a stamp is a significant event. For example, it may be possible to incorporate (sourced) commentary on which of several possible aspects of a person a stamp chose to focus on, etc. When possible, this simultaneously enhances the article and justifies fair use of the stamp. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 00:22, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A bit process-bound and making-a-pointy to undelete a PROD in order to speedy delete, if you don't mind me saying so&#160;:o) Although looking at it in the 50 seconds or so it was undeleted, it seemed to fail {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-web_d5db.html" title="Template:Db-web">db-web</a>}}.

<dd>Restoring and then speedy deleting does mean the article has to be reviewed before being undeleted again, rather than just being restored immediately on request as articles deleted via PROD are. To me it seems closer to, after accidentally pressing 'enter' and leaving an empty deletion log entry, undeleting and redeleting an article in order to leave a better summary (which I've done a few times), than going through two processes for their own sake. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 00:27, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Although I have had no part in the ongoing situation, because of my previous interactions with both users I am not the ideal Administrator to decide on the issue. Therefore, I request that other Administrators look into it, since I feel that the situation does merit attention, possibly a <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERfC_a13a.html" title="WP:RfC">Request for Comments</a>.<br />
I am copying here the comments made on my talk page to bring the issue to my attention (<a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedux_26e5.html#User_Lesfer.27s_persistent_violations_toward_WP:CIV" title="User talk:Redux">here</a>).</p>

<dd>Greetings Redux. As to the articles in question, there is a semantic difference in how Lesfer and myself view the categories as they are assigned to specific individuals with two aliases. It is not myself but Lesfer who appears to have "a personal grudge against me" (please see the aforementioned personal attacks and incivility), however unlike my esteemed fellow editor I wish to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> on his behalf and hope you can instruct him that such terms as "kid" here in North America are viewed in a condescending manner.

<dd>Without getting into much of the detail, I would suggest that all editors avoid, by all means, reflecting on each others' persons, especially when it is not the person that is irritating. Remember: all we are is words. If one editor's edits bother you, talk about the edits, not the editor. Similarly, if someone says something about you, instead of your edits, remember that he or she doesn't know you, has never met you, can't judge you. You cannot be hurt by someone whose sum knowledge of you is a few words on a single website somewhere. Both "you're an idiot" and "you should be banned for calling me an idiot" are leading you toward greater conflict and less happiness. You both have goals here. State your goals. Read the other person's goals. Don't refute, don't point out the error: state the positive, the hope, the desire.</dd>
<dd>If it's too difficult to let the insults pass, then we have the mediation cabal who will try to help out. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 01:40, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Geogre, your words speak to the heart of the matter. Alas instead of focusing on edits, Lesfer persists in using derrogatory terminology directed specifically towards myself. How would <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">WP:CIV</a> apply, or should they not be considered at this point? Lesfer communicates to various editors (not solely myself) in such a condescending tone which completely undermines the entire process we are attempting to achieve here at Wikipedia. I would suggest that since he fails to act in a civilized manner that he simply avoid directing comments towards myself and I will do the same. If not, then yes a mediation cabal may be the only alternative towards reigning this editor's persistent violations of the above cardinal guidelines of Wikipedia which have been established as essential guiding principals. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetkinetic_8528.html" title="User:Netkinetic">NetK</a> 12:32, 6 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>I am in need of assistance with a problem I seem to be having with the user <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">User:MONGO</a>, an administrator. I attempted to engage him in a dialog about his protection of his talk page, an act I believe to be irresponsible consider he has been blocking anonymous IP's, leaving them no way to contact him. He is of course entitled to disagree with him, and were he to argue his point to me, he might even sway me to his opinion.</p>
<p>This does not however entitle him to insult me, break <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, violate <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>, and attack me openly. I am seeking mediation for this issue, and for someone to confront him about his attitude problem.

<dd>I showed up on your talk page in relation to some NPOV edits I saw go up, and your actions in banning a user (who I agree deserved banning). The fact that I have not edited recently does not excuse you to be rude, uncivil, and violate policy by threatening other users. Your actions are uncalled for. I've not edited for a week because I am still learning the system. I feel it is important for me to read the edits of others and to learn the craft before I begin editing myself. So far my edits have been related to clean up, as I don't feel qualified for much else.</dd>

<dd>I am qualified however to discuss with you what I think is an ethical conundrum as a matter of academic interest.

<p>Regardless of the merits of this particular case, protecting user talk pages, especially those of admins, should be the last resort. You (and other people) can always revert vandalism, but nobody but an admin can leave you a message without revealing their email address if the page is protected. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User_talk%7EZocky_f226.html" title="User talk:Zocky">Zocky</a> | <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_Picture_Popups_bee7.html" title="User:Zocky/Picture Popups">picture popups</a> 12:48, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've unblocked this user. Urek did not comment on MONGO's talk once asked, and had been quite specifically told that while it wasn't a good idea to comment here, he could. Urek was using my talk page in a positive manner, and made only one edit to this page following that. That comment was ill-advised, and he was blocked. As this user was perhaps not aware of MONGO's recent history, the phrase MONGO used, <i>"lots of trolling,"</i> could have been seen as an escalation of hostilities. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="black">brenneman</font></a> <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" rel="nofollow"><font color="black" title="Admin actions"><sup><b>{L}</b></sup></font></a></span> 04:16, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, I'd appreciate it if an admin has a look over the closure of a couple of controversial AfDs by a non-admin (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_P-P-P-Powerbook_%284th_nomination%29_ae4d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/P-P-P-Powerbook (4th nomination)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/P-P-P-Powerbook (4th nomination)</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Deborah_Frisch_%282nd_nomination%29_cc65.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Deborah Frisch (2nd nomination)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Deborah Frisch (2nd nomination)</a>); my understanding of the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_process_57c8.html#Non-administrators_closing_discussions" title="Wikipedia:Deletion process">non-admin deletion process</a> is that this is inappropriate. See also discussion at <a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParsssseltongue_45c2.html" title="User talk:Parsssseltongue">User talk:Parsssseltongue</a> and <a href="../../../z/i/g/User_talk%7EZiggurat_7e61.html" title="User talk:Ziggurat">User talk:Ziggurat</a>.

<ul>
<li>I fully support you examining these AfDs. But I would like to say, I stand by my actions. There is serious need for AfD reform. Common sense goes right out the window on these things sometimes. They need to be closed sooner, and articles shouldn't be open for AfD nomination more than once every six months. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">PT</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParsssseltongue_45c2.html" title="User talk:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">s-s-s-s</font></a>)</sup> 23:49, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I support Ziggurat's call for a review of these afds. Please also see my exchanges with Parsssseltongue on the talk pages. I believe Parsssseltongue is abusing <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> in violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> and is disrupting the afd process in order to impose his/her own ideas about policy. <s>I feel that he/she also let me believe he/she was an admin, when he/she isn't.</s> <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 23:52, 3 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Another user has persuaded me that I may well be mistaken about the last point, and I retract it. I stand by the others. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 01:05, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>His actions on the P-P-P-Powerbook AfD do go against <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_process_57c8.html#Non-administrators_closing_discussions" title="Wikipedia:Deletion process">Wikipedia:Deletion_process#Non-administrators_closing_discussions</a>, but he does have <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> on his side and possibly <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a>, as there was no way that was ever going to be closed as anything other than "no consensus". As for <a href="../../../d/e/b/Deborah_Frisch_765f.html" title="Deborah Frisch">Deborah Frisch</a>, given that the AfD was a direct result of an intentional admin pileon to turn the article into a delete-worthy mess instead of properly blocking the person causing the article's vandalism and allowing for it to be properly reconstructed with correct citations <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents#Deborah_Frisch_blanking_Deborah_Frisch.2C_using_it_to_attack_others" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents#Deborah_Frisch_blanking_Deborah_Frisch.2C_using_it_to_attack_others" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>, I certainly believe he had the right to close it as an out-of-process nom (though I wouldn't necessarily go so far as to call it a bad-faith move on the part of the editor who relisted it). --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 23:57, 3 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My understanding of AfDs is that it's entirely possible for the first AfD to be closed otherwise (see my comments on PT's talk page), but I'd still appreciate an admin look at the issue. I'm not so concerned with the second example. <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZiggurat_41bd.html" title="User:Ziggurat"><font style="color:#DC2163;">Z</font>iggurat</a> 00:04, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>What does it mean to "have <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> on your side"? As a deletionist, I feel that sometimes no consensus or even keep leaning afd discussions are substantially misguided, and that such kept articles are detrimental to Wikipedia's reputation as an encyclopedia. Does that mean I should take my own initiative, cite <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> and close these afds as delete with the explanation that my actions are for the greater good of wikipedia and that future afd nominations would have eventually voted for delete anyway? <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 01:15, 4 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The P-p-p-powerbook afd is controversial, and not at all necessarily a no consensus close. It's not a vote, and the admin is supposed to judiciously weight the arguments according to policy and guidelines. I've seen against-the-grain admin closures in favour of keep or delete in the past that have survived deletion review. It's not that rare. But that kind of judgement responsibility for controversial should be left to admins, who are public servants and representatives of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 01:00, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Oh, I'll have no quarrel with however any admin decides to handle the P-P-P-Powerbook closing; I'm just commenting. As for <a href="../../../d/e/b/Deborah_Frisch_765f.html" title="Deborah Frisch">Deborah Frisch</a>, that little bit of system gaming was perfectly set up so that I'll risk a 3RR block if I go anywhere near it for a while, even though I was just reverting vandalism. --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 00:43, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reopen the first, leave the second. If necessary, get an admin to speedy close the second. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 23:54, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>In all honesty, I've been seriously considering opening some sort of policy discussion regarding the possibility of increasing the amount of latitude given to nonadmins closing discussions when the consensus is something other than delete (where there's no point in a nonadmin closing the AfD since they can't carry out the deletion). There's just too many things up for deletion at any given time, not enough admins, and not enough editors willing to go through the often unnecessarily unpleasant RfA process. (Any such proposal would be rational, of course, with non-admins needing to show a certain amount of experience in the Wikipedia namespace and AfD in particular, no block log a mile long, etc. Like I said, it's just something I've been mulling over in my head.) --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 00:40, 4 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Whether the status quo is maintained or not, I believe non-admins need to spell out that they are not administrators in closing afds, and refrain from making opinionated statements during closures. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 01:00, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Nitpick</b>: I think it would have been more appropriate for you to have just killed P-P-P-Whatever and made a note as to why in the deletion log (and here), instead of adding content to the closed deletion discussion.

<dd><b>Comment that is much more than a nitpick</b>: I hadn't noticed that Parsssseltongue was a <i>participant</i> in the P-Ppppfhgfgt AfD. Given that, he probably shouldn't have closed it; even admins aren't supposed to do that. In some cases that fact alone would have given anyone more than enough reason to reopen it without blinking an eye. --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 01:28, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Indeed. I was working on creating a Deletion Review submission based on that fact alone, yet now it is not needed. That's taboo for everyone, to close an AFD you were involved in. The deletion procedure states that "<i>non-admins in good standing with the community can close non-ambiguous keep/close/redirects"</i>. We need to make two decisions here: a) is a "no concensus" close ambiguous and b) do certain editors fall into this category. <font face="sans-serif"><b><a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel.Bryant_22a1.html" title="User:Daniel.Bryant">Daniel</a><a href="../../../r/a/n/Special%7ERandom_5382.html" title="Special:Random">.</a><a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDaniel.Bryant_8f7b.html" title="User talk:Daniel.Bryant">Bryant</a></b></font> 01:32, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think the rule about non-admins only closing uncontroversial AfDs should be followed - and this is partly why. The only possible objection to that rule is "if a non-admin obviously has the judgement necessary to close a controversial AfD, why shouldn't he?" - and the answer to that is "if he has that judgement, then he should <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFA_4c83.html" title="WP:RFA">request adminship</a>, because he will get it". We do have a backlog at AfD, but in my opinion we could solve that at a stroke if every active admin decided to do 1-3 closes a day, if we really wanted to - I don't believe that compromising the closing process is necessary, nor will it have much impact. <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> is not sufficient here - our processes are not infallible but they do have good reasons behind them, and to ignore them requires much <i>better</i> reasons.</dd>
<dd>I also have to object to Aaron's claim that <i>"there was no way [the Powerbook AfD] was ever going to be closed as anything other than "no consensus"</i> - "no consensus" means "AfD failed", and in my opinion, that's what we should all say in closing AfDs instead, as people seem to think of "no consensus" as the equivalent of a 5-4 victory on penalties in football, whereas in reality it's closer to match abandonment due to not enough players turning up (in the case of AfDs, not enough convincing arguments or participants to call it a keep or a delete). "AfD failed" would make the meaning clearer, and discourage admins from using it as a cop-out. This one clearly isn't an obvious "no consensus" except as a cop-out, as Brenneman's closing shows - it remains to be seen whether deletion review will endorse it, but even if it doesn't it won't be unanimous and it won't be 'obvious'. <small>(Someone please translate my metaphor into an American sport so the majority of editors can understand it.

<p>My opinion: Parsssseltongue is doing helpful work. I would encourage him to stay away from controversial closings: don't close anything as "no consensus" because those are the types of debates that need careful reading of policy and might go either way. <i>Especially</i> don't close any debates you participate in, that's a no-no for everyone. Also, it's okay to close as speedy keep if it's obvious and uncontroversial, but you shouldn't be the first to propose that idea (that is, there should actually be some <b>speedy keep</b> votes in the list). Take your closing for <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Stress_%28band%29_9f66.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Stress (band)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Stress (band)</a>. Sure, the nominator was new and didn't say much along the lines of policy... and the article might well be kept. But that article has serious problems if you look at it -- it's unsourced and has big-time POV issues, and should have had a debate (but I don't personally care enough to renominate it). <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 13:49, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The article states that Fidesz "emerged as the core of integrated right conservative nationalist forces"; "the FIDESZ partly incorporated the Antall cult of inter-war nostalgia and what the HDF stood for in their time and reawakened Hungarian nationalism in a somewhat extreme form which eventually backfired in 2002", "The FIDESZ-CP also drifted progressively to more radical nationalist policies rebuilding past images and symbolism, tapping successfully the nationalist feelings". I have recently added two other sources. So, there are now three articles published in the leading English-speaking academic journals. Anyone can check them.

<dd>I had (have) some concerns about this as well, but the <a href="http://www33.brinkster.com/iiiii/inventions/refrigerator.asp" class="external text" title="http://www33.brinkster.com/iiiii/inventions/refrigerator.asp" rel="nofollow">Calendar of Inventive Contributors to the Development of Refrigeration, 1748-1885</a> looked useful enough that I added it to <a href="../../../r/e/f/Refrigeration.html" title="Refrigeration">Refrigeration</a>. The point of the site seems to be, 'You may have heard that an African-American invented X; In fact X was invented by white person Y." Objectively, that should be no different than saying it the other way, "White person Y is typically credited with inventing X, but the real basis for X was this invention by an African-American..." Most of us probably would not object to linking to a site promoting the second point of view, unless we suspected the claims were agenda-driven. At the same time, many of us might be uncomfortable linking to this site for the same reason. And does it matter? Either "Daniel Livingston Holden of the United States took out U.S. Patent No. 95,347," or he did not.

<dd>Well, it depends on the reputation the site has. If it is known to be "problematic" (like spong.com, theinquirer.net, etc) we can remove it. However, if its reputation is fairly neutral, we can keep it.

<p>I posted those links because I wanted to debunk falsehoods associated with the invention of certain things. There are many people who believe in those falsehoods, and know of nothing else that disproves it. That site has everything necessary to debunk those falsehoods. Some of you may worry about the motives, or the intent, of the webmaster, but, judging from the evidence presented at that site, the actual diagrams of the inventions, the references from other web sites, actual US patents, and books, and so on, everything from that site checks out, and is therefore credible. And yes, it was frustrating having to repair the links that were removed just recently. 69.118.97.26 22:55, 9 October 2006 (UTC) <span id="63285410558"></span></p>

<ul>
<li>I'm not on my main computer so this will be brief. If necessary I will return later. First, I don't really care if someone removes warnings without archiving them. There is a conflict between user talk page policy and the vandalism policy about this, which itself resulted in a recent edit war. My comment is in this history, and the edit summary is <i>blocked</i> which is hard to miss. Any other admin dealing with user complaints should check the history and block log, where the block is documented. (Archiving is <i>nice</i> and preferred by the commmunity, but I see little point in forcing such issues in most cases.) So Deathrocker should knock off the talk page fetishism. On <i>ad hominem</i>, I see your point but I don't think its actionable at the moment. Deathrocker should definitely explain his edits with reference to sources, not to his age and personal experience or other editors' youth and inexperience. So knock it off, ok? Finally, if he violates his revert parole again (1 per day, 2 per week), post it to <a href="../../../a/e/_/WP%7EAE_df73.html" title="WP:AE">Arb enforcement</a> rather than escalating to a 3RR yourself.

<dd>I'm not entirely sure that what he's doing can be considered "blanking." There are some questions about the relevance of the information under debate to the article itself, from the looks of the discussion. As Evenfiel points out, it *does* give quite a bit of the article over to what's essentially a debate over whether Led Zeppelin is a heavy metal band.

<p>I now have definitive proof that deathrocker is interested purely in ad hominems and personal attacks, as well as dishonest editing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=78938048" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=78938048" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=78938048</a> As you can see here, everything I posted is honest accusations against him, and had every right to be on this very talk page. However, deathrocker reverted it, claiming I was spamming and that it was not relevant to the page. This is a LIE. I repeat----<i>A LIE.</i> It had every right to be there. He is now clearly not interested in honesty at all. This is not a personal attack, it is a sourced accusation. I am putting it back up here. If he removes it again without a valid reason, I am going to email an admin about it to prevent him suppressing any proof that makes him look bad. I would like to have <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathrocker_4378.html" title="User:Deathrocker">user:deathrocker</a> banned.</p>
<p>See the <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia_Metallum_0a26.html" title="Encyclopaedia Metallum">Encyclopaedia Metallum</a> talkpage for more details.Deathrocker is so incredibly biased against anything having to do with extreme metal that it compromises all his edits and talk page commentary, and he also dislikes Encyclopaedia Metallum, thus making it unfair that he should be able to edit the page. Whenever someone tries to propose that he be banned (in order to let other users new to the article know he is trolling/biased/editing in bad faith), he deletes and claims it is a personal attack, like he did here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Encyclopaedia_Metallum&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=78931646" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Encyclopaedia_Metallum&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=78931646" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Encyclopaedia_Metallum&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=78931646</a></p>
<p>“Encyclopaedia Metallum exclude the band entirely from their database because they are uneducated on the history of heavy metal music...”, “of cookie monster music fans...”, “apposed to the aims of certain extreme metal kids that seem to be drawn to the website of the article's subject and editing this article itself... who can't be bothered to educate themselves, by taking the time to read about what the subject in question; right here---&gt; <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_metal_music.html" title="Heavy metal music">heavy metal music</a>...”, “A Burzum fan attempting to tell anybody what is and isn't genuine metal? <a href="../../../l/o/l/Lolz.html" title="Lolz">lolz</a>, anyway...”, “When people new to metal such as extreme metal kids...”, “Vs. an underground extreme metal site, ran by two kids who...” , “Most of the new extreme metal kids do not view the original heavy metal bands as "metal", because they have been brought up with a watered down more hardcore punk related version and they were not born when the original movement was around. (people).... , “As it is mostly extreme metal kids who have the misfortune...”</p>

<p>Here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Encyclopaedia_Metallum&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=77289284" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Encyclopaedia_Metallum&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=77289284" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Encyclopaedia_Metallum&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=77289284</a> he claims his decision was validated by general consensus, which if you read the talk page back then <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Encyclopaedia_Metallum&amp;oldid=77296804" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Encyclopaedia_Metallum&amp;oldid=77296804" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Encyclopaedia_Metallum&amp;oldid=77296804</a> you can tell is a blatant lie: two/three (him, a lone anon ip and vegataman) vs evenfiel, dace, Reaper, Danteinferno, inhumer, Noktorn, and at least one anon IP address; I didn’t give IP’s much attention for simplicity’s sake. That’s six-to-seven against two-to-three. Casebook example of dishonesty to promote your own agenda; given that the content he changed dealt with whether or not the band included all forms of metal, I can either say one of two things: he either really, really hates the site and wishes to slander its creators in any way possible, or he is so incredibly biased against extreme metal and it's fans (who he constantly, constantly, <i>constantly</i> refers to as "kids" as if there aren't adults who listen to extreme metal, or as if he is above all extreme metal fans in existence) that he simply won't let any article show neutrality towards them.</p>
<p>I can't make this any clearer to the administrators of Wikipedia: STOP HIM FROM FURTHER EDITING ARTICLES. If you want more instances of dishonest editing on his part, I can quote them, I have a few more (and he gives me more material to work with everyday, thanks man&#160;:) ); if you want direct links, I can search them out sometime later this week (I have a lot more important things to do at the moment than try to get a dishonest idiot banned from a website). But if these instances, combined with past transgressions are not enough to have him removed....Christ, would you look at all of that? Editing in bad faith, personal attacks, biased assumptions....if that isn't enough to get him banned, you have no idea how bad it is going to make your website look. The metal community at large already has a distaste for Wikipedia because of biased editing and misinformed editing. I beg you: don't make it any worse.<a href="../../../o/u/r/User%7EOurs18_47e9.html" title="User:Ours18">Ours18</a> 20:58, 1 October 2006 (UTC) Now, if there is a better place to put this, I would like the administrator present to go to my talk page and ask for my email address. I will then give it to you, and you can email me where I should put it: DO NOT SAY IT IN ANY PUBLIC DOMAIN. I have every reason to believe that if you do so, deathrocker will watch that page and edit out any accusations against him. He MUST NOT be allowed to have his way on here any longer. This is an emergency now, he WILL remove any incriminating evidence against him.<a href="../../../o/u/r/User%7EOurs18_47e9.html" title="User:Ours18">Ours18</a> 21:46, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
All of <a href="../../../o/u/r/User%7EOurs18_47e9.html" title="User:Ours18">user:Ours18</a>'s claims are unfounded. Feel free to visit my edits, and talkpage here.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Deathrocker" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Deathrocker" rel="nofollow">[26]</a></p>
<p>The quotes which Ours18 is pulling up out of nowhere from discussion pages are <b>entirely</b> out of context, and twisted to suit the grudge against me that he has, because he added uncited bias to the mallcore article.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mallcore&amp;diff=78925730&amp;oldid=77304800" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mallcore&amp;diff=78925730&amp;oldid=77304800" rel="nofollow">[27]</a> which I then removed stating "unsourced info was added".</p>
<p>Non of the quotes fall under "<a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal_attacks.html" title="Personal attacks">personal attacks</a>" anyway, admin <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">user:Thatcher131</a> has already viewed the articles talkpage which in question... where the user Ours18 is pulling out of context comments to twist into a personal attack against me from.</p>
<p>This user has frequently leveled personal attacks at me claiming that I am "trolling",(for evidence of this attack, see his message on this very board) when I have been editing the site for around a year and my edits to articles have no trace of "trolling".</p>
<p>He has also spammed article talkpages with this personal attack message, and doesn't understand that talkpages are for discussing the article only. I have sent Ours18 a message regarding this. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ours18&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=78933240" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ours18&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=78933240" rel="nofollow">[28]</a> he proceded to level another personal attack at me branding myself a "liar" without evidence.</p>
<p>I have also removed another of Ours18's edits where he attacked a musical movement in an article, dismissing at as the derogatory insult "mallcore". I assume this is an another motive for dragging up cases which have already been looked at by an admin. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Encyclopaedia_Metallum&amp;diff=78921542&amp;oldid=77303852" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Encyclopaedia_Metallum&amp;diff=78921542&amp;oldid=77303852" rel="nofollow">[29]</a> He also had a history of editing with bad faith, attacking users in the edit summary.. calling them "vandals"", as he did to me in the edit provided, despite the fact that there was no "vandalism" in my edit only putting th earticle to a <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a>.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Encyclopaedia_Metallum&amp;diff=78921542&amp;oldid=77303316" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Encyclopaedia_Metallum&amp;diff=78921542&amp;oldid=77303316" rel="nofollow">[30]</a> - 22:02, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As I explained, mallcore is not an entirely derogatory term, which is why I used it (I never use it as an insult). In the future, I will remember not to use it anywhere except it's own article. Furthermore, if you want to accuse me of including unsourced information on the mallcore page, then fine. However, the entire article is unsourced, and my claim is correct. I see the term mallcore used as a genuine term FAR more than an insulting term for numetal and metalcore, so you can just shut up with the nonsense about me being dishonest, okay?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I stopped accusing you of vandalism once I read the article and realized how this site defines it; I haven't done it since and won't do it unless you actually are doing it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>None of the quotes are out of context: they all pertain to your reasons for editing the article: <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia_Metallum_0a26.html" title="Encyclopaedia Metallum">Encyclopaedia Metallum</a> or a related musical article, and they all show why you should not be editing said articles: because you are <i>incredibly biased</i> against extreme metal and EM. This is not an accusation---this is proven. Or at least it was proven, until you removed it from this page with little to no justification for doing so.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Similarly, I did not twist any of the quotes---they are direct quotations. If you don't like it, vow not to say them again, as YOU were the one that said them. As I said, I will provide the links to the admins if they agive me their/his/her emails address(es)---you have proven yourself untrustworthy with regards to keeping proof on a talk page <i>SPECIFICALLY DEDICATED</i> to this very subject. Therefore, I will no longer post proof here, as you will just edit it out anyway, like you did earlier.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And as I already said, it is NOT a personal attack, it is a well-founded and <i><b>sourced</b></i> accusation. That does not qualify as a personal attack. My accusations of trolling are also sourced, as I cannot believe you edited those articles with any other intention than to incite a reaction.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You are the only user on this site I have come even <i>close</i> to attacking, and the only time I have definitely posted with the intention of insulting was on my very own talk page where you did the exact same thing. I'm fucking tired of your condescending attitude you use towards me EVERYWHERE, including my talk page. I am not a KID. I am not an EXTREME METAL KID either, regardless of how much you want to believe that. Such terminology is clearly intended to insult, as is the condescending attitude. If you don't want me acting like I'm better than you, than fucking stop doing it on my talk page. Okay?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Any further accusations will not be posted here, as I already explained. I will email them when I recieve email addresses, and they will be sourced. I apologize if that caused a problem earlier, but I thought the other sourced evidence (as well as his past trangressions) would be enough to show that he is not acting in any good faith whatsoever.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And about that as it pertains to me....well, I am acting in good faith. You have had a grudge against me the whole time you've noticed me, so don't pull that crap with me. I edited the article on mallcore from the standpoint of myself and most others I have met, both online and in the real world, bot extreme metal fans and fans of the traditional metal bands. The term is NOT always meant to insult. Since the entire article has no sources and is already fairly accurate, I figured one more piece of entirely accurate information without a source wouldn't matter. Unfortunately, deathrocker had to insert his own POV "all extreme metal fans are idiots who just hate numetal" (note: not an actual quote), which he did by omitting a perfectly true claim. His revert is obviously aimed to make the whole article simply one big "EXTREME METAL FANS ARE TEH GAY!!!," which is currently what the article actually is: there's nothing to counter the (totally unsourced) claim that it is a derogatory term used solely by extreme metal fans. That was why I added it; it made it much more NPOV than it was and currently is.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Using the term mallcore in another article was a slip-up on my part, as I forgot that this site incorrectly views it as an insult. It won't happen again and hasn't happened since.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Again, I'm going to ask deathrocker this, and I'm sorry if it is blunt (I'm done doing anything in a formal manner with you until you apologize): stop attacking everyone who disagress with you, stop acting like you are above us, and specifically, stop acting like I'm a god damn kid, because for the last time, <i>I'm NOT</i>. <b>That</b> is insulting, especially when you don't even bother trying to back it up and just do it from the viewpoint that everyone who thinks Led Zep is not metal must be a kid or everyone who uses EM for any reason is a misinformed cretin. <a href="../../../o/u/r/User%7EOurs18_47e9.html" title="User:Ours18">Ours18</a> 00:58, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>So now, you've gone from pulling quotes from an issue which has already been looked at... out of context that don't fall under attacks anyway, and twisting them. To absolutely <b>fabricating lies</b> and putting them in quotation marks in an attempt to <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slander.html" title="Slander">slander</a>.. which you freely admit?...</p>
<p>I don’t know what your issues are, but you need to sort it out before wasting my time with nonsense you admit is “<i>not actual quotes</i>”, it comes across as extreme desperation.. desperately attempting to condemn me because of your grudge (which I sourced above)..you can’t actually find anything I’ve said that falls under attack.. so you’re openly creating sentences I’ve never actually said now?.. <b>don’t put words in my mouth</b>... in fact your behaviour is rather worrying, I’d appreciate you not addressing me at all. - 14:19, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The admin noticeboard (as well as /incidents) are rather impractically long despite the frequent archivings. However, part of the cause seems to be people posting stuff here that doesn't really belong here. Do people think it's a good idea if, whenever we see something that belongs on another page, we remove it <i>on sight</i> and place it where it belongs? E.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>Issues about AFD closure go to DRV</li>
<li>Inappropriate usernames go to RFC/username</li>
<li>Normal user disputes go on RFC</li>
<li>Checkuser requests go on RFCU</li>
</ul>

<p>I suggest that you've raised a small part of a bigger problem, exemplified in the <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diane_Farrell_6b4b.html" title="Diane Farrell">Diane Farrell</a> incident above. When process is circumvented, guidelines and community consensus are disregarded, and Wiki business is increasingly conducted on IRC outside of community view, editors may believe the only way to accomplish anything is to post here about the incidents. That's the bigger point I was trying to raise above with the Diane Farrell incident. Wiki has prcoesses which are ignored when Wiki business is conducted on AN and IRC. Maybe I'm wrong about the nature of the problem, but it seems like a slippery slope is increasingly engaged. The Farrell article shoulda/coulda been handled in a way that didn't need to engage AN: there was/is a process in place, that wasn't used. None of those editors, who so desperately wanted her article, would just follow the process and write the election article; so I stayed up last night, learned more about either of those candidates I ever want to know, and wrote it myself. Since the people who wanted the article knew the issues, I don't understand why one of them couldn't just do what I did. There was/is a process, which was ignored in favor of an IRC shortcut. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 17:26, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am bogged down in the middle of couple of moves and need Admin assistance.</p>
<p>A user gutted the <a href="../../../w/a/l/Waldo.html" title="Waldo">Waldo</a> article and created <a href="../../../w/a/l/Waldo_%28short_story%29.html" title="Waldo (short story)">Waldo (short story)</a>. This loses the edit history, though the motivation is good (to avoid unwanted attention by the Where's Waldo crowd). So I undertook to move the pages, but have run into a problem where there is now a redirect that needs to be clobbered (the material has been incorporated).</p>
<p>So this needs to be done:</p>
<ol>
<li>Delete the Waldo (short story -- temp) page. (all material has been saved)</li>
<li>Delete the <a href="../../../w/a/l/Waldo_%28short_story%29.html" title="Waldo (short story)">Waldo (short story)</a> page which is just a redirect now.</li>
<li>Move the <a href="../../../w/a/l/Waldo.html" title="Waldo">Waldo</a> page to Waldo (short story).</li>
</ol>
<p>I think I can pick it up from there, because we obviously want to have the proper redirects and disambiguation pages, and leave the Waldo name open for the Where's Waldo crowd to use. I have transferred and saved all the recent edits by Djdedalus (from the other page) to the Waldo page, so the page history is intact and complete and it is ready to move.</p>

<dd>I'm not an admin, but thanks for pointing out this case of copy-paste moving of text. You are absolutely correct that this should not have happened. My instinct would be to simply revert all these edits back to a version where the edit history of a piece of text is in the edit history of the article where the text resides (rather than in the edit history of a different article). You might need to look closely though to make sure nothing gets lost. And then, if there is an issue of renaming or page moving, find an admin to help merge/move page histories if needed. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 17:08, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think Carcharoth, that you should have a discussion also with myself and Rarelibra. He is trying to set these names straight. If you go back in the archives, this user Gryffindor actually moved a lot of these pages in the past, without any discussions. He did this on Trentino-Alto Adige on 25, October 2005. I would even go as far as accusing this user of abusing the WP system. I'm just warning, be careful who you are supporting in this. The names he has put in place are extremely German POV, definitely to anyone familiar with this region of Italy. my best regards. Taalo 21:06, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Dear Asterion, part of the problem is that the user Gryffindor actually moved the pages by his own accord on 25, Oct. 2005. Since then the pages have been cemented into this new name by a few people with a German POV. He often uses the rules (after the fact) of wikipedia to try and maintain his POV. Isn't this abuse?? This has gone as far as switching all the names from Italian-German to German-Italian. Having the Province of Bolzano/Bozen page stuck as South Tyrol. The Province is Bolzano (Bozen). There is no Province of South Tyrol in Italy. I would dearly like to assume good faith, but the thing though, is through this past year, this user (and now an admin!) has done what he has done. From someone who is actually from this region, it has been utterly discusting to see this process. For the life of me, I can't see why a few people are doing this.. and why we can't just come up with names that SHARE this region, as is actually done in the region. Thanks for getting involved though, I really do appreciate that. Taalo 21:37, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To reply to Taalo, and to clarify the reference to <a href="../../../r/q/m/WP%7ERQM_4dc3.html" title="WP:RQM">WP:RQM</a> (Wikipedia:Requested moves), I have no opinion (yet) about which names the articles should be under. That is something that should be discussed at <a href="../../../c/o/m/Talk%7ECommunes_of_South_Tyrol_781c.html" title="Talk:Communes of South Tyrol">Talk:Communes of South Tyrol</a> (as Asterion says) or some other suitable place. I am more concerned that wholesale cutting and pasting has taken place, and without even using edit summaries saying from where the text was moved. For more on why text with a long and extensive edit history <b>must</b> be moved using the Wikipedia 'move page' function, rather than by cutting and pasting, please see <a href="../../../m/o/v/WP%7EMOVE_8a50.html" title="WP:MOVE">WP:MOVE</a>.

Then we start a mediation process, listen to all sides and propose a decision as uninvolved, (hopefuly) unbiased and (hopefuly) respected users. --<a href="../../../d/i/j/User%7EDijxtra_582d.html" title="User:Dijxtra">Dijxtra</a> 15:09, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>In my own defense - it seems that we are ignoring the past, which Taalo has been able to point out. This page was moved indiscriminantly by an admin who just so happens to have a lot of connection with some of the articles. Even after all of the evidence has been shown as to a number of sources and references showing the title to be "Trentino-Alto Adige" (for the region) and "Bolzano (Bozen)" (for the province), we still run into flack. The page move has been requested and this is a case of disregarding the so-called 'consensus' to correct the name that is listed with the United Nations and with the Italian government. To allow this naming convention to continue is not only a biased POV but it is not in keeping with the 'fair and just' policies of Wikipedia. Because if I'm not mistaken, care is to be taken as to the proper translation and respect for multilingual areas such as this one - and "South Tyrol" is only a derived English version of the "Sudtirol" German portion - for a province that exists in Italy. The name "Bolzano" is the Italian province name, with "Bozen" being the German version, thus the title "Bolzano (Bozen)" would suffice in keeping with the respect of the rules. Same with the region - "Trentino-Alto Adige" is given the alternate of "Sudtirol" (not "Trentino-South Tyrol"). Thus, I may have been incorrect in the approach, but the overall goal was just and correct. This has been completely ignored in the midst of all of this. I think this is so obvious, yet to ignore it is to ignore the very spirit of why wiki is here.</p>
<p>Also in my defense, as I was doing such moves/changes I did go back and make sure all of the links were corrected and redirected. I have taken quite the personal abuse from various users (admin or not) which I don't appreciate - especially when we were all supposed to have assumed good faith. In making such changes, the good faith was to correct a wrong. Instead, well, here I am on the defensive. Think or judge what you wish, but the situation remains unresolved. We have even had users who live in the province state the correct name ("Bolzano") or the region name ("Trentino-Alto Adige").

Also, I don't believe I am claiming "innocence and pity" at all - or please point out where I do (in your own biased way). So your use of such words is attacking and offensive as well. Please refrain from using such judgmental words and, instead, approach more cautiously. I would definitely appreciate it. <a href="../../../r/a/r/User%7ERarelibra_30fe.html" title="User:Rarelibra">Rarelibra</a> 17:06, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Facts are easy to see - and the debate wasn't about actions and talk pages. The debate - the biggest problem I had - was your approach and choice of words. You should be more careful in choosing to use harsh words, especially when you are going to choose to lecture someone yourself. Otherwise it takes away from the effect by loosing any and all applicable respect to what you have to say. You <b>can</b> be stern about rules and, at the same time, be completely nice about things as well. As far as edits after warnings, well - sometimes you don't always get to see a talk page if you have two or three browsers open and are trying to make correctional edits to biased POV articles. Give some credit where credit is due. I'm sure you've made your share of mistakes. <a href="../../../r/a/r/User%7ERarelibra_30fe.html" title="User:Rarelibra">Rarelibra</a> 01:22, 9 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>As I said above, my choice of words were because your talk page was littered with various people rightfully asking you to stop doing cut-and-paste moves - all of whom you ignored. Asking nicely was not making any progress. Diverting you away from doing things incorrectly resulted in Taalo doing things correctly and got one of your articles renamed as you wanted so far. You're welcome. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 02:55, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wow - are you trying to take the credit for that? Or are you asking for me to thank you for any of this? Because if you are asking for a personal "thank you", you'll be severely disappointed. It almost sounds like you are justifying being noncordial and rude by saying "asking nicely was not making any progress" - is this correct? I am trying to understand your words. <a href="../../../r/a/r/User%7ERarelibra_30fe.html" title="User:Rarelibra">Rarelibra</a> 05:50, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You keep throwing around "noncordial and rude". What exactly is noncordial and rude about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Rarelibra&amp;diff=79153045&amp;oldid=79149215" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Rarelibra&amp;diff=79153045&amp;oldid=79149215" rel="nofollow">this edit</a>? It has a nice "please" on it and a "Let me know if you have any questions". That was after you had ignored four or five requests to stop, causing one person to get so desperate as to list you at <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>! With 5 non-consensus regular moves and even more non-consensus cut and paste moves, all in a 13-hour span on October 2 alone, now I'm thinking I should have just blocked you as extremely disruptive instead of simply warning. Read the above messages in this section and read your own talk page - and esp. notice how many different users are involved in both places - and then try to tell me that you weren't being disruptive. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 15:35, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While making this list, now I'm confused as to why you chose me to get so angry with. Mine was one of the last warnings you received - meaning I had the most reason to be stern - and mine was actually one of the more cordial ones. Along with Thatcher131, Carcharoth and Dijxtra here and Taalo as well, you singlehandedly stirred up a bees' nest of 13 people... most in a single calendar day. Now please don't tell me you didn't cause a disruption and don't feign horror at how I chose to address you. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 17:38, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, bottom line is you don't have the right, in either case, to be rude, inconsiderate, insulting, brash, etc. Whether I did or did not is <b>not</b> the debate here. It seems to be the case that you think it was <i>justified</i>, in which case, it wasn't. As you try to educate me, so do I try with you - making statements of "I should have just blocked you..." and the borderline "you're welcome" statement above - when taken in the wrong context - smack with quite an amount of attitude. Since tone and inclination cannot be deciphered from text, we are all supposed to assume good faith that they are positive (which I don't think has been the case on many sides of this ongoing debate/discussion). The good thing is that progress <b>has</b> been made already on one page - and a neutral party is aiding in the mediation process. But the disappointing thing - and I must say I have a right to state this - is the lack of awareness and one-sided judgment that took place on both Taalo and myself. The neutral party brought in could see that <b>all</b> parties were guilty of one thing or another (admin or otherwise). In that sense, certain individuals should have <i>all</i> been removed from the discussion - and not singling out one or two. You see, I am comfortable being in this position, especially if the end result brings about a change. It's called being the 'sacrificial lamb' or sometimes 'the martyr'. And after 19+ years in the US military, it runs off like water on a ducks back. I'm not even concerned with wether or not you agree with me or realize your own errors (in a sense). So if there isn't anything else, let's both move on to what we were doing best before this whole thing. <a href="../../../r/a/r/User%7ERarelibra_30fe.html" title="User:Rarelibra">Rarelibra</a> 20:10, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>IMO, block the IPs for 2 weeks only. If you look at their contribution history, you'll see the contributions all fit within a short timeframe (4-5 days). Also, use the anon-only block option. Based on the time period of the edits, these may be dynamic IPs, so indef-blocking them might be a bad idea. 2 weeks should be sufficient when they crop up. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 18:56, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>I'm specifically referring to article Encyclopaedia Dr amatica, where I've placed a speedy delete tag - the page (as well as Encyclopedia dramatica) is an attempt at a remake of Encyclopaedia Dramatica which was protected from remake. It's frustrating that this user won't listen to requests on his talk page as well as repeated edits to keep those tags on. I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask, but I would appreciate if someone could delete and protect those pages, or whatever the right procedure is?

<dd>I'm asking here because Medcom has a 38 case backup and the chairman hasn't been seen in three months. I'm both an admin and one of the coordinators for Mediation Cabal, and the reason I chose this venue for my question is because typically admins watch this noticeboard, and as such they typically are trusted by the community and well versed in dispute resolution and Wikipedia policies.

<dd>It depends on how it's used - if someone messages all editors of a particular article, that's useful notification. If someone messages all users likely to "vote" a certain way, for example, self-identified inclusionists, that's hurtful canvassing. Does the fact that it's a template really make any difference?

<dd>Contacting all the editors who've worked on an article seem good - they all got an interest, some knowledge, and a stake. OTOH they will also normally be pre-disposed to keep the article.

<p>An interesting noted from Brad on WikiEN-l:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The volume of corporate vanity/vandalism which is showing up on Wikipedia is overwhelming. At the office, we are receiving dozens of phone calls *per week* about company, organization, and marketing edits which are reverted, causing the non-notable, but self-aggrandizing authors, to scream bloody murder. This is as it should be. However, I am issuing a call to arms to the community to act in a much more draconian fashion in response to corporate self-editing and vanity page creation. This is simply out of hand, and we need your help.</dd>
<dd>We are the #14 website in the world. We are a big target. If we are to remain true to our encyclopedic mission, this kind of nonsense cannot be tolerated. This means the administrators and new page patrol need to be clear when they see new usernames and page creation which are blatantly commercial - shoot on sight. There should be no question that someone who claims to have a "famous movie studio" and has exactly 2 Google hits - both their Myspace page - they get nuked. Ban users who promulgate such garbage for a significant period of time. They need to be encouraged to avoid the temptation to recreate their article, thereby raising the level of damage and wasted time they incur.</dd>
<dd>Some of you might think regular policy and VfD is the way to go. I am here to tell you it is not enough. We are losing the battle for encyclopedic content in favor of people intent on hijacking Wikipedia for their own memes. This scourge is a serious waste of time and energy. We must put a stop to this now.</dd>

<p>So, are we ready for db-spam yet? And should we be protecting articles subject to vanity edits? <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 08:53, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I definitely support db-spam. It's quite frustrating to take the articles through AfD and get bashed by a hoard of socks, anon IPs all extolling the "greatness" of the company. Waiting 5 days to clean up the garbage is really very frustrating. Also, there is hardly a difference between the bio vanity and these types of corp-vanity. --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 08:59, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Definitely not an administrative issue; however, this non-administrator thinks that your reading of the situation is correct. This is the English Wikipedia, not Italian, and in English the Italian word "paparazzo" is almost never used, even though its plural is very common in media discussions. Moreover, the convention toward using the singular has a bit less force (though it is still a good idea) for nonstandard (or foreign) plurals where the difference may be more than one letter S. I think it definitely falls under the category of necessary exceptions. <tt style="color:#161;">Gavia immer <small>(<a href="../../../g/a/v/User%7EGavia_immer_59c2.html" title="User:Gavia immer">u</a>|<a href="../../../g/a/v/User_talk%7EGavia_immer_91e5.html" title="User talk:Gavia immer">t</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Gavia_immer_82c8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Gavia immer">c</a>)</small></tt> 18:48, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would like to bring to general attention User:Dev920/Userproject:Conservatives. No objection could be made to any project devoted to improving articles, but this particular one states its aims as "by producing NPOV but comprehensive articles, assist the Tories in winning elections" and states that every member "should be a Wikipedian first and foremost, and a Tory second".

<dd>The Doc's very reasonable objection (above) aside for a moment, the page seems anodyne enough until the very end, where it suggests that people may be recruited via a message such as <i>Hello, I noticed you edited {article} and <b>from your edits you appear to be a Conservative</b>, so I'd like to invite you</i> etc etc (my emphasis). Despite the commendable insistence on avoiding expression of a PoV, this message is not incompatible with a suspicion that the userproject is intent on recruiting those who have exhibited a PoV. Could the insistence on avoiding a PoV be mere lipservice? ¶ I wonder about naming. A huge percentage of WP editors are from the US, and "conservative" in a US context I think means "paleoconservative" or "retrogressive" in a British one.

<p>As I outlined on the Userproject, the aim is produce Conservative party-related articles to a high and NPOV FA standard; <i>any</i> article submitted for GA or FA would immediately have any POV stomped on: and I welcome this! Hoary accuses me of lipservice to NPOV, but if you look at my contributions, I have consistently added NPOV information, usually with references, and have an FA standard article to my name, <i><a href="../../../j/a/k/Jake_Gyllenhaal_907c.html" title="Jake Gyllenhaal">Jake Gyllenhaal</a></i>. I don't want to create a Wikiproject politics because I only want to edit Conservative articles. I tried very, very hard to convey that message on the page. Yes, I am Conservative, yes, I want the Conservatives to win the next election, does this mean I will do that by skewing the facts? No! I'm an ideological conservative: I believe that if two ideologies were placed side by side, the Conservative one would seem obviously better to any impartial observer. Writing Conservative FA articles would show those ideas to a much greater audience. I have no desire to introduce POV to Wikipedia. Note that I wrote that I was working on the assumption that Labour articles would one day be at exactly the same standard - <i>"we're just getting there first"</i>. You are concerned because I have admitted this POV upfront: how many would do that before simply editing articles to suit their beliefs? Please stop pillorying me because US Republicans are amoral spinners.</p>
<p>Obviously, I am aware there is a potential for people to push their own POV on Wikipedia. I am opposed to this (look at my edits to <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a>): that's why I emphasised NPOV so strongly on my page. This is why I invited <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFys_bced.html" title="User:Fys">Fys</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Fys&amp;diff=80655061&amp;oldid=80298305" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Fys&amp;diff=80655061&amp;oldid=80298305" rel="nofollow">act as a NPOV checker</a>, as a security against POV, even inadvertent POV. Instead, he reported me here. How can you judge a project that has not even begun work? How can you argue a page that exists in the user namespace should be deleted, when I have demonstrated absolutely no abuse of Wikipedia policy, and in fact, quite strongly uphold it? Hoary claims my invitation message indicates an intention to promote POV: why? A project to encourage Conservatives to join has to find them, does it not? Have I not made it absolutely crystal clear I would not, if this project took off, tolerate any vandalism of articles (because that's what it is)?</p>
<p>I have set up this project in my user namespace specifically because it was POV(though it's work would not be). I am a dedicated Wikipedian with a track record in writing neutral articles, and have no intention of changing this. Please do not condemn a project that has committed no break with policy, that exists for editors <i>to admit their POV</i>, which would lead to even greater scrunity of any articles written (which I would hardly do if I wanted to skew articles to my POV). If you want a project that writes POV into articles, delete <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Islam%7EThe_Muslim_Guild_0890.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Islam:The Muslim Guild">The Muslim Guild</a>, which <i>does</i> put POV into their articles, and which I have consistently tried to correct. But please don't assume bad faith. That happens too much on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDev920_f8f8.html" title="User:Dev920">Dev920</a> (Tory?) 15:21, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Please <i>do</i> compare it to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Islam%7EThe_Muslim_Guild_0890.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Islam:The Muslim Guild">The Muslim Guild</a>. That explicitly says "Although the Muslim Guild carries the word "Muslim" in its name, we encourage members of any faith to participate as long as they are knowledgeable about Islam as a religion and are willing to present an unbiased and balanced view of Islam." It does not say "... and assist Islam in winning converts" - if it did, I suspect it would be treated the way this project is being treated. Just remove the part about explicit Tory <i>support</i>, and I suspect your project will get along fine. Writing articles about Conservatives will tend to attract a lot of Conservatives anyway, but you can't make a particular political point of view a requirement. You will attract a few liberals (and Liberals), and you can't discourage them. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 16:09, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I have already explicitly outlined why I set up this project in my userspace; I'm not going to move it into a Wikiproject.</li>

<p>Moving onto the threat to delete my project because it is clearly POV: having a POV project page isn't actually contravening <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. I don't know if you've actually read the policy, but let me quote the relevant parts (emphasis added): "All Wikipedia <b>articles</b> must be written from a neutral point of view (NPOV), representing significant views fairly and without bias.

<p>If you delete my Userproject, you are overstepping your bounds as admins. I am a conscientious Wikipedian, and I have done my utmost to work within the rules. I have not contravened any policies, and you cannot delete my project on the basis that <i>you</i> think one day I might.

<p>I'm a Socialst and have always declared it on my user page to avoid any conflicts of interest (I edit neutrally, not as a Socialist). I'd like to ensure that the UK never gets a Conservative government ever again. Can I join your "userproject" and edit on that basis? If so, thanks!.. but how would that fit with existing Wikipedia policies? If not, why not?.. and how would that fit with existing Wikipedia policies? I'm sure you can see where I'm going here, but if you can answer both of these questions, I'd be pleased. And fascinated how you did it.

<li>No, you couldn't have joined. Because you didn't agree with the aims of the project. Would you join a Wikiproject whose remit you were not interested in? No. That fits with existing Wikipedia policy because there are no guidelines which specifically cover Userprojects (because they get deleted on sight by jaded admins) and so the rules governing Wikiprojects would apply: only sign up if you're interested. As you are a socialist, there would be little point in you joining an explicitly Conservative project. Instead, I would have encouraged you to set up Userproject:Socialists and suggested a friendly competition to see who could reachg matching FAs first. This would obviously have fitted with Wikipedia policies as much as Userproject:Conservatives does i.e. completely. This is of course, however, now completely irrelevant because admins would rather assume bad faith than even allow a project they don't agree with get off the ground. (And btw, you might want to emigrate before the 2009 election: Labour are going doooooown...) <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDev920_f8f8.html" title="User:Dev920">Dev920</a> (<a href="../../../m/i/n/Wikipedia%7EMini_Talkpage_Template_64eb.html" title="Wikipedia:Mini Talkpage Template">check out this proposal</a>) 21:40, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>So you are confirming that your goal is to organise a political faction, excluding any editors whose politics you disagree with, and then argue that this is an appropriate use of Wikimedia resources because it is in userspace instead of projectspace?

<dd>Frankly, what I put in my userspace, as long as it is Wikipedia related and not obscene or defamatory, is none of your business. The goal of Wikipedia is to produce the world's most comprehensive free encyclopedia - an aim I utterly agree with. I wouldn't have started a project that existed to contribute to that goal if I did not believe in it. You are simply failing to understand what I wanted to achieve because you think you know what I was planning - but you evidently don't or it wouldn't have been deleted. I was seeking a group of like-minded editors to produce NPOV articles on a specific subject. Our reason for doing it is entirely irrelevant to the Wikipedian community, because the results of our work would have been exactly the same as any editor's. You keep saying it was inappropriate, but there was no policy it contravened or you would have quoted it at me by now. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDev920_f8f8.html" title="User:Dev920">Dev920</a> (<a href="../../../m/i/n/Wikipedia%7EMini_Talkpage_Template_64eb.html" title="Wikipedia:Mini Talkpage Template">check out this proposal</a>) 21:55, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I'd rather not, because that is precisely the way that policy pages get bloated and confusing. We can't cover every bad idea on a policy page. Anyway, your confusion isn't about that, it is about this idea that "what [you] put in [your] userspace, as long as it is Wikipedia related and not obscene or defamatory, is none of your business" is wrong. We're not here to provide no-holds-barred webhosting for you. Your userspace is content that Wikimedia is publishing, and is subject to more or less the same rules and guidelines as the rest of our content. <b>As a courtesy</b> we generally give editors a lot of leeway in what they do with their userspace, but it is not a sacrosanct loophole to evade community standards for the project. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 22:04, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"We're not here to provide no-holds-barred webhosting for you." <i>Did I say that</i>? Did I say I wanted to use the userproject as a tubthumping call to Conservatism? No. Was I not at pains to emphasise the role of the project was to write <b>NPOV</b> articles on Conservative party related issues? Yes I was. Did I want webhosting, or was I trying to run a collaborative project to ultimately improve Wikipedia, though in select areas? The only difference between my Userproject and any Wikiproject was that it was coming from an admitted POV viewpoint: a point <i>that had no bearing</i> on the articles written, as any FA article is NPOV. I fail to see how any project that exists to write FA articles for Wikipedia can ever be considered against the goal of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDev920_f8f8.html" title="User:Dev920">Dev920</a> (<a href="../../../m/i/n/Wikipedia%7EMini_Talkpage_Template_64eb.html" title="Wikipedia:Mini Talkpage Template">check out this proposal</a>) 22:13, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was trying to write an article on Ludger who is a prominent musician in the Montreal music community. He is a first prize winner of the 2001 Polliwog Contest which is the premier annual new music contest in Quebec. And someone, whoever you are started deleting me before I was halfway started!!!! What is this place? Who are and what are you doing? When one clicks on "Ludger" in the list of Montreal musicians in the corresponding wikipedia article they get a "Saint Ludger", not the musican Ludger who should by rights be included here as member of Montreal's music scene.

As Lawrence King correctly notes, that page has only been edited by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Powelltimothy_2e69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Powelltimothy">User:Powelltimothy</a> (click for contributions), most probably Mr Powell himself (<a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22timothy+michael+powell%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22timothy+michael+powell%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">122 unique Ghits</a>). The only contributions so far have been to paste his biography and to add an edit that was reverted as self-promotion (see link above). The article is also unwikified, not categorised, and is orphaned (not linked from any other articles), and is not a recreation.</p>
<p>Can anyone remind me what is the best course of action in a case like this? I know one solution is to move the page to the user page with a "no thanks" message explaining why this is not acceptable practice on Wikipedia (creating your own bio), but I can't find the templates for that. The userfying is acceptable due to the username being used here. I think I would be right in thinking that "assume good faith" would avoid speedy deletion or PROD in the case of such a recent creation, as that kind of "first encounter" might end up discouraging future contributions from someone who might have misunderstood Wikipedia's practices (this scenario is supported by the lack of categories, lack of incoming links and lack of wiki-links).</p>
<p>The only other thing I am worried about is whether such a course of action should be <i>preceded</i> by a welcome message, to, well, be more welcoming. So I think: (1) Welcome the new user; (2) Move article to userspace and say "thanks, but no thanks", and give standard explanation; (3) Some unspecified time later, speedy delete user page if no further contributions or discussions appear to be forthcoming.</p>
<p>I'd be grateful if someone could point me to where this probably very frequent process is documented, with links to the relevant templates (if the process is not documented, it should be - though the process does depend on whether the editor conveniently self-identifies, as here, and how soon the article is discovered - if the article had been discovered a year later, and the editor had made no further contributions, the good faith goes out of the window and the 'self-promotion' case is all-but-proved - discovery immediately, as here, means <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> applies).

<dd>Unless it's an obvious (or at least highly ambiguous) case of accidentally creating a user page in the wrong place, I think userfying vanity articles is a bad practice. I've occasionally gone back and checked, and in the vast majority of cases:</dd>

<dd>That's an impressive bit of analysis. I agree that where a new account is obviously persistently adding vanity stuff about themselves, they should be warned and then have their pages deleted and their edits reverted. My concern is that newcomers can genuinely think what they are doing is OK. We should allow a brief period of grace, plus a warning, and then, if they show no signs of learning from their mistakes and/or doing any more editing, they can be classed as a drive-by vanity spammer, and the appropriate action taken. It is easy to fall into the trap of, after speedying hundreds of vanity articles, to think that all of them are drive-by vanity stuff. Some won't be. Anyway, in this case, I have a note to check after a month, and then nominate the user page for deletion (at MfD, I think). I didn't know about {{<a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUserfied_2a2a.html" title="Template:Userfied">Userfied</a>}}. I had already said something similar at <a href="../../../p/o/w/User_talk%7EPowelltimothy_8ca4.html" title="User talk:Powelltimothy">User talk:Powelltimothy</a>, but that template makes some other points that I missed. I'll add it now. Thanks. The final point to make is that in this case only two edits were made. Looking at the bio, it is entirely possible that if that person is made to feel welcome, they could contribute useful stuff about music. Which is why I think in this case userfying, and then later deleting if nothing else is forthcoming, is best. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 13:26, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>during edits to an article on Chatham, New Jersey and Chatham Township, New Jersey I encountered an editor who chose to vandalize a chart to make his argument seem true... I have tried discussing it on TALK with this result... what recourse do I have?</p>
<p><i>This Wikipedia image that lists the communities in Morris County and shows them on a map, directory to Morris County communities was altered just a few minutes ago by you to read as you wish it to... that is vandalism and I will report it if you do not correct it -- your behavior is pathetic and unprofessional.</i></p>
<p>O rly? I'd call it professional, actually. I find errors and I fix them. The Census bureau does not know of a town by the name of Chatham, NJ. So you're just making something up. Go ahead and report it. —lensovet–talk – 20:27, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>now lensovet has deleted the discussion in TALK related to the issues and made multiple reversions to the edits -- do you have an award for this type of behavior? I see that he has started a web page on this topic, isn't it self-serving for him to control what is on Wikipedia so that it agrees with his viewpoint alone?</p>

<p>That is an <b>anti-Wikipedia threat</b>, which confirms your intention to bully and vandalize in order to have your way in an issue regarding which you have demonstrated that you do not have a neutral point of view. You maintain a web page on the topic of a township in which you used to live and it seems that you wish it were the town because it was featured in a magazine as one of the best places to live...</p>

<p>[ more about the webmaster ] I was born in St. Petersburg, Russia on 4/22/87 and came to US at the end of 1996. I lived in Chatham from 1998 until the summer of 2005, during which time this site was born. I am involved in numerous "computer" projects; I am the former webmaster of the Reeves-Reed Arboretum in Summit. Currently, I am a localizer for two Mac OS X applications, Fire.app and Camino.app, translating their interfaces into Russian, so that they are available to a wider audience. I occasionally do minor editing on Wikipedia, and lately I have been trying to lend the Russian translation team at LiveJournal a hand.</p>
<p>This information, provided to the world by you, has some significant differences from your bio in Wikipedia: Personal biography</p>
<p><i>I was born in Leningrad, RSFSR, USSR (present-day St. Petersburg, Russia), where I lived until 1996. At the end of that year, I moved to Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, New York, where I spent roughly a year and a half before moving to Chatham Township, New Jersey. I graduated from CHS in 2005, and embarked on a cross-country road trip with my dad in the summer of that year. Currently, I live in Granada Hills, California when I'm not in college, and I attend the University of California, Berkeley during the academic year.</i></p>
<p>You also note on your User Page:</p>
<p><i>My name is Paul, I work on a number of open-source projects. I specialize in web design and localization.</i></p>
<p>My goals for Wikipedia are to correct errors or unclear phrasing, and to make more articles available/bring existing articles up-to-date into Russian. The Russian-related goals have taken a total back seat at this point, so I'm mostly rewording passages. Every so often <b>I actually write my own material from scratch</b>.</p>
<p>Writing one's own material from scratch is not following the principles of Wikipedia, regarding original material, but it seems to be your style. That is acceptable on your own web page, not as a Wikipedia editor. I have no intention to get into an edit war with what seems to be an immature bully who will rewrite established pages and charts to make them conform to his personal and distorted point of view. One could characterize that as an obsession. Only Wikipedia suffers from such wars.</p>
<p>I have participated with many editors on Wikipedia to work out differences in approach or data to include in many articles, under tolerant and ethical conditions in good faith. My success in those collaborative efforts has made working on those articles rewarding and enjoyable.</p>
<p>You have now altered several longstanding articles because of what seems to me to be a personal issue. They no longer fit the pattern of their peer articles. It could only be detrimental to Wikipedia for me to continue attempting to make edits to improve these articles that you have altered and intend to dominate. Your methods and attitude give me an insight into the tales of frustration seen among other editors who continue to try to work with what seem to be rogues and wind up only with rants as the final product. A couple of efforts to make a contribution are worth spending one's time... there are millions of articles in Wikipedia for one who truly wants to improve it.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm disturbed by the level of animosity in what to call the non-Township Chatham. I will say that the Census Bureau is a spectacularly poor source to use to determine the name of the municipality. Far more relevant would be references by the municipality to itself (though a web site will often use a formal name that isn't used venarcularly) and to how the locality is referenced by locals, say in the media. Using the Census Bureau proves absolutely nothing. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 01:09, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>This guy grabs at whatever (he thinks) will justify his actions... I am glad that others recognize the absurdity of using the census bureau as an authority. The community has been called Chatham, New Jersey for over a century -- he even used it on his web page for the town (for which he is seeking donations!). Thanks for speaking up. I see that you have provided significant contributions to many similar articles. ---- kb 2006.10.16</p>

<p>This article has become little more than a battle ground for a dispute between a cofounder/first employee of a company and the other (co)founder over the history of the company and which of the two men made what contributions. The son, Christopher Gray, is editing anonymously from dynamic IPs while the cofounder/employee has registered under his own name (<a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeoffrey_Wickham_8b1a.html" title="User:Geoffrey Wickham">User:Geoffrey Wickham</a>/<a href="../../../g/e/o/Geoffrey_Wickham_1a90.html" title="Geoffrey Wickham">Geoffrey Wickham</a>). The Gray takes the view that his father did everything and that Wickham was just along for the ride. Gray cites <a href="http://www.asap.unimelb.edu.au/bsparcs/scripts/bs-bib.php3?pubid=ASBS00284" class="external text" title="http://www.asap.unimelb.edu.au/bsparcs/scripts/bs-bib.php3?pubid=ASBS00284" rel="nofollow">a compilation of his father's notes that he (Christopher Gray) put together</a> to verify most of his edits. The two of them have been jockeying around with wildly different versions of events, removing citations, removing sources and citations from the References section, and generally having a slow moving edit war that has lasted for months. They are two of maybe a half dozen people who miight be able to provide some sort of expert opinion on the subject, one because he was there and one because he has all his father's writing and grew up while it was happening. The article was protected to try to start meaningful discussion; it didn't work. I tried an RfC and got nowhere. The talk page/talk page history is filled with legal threats, personal attacks, incivility, and general immaturity. Any suggestions? Any admin in Australia want a project? The company is quite notable and should be included in Wikipedia, but it isn't possible to verify much of it from overseas.—<a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWAvegetarian_a804.html" title="User:WAvegetarian">WAvegetarian</a>•<a href="../../../w/a/v/User_talk%7EWAvegetarian_1514.html" title="User talk:WAvegetarian">(talk)</a> 16:46, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Those edits occurred within the last week, hardly "old", and some <i>clearly</i> have prejudicial intent. A quick look at your edits (as both Caligvla and Calgvla) shows plenty more prejudicial anti-Armenian edits. For instance, your claim that Image:armenian6.jpg and other deleted images are typical of Armenians is ludicrous and clearly of racist intent. <sub>└</sub>&#160;<sup><b><a href="../../../o/s/g/User%7EOsgoodelawyer_264a.html" title="User:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="blue">OzLawyer</font></a></b></sup>&#160;/&#160;<sub><i><a href="../../../o/s/g/User_talk%7EOsgoodelawyer_92f4.html" title="User talk:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="black">talk</font></a></i></sub>&#160;<sup>┐</sup> 01:49, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First, my apologies for having to put this bit of a screed here, but unfortunately it seems my only resolve, sans posting this on the admin notice board, which I'm not even sure is the proper route -- or if there even is a proper route for that matter(I will post it there as well). According to what I've read, only other administrators keep a proverbial "eye on each other", so to speak. As it is, <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">William M. Connolley</a> has repeatedly abused his powers as an admin, as well as being completely derelict in his duty of using those very same powers. The first incident I had with <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">William M. Connolley</a> involved a 3RRV report I had filed on <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamdrake_04b4.html" title="User:Ramdrake">Ramdrake</a>, who had broken the 3RR. In fact, he had broken it twice in as many hours. The reverts were rather obvious and there was no confusion over whether or not he made the reverts, yet <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">William M. Connolley</a> chose not to enforce the wikipedia rules for either infraction. Further, he actually blocks me for several hours on the grounds of "incivility". He explains nothing, discusses nothing. His comments were incredibly terse, his actions equally arbitrary. The supposed "incivility" I can only guess was related to a comment where I had sarcastically inferred that it was very odd that someone with a PhD in biological science would repeatedly cite anthropologists and other "social scientists" on matters that were completely in the domain of biological science itself! Very, very odd indeed, almost comically so. I immediately clarified the statement in case it was taken wrongly, and Ramdrake himself said he had not taken offense to that comment; instead, he had taken offense to the fact that I called several of his cites "garbage studies that were written like op-ed pieces"(some of them weren't even studies, but were in fact opinion pieces). Ramdrake later changes his mind, however, and cares more about the sarcastic commnet I made about his selection of studies. In any event, <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamdrake_04b4.html" title="User:Ramdrake">Ramdrake</a> violates the 3RR --twice-- but is not punished, and I get my editing privileges suspended for calling op-ed pieces "trash/garbage". In a more recent encounter with <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">William M. Connolley</a>, we had a user vandalize, whether intentionally or not(you must forgive me: I am not a mind reader), the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Schumacher_8477.html" title="Michael Schumacher">Michael Schumacher</a> wiki. I reverted three times, and repaired the overt vandalism once. Another admin trying to stem the resultant edit war created a talk page section regarding the situation, but, curiously, <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark83_60bf.html" title="User:Mark83">Mark83</a> refused to take part, despite the fact he was so adamant about the issue to begin with that it had driven him to vanadlize the page, later claiming his vandalism was the result of ignorance, not maliciousness. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark83_60bf.html" title="User:Mark83">Mark83</a> has a history of vandalizing that schumacher wiki, however, so it was hardly a shock to me he would be back at his old tricks. Apparently, he had not bothered to read the cites he was busy deleting -- go figure. Then he demands to see the cites when he had just got done deleting the very cite he was clamoring for! Then I get a message on my talk page from <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark83_60bf.html" title="User:Mark83">Mark83</a>, a "neener-neener"-like message detailing that I had been reported on the 3RR board. Interestingly, the person reporting me was not <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark83_60bf.html" title="User:Mark83">Mark83</a>, but was instead <a href="../../../m/u/c/User%7EMuchness_6152.html" title="User:Muchness">Muchness</a>, someone with absolutely no connection to the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Schumacher_8477.html" title="Michael Schumacher">Michael Schumacher</a> wiki. He has never contributed to the wiki as far as I can see. The net result of this indcident? --I-- got suspended, for an entire 24 hours, too. On top of that, <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark83_60bf.html" title="User:Mark83">Mark83</a>, the only one that actually violated the 3RR, received no punishment. Apparently, <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">William M. Connolley</a> isn't quite sure if reverting four times vioated the 3RR. He is sure, however, that reverting 3 times is. Ridiculous. This is twice in a row <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">William M. Connolley</a> has been derelict in his duties as an admin and twice he has abused his powers.

Connolley</a>, but it makes me very curious if he has had such a history with other persons.

<dd>Back to the issue. Ernham, blocks here are mainly for preventative purposes, not punitive. They are not meant to be used as "punishment". Also, remember that even admins are volunteers here and have no "duties" - they are not required to block anyone at all, so withholding a block is not abuse of power. So then what we're talking about then is unbalanced treatment. Regarding the reverts, your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Michael_Schumacher&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=81105091" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Michael_Schumacher&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=81105091" rel="nofollow">edit summaries</a> accusing Mark83 of vandalism were really good grounds for a block as well as revert warring, and while he probably did violate 3RR you will find that admins tend to side with those who don't yell and throw personal attacks at others. I would suggest that instead of writing long phrases here you just go to the disputed article and try to reach consensus on the talk page, without any revert wars - they <i>never</i> help anyway.--<a href="../../../k/o/n/User%7EKonstable_8474.html" title="User:Konstable">Konst</a>.<a href="../../../k/o/n/User_talk%7EKonstable_e0b7.html" title="User talk:Konstable">able</a> 08:24, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yeesh, make one comment about a squirrel and you're marked for life... Anyway, I explained to the user how to use diffs when making a complaint.

<dd>I think it's extremely unfair to claim it's ok to block someone even if they are in the right (<strike>as this Mark person did break 3RR and Ernham didn't</strike>) on the basis that they can't keep their temper. How is that in any way in keeping with the spirit of Wikipedia? If what is written above is the full story, Mark should have been blocked and Ernham warned about incivility, <i>then</i> blocked if he persisted. The admins shouldn't be "siding" with anyone: they should be doing what their role requires of them. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDev920_f8f8.html" title="User:Dev920">Dev920</a> (<a href="../../../m/i/n/Wikipedia%7EMini_Talkpage_Template_64eb.html" title="Wikipedia:Mini Talkpage Template">check out this proposal</a>) 08:40, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ernham was not in the right on <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Schumacher_8477.html" title="Michael Schumacher">Michael Schumacher</a>, he was revert warring and accusing Mark83 of vandalism in big caps locked edit summaries. Ernham has had two prior blocks for incivility and 3RR, so I think futher violations don't warrant too many warnings.--<a href="../../../k/o/n/User%7EKonstable_8474.html" title="User:Konstable">Konst</a>.<a href="../../../k/o/n/User_talk%7EKonstable_e0b7.html" title="User talk:Konstable">able</a> 09:09, 15 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I did wonder if that was the full story or not. That does change the situation. I've checked his contribs edit summaries and he isn't very pleasant to people who think are wrong and/or vandalising. A block for personal attacks is fair. But Ernham was blocked for 24 hours for allegedly breaking 3RR when he didn't actually do so, which he explained on his talkpage (though I guess I am assuming good faith here, so correct me if I'm wrong). Which seems unfair. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDev920_f8f8.html" title="User:Dev920">Dev920</a> (<a href="../../../m/i/n/Wikipedia%7EMini_Talkpage_Template_64eb.html" title="Wikipedia:Mini Talkpage Template">check out this proposal</a>) 09:34, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>did you even bother to read/see what Mark83 did?

<dd>Well, I can only guess he/she in fact did not bother to read such. If you would have done so, you would have already noticed that I went to the talk page; the would-be vandal did not. It was about as classic a case of simple vandalismas one could produce, so there is no debate over whether or not this was vandalism, warranting the usage of the word. I did not "caps lock a response". I used caps in half of a sentence to emphasize that particular portion of the sentence. <a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnham_36c9.html" title="User:Ernham">Ernham</a> 11:08, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ernham has repeatedly called me a vandal for honest edits. After numerous requests to stop personal attacks and withdraw the vandal comments I opened a request for comment <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Ernham_1da9.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Ernham">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Ernham</a>. Despite this, the many requests and warnings to stop personal attacks, Ernham continues to do so. As for the 3RR incident; I have explained my edits <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_3RR_dc8f.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/3RR">Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/3RR</a> and welcome any admin to review it again. I warned Ernham that another revert would be a violation, he reverted and I did not revert after that. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark83_60bf.html" title="User:Mark83">Mark83</a> 18:50, 15 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Further to Mark's post to my talkpage, I would like to say that he has acted in an honourable fashion to Ernham's reverts, that he stayed within 3RR, and has been unreasonably attacked by Ernham, who accused him of vandalism for questioning a dodgy correlation on the Schumacher page. Mark appears to be an exemplary Wikipedian.</dd>
<dd>In the light of this, Ernham's block for 3RR now seems utterly justified, as he was given appropriate warnings. I still do not entirely agree with the block for incivility though. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDev920_f8f8.html" title="User:Dev920">Dev920</a> (<a href="../../../m/i/n/Wikipedia%7EMini_Talkpage_Template_64eb.html" title="Wikipedia:Mini Talkpage Template">check out this proposal</a>) 19:14, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Because Ernham doesn't seem to realise how incivil he is being. I have tried to tell him he shouldn't be rude to other editors, but he thinks his incivility is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ernham&amp;diff=81568615&amp;oldid=81566580" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ernham&amp;diff=81568615&amp;oldid=81566580" rel="nofollow">justified</a>. Until a user understands what they are doing is wrong, (i.e., saying that they don't care, or that they will say what they damn well like, or comments in that vein, which indicates that they know what they are saying is incivil but they don't care) there is no point in blocking them for incivility. It aggravates the situation by making them feel put upon. You can't punish someone who doesn't accept the crime. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDev920_f8f8.html" title="User:Dev920">Dev920</a> (<a href="../../../m/i/n/Wikipedia%7EMini_Talkpage_Template_64eb.html" title="Wikipedia:Mini Talkpage Template">check out this proposal</a>) 20:50, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

You were not repairing vandalism, you were reverting a good faith editor who had removed an extremely tenuous link.

<dd>Actually that had nothing to do with his vandalism. He deleted a cite that specifically substantiated parts of the paragraph, with no explanation for doing so. Then he claims that it was uncited and demands a cite the tiny fraction he left. The cite he demands is the very one he deleted. Not only did he cause disuption with his shenangin, but he delete valid information. He doubly vandalized.

<dd>Only one of my blocks was legitmate, and I was completely a newbie here, being attacked by a bunch of rabbid Formula one zealots. And my sarcastic use of "personal attack" is a joking demonstration in how equally ridiculous is to say it's a personal attack for me to call someone that vandalizes a website a vandal. That said, I find it interesting the rapist "she deserved it" logic that is rife with the here. Perhaps this is a sockpuppet show? Mabye "the blue line"? The reality is the mod in question has been completely biased in his use of admin powers and, quite frankly, should not have those powers if this is a common theme of his. It's clear by the fact he does not even understand the rules he enforces that he should --obviously-- not be enforcing those rules. Crazy.</dd>

<dd>It's obvious that most are vandalism. It's not obvious to me that all are, perhaps because I have now knowledge whatever about most things he's writing about. My inclination is to ban him (I always think of vandals as male) permanently, but I've been so brainwashed by the mantra of AGF, etc., that I desist. (Anyway, he'd just come up with a new username, making whack-a-mole more laborious.) I've given him a three-hour vacation. Perhaps others better qualified than myself can go through his list of "contributions" during this period and work out what to do with him. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 03:05, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks. I went through the whole list and ended up reverting everything. The only ones I couldn't verify as vandalism were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rap_snacks&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=81676394" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rap_snacks&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=81676394" rel="nofollow">this one</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Malden_High_School&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=81529279" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Malden_High_School&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=81529279" rel="nofollow">this one</a>, but once it was clear that all the rest were vandalism (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Larisa_Turchinskaya&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=81530290" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Larisa_Turchinskaya&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=81530290" rel="nofollow">this</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Larisa_Turchinskaya&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=81530290" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Larisa_Turchinskaya&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=81530290" rel="nofollow">its successor</a> this are doozies), I figured it was probably the best idea to revert the rest. Just has me thinking ... I'm not an admin, but for those of you who are, an admin tool that allowed for automatic rollbacks of all of a specific user's edits where there were no subsequent edits might be useful for cleaning up after these one-day vandals. | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">Mr. Darcy</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a></small> 03:25, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sure would. In cases like these, yeah, just revert 'em all; if the pure vandal happens to have sullied his purity by making a non-vandalistic edit, oh well.

<dd>Agree with Jpgordon. In cases like this, after seeing the first vandalism, I usually check two or three others, then if they are all vandalism, just machine-gun them all.

<dd>It is worth watching out for the possibility that, among that lot, you end up reverting the vandal's reverting of someone else's vandalism! If your edit summary says "reverting vandalism", it is possible no-one will check, and the 'reversion of reversion of vandalism' will go uncorrected.

<p>Well, I warned you that I found this mildly interesting. I first thought of using a Wikipedia "list of famous people", but they've all been deleted. I then tried to come up with a few names myself, and stuck "User:" in front of them. The results are at <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html#Test" title="User:Carcharoth">User:Carcharoth#Test</a>. Of the 24 names I could come up with, 11 have never been created, 4 are existing accounts (three inactive, one active <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShakespeare_5f6f.html" title="User:Shakespeare">User:Shakespeare</a> - with one of the inactive ones being a redirect - <a href="../../../s/a/d/User%7ESaddam_Hussein_826e.html" title="User:Saddam Hussein">User:Saddam Hussein</a>, who stopped editing during the time the real <a href="../../../s/a/d/Saddam_Hussein_75a3.html" title="Saddam Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> was on the run...), 1 account is a suspected sockpuppet (<a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorge_Washington_e0e0.html" title="User:George Washington">User:George Washington</a>), 3 are banned users (<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHitler_b4ff.html" title="User:Hitler">User:Hitler</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBonaparte_0e16.html" title="User:Bonaparte">User:Bonaparte</a> and <a href="../../../a/t/t/User%7EAttila_the_Hun_c67c.html" title="User:Attila the Hun">User:Attila the Hun</a>), and 4 user pages have been deleted as old user pages of banned users (including User:God and User:Jesus). One of these pages has even been deleted twice, with User:Joseph Stalin being recreated around a year after it was deleted the first time (shouldn't there be a way to stop this?). The final one, bringing the total to 24, is <a href="../../../i/d/i/User%7EIdi_Amin_02d2.html" title="User:Idi Amin">User:Idi Amin</a>, which has been cybersquatted by <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeoffrey_54da.html" title="User:Geoffrey">User:Geoffrey</a>, presumably to prevent vandals using this name.

<p>I'm working on standardizing an infobox for national economy articles with <a href="../../../i/n/f/Template%7EInfobox_Economy_3c62.html" title="Template:Infobox Economy">Template:Infobox Economy</a>. So far, it's going well, but I not sure exactly what to do with legacy infoboxes. On most national economy pages that have an infobox, a separate template is used for the box. When I apply my template on an article that already has a table, I usually rewrite that template. But really, the infobox should be on the main article. So the template has to be deleted. I did this for <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economy_of_the_United_States_3325.html" title="Economy of the United States">Economy of the United States</a>, working through TfD, but it would be cumbersome to do this for each box individually. Am I allowed to speedily delete these templates myself, skipping TfD and citing that first case as a precedent? [Also, if anyone wanted to help me work on applying the economy infobox to all economy articles, a huge task, that would be great.] <small><a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELittleDan_7151.html" title="User:LittleDan">LittleDan</a></small><sup><a href="../../../l/i/t/User_talk%7ELittleDan_c646.html" title="User talk:LittleDan">talk</a></sup> 22:52, 16 October 2006 (UTC) <span id="63286068957"></span></p>

<dd>If he's been blocked on checkuser evidence than the proof can't be revealed per Foundation policy. Given that it's a sockpuppet block that seems the most likely explanation.

<dd>I don't think there was ever a formal checkuser request filed through the RFCU page. If you look at Karmafist and Mackensen's talk pages from around August 17, you will see that around the time Karmafist was asking to come back, Mackensen pointed out that he has used several socks to participate in an RFA, and asked him to withdraw those comments as a show of good faith. Karmafist claimed innocence. Shortly after that the People Powered account was created. Interestingly, NoSeptember twigged to the possibility last month during my RFA, which I had forgotten about. Karmafist's last edits are right on the boundary of technical checking, but one of the checkusers may have records going back to August. I think there are enough possibilities here to at least wait for a fuller explanation from Freak or someone else with the correct information. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 07:32, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I'm a MedCab mediator and recently we have received a case, which is probably more suited for admin intervention...</p>
<p><a href="../../../d/u/k/User%7EDuke53_0b5c.html" title="User:Duke53">Duke53</a> has posted a message on his own user page that implies <a href="../../../d/u/b/User%7EDubc0724_51dd.html" title="User:Dubc0724">Dubc0724</a> is a racist because a website used as a citation for the University of New Jersey at Durham article turned out to be sourced from a hate group. Once the error was realised, <a href="../../../d/u/b/User%7EDubc0724_51dd.html" title="User:Dubc0724">Dubc0724</a> replaced this citation with a more appropriately sourced alternative. The article in question, University of New Jersey at Durham, has subsequently been deleted and is now merely a redirect.</p>
<p>Essentially the <a href="../../../d/u/k/User%7EDuke53_0b5c.html" title="User:Duke53">Duke53</a>'s user page comments possibly amount to an infringement of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> and in this context, <a href="../../../d/u/b/User%7EDubc0724_51dd.html" title="User:Dubc0724">Dubc0724</a> requests admin intervention to arrange their removal.

<p>This user likes to hold and keep long grudges.

<p>I've noticed a couple administrators using nick names in their signatures that completely obfuscate their real username. I would think that this would generally be a bad idea; it affects perception of the administrator's accountability. Use of nick names makes it difficult for another user to verify admin status at the administrators list. Logs don't list usernames, so it makes it difficult to see if the person you were talking to actually performed the block/deletion/etc. And finally, use of nick names is discouraged at <a href="../../../s/i/g/WP%7ESIG_e615.html" title="WP:SIG">WP:SIG</a> and <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSERNAME_bbd4.html" title="WP:USERNAME">WP:USERNAME</a>. Administrators should be held to a higher standard when it comes to following policy. I was wondering if my interpretation is correct here.

<dd>Orane is an old user (older than the new user log) with no contributions, but <a href="../../../c/h/u/WP%7ECHU_759d.html" title="WP:CHU">WP:CHU</a> to this name for <a href="../../../j/o/u/User%7EJournalist_823c.html" title="User:Journalist">Journalist</a> would probably be refused anyway. Resolving possble problems this way probably causes less confusion than anything else. As for Nearly Headless Nick - sure, slight vanity, but many people will get it. (although his username should be "Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington" and his nickname "Nearly Headless Nick" to conform to Harry Potter). No big deal, let people have their little harmless vanity as long as they link to their userpage or talk page. <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> <a href="../../../k/u/s/User_talk%7EKusma_087e.html" title="User talk:Kusma">(討論)</a> 12:52, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>To expand on this, many things we have (most of fancy formatting on userpages) are not directly about building the encyclopedia. They are about feeling good while building the encyclopedia. Happy contributors build a better encyclopedia, so as long as their vanities are not disruptive (like a sig with a link to a different user would be) I see no reason to annoy good users about this. <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> <a href="../../../k/u/s/User_talk%7EKusma_087e.html" title="User talk:Kusma">(討論)</a> 12:55, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your objections are a tad odd. While userspace can get a bit myspacey, sigs certainly do not tip that boundary. Conflicts with nick names and other users taking them are rare, all actions are tracebale through the username, and figuring out who is who is as easy as scrolling over a link. As one of the few admins to use and sign with their whole, real name, I still see no problem with nick names (no matter how utterly stupid, which is a lot sadly), sig nicks (ditto), and do not believe it is an issue. --Jeffrey O.

<dd>I don't really have a problem with anyone using a nick that differs from their log-in name, as long as the signature links to the correct user page/user talk page. Now I may be missing something, but at <a href="../../../s/i/g/WP%7ESIG_e615.html#Customizing_your_signature" title="WP:SIG">WP:SIG Customizing your signature</a> it says "<i>Signatures that obscure your account name to the casual reader may be seen as disruptive</i>" can you show a legitimate example of where Journalist, or anyone's signature has caused disruption? Also, I agree with Jeffery O.

The problem is that only real usernames are listed in logs. An editor shouldn't be required to play Wikipedia Sherlock because an admin wants to be cute.

Usernames that are complete replacements are. —<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalber_d5cd.html" title="User:Malber">Malber</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMalber_7564.html" title="User talk:Malber">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Malber_b734.html" title="Special:Contributions/Malber">contribs</a>) 14:38, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Yes, that doesn't do any good sorry. Can you <i><b>show</b></i> where this has caused disruption? Can you provide a link that shows that *whomever's* signature, caused a ruckus? Seems to me that someone shouldn't have to change their sig just because one or two people got confused. The policy states that disruptive signatures are discouraged. A handful of people being confused is hardly disruption. Really it's not hard to figure out who is who. <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledgeOfSelf_7104.html" title="User:KnowledgeOfSelf"><font color="#151B8D">K</font><font color="#7D1B7E">O</font></a><font color="#6D7B8D">S</font> | <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledgeOfSelf_36c0.html" title="User talk:KnowledgeOfSelf"><font color="#461B7E">talk</font></a> 14:55, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>From above: <i>Logs don't list usernames, so it makes it difficult to see if the person you were talking to actually performed the block/deletion/etc.</i> If you wanted to talk to someone who blocked/deleted/etc, and you were looking at the logs, wouldn't you click on the username to get to their userpage?

<dd>Here's a more demonstrative example: An admin with a sig in their nick participates in an AfD debate. The debate closes as delete when the result is ambiguous. Same admin closes the debate as delete and deletes the article. The logs won't be representative of the conflict of interest because of the obfuscated sig. There is a potential for abuse here that can be prevented by requiring admins to use their real username in sigs. A precedent is with e-mail; regular editors aren't required to register e-mail addresses; this was and established part of wiki-culture. Prospective admins are now required to do so as part of the RfA process for accountability reasons. —<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalber_d5cd.html" title="User:Malber">Malber</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMalber_7564.html" title="User talk:Malber">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Malber_b734.html" title="Special:Contributions/Malber">contribs</a>) 15:06, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>When closing AfDs admins sign after recording the result at the top, so you can check if their signature appears at the top and in the body of the AfD. So there would only be a problem <i>at first glance</i> if the admin changed their signature between participating and closing. And even then, simply hovering over the link will disclose their username. Alternatively, you can compare the <a href="../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_delete_f5f8.html" title="Special:Log/delete">log</a> entry with the history of the AfD page, both of which display the actual username and not the signature. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a>&#160;(<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 15:11, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>A couple of other places where this behavior would be disruptive: requests for comment and requests for arbitration. Users listed here are listed by real username not the nick name.

<dd>You are just trying your best, arent you Malber? As the others repeated, just hover your cursor over the signature, and the name comes up. If a new user sees my username, he/she is more inclined to click on it (which would take him/her to my userpage Journalist). In the first sentence, it mentions that I'm Orane. No big deal. In AFDs or whatever, look in the history to find if the Admin who closed the debate voted in it. It's as simple as this. I've had this sig for a year now, and many time I've participated in discussion signing with Orane, and have people reply to me by saying "Journalist...". There is no confusion.

<dd>I think using a sig different from your username is completely unacceptable. It means you actually have to <i>hover over the link</i> to find out the username. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 20:47, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>I think a major problem is that everyone here is an experienced Wikipedia user, so a very one-sided perspective is being produced. A new user will not immediately consider the possibility that one's signature may not correspond to one's username. For example, even though I've been around for awhile, I've seen Nearly Headless Nick on talk pages, and Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington in history pages, but never realized that they were the same person. If the need had ever arisen, I'm sure I could have figured they're the same person, but the point is that to the inexperienced Wikipedian, one user naturally appears to be two.<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDeli_nk_ed07.html" title="User:Deli nk">Deli nk</a> 21:05, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm going to put my main comments in the thread on the Village Pump, but I can confirm that this sort of practice <i>can</i> cause confusion. Not for long, if you are prepared to investigate a bit, or if you are alert, but I have been confused by this sort of thing in the past (it is a particular problem if, like me, you read <i>very old</i> discussions). Sometimes I have seen people morph their signatures in the <i>same thread</i>, and have had to do a double-take to make sure I knew who was saying what (the above example of this, although obvious, was a good example). <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 00:38, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I <i>do</i> like it when people on Wikipedia find a solution in need of a problem. The 'pedia does have a number of problems - nothing fatal, nothing insurmountable - that might attract someone looking to provide a solution. But, instead, we always collectively find something that doesn't cause problems and worry about it forever.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If people are finding <i>anyone</i> signing under a name that does not link to their user/user talk page, then there's a problem... with the individual who is mis-signing. However, if people are signing as Jim but are actually Paul, it doesn't matter, so long as Jim's user details are accessible by clicking Paul's sig.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Put it this way: the "misunderstood new users" we have "mistaken" for vandals (always their discription of themselves) will, invariably, find our correct user names <b>even when we don't sign the {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest_d929.html" title="Template:Test">test</a>}} post</b>. They will also find our email link. They will find someone to complain at. So they don't have a problem. So who does that leave suffering from the hell that is Jim signing as Paul? Er... nobody.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Of course, there will always be people who try to overplay the mark-up and write to others by writing to Wikipedia talk:Jim or <a href="../../../j/i/m/Talk%7EJim_e972.html" title="Talk:Jim">Talk:Jim</a> when they are aiming for Jim's talk page.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I note that this, as ever, is not a talk thread aimed at the million or so editors here, just the 1,000 elected administrators. The automatic, embittered assumption that anyone who has been elected an administrator by their peers is a crook continues.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>We have the odd poor administrator. We also have 900 other human beings with sysop buttons, with all the terrible flaws that come from... being human. We can't allow for that, any more than we can allow for people getting embittered and writing timewasting threads, or getting community-minded and seeking to help us all out of a major issue.

<dd>Congratulations. You have ignored half the arguments raised in this thread, repeated arguments already raised by others, and added a small amount of original hyperbole. You've also managed to take affront on behalf of 1000+ people by failing to assume good faith. Really, you should have taken your own advice and moved on. Nothing to see here? Several people have mentioned that confusion <i>is</i> possible. The 'problem' may be overblown, but you don't need to shout it down. You could have politely thanked Malber for raising this issue, and then, equally politely, have presented your reasoning, and then let the discussion reach its natural conclusion. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 23:08, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Seeing all these "it doesn't really happen" implications, I should probably mention that I have personally become confused over "Cyde"/"Cyde Weys" before. It was a while ago, but I think I was looking up various admins' actions on some page.... I don't see any positive benefit for people obfuscating their user name (except if they're de-obfuscate their real identity, of course), but... *shrug*. (And even in the case of using one's real name, they might list their username also, in the style of the ArbCom's listing of arbitrators.) —<a href="../../../a/y/s/User%7EAySz88_15e3.html" title="User:AySz88">AySz88</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AySz88_57ae.html" title="Special:Contributions/AySz88">\</a><a href="../../../a/y/s/User_talk%7EAySz88_f90d.html" title="User talk:AySz88"><font color="#FF9966">^</font><font color="#FF6633">-</font><font color="#FF3300">^</font></a> 23:07, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hmmm... I've used 'CBD' because it is more concise than 'CBDunkerson' (or 'Conrad Bertrand Dunkerson') and my only concern has been that someone might sign up with the actual username 'CBD' and I would need to switch to avoid confusion (which is also why I don't use 'Conrad'). However, I can see where if someone wanted to send me a comment and just remembered seeing 'CBD' they could be confused when typing in 'User talk:CBD' doesn't work. Redirecting 'aliases' to actual usernames could prevent any such dangers, but would then reduce the pool of available usernames. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 17:45, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

I had made a complaint about the above instances to more than a dozen admins.

<p>Unfortunately none of the <i><b>more than dozen</b></i> admins I had complained to took any action. Admin Blnguyen himself, I believe was on a Wikibreak. However, for whatever reasons, none of the admins ventured to mediate or even so much as serve Mahawiki with a stern warning.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Mahawiki's incivility hasn't stopped or abated one bit even since then. Below are the list of further instances of incivility by him.</p>

This IS <b>slander</b> and a PERSONAL ATTACK.<br /></p>
<p>Please note: Most of his incivility falls under one of the following categories.</p>
<p>a) Calls me or Dineshkannambadi a snob, troll, <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kannada.html" title="Kannada">Kannada</a> bin laden, jehadi, terrorist, vandal etc.,.<br />
b) Almost every second edit summary of his accuses us of vandalism. This is something that Blnguyen himself had cautioned him against more than a month ago when he had blocked him. And yet, he continues to do it.<br />
c) Arbitrarily trashes all respectable sources cited by us as 'fanatics', 'fiction writers', 'rubbish', 'biased' etc.,. He has rubbished sources like <a href="../../../d/e/c/Deccan_Herald_6dd9.html" title="Deccan Herald">Deccan Herald</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hindu_e4f3.html" title="The Hindu">The Hindu</a>, Dr. Suryakanth Kamath (a highly respected historian of national(India) and international repute), Dr. Jyotsna Kamat(another historian of wide repute) - both are decorated historians with awards from the Govt of India.<br />
d) Goes around accusing all <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kannada.html" title="Kannada">Kannada</a> editors, especially myself and Dineshkannambadi of 'vandalising' articles, 'kannadising' articles and pushing POV. He carries out this accusation on random users' talk pages but <b>never once</b> does he engage in any meaningful discussion on the talk pages of the articles in spite of being asked/told more than once to take his concerns to the respective article's talk page.<br /></p>
<p>This is just a sample of his incivility and I am sure you can find more if you keep digging. For almost the past one month, I have tried my best not to engage him in any conversation, but he keeps trailing me and lands up wherever I go.</p>
<p>For the last couple of days both he and his pal <a href="../../../a/r/y/User%7EArya_Rajya_Maharashtra_6561.html" title="User:Arya Rajya Maharashtra">User:Arya_Rajya_Maharashtra</a> had been serving me with frivolous warnings. They accused me of 'abusing popups'. Curiously, in their warnings, <u><b>they did not even bother to point out <i>where</i> the purported 'violations' had taken place!!</b></u> Frivolous as they were, I started archiving them and removing them from my talk page. They misrepresented this and Arya even filed a 3RR against me!! Do I need to remind anybody that 3RR doesn't apply to reverts done on your own talk page?!</p>
<p>However, <b>I am extremely disappointed and peeved</b> at Admin Blnguyen's hasty block of me.</p>
<p><b>Whats worse, not a single admin has bothered to show up on my talk page even after I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASarvagnya&amp;diff=82014265&amp;oldid=81961475" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASarvagnya&amp;diff=82014265&amp;oldid=81961475" rel="nofollow">appealed</a> to be unblocked!!</b></p>
<p>This is a travesty of every rule of civility on WP and I demand an explanation AND and intervention from the admins. I also demand that strong action be taken on <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">User:Mahawiki</a>.</p>
<p>And please dont ask me to go for <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">WP:DR</a> for what is so patently a question of incivility. <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">WP:DR</a> is something I would use in a content dispute and a content dispute is not something I have with him at the moment. The evidence I've provided here should be enough for any admin to haul him up on grounds of blatant incivility. No content dispute can or should ever be used as an excuse for incivility. And I hope the admins dont give him any such loopholes to keep beating around the bush. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 20:43, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm sorry the whole situation has upset you so much. May I suggest requesting an <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssociation_of_Members%27_Advocates_d8b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Association of Members' Advocates">advocate</a>? Also, private mediation probably could help if you wanted to work something out with Mahawiki, even in a non-content dispute, but not if you just want it all to end. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmedblowfish_0e51.html" title="User:Armedblowfish">Armedblowfish</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/m/User_talk%7EArmedblowfish_5587.html" title="User talk:Armedblowfish">talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Armedblowfish_d1c9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Armedblowfish">mail</a>) 21:16, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>We've already been past an official advocate(<a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerique_6b89.html" title="User:Amerique">User:Amerique</a>) and many <i>unofficial</i> mediators. The last time we had an advocate(User Amerique) it didnt change anything. Mahawiki was his usual uncivil self. So much so, the advocate who had entered the mediations at Mahawiki's behest, abruptly left the proceedings. Admin Blnguyen has blocked him once already for blatant incivilty. That was probably about 2 months ago. After the block was over, he was back to his incivil ways as can be seen in the appeal I made about one month ago to the 'dozen-plus admins'. And like I said none of the dozen plus admins I appealed to took any action on him - some were on Wikibreaks, some were busy, some didnt know enough about the background etc.,. It was only Admin Utcursch (<a href="../../../u/t/c/User%7EUtcursch_88c9.html" title="User:Utcursch">User:Utcursch</a>) who stepped in and to give credit to him, he did solve a couple of <i>content disputes</i>. But even he didnt pull Mahawiki up for his incivility. And Mahawiki continued his incivil ways even when Utcursch was part of the proceedings. The diffs 58-74 I've listed above are from this period, ie., after Admin Utcursch stepped in.</dd>
<dd>And like I said, I dont see any point in pursuing DR unless incivility ends. And I think I've placed enough before the admins here for them to haul him up. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 21:52, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, private mediation could be set up such that you two could avoid talking to each other directly, at least in the beginning. This would allow the mediator to filter out the potentially offensive material. (By "potentially offensive", I don't mean to make a judgement over whether certain material is "uncivil" or not, merely whether or not it is likely to be upsetting to the receiver.) If both you would consider that worth trying, mediation could still be a useful option. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmedblowfish_0e51.html" title="User:Armedblowfish">Armedblowfish</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/m/User_talk%7EArmedblowfish_5587.html" title="User talk:Armedblowfish">talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Armedblowfish_d1c9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Armedblowfish">mail</a>) 22:55, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>As you can see in front of your very own eyes, his incivil ways continue unabated! He calls our edits 'fanatical' and what not. He says Dineshkannambadi is taking WP for a ride!! Dinesh is an outstanding editor of impeccable record and has almost single handedly written so many articles, some of which are on their way to FA status even as we speak. Will an administrator please ask Mahawiki to explain his accusations in <b>no uncertain terms</b>. Simply throwing accusations left, right and center without a <b>shred of evidence</b> to back it up is a classic case of personal attack and slander!! This has to end <b>NOW</b>!</li>
<li>This is not the first time he is making accusations like this. He has made this accusations several times in the past and his targets have been articles like <a href="../../../r/a/s/Rashtrakuta.html" title="Rashtrakuta">Rashtrakuta</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/j/Rajkumar.html" title="Rajkumar">Rajkumar</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/u/Seuna.html" title="Seuna">Seuna</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/v/Kaveri_river.html" title="Kaveri river">Kaveri_river</a> etc.,. Please go and check the history of edits on the talk page of these articles. On some of these articles, he doesnt even have a single edit to his name on the talk page!! And yet, he is crying hoarse of Dinesh taking people for a ride!! What cheek! I have already given a detailed description of his antics in my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Blnguyen/Archive27#Mahawiki" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Blnguyen/Archive27#Mahawiki" rel="nofollow"><b>complaint made one month ago</b></a>!! I cant believe I am still having to repeat this same thing over and over and over again!</li>
<li><b>Now he accuses me of being anti-<a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindi.html" title="Hindi">Hindi</a>. Can an admin please ask him to prove it? Or if he cant prove it, can an admin please call his bluff and put him in his place?</b> All that I have done is question the <i>need</i> for having transliterations in Hindi on <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jana_Gana_Mana_84d3.html" title="Jana Gana Mana">Jana_Gana_Mana</a>, <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vande_mataram.html" title="Vande mataram">Vande_mataram</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sare_Jahan_Se_Achcha_39c5.html" title="Sare Jahan Se Achcha">Sare_Jahan_Se_Achcha</a>. That doesnt make me anti-<a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindi.html" title="Hindi">Hindi</a>!! And I have discussed this at <i>excruciating</i> length on the respective talk pages. It is there for everyone to see. The admins can also check with respectable editors like <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESameerKhan_2c38.html" title="User:SameerKhan">User:SameerKhan</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">User:Ragib</a> who were party to those discussions from start to finish. This again is an example of Mahawiki trying to mislead people by misrepresenting his opponents' stands. I have every right to consider this a personal attack!</li>
<li>What really does it take for admins to clamp down on this sort of brazen incivility?</li>

<dd>Yer. You're not entirely helping this situation with your impatience, but I have issued (yes, another) warning to the other user for his part. Edit warring and arguing really doesn't help anything. Mediation, RfCs, eventually Arbitration... you might want to look at going down these avenues. Your diffs and explanation are lacking in context which makes the argument somewhat hard to grasp and may be why few have responded so far (as well as activity slowing somewhat at this time of day/night), and I'm pretty tired at the moment so I can't help so much myself. -- <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsumed_Crustacean_06d3.html" title="User:Consumed Crustacean">Consumed Crustacean</a> <small>(<a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConsumed_Crustacean_e411.html" title="User talk:Consumed Crustacean">talk</a>)</small> 05:54, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>What is Mahawiki trying to prove below by quoting from random content disputes on multiple articles? A prolific contributor like Dinesh is bound to run into content issues on the many articles he edits. Why is that of concern to Mahawiki?</li>
<li>What business does he have quoting out of context a content dispute Dinesh had with Parthi 6 months ago?(Mahawiki probably wasnt even on Wikipedia then). And infact, its curious that Mahawiki is complaining when Parthi or the other editors whom Dinesh has supposedly harassed havent complained. Parthi infact, is working with Dinesh, to get Dinesh's <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chalukya.html" title="Chalukya">Chalukya</a> article to FA. They're doing this as we speak! <u><b>And in any case, why is Mahawiki bothered about Dinesh's dealings with X, Y or Z. Let him just explain his own incivility vis a vis <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">User:Sarvagnya</a> and <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDineshkannambadi_c09f.html" title="User:Dineshkannambadi">User:Dineshkannambadi</a>.</b></u></li>
<li>If he has the guts let him either explain his brazen incivility or atleast let him make a list of the instances where I have been incivil.</li>
<li><b>Please note once again, <u>all the instances I've listed above are instances of incivility</u> and many a time uncouth behaviour by Mahawiki. No content issue can ever be used as a fig leaf to cover up such shameful behaviour.</b></li>
<li>And needless to say, most if not all the content disputes he has selectively quoted from tonnes and tonnes of discussion, is bogus.</li>
<li><i><b><u>Once again, I ask the admins to ask him to explain his incivility and not divert attention to sundry content disputes to cover up his incivility.</u></b></i></li>
<li>Also note: I am not interested in digging into the Belgaum issue again and again. That was one place where <b>all parties involved</b> were incivil and <b>all of them</b> have been pulled up for that by the admins. And among 'all of them', it should perhaps be pointed out that it was Mahawiki alone who was handed a block for being extraordinarily uncivil.</li>
<li>The instances of incivility I have listed above <b>DO NOT</b> include anything from the Belgaum dispute. All the instances I have cited are from <b>after</b> admin Blnguyen blocked Mahawiki the first time(that was probably close to 2 months ago).</li>

<p>In my book, his unilateral removal of the tag constitutes vandalism and he might be trying to prove a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> after his AfD failed.</p>

<li>I don't see what vandalism or WP:POINT has anything to do with it.

<dd>I have restored the page for now. I politely ask that you discuss first and not unilaterally delete. That page has been online for nearly three years, and was never an issue for the community during this time. In fact, it was useful to have in order to keep track of students' work so that folks could identify otherwise random patterns of edits/newbies. It as the project that inspired the creation of <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchool_and_university_projects_a92e.html" title="Wikipedia:School and university projects">Wikipedia:School_and_university_projects</a>, so I would appreciate you leaving it intact.

<dd>From the page you linked: "The focus of user pages should not be social networking, but rather providing a foundation for effective collaboration." Which seems to be met here.

<dd>I think some of the issues are relevant to this forum. The pages seem perfectly fine (there is nothing in <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> saying that classroom collaboration pages are forbidden), and certainly the initial deletions don't seem justified in any way. Indeed, looking at this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=delete&amp;user=Naconkantari&amp;page=" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=delete&amp;user=Naconkantari&amp;page=" rel="nofollow">deletion log</a>, not all the subpages or subpage talkpages have yet been undeleted. The deleting admin could have taken the time to investigate, and seen that time and effort had gone into this set of pages. Thus leaving a message on the user's page would have been far more preferable. This is not some drive-by vandalism or MySpace-type set of pages that were deleted. What I would like to see discussed is whether <i>anyone</i> can defend <a href="../../../n/a/c/User%7ENaconkantari_d810.html" title="User:Naconkantari">Naconkanturi</a> carrying out these deletions (which is after all why Naconkanturi put the action up for review), and whether anyone is going to properly undo all the deletions? I apologise if I am going too far here, but everytime I see a set of deletions like this, I feel that someone should check the other deletions by that admin to make sure similar mistakes haven't been made. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 21:52, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Note that I cannot put this on either of the admin's involved pages; Cowman is on Wikibreak, CSCWEM has his talk page protected.</b></p>
<p>I was recently conducting a test using a <a href="../../../6/9/2E/User_talk%7E69.51.87.130.html" title="User talk:69.51.87.130">school ip</a>. The point of this test was to discover whether or not people actually use <i>diffs</i> when looking in RC, or if they choose to revert simply because of edit summaries and the passing IP address. The edits from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=69.51.87.130" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=69.51.87.130" rel="nofollow">September 5th and up are mine</a> (excluding Oct 9, 17, and 23 edits, all of which were made after this). Using edit summaries most would consider truly awful, I went around and actually <i>edited constructively</i>. For the most part, response was good. I did not receive a single revert or warning. Had I, I would have explained the situation and gladly stopped. I really like Wikipedia, I'm just far too curious for my own good.</p>
<p>I noticed someone had mistakenly left a comment intended for the talk page of an article in the article itself. So I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Battle_of_Evermore&amp;diff=78168001&amp;oldid=78111110" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Battle_of_Evermore&amp;diff=78168001&amp;oldid=78111110" rel="nofollow">took it out</a>. <a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurch_e84c.html" title="User:Gurch">Gurch</a> promptly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Battle_of_Evermore&amp;diff=78168087&amp;oldid=78168001" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Battle_of_Evermore&amp;diff=78168087&amp;oldid=78168001" rel="nofollow">reverted me</a>. This I can understand, as even with the diff it probably looked like blanking. That was my fault, really.</p>
<p>But I digress: Curiosity, being both my gift and curse, made me continue. I reverted his revert, this time with an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Battle_of_Evermore&amp;diff=78168345&amp;oldid=78168087" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Battle_of_Evermore&amp;diff=78168345&amp;oldid=78168087" rel="nofollow">even worse edit summary</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../c/o/w/User%7ECowman109_5ea9.html" title="User:Cowman109">Cowman</a> blocked me. This, to me, was far too harsh. Not only had the IP I was using not received any warning for <i>over a year</i>, but he himself did not warn me. No one did.</p>

And then, before I could say another word, he protected my talk page with the reason being <i>for the time being</i>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:69.51.87.130&amp;diff=78169955&amp;oldid=78169895" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:69.51.87.130&amp;diff=78169955&amp;oldid=78169895" rel="nofollow">[119]</a></p>

<p>I'm going to post this same message on both of your talk pages, but let it be known here too:</p>
<p>Stop. Stop the bickering between you. Stop arguing on each other's talk pages. Stop arguing on other talk pages. Stop arguing in public. Just stop. The point-scoring and general nonsense that would shame two 11-year-old schoolboys is just tiresome. You can seek mediation or just avoid each other. But you're going to have to stop the bickering as someone, somewhere, is going to assume that the pair of you are trolling Wikipedia and thus will make you stop bickering in the most permanent way: without discrimination, someone will block both of you. So give it up. Now. Stop. We're done.

<dd>So you're saying if you think something is a BLP case it doesn't matter how many people tell you it isn't? Obviously we can't let just anyone go around and delete entire sections of articles simply by saying "BLP", so this is as much a consensus decision as anything else. You are no more authorized than anyone else in deciding whether BLP applies anywhere, so you should very well defer to others' opinion and refrain from reverting unless there is broad agreement with your action. I <i>am</i> sure it is solidly sourced, and I have explained it to you. You are wilfully trying to misinterpret a policy contrary to the policy's explicitly stated purpose. Clearly you <i>do</i> have an axe to grind, and it's not hard to see which, given that you describe yourself on your user page as a "wingnut", and I suppose Objectivists are the ultimate "wingnuts"... <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMargana_b7b1.html" title="User:Margana">Margana</a> 04:47, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

On the other hand, speaking of bad faith, you felt it necessary to point out my having cleaned out an 80K talk page, as if there was some requirement to keep indefinitely any months-old warning.

<p>I consider Crockspot's concerns regarding sourcing to have been rather overblown in this case (he was removing Wired and Boston Globe sources, in addition to more questionable material); however, I have now rewritten the disputed section to increase the number and usage of mainstream sources. I consider the version as it exists now to meet the sourcing requirements of BLP. However, as mentioned at <a href="../../../j/i/m/Talk%7EJimmy_Wales_e8bc.html" title="Talk:Jimmy Wales">Talk:Jimmy Wales</a>, I am somewhat concerned about the appropriateness of the "Controversy" section within the scope of <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Wales_abf5.html" title="Jimmy Wales">Jimmy Wales</a>. Even following my edits, which slightly reduced its rendered length, it is a quite substantial section describing a minor dispute in the context of a relatively short biography (why can't we find more to say about Jimbo?). As such, I am open to the idea that it should be reduced further or perhaps moved to some other more suitable venue for the content. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 07:00, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I applaud your rewrite. That is how you source negative info in a living bio, and is all I was asking for. I removed the good sources in the past, because after removal of the poor sources and statements, the section made no sense. But this complaint is not about the content of <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Wales_abf5.html" title="Jimmy Wales">Jimmy Wales</a>, it is about the behavior of <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMargana_b7b1.html" title="User:Margana">User:Margana</a>. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 12:15, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Ummmm, 3 months? How did you arrive at that? I've never dealt with Margana before, so perhaps I am missing important history, but that strikes me as very excessive. Crockspot removed a section citing BLP. Margana restored it 6 times over the course of several days (never actually crossing 3RR). Such an edit war was not a productive way to resolve the dispute, but Margana's argument that the section already was cited (Wired, Boston Globe, Newsweek) was not without merit. I'm inclined to agree with Margana that Crockspot was being overly aggressive in his application of BLP in this case. In particular, I don't agree with his argument that removing the disputed sources couldn't be accomplished with far more precision (i.e. leaving the shape of the section intact based on the more reliable sources), or that attributing Larry Sanger's views to a Meta essay he wrote was inherently unacceptable since we should never cite Wikipedia. If it wasn't for the significance we attribute to BLP, this would have been little more than a run of the mill content dispute and edit war, with a little incivility thrown in. The disputed content was never inaccurate, and the only dispute was really with regards to sourcing. BLP gives substantially greater legitimacy to Crockspot's approach than to Margana, but either party could have improved the situation by improving the text rather than edit warring. (And Crockspot, just because you aren't required to do so, doesn't make edit warring into a good approach to solve the problem. BLP patrolers should redact when necessary but also strive to improve when possible.) Had this been a first offense, I probably would have stopped at little more than a warning for Margana. Even with the long history of previous blocks, it seems excessive to me to jump to three months under this pattern of facts. Margana's actions in this case were inappropriate, but they were not exactly a terrible scourge upon Wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 19:50, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I think that even though there may be some mitigating factors in this particular blocking, the fact still exists that there seems to be no evidence that Margana will stop his disruptive activities, regardless of block length. <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanGerbil10_1003.html" title="User:RyanGerbil10">RyanG</a><font color="green">e</font><a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanGerbil10_1003.html" title="User:RyanGerbil10">rbil10</a><small><a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanGerbil10_836d.html" title="User talk:RyanGerbil10">(Упражнение В!)</a></small> 20:43, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Seems a reasonable sort of person. I'd just wonder over, say hi, and leave a message explaining the situation. He will probably be grateful you told him before he made too many edits with that account. As he self-identifies as a programmer, he might even write and run a bot one day!&#160;:-) <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 00:19, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Random query here, but if your surname was Abbot, then you wouldn't be able to use it as a username? I suggest changing the username guidelines for bots to include a preceding space, such as Tyler_bot. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 17:57, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think "Abbot" is an exception (analogous to "Yamashita"); in general we should still disallow human accounts named *bot. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small>2006-10-20 09:01Z</small></i></span>

<dd>The username should not be the criterion here: the criterion should be whether the user is actually an <a href="../../../r/e/g/Wikipedia%7ERegistered_bots_ff5c.html" title="Wikipedia:Registered bots">unregistered bot</a> that is not going through the <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_Requests_for_approvals_904a.html" title="Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approvals">proper channels for approval</a>. It's actions rather than username that count: I'd leave it it up to Tylerbot whether s/he keeps the username as s/he clearly <i>isn't</i> a bot. (I have advised Tylerbot, in the spirit of welcome and as a bot owner myself, that if s/he keeps that name s/he may need to be extra careful what s/he does.) I would, however, summarily block any Wikipedia account, <i>whatever its name</i>, which clearly actually was an unauthorised bot up to no good. I think simple bot-related-account naming guidlines such as that suggested by Hahnch and insisted on by Quarl is a solution to a non-existent problem. <span style="font-family:courier">:-)</span> --RobertG ♬ <a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobertG_9f35.html" title="User talk:RobertG">talk</a> 10:08, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Most English speakers would parse Abbot as a single name, and Tylerbot as a compound of Tyler and bot. Having said that, I agree with what RobertG has said, though this depends on whether people tend to distinguish bots based on the flag (used to filter RC and similar edit histories), or whether people want to be able to <i>visually</i> distinguish bots when looking at user names. If the latter is wanted, then '-bot' names still need to be discouraged. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 10:15, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Sir,I read ur message on Admin-notice board.here are the proofs of Sarvagnya's misbehaviour. --- Hello, First things first.When i joined wikipedia I was not aware of wiki policies and hence I was 'bold' and 'emotiona' when dealing with my edits.It is only after Aksi_great and Sunder adviced to me as being 'citation-savvy'.I agree that I was rude and incivil at times but frankly of admins would take care of <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> and interfere into the feuds early i would not need to resort to incivil behaviour.I am pleading admins to watch <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgaum_border_dispute.html" title="Belgaum border dispute">belgaum_border_dispute</a> but in vain.My biggest concern is kannada POV pushing there.[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Belgaum&amp;diff=72356098&amp;oldid=72352558" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Belgaum&amp;diff=72356098&amp;oldid=72352558" rel="nofollow">PLEASE SEE THIS BLATANT POV PUSHING of sarvagnya</a>].If any admin promises to take care of this anti-Maharashtra stand I think I will not bother anyone.In fact if anyone wants I would delete my a/c here.I am concerned about misinterpretation of Maharashtra's stand on Belgaon issue which is very emotional issue for all Maharashtrians. I have also stopped taking all this things personally and would request sarvagnya the same.They are busy on Kill-Mahawiki mission.</p>

<p>I just cannot believe how much a person can lie. Sarvagnya writes mahawiki was blocked for incivility in Belgaon. It is an outright LIE&#160;!!!! Mahawiki was blocked for dispute in the <a href="../../../r/a/s/Rashtrakuta.html" title="Rashtrakuta">Rashtrakuta</a> page which was Kannadized and POVed by Dinesh Kannambadi. While the Belgaon issue ended with the pulling up of Sarvagnya by admins. I dont want to get into a brawl with Sarvagnya simply because it is a wastage of time and resources. I have always advised mahawiki to keep away from these kind of troublemakers. As far as warnings are concerned, Sarvagnya gave two bogus warnings to me - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Arya_Rajya_Maharashtra&amp;diff=75043015&amp;oldid=75041229" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Arya_Rajya_Maharashtra&amp;diff=75043015&amp;oldid=75041229" rel="nofollow">this</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Arya_Rajya_Maharashtra&amp;diff=82248047&amp;oldid=81952696" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Arya_Rajya_Maharashtra&amp;diff=82248047&amp;oldid=81952696" rel="nofollow">this</a>. Apart from that Sarvagnya has a penchant for pushing his POV in every other article. And when asked for citations, he and his pals provide the Kamat's book (which is total unabashed Kannada glory) as citation. Most other misdeeds of this particular user have been provided by Mahawiki. -<span class="plainlinks" style="border: 2px solid #0001DC; padding: 1px;"><b><a href="../../../a/r/y/User%7EArya_Rajya_Maharashtra_6561.html" title="User:Arya Rajya Maharashtra"><font color="green">Arya</font></a></b></span><a href="../../../a/r/y/User_talk%7EArya_Rajya_Maharashtra_43c8.html" title="User talk:Arya Rajya Maharashtra"><b><font style="verdana" color="BROWN">Raj</font><font color="Magenta">ya</font></b></a><b><a href="../../../m/a/h/Maharashtra.html" title="Maharashtra"><font color="#FF5900">महाराष्ट्र</font></a></b> 12:40, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I had decided not to reply sarvagnya's badmouthing unless asked by a admin.But just to make a point clear,I was pointing out Dinesh's edits to signify -He uses Kamath's books which <b>MANY</b> editors including me and Arya think unreliable and biased and needs to be verified and how he trashes the sources which are not suitable to his POV.I request admins to take note of this and do the needful.In addition to that please ask Sarvagnya to stop his personal attacks at once!In fact he is using the word 'shameful' here itself!I dont know why he is so wary of me.He seems to vowed to bowl me out of wikipedia.</dd>

<li>If the above editors are just using WP as a chat room, warn them a few times or just block them. As for the COPPA issue, if there is personal information that can easily identify a person under 13, just delete it. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">User:Zscout370</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Return Fire)</a></sup></small> 13:32, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I agree with Mgm about young people (self-identified or not) doing good work round here. It would be easy to be overzealous about this. Warnings have to come before blocks. Just remove personally identifying material for children when you see it and request oversight (though whether the amount of it would overwhelm those with oversight privileges is something to consider - and don't file requests in public, that leaves a paper trail for the wrong sort of people to follow back - use e-mail - in fact, this should all be explained somewhere that we can just link to, instead of having public discussions pointing the wrong sort of people where we don't want them to go). And explain things to the child (without being condescending). They (like any new user) will take time to learn how things work around here. If they don't show signs of changing their behaviour, or contributing, then block them. Don't be too slow if they are constantly chatting and revealing things about themselves, but equally don't be too hasty either. That would be my view. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 10:56, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

Additionally basic <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civility</a> has a part to play, rolling back in edit disputes using automated tools is pretty uncivil.

<ul>
<li>Agreed, that WP is not an expt in rule making. I am not pushing to make any rules myself. Clearly here was a case where I was ignorant of an esoteric 'practice' on WP. So the admin should have atleast enlightened me first. Also, I was not reverting any article page. I was reverting my own user talk page to remove frivolous warnings given to me by people whose records are there for everyone to see(Read the "User:Mahawiki and his incivility" section above on this very page).</li>
<li>First of all, it is not even clear to me yet, why I was blocked. The blocking message from the admin says, I was blocked for fighting with Mahawiki. And I was fighting(revert warring) with Mahawiki and Arya because of their frivolous warnings to me about my supposed abuse/misuse of popups. And this warring was on my own user talk page not on any article page.</li>
<li>And Blnguyen's block on me closely followed Arya's filing of 3RR vio(on my own user page) on the 3RR vio noticeboard.</li>
<li>I asked for clarifications for all this in my "unblock me" template, but got no answers.</li>

<li>I didnt infer that the use of popups <i>alone</i> was the reason for me getting blocked. Because Bl made a mention of popups <i>also</i> in his message, I thought that it may have had something to do with my blocking.</li>
<li>More importantly, if you notice my talk page history just before I got blocked, you will see that there was a revert war going on between me and Arya/Mahawiki. Both of them were accusing me of removing 'official' warnings Arya had placed on my talk page. And <i>that</i> official warning pertained to my supposed <i>abuse/misuse of popups</i>. Note that, neither Arya/Mahawiki nor Bl make <i>any mention</i> of <b>where</b>(on which article or talk page) my supposed <i>misuse/abuse</i> of popups took place.</li>
<li>And further, Arya went and filed a 3RR violation against me. Just as I was about to comment there that 3RR violation rule does not apply to your own talk page(correct me if I am wrong), I got blocked by Bl.</li>
<li>So <i>you</i> tell me what I have to infer.</li>
<li>First of all, Arya's filing of 3RR against me itself was against WP policy. Even if it was not, none of his warnings even pointed out where my supposed violations had taken place except that they kept insisting that I was <i>abusing/misusing</i> popups. On top of it, Bl blocked me based on a complaint that shouldnt even have been considered in the first place(due to above reasons). Correct me if I am wrong. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 20:45, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I will attempt to point you to where you went wrong (IMO). You have been fighting with Mahawiki for quite a lot of time now. You complained to 14-15 Indian admins to get Mahawiki blocked and that didn't result in anything. Now both of you get blocked and you still lay the blame on Mahawiki and others without for once accepting the fact that you too were in the wrong. You agree that you were into a "revert warring session" and you got blocked for that (along with mahawiki). Blnguyen mentioned popups also in his message to inform you about where popups should not be used. Blnguyen didn't block you based on any 3RR complaint. He blocked you because of edit warring. - <a href="../../../a/k/s/User%7EAksi_great_bb76.html" title="User:Aksi great">Aksi_great</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/s/User_talk%7EAksi_great_f9ab.html" title="User talk:Aksi great">talk</a>) 20:56, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Where have I ever denied that I was also in the wrong? If you see the message I had posted to 14-15 admins, I believe I have made a mention of my incivility too.</li>
<li>The point is, while mine and Dineshkannambadi's incivility stopped soon after Bl intervened the first time, Mahawiki's has continued unabated till this day. No wonder if you see, his defence above, he still keeps harping about our incivility on the Belgaum talk page or Dinesh's run in with some X, Y or Z <i>totally disconnected</i> from our disputes.</li>
<li>Belgaum talk page was something where <b>everyone <i>involved was uncivil. And</i></b> <i>all of us'</i> got pulled up for that by Blnuyen. I am talking about incivility <b>after that</b> infact <b>after Mahawiki was blocked the first time</b>. After that point, I have always been civil except for maybe a couple of instances that happened in the heat of the moment. But in Mahawiki's case, incivility has become routine. And the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Saare_Jahan_Se_Achcha&amp;diff=82253819&amp;oldid=82246845" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Saare_Jahan_Se_Achcha&amp;diff=82253819&amp;oldid=82246845" rel="nofollow">most recent case</a> is on the Sare Jahan Se Achcha talk page. It happened yesterday.</li>
<li>Also please note that it is true that none of the 14-15 admins I had complained to took any action on Mahawiki. But the reason for that is not because they examined my complaint and found it lacking in substance, but because <b>none of them even ventured to investigate my complaint</b>. Most of them pleaded being busy or being on wikibreaks etc., while some didnt even respond. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 21:08, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi, I haven't treaded this path before. So I have some doubts and didn't know where to go with it. Hopefully some admin here can clarify it for me. I also hope that no admin sees this as an affront to admins in general or any admin in particular.</p>
<p>a) Is there any rule or policy on WP which condones(in any situation) the use of a harsh tone which borders on incivility on ordinary users by admins?</p>
<p>b) Also can an ordinary user like me make use of the {{npa}} on an admin in such cases.</p>
<p>c) Where do I go to complain against an admin if I feel that the admin has been abusing his powers to browbeat me into submission. <i><b>Especially when the admin in question seems least interested in solving or even lending an ear to any disputes or issues the 'ordinary' user may be having.</b></i></p>
<p>d) I have heard a lot about <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">WP:DR</a>. But, is there any place where 'informal' complaints can be lodged against admins. IMHO, every dispute on WP need not have to go through <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">WP:DR</a>. There should be some way for 'respectable' editors or admins to very quickly take a <i>prima facie</i> look at the issue and comment. And if <i>prima facie</i> the 'respectable' editor finds that the admin has indeed overstepped his brief, that editor or even the wronged editor should be given the liberty to <i>politely</i> warn the admin who has erred. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 19:38, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>An admin may (and in some cases should) respond sternly to some forms of abuses. There is a difference between taking a stern/harsh tone and resorting to personal attacks, like namecalling. To say whether a line was crossed will generally require looking at the details of the specific case. You are free to complain about personal attacks or unfair treatment. Using templates like {{<a href="../../../n/p/a/Template%7ENpa_f59d.html" title="Template:Npa">npa</a>}} are generally discouraged against any established user, in preference for a more specific and personalized message. <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDispute_resolution_d69e.html" title="Wikipedia:Dispute resolution">Wikipedia:Dispute resolution</a> gives advice and options for dealing with conflicts.

<li>See, here was a case where I got blocked and unfairly <i>in my opinion</i>. Then, no admin even responded to my "unblock me" template. I was thus <i>forced to</i> 'serve time'. At this point, I certainly had good reason to be feeling dejected and cheated. To add salt to injury, an admin now enters the scene, <i>after my block has expired</i> and I have myself noticed it and started editing again and leaves me a message in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sarvagnya&amp;diff=82071028&amp;oldid=82014265" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sarvagnya&amp;diff=82071028&amp;oldid=82014265" rel="nofollow">edit summary</a>.</li>
<li>The edit summary reads, <i>"Block has expired, but for crying out loud, stop the d*mn bickering or you *will*be blocked again. The pair fo you."</i> - I think I can safely consider an edit summary like that as uncivil and borders on a threat a headmaster would make to primary school children. More so, when it comes from an admin, who (a)didnt bother to respond to my "unblock me" template and was <i>crying out loud</i>(in his words) (b)who doesnt know head or tail of what exactly my dispute with <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">User:Mahawiki</a> is about, but doesnt think twice before calling it <i>bickering</i> and (c)who is <i>even now</i> unwilling to even give me a chance to explain myself but makes a veiled threat that he will get me permanently blocked if I even so much as dare <i>talk to him</i>. To tell the truth, I <b>am</b> indeed <i>scared</i> to approach that admin now or in future for <i>anything</i>.(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sarvagnya&amp;diff=82274461&amp;oldid=82252551" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sarvagnya&amp;diff=82274461&amp;oldid=82252551" rel="nofollow">[130]</a>,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Redvers&amp;diff=82281107&amp;oldid=82272556" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Redvers&amp;diff=82281107&amp;oldid=82272556" rel="nofollow">[131]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Redvers&amp;diff=82281601&amp;oldid=82281237" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Redvers&amp;diff=82281601&amp;oldid=82281237" rel="nofollow">[132]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sarvagnya&amp;diff=82283567&amp;oldid=82283007" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sarvagnya&amp;diff=82283567&amp;oldid=82283007" rel="nofollow">[133]</a>) <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 20:29, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm sorry it upset you so much. I would reccomend one of two courses of action. The first would be to contact the admin directly and explain how you found that statement to be offensive, as nicely as you can. (Instead of saying "That was uncivil" try "I was offended by that because....") For some reason coming right out and saying "that was uncivil" has a way of escalating conflict. If for some reason the first option is difficult, please consider requesting an <a href="../../../a/m/a/WP%7EAMA_ced1.html" title="WP:AMA">advocate</a>. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmedblowfish_0e51.html" title="User:Armedblowfish">Armedblowfish</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/m/User_talk%7EArmedblowfish_5587.html" title="User talk:Armedblowfish">talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Armedblowfish_d1c9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Armedblowfish">mail</a>) 01:46, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi, I've been canvassing some support recently, as some of you may have seen, for a program/project to harmonise all of the user page templates and warnings. I'm looking for an admin, not necessarily to carry out much work, but who will be able to point me in the right direction, on certain issues. I'm willing to do all the leg work, but could just do with someone <i>sitting on my shoulder</i> to achieve this goal. If you're interested, or would like to know more please see <a href="../../../k/h/u/User%7EKhukri_templates_88ca.html" title="User:Khukri/templates">here</a> .Have a glance through all the different types of warnings and if you have any ideas please list them.

<p>I wanted to get a broader view of our now more limited Fair Use guidelines. Spearheaded by Jimbo, Wikipedia's fair use guidelines now allow the deletion of media content if a reasonable free alternative can be found. Now, whereas I support this for things such as public artwork, buildings and monuments which we could easily find, users have been tagging images which would be incredibly difficult to produce alternatives for. For example, see the discussion at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Fair_use_ece5.html#Replaceable_fair_use" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Fair use">Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Fair_use#Replaceable_fair_use</a> regarding Image:Africanmourningdove631.jpg. There are also many images tagged at <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_problems_2006_October_13_Images_a00a.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright problems/2006 October 13/Images">Wikipedia:Copyright problems/2006 October 13/Images</a> which I believe sufficiently satisfy both legal fair use requirements and Wikipedia requirements for fair use. Take a look at Image:Wärtsilä-Sulzer RTA96-C.jpg for example, how reasonable is it for Wikipedia to generate a free use alternative of the world's largest ship engine or an engine cutaway such as Image:PSA-Ford diesel V6.jpg.</p>
<p>The thing that I find most worrying is that such a move has largely been spearheaded by a small group of Wikipedian's who work with images. When Jimbo first mentioned his views on promotional photos being used on Wikipedia, he acknowledged that his views on fair use in general tended towards the extreme range of the spectrum, of course, he's now picked up more supporters. But does the general Wikipedian really believe that such a strong stand against fair use is of benefit to an encyclopedia? I'd like for more people to take part in some of the image discussions linked above. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 18:27, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Totally OTT in my opinion. Good luck fighting it, though, you'll probably be told to go start your own wiki (as I was). To hell with creating a good quality, illustrated enyclopedia right?

<dd>I'm confused by this comment. Claiming "fair use" on other people's work instead of creating our own content would seem to be the much more activist anti-copyright position. Would you be as enthusiastic about what we're doing here if we were just cutting and pasting swaths of text from professionals because we believe we can't do as good a job ourselves, while claiming "fair use"? I certainly wouldn't. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 19:53, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>JKelly, your example doesn't apply here and you must know it. People are obviously still enthusiastic about the project knowing that we include splashings of fair use images. The reason we allow fair use images at all shows us this. I mean an image like Image:Wärtsilä-Sulzer RTA96-C.jpg, it was published as a promotional image for the subject by its manufacturer, it falls under legal fair use. How generating a free use example of this can be considered <i>reasonable</i>, I'm not too sure. I spoke to <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadell_cd19.html" title="User:Quadell">User:Quadell</a> about this, and he believes that reasonable means impossible, something I disagree with. I personally put <a href="../../../e/n/c/WP%7EENC_e8ee.html" title="WP:ENC">WP:ENC</a> over the GFDL crusaders and I think that the tagging of some of these images is unreasonable, and their deletion a detriment to Wikipedia's usefulness and quality. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 01:00, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, that's pretty much it, thanks for being more eloquent than me&#160;:) I'm thinking of promotional shots released with the express intention of them being used in the media but not released under GFDL, the use of album sleeves in discographies, and so on. I think these things add to the quality of the encyclopedia and that the average user is more interested in quality than free content. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 13:44, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Indeed, and then the question of expectation of privacy and conditions of publication would get involved. Please do not try to emphasize a fringe case of a clear violation to try to frighten everyone and prevent their working on the project.

<dd>Oh, and lawyers may wish to emphasize that people, rather than they, are responsible for what people <b>add,</b> but mistakenly undoing a change that was destructive and outside of established procedures for the removal of libel is neither adding nor the absence of a policy for protecting against libel. That's a far, far cry from telling people not to restore blanked articles, as blanking is not the way bad content of any form is dealt with on Wikipedia. We have a process for eliminating malicious editng, two processes, in fact. Removing the <i>entirety</i> of an article to get rid of a portion of an article is destructive, is vandalism, and is not, in fact, the removal of libel: it is the attempted erasure of an entire work of art. Are the people blanking going to be financially and legally responsible for what they've done in blanking the good contributions that surrounded the <i>alledgedly</i> libellous sections? The standard you are proposing is impractical and unlikely to be law. This is in addition to the fact that no, courts cannot tell exactly who added a thing. A court can determine an IP which locates a machine, but not the fingers at the machine, as any of us who have dealt with vandals and sockpuppeteers knows. All of which is not to absolve editors, but the attempted chill in this case is, in my view, mistaken. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:21, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Unexplained blanking of articles is unacceptable regardless of the cause. It's listed on <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANDAL_b36a.html" title="WP:VANDAL">WP:VANDAL</a> as an archetypical form of vandalism and even if a human did not revert it a bot would probably catch the change. If this happens is the <i>bot</i> now legally responsible for libelling an individual?<br />
Perhaps a better solution would be to make a prompt come up (similar to that you can turn on to prompt for blank edit summaries) any time a user makes an edit which would leave a page blank. It could briefly explain that <a href="../../../b/l/a/WP%7EBLANK_0096.html" title="WP:BLANK">page blanking</a> <b>does not</b> erase the page in question, is going to be considered vandalism, and suggesting that if they believe the page should not exist, they should use the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_process_57c8.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion process">Wikipedia:Deletion process</a> or discuss with other editors on the talk page. Since the good-faith blanking of articles is almost certainly caused by the misconception that blanking will delete the page, this could probably halt all or nearly all instances of good-faith blanking, and would even make page blanking slightly more obnoxious for vandals. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> <small><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_tjstrf_12ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/tjstrf">Now on editor review!</a></small> 16:38, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Probably not. If the libel was introduced with the obscenities, then you'd have just reverted that also. If the libel was already there, then you weren't the one to introduce it. Where you'd get into trouble is if libel was already in the article and was removed via page-blank. If you revert, then you are introducing the libel back into the article.

<dd>(edit conflict, Re:Kbdank)It was technically "removed" by the replacement of the article with obscenities as well. It would similarly be "removed" by replacement with other libel, or a copyvio, or a personal attack against another editor, or a "Cool, I can edit this!", or the goatse image, or, as happened to the <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Hamilton_3fe5.html" title="Alexander Hamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a> page, by the copy-pasting of the <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brock_%28Pokemon%29_1ade.html" title="Brock (Pokemon)">Brock (Pokemon)</a> article over the page's initial content.<br />
This situation concerns me deeply as any vandalistic action, no matter how obvious, which had the effect of removing the libel (even if it replaced it with something far, far worse) would by the same token as blanking be unrevertable without review.<br />
In effect, this forbids the swift removal of <i>simple</i> vandalism from BLP articles out of fear that <i>complex</i> vandalism may still be present. This argument may seem like <a href="../../../r/e/d/Reductio_ad_absurdum.html" title="Reductio ad absurdum">reductio ad absurdum</a>, but I have seen every above-mentioned instance of vandalism take place at some point, several of them to BLP pages. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> <small><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_tjstrf_12ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/tjstrf">Now on editor review!</a></small> 18:52, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Indeed. I understand how an editor who willingly reintroduces libel <i>after it has been identified</i> should be held liable, but I cannot fathom why an editor who is cleaning up simple vandalism is legally committing a crime. Perhaps what we need to do is to be less confrontational in the blanking warnings (or use {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest0_e386.html" title="Template:Test0">test0</a>}} more) to explain to those who see incorrect information how to tell us that it is indeed incorrect, and is not a random kid in school blanking articles wholesale. Otherwise, the effect is what Tjstrf indicates: the editing environment for good faith editors becomes poisoned by legal issues, and that's exactly why we have <a href="../../../n/l/t/WP%7ENLT_0807.html" title="WP:NLT">WP:NLT</a>. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">xd</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a>)</sup> 19:08, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>Libel laws internationally differ as to culpability vs intention, but I'd say you run a risk when unintentionally reverting a change back to libel on a BLP article. From a likelihood-of-trouble point of view, it's vanishingly small, but it is a risk.</p>
<p>However, from a Wikipedia point of view, there's a bigger point than just libel. We are clearly approaching some sort of critical mass. Journalists are using us as a primary source whilst disparaging us on feature pages. So we've clearly arrived in the firmament for the media in general.</p>
<p>That means that minor-famous people are now start "Wikipeding" for their articles, just as a year or so ago they started Googling for their own names. The truly famous don't, but the minor-famous do.</p>
<p>So, when reverting a BLP article, I think we do now need to be careful. We've reach a stage - one we've always aspired to - of being thought of as a journal of record. That's great, in so many ways, but it requires us to be more careful.</p>
<p>We might not have reached it yet, but the day is only months away where we get some serious trouble for our vandalism or our reverting. The first we can cope with, although it will be expensive to do so and will open the floodgates.</p>
<p>The second is harder to justify. The time is coming where we will switch from reverting vandalism on BLP articles to automatically stubbing them and letting them be reviewed at leisure. In the meantime, the days of blindly reverting vandalism are coming to an end, so anyone who visits the contribs of a vandal and just hits <i>rollback</i> for each contribution will soon have to think twice.</p>
<p>And we'll need to review our procedures and processes in light of all of this. Not now, per se, but soon enough. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedvers_29e5.html" title="User talk:Redvers">➨</a> <b><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_ab65.html" title="User:Redvers"><font color="red">ЯEDVERS</font></a></b> 19:18, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't know if anyone has mentioned it (yet), but it's case law in the 9th (US) Circuit that reposting Internet libel elsewhere on the Internet is not, in itself, libel. See, for example, <b>Barrett v. Rosenthal</b> in <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Barrett_fdb7.html#Libel_suits_filed_by_Barrett" title="Stephen Barrett">Stephen Barrett#Libel suits filed by Barrett</a>.) It may be <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dicta.html" title="Dicta">dicta</a>, as it wasn't required to reach the conclusion dismissing the case, but it is still <a href="../../../c/a/s/Case_law.html" title="Case law">case law</a>. In the case in question, Rosenthenal reposted alleged libel on a <a href="../../../u/s/e/Usenet.html" title="Usenet">Usenet</a> newsgroup. If I interpret the court documents correctly, the trial court ruled that Rosenthal could not be found guilty of libel, because of the <a href="../../../d/m/c/DMCA_bb76.html" title="DMCA">DMCA</a>. The appeals court found that the material was not libelous (being an opinion), and explictly declined comment on the repost ruling. In this case, it would imply that only the editor who originally inserted the libelous material could be found liable. — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 20:54, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>The bits I'm still not clear about from this discussion is how <a href="../../../n/l/t/WP%7ENLT_0807.html" title="WP:NLT">WP:NLT</a> applies to the increasing presence of external legal threats constraining the editing environment. I realise that <a href="../../../n/l/t/WP%7ENLT_0807.html" title="WP:NLT">WP:NLT</a> applies to users making threats on-wiki, but the point made about editors feeling constrained by uncertain legal issues is a good one that needs to be resolved with a clear demarcation of responsibilities, plus legal advice (or, rather, advice on when to seek legal advice) for <i>editors</i> who want legal advice, and not only legal advice for the Foundation. Also, I see people focussing on Biography of Living People (BLP) stuff, but the point was made that libellous edits can be made to non-BLP articles (eg. adding something about a living person to <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moon.html" title="Moon">Moon</a>, which a new editor might be even more likely to blank, as that would be an obviously vandalised article). Thus the focus on BLP articles for the "should I revert page blanking" issue, is somewhat misleading - this issue applies to <i>all</i> articles. Finally, I often jump into an article to correct a spelling mistake or rewrite a single paragraph. I am aware that I should read the whole article, and copyedit the whole thing, rather than make one tiny change, but this is an example of the same sort of thing: small, incremental edits, eventually adding up to a reasonable article, but where editors often don't read the whole article. Maybe the "stable articles" feature is also relevant here. Marking a version as stable (implying you have read the whole thing), when it contains libel, is, to my mind, potentially exposing an editor far more to legal action than reverting a page blank of a non-stabilised article. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 01:34, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If an article contains something that leads to a lawsuit, either the Wikimedia Foundation is liable or it's not. For all of our sakes, it's far better that the answer is <b>not</b> - if the Foundation is liable, the entire project could shut down. Or, only slightly better, a lot of money that could go to servers or bandwidth could go to lawyers to defend the Foundation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If some editors cease editing because they worry about personal liability, that's not good, but it's not the end of the world. And, arguably, there really should be few good people who leave - as someone noted above, <i>From a likelihood-of-trouble point of view, it's vanishingly small</i> that someone who lacked intent (and reverting a blank page, with no indication that the blanking was done for good reason, clearly is a case of no intent to commit libel) will successfully be sued. Folks like the EFF and the ACLU are presumbably around to help, if necessary. Which isn't to say that lawyers might not go after the editor who originally <i>posted</i> the libel - but that's not the concern above, of course. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Broughton_26e4.html" title="User talk:John Broughton">Talk</a> 02:19, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>law.duke.edu says "Many corporate plaintiffs that sue for Internet libel seek to send a message to the public that they will pursue aggressively anyone who criticizes them online, and these plaintiffs seem to be using libel law to squelch not just defamatory falsehoods but legitimate criticism as well.

<dd>The Federal law in question simply requires that ISP not delete or destroy any <i>pre-existing</i> records they may have in their possession <i>if</i> requested by the Feds that they preserve it. If they don't have the pre-existing records in the first place, the Feds are out of luck. It is not uncommon for preservation requests from the Feds (and from state and local law enforcement, to say nothing of civil litigants) to ask for everything under the freakin' sun to be preserved, such as transcripts from AIM and IRC chat sessions, IP transaction logs, emails received, emails sent, files uploaded, files downloaded, and so on and so forth. If the ISP does not keep this data in the course of its normal business operations (and believe me, most don't), the ISP is not obligated in any way to suddenly start keeping them in order to comply with the preservation request. They can forthrightly tell the Feds "We don't keep those records," and the Feds will go about their merry way. --<a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtreme_Unction_1dfd.html" title="User:Extreme Unction"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000"><b><i>Ξxtreme</i></b></font> <font color="#006688" face="arial, helvetica">Unction</font></a> 04:28, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

He has expressed his willingness to renege on his own promise to the community on his RfA <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Samir_%28The_Scope%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=82182845" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Samir_%28The_Scope%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=82182845" rel="nofollow">[141]</a>. Cronyism is at show on this section of his talk page. Three of the Indian administrators argue for him with unconcern for his personal attack, ignorance of rules, and willingness to break them. When I reported his personal attack on <a href="../../../p/a/i/WP%7EPAIN_2701.html" title="WP:PAIN">WP:PAIN</a> it was removed citing no warning (in edit summary) [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Personal_attack_intervention_noticeboard&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=82148995" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Personal_attack_intervention_noticeboard&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=82148995" rel="nofollow">[142]</a>] and it was explained to me thus <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Shell_Kinney#Warn_an_admin_on_personal_attack.3F" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Shell_Kinney#Warn_an_admin_on_personal_attack.3F" rel="nofollow">[143]</a> When I put a warning template on his talk page one of his friends removed it because he thought it was ugly. I placed a message on Jimbo Wales' talk page merely inviting his attention but it was removed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jimbo_Wales&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=82344314" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jimbo_Wales&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=82344314" rel="nofollow">[144]</a>.

<dd>I have somewhat of a problem taking this fellow seriously. Personally, if I had a username which had an obscene meaning I wouldn't expect people to take me seriously either and would be surprised if they didn't block me.

<li>18:15, 17 October 2006 (UTC) - <b>Kundan After Sundown</b> in Samir's talk page says <i>Hey user, your out-of-place remark <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Deepujoseph" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Deepujoseph" rel="nofollow">[150]</a> is in poor taste and in bad faith. Do you know Malayalam and the meaning of the word to guess that it is obscene? Or did you rely on the opinion of two users who looked at once credit-worthy because they cried foul on somebody's user name? If that is the case, you are relying on somebody who in turn relies on ignorance ("I didn't know the other meanings for it"). I can let you know that the two users concerned have plainly refused to look up the word in a local language dictionary and never denied the fact that it is a proper name among the <a href="../../../s/c/h/Scheduled_caste.html" title="Scheduled caste">scheduled castes</a> of Kerala. Ignorance, lack of receptiveness, élitism and disdain for the peripheral lives- you have been party to them. And one user who googled the word in question and found that it meant a very loose cunt in some Icelandic language epitomises the wisdom of your ilk.</i></li>

If Samir had admitted that, it would have been the end. He chose to ridicule me instead of answering my questions. The other admins were trying to justify Samir "somehow". Samir does not admit that he is violating any guideline( not even bending) but another admin justifies his action quoting <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> , without looking at <a href="../../../s/i/r/WP%7ESIR_b56d.html" title="WP:SIR">WP:SIR</a>.

<dd>Going through the history, this was/is obviously a troublesome user and some block was appropriate. However, when blocking for "legal threats," it seems to me that a link to the <a href="../../../l/e/g/WP%7ELEGAL_8608.html" title="WP:LEGAL">WP:LEGAL</a> policy should be provided, along with advice that the user can request to be unblocked if he or she clearly <i>withdraws</i> the legal threats, which after all is the main thing we want to happen (I have seen this succeed more than once). Information on how to contact the <a href="../../../o/f/f/WP%7EOFFICE_66ac.html" title="WP:OFFICE">WP:OFFICE</a> can also be provided, to give the user a vehicle for raising any <i>bona fide</i> legal issue that he or she might think to exist, as opposed to just saying, in effect, "you have no rights, go away" which in the long term may just aggravate the discontent that resulted in the threats being made in the first place. In this case, the user may not be likely to ever become a productive editor anyway, but I think the blocking admin might still want to consider these ideas for the future. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 13:18, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I appreciate these can be tough calls. Certainly urging the user to withdraw the threat is something we agree upon. It's more a case-by-case judgment whether, once the threat aspect is removed, there is a genuine issue to be addressed or not and how best to counsel the user to address it, or whether just to ignore it. In other words, whether tactically turning the person to the right instead of the wrong methods will help avoid long-term legal issues no one wants, bearing in mind that 99±% of legal etc. threats go nowhere. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 17:31, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This address is my school's IP address. It has a long history of blocks due to various idiots vandalizing. I'd like to request a "hard block" (in opposition to a "soft block"?) to prevent users registering from that IP address. A couple of other students in my class thought it would be fun to vandalize the project; when they thought someone was "on to them" they registered new accounts. These users were User:Headmaster2008, User:ImaSpamThis and User:David2001. Altogether, "they" vandalized the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane_Boys%27_College_6476.html" title="Brisbane Boys' College">Brisbane Boys' College</a> page repeatedly, posting my personal info on there (I occasionally do RC patrol via the school PC's, thus they found it amusing to do so). Can someone please help with this? Also - if such a block were done, would it prevent me from logging in and doing RC patrol via that IP?

<dd>I'm NOT an admin, but IMO although it's nominally 'on topic', it's not a discussion about how to improve the article, and while <i>I</i> probably wouldn't delete it, I think there are grounds to do so, or perhaps to move the post to a sub-page with a note on the talk page asking the author to re-work it as a suggestion for improvement. <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnchoress_3b7f.html" title="User:Anchoress">Anchoress</a> 05:17, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>For me, it would depend on context and the level of disruptiveness. If it was from a repeatedly problematic editor, a personal attack, on a widely trolled page (e.g. one where it threatened to begin a flame war), or filled with obscenities, I would remove it. In most other cases, especially a really new editor, I would leave the thread with a reply such as "This is not the place to elaborate your personal opinions.", and maybe give the user a civil note about posting rants on their talk page. This is because many people mistake honestly talk pages for forums, and simpy reverting their comments (especially without explanation) will often cause more disruption than leaving it. Of course, a similar rant on a BLP page would warrant a swift removal. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> <small><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_tjstrf_12ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/tjstrf">Now on editor review!</a></small> 07:07, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I've removed it. It was just a rant, as was obvious from the multiple exclamation marks, the numerous reminders that the writer was laughing out loud, and most obviously the assertion that it wasn't a rant. It didn't offend me at all; it didn't even sadden me, as I was already very aware of the popularity of this stance. It might offend others, I don't know.

<dd>Wikipedia is not a venue for negotiating ultimate truth. The use of article talk pages to assert or denounce some Eternal Truth is utterly inappropriate. A little banter is ignorable. A jeremiad isn't. There are people who live to find articles on subjects they hate so that they can symbolically enact their frustration. Their problems are not ours.

<dd>I reviewed the information presented and Jayjg is correct. What you listed as the first revert is not really a revert. Nor is it an attempt to circumvent 3RR, which is the only circumstance here where I'd count it as a revert. This was the first edit, not the last.

<p>My username is <a href="../../../l/i/l/User%7ELil_crazy_thing_d28e.html" title="User:Lil crazy thing">user:lil_crazy_thing</a> i wanted to leave a message here because i know otherwise it will not get looked at. and i know i'm not ment to do this but there no other choice. i have very unfairly been yet again blocked by Yamla. He his always singling me out and applying rules to me and not others on wrestling images. He is forever basically harassign me and stalking me on wikipedia and i'm getting very sick of it, i never had any priblems at all on wikipedia until yamla started on me and ever since then he will not leave me alone and will find fault with anything if he gets the chance to he will also block me. I'm always being unfairly treated by him and all i want is for him to just leave me alone for once which he will not do. I add an unblock request but he said no and i think that very bias to have the blocking admin review it cos everyone will know that a blocking admin will not undo his own block. Please can someone please review it and if they want me to i can prove proof for every statement i've made if need be.<a href="../../../8/0/2E/User%7E80.47.161.10.html" title="User:80.47.161.10">80.47.161.10</a> 16:02, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This user knows that it is not stalking to continue warning a user for repeated violation of policies (see <a href="../../../s/t/a/WP%7ESTALK_e55b.html" title="WP:STALK">WP:STALK</a>). Additionally, the claim that I am applying rules to images uploaded by this user but to no other wrestling images is a blatant lie and this user is well aware of that (even apart from the rather strange claim that only wrestling images are relevant). I have provided examples of other wrestling images which I have similarly marked as inappropriate under Wikipedia policies. I welcome other admins reviewing this particular block, but in the interests of maintaining civility, I am taking a 24 hour break from responding to this user's accusations on her talk page. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 16:22, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Would I be correct in stating that the origin of your dispute is some removed material that <a href="../../../h/o/s/User%7EHossein.ir_5f79.html" title="User:Hossein.ir">Hossein.ir</a> considered to be <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">libel</a>, but you considered the removal of the material to be <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVAND_6593.html" title="WP:VAND">vandalism</a>?

<dd>Hossein.ir seems to be disputing it, which would probably make it a content dispute rather than vandalism, albeit a rather escalated content dispute. <a href="../../../m/_/_/WP%7EM_4ddf.html#Why_should_mediation_be_confidential.3F" title="WP:M">Private mediation</a> is generally good when disputes get hot. Alternatively, you could try <a href="../../../r/e/f/WP%7EREFACTOR_6166.html" title="WP:REFACTOR">refactoring</a>, although that generally works better when a person refactors their own comments, or when a neutral third party refactors them, given the controversial nature of refactoring. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmedblowfish_0e51.html" title="User:Armedblowfish">Armedblowfish</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/m/User_talk%7EArmedblowfish_5587.html" title="User talk:Armedblowfish">talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Armedblowfish_d1c9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Armedblowfish">mail</a>) 18:07, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I believe <a href="../../../h/o/s/User%7EHossein.ir_5f79.html" title="User:Hossein.ir">Hossein.ir</a> is using this as a bad-faith effort to whitewash the sourced and cited material. However, as he brought (what appears to be a bad-faith) nomination of 3RR against me (which was shot down by two other admins, AND in which he was warned for incivility and baitinig) I do not want to be the one to levy sanctions as I feel sysops must hold themselves to very high standards. If anyone can show me why this would be considered libel <b>according to wikipedia</b>, I'd be grateful. Otherwise, I am afraid he is merely trolling. -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 18:12, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would think that CheckUser might work, except that it does not help find sockpuppets of users who use open proxies because it matches socks and their masters based on IP address. Therefore, it can be used to find the open proxies used by known sockpuppets and other accounts, or it can be used to find the sockpuppets of a user that does not use open proxies. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesse_Viviano_b409.html" title="User:Jesse Viviano">Jesse Viviano</a> 23:58, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>With this innocuous edit summary, a bot is wiping all comments (mostly vandalism warnings) from AOL user talk pages. These aren't all old comments; they're recent. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:205.188.116.135&amp;curid=609207&amp;diff=83128271&amp;oldid=83021421" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:205.188.116.135&amp;curid=609207&amp;diff=83128271&amp;oldid=83021421" rel="nofollow">this example</a>.</p>
<p>If a non-bot did this, I'd revert the edit and post a complaint on the perp's own user talk page. But I'm not going to battle a bot single-handedly.</p>
<p>I realize that despite all the minatory white-hands-on-red, etc., WP gives more or less <i>carte blanche</i> to AOLusers to make as many stupid edits to as many pages as they wish. ("Blocking might prevent good edits by innocent users"!) However, for a bot to blank mere criticism of an AOLuser (and to do so with a bland and uninformative edit summary) seems several steps too far.</p>
<p>As for the warning (in red!) that warnings to AOL users go to the wrong place, this is untrue for certain AOL IPs. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Elvis_Presley/archive13" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Elvis_Presley/archive13" rel="nofollow">this</a> for example: an AOLuser with obsessed by dark thoughts about Elvis Presley. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 03:33, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Incidentally, I'm no fan of melodramatic warnings on user talk pages. I think the warnings should be curt, clear, and uninteresting. But that's a different issue. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 03:43, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm the operator of the bot in question. The bot is removing warnings posted to pages in the AOL <i>proxy</i> range, as distinguished from the AOL <i>dynamic</i> range. This is an important distinction which often leads to the opposition expressed above and on the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_on_user_warning_layout_standardisation_4293.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject on user warning layout standardisation">User warning layout standardisation talk page</a> (all of which have been answered there). A user in the <i>proxy</i> range changes <i>very</i> rapidly; it is said that the 'new messages' banner is permanent, and that clicking the link brings you to a talk page for an IP you've already moved from. Very conservatively, proxy users switch addresses within fifteen minutes, which makes all warnings older than fifteen minutes absolutely irrelevant. Leaving warnings after that point is the equivalent of warning <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Titoxd</a> about hypothetical vandalism committed by <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a>, and arguing that they are relevant because <i>someone</i> has to be warned.</p>
<p>The AOL <i>dynamic</i> ranges are more traditional, randomly assigned on connection and generally stable the whole time the user is connected. Warnings on these pages don't need to be removed, since the user actually <i>will</i> see them. Those IP addresses should no longer be categorised by {{<a href="../../../a/o/l/Template%7EAOL_b86f.html" title="Template:AOL">AOL</a>}} rather than the generic {{<a href="../../../s/h/a/Template%7ESharedip_e028.html" title="Template:Sharedip">sharedip</a>}}, and updating those pages is part of the maintenance I was performing while reviewing each individual edit after the fact. —[<small><a href="../../../a/d/m/WP%7EADMIN_f0df.html" title="WP:ADMIN">admin</a></small>] <a href="../../../p/a/t/User_talk%7EPathoschild_s_8ed0.html" title="User talk:Pathoschild/s">Pathoschild</a> <small>04:15, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>At the same time, the warnings on the proxy pages will still be visible, and blanking the warnings will just trigger the confusing orange bar again, and a user will get confused anyways if he clicks the diff link, so I don't see any benefit in blanking those pages.

<dd>As I said "does not appear", we have yet to go back through all the old bot requests (am working on validating several inconsistant pages) but "open-ended" bot tasks are no longer approriate. It would be just as easy to say that adding a new template to every page in the wiki would be <i>tedious</i>, but it is certainly wouldn't be acceptable to have a bot start doing this. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobchurch_99c1.html" title="User talk:Robchurch">User talk:Robchurch</a> who approved your bot is not around to elaborate on the discussion though.

<p>Thanks for the clarification, Pathoschild. I hadn't noticed any differentiation by en:WP among AOL IP numbers, which I suppose is "my bad". Putting aside the question of whether your bot was authorized to do what it's doing, what it's doing does seem to be a good thing. So I eat most of my words. But not all: I still think "AOL proxy range maintenance" was an unnecessary, even misleadingly bland edit summary; it could have been "AOL proxy: Deleting all messages other than AOL template" or similar. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 06:24, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Time ranges for these should be determined at <a href="../../../r/f/b/WP%7ERFBOT_2557.html" title="WP:RFBOT">bot requests</a> and the bot should not remove <i>recent</i> messages, otherwise why waste the time donig anything on these pages, just blank (other then the template) and protect all of them. — <a href="../../../x/a/o/User%7EXaosflux_5b5b.html" title="User:Xaosflux"><b><font color="#FF9933" face="monotype"><big>xaosflux</big></font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../x/a/o/User_talk%7EXaosflux_b62d.html" title="User talk:Xaosflux"><font color="#00FF00">Talk</font></a></sup> 06:29, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Why waste the time leaving messages indeed. Time ranges should <i>not</i> be determined at bot requests, because the bot is incidental to the task— I could do the same task semi-automatically or manually (as <a href="../../../a/o/l/User%7EAOL_account_5190.html" title="User:AOL account">AOL account</a> once did).

<dd>Agreed, determining the best use of these pages is not the role of bot approvals, but the implementation of those determinations is. Without further details the situations are endless (e.g. at the shortest possible intervals, all messages left on these talk pages would be getting immeditatley removed-even if a project group determined that having these pages blank is best, implmenting that by immediately reverting talks is obviously not useful. Sometimes project groups miss some details like this (usually not as obvious as that example of course) and when the bot task request comes in we refer the operator back to the project group for further direction. Most bot approvals are fairly straight forward, and the process has been streamlined in the last month or so. — <a href="../../../x/a/o/User%7EXaosflux_5b5b.html" title="User:Xaosflux"><b><font color="#FF9933" face="monotype"><big>xaosflux</big></font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../x/a/o/User_talk%7EXaosflux_b62d.html" title="User talk:Xaosflux"><font color="#00FF00">Talk</font></a></sup> 13:17, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This might sound like a radical proposal, but I do not think we should be leaving warning messages on the talk pages of AOL proxy range IP addresses <i>at all</i>. Not once have they been picked up by the intended recipient, with exception to a vandal who is seeking out these warnings. All that they do is provoke vandals and confuse the casual and innocent visitor. Can someone show me a diff that would prove otherwise? <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECan%27t_sleep%2C_clown_will_eat_me_7058.html" title="User:Can't sleep, clown will eat me">Can't sleep, clown will eat me</a> 07:30, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>To whom of the administrators it may concern,</p>
<p>I don't know if this is the right place to offer suggestions, and I have a feeling that this has been suggested before, but anyway:</p>
<p>It is my opinion that a lot of administrative work and undoing of vandalism could be avoided if WikiPedia were to stop allowing anonymous/non-account users to edit the WikiPedia content. I am also of the opinion that it would be a slight improvement for the community, and would enhance the community "feeling", if people had a better idea of who are who and who does what edits.</p>
<p>As such, i would suggest that The Wiki-Rulers consider making it mandatory for would-be editors to create accounts or them to be able to edit WikiPedia content.</p>

(The open proxy check site indicated that it is probably <i>not</i> an open proxy, but a lot of Web lists treats it as one due to poor security precautions by the ISP allowing access through the proxy.) Kskang3247 said that as a result of the block, he cannot <i>read</i> articles (after I initially wrote him and declined to lift the block, citing the open proxy nature of the IP and that he would still be able to read), and asked me to lift the block. He sent me a screen shot of the block message; however, that screen shot indicated that the message read that he is only blocked from editing, not reading. So my questions are, for those who might know more about this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it possible that an open proxy block causes someone to be unable to read articles?</li>
<li>Whether this is true or not, should I convert the block (indefinite, as open proxy) to a soft block, and if so, should I also lift the block on creating user accounts from that IP?</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="../../../c/m/e/User%7ECME46_36f7.html" title="User:CME46">User:CME46</a> is a sock of User:Andrew Lin, who is an indefinitely blocked user that has edited under many usernames.

<p>By the way, I think it would be nice if, whenever people are doing such selective history deletions, they'd also move the deleted revisions to a different title. That will make the job of any admin who needs to repeat the exercise later for the same article easier, and ensures that the revisions containing confidential information don't get restored later by accident. There are two ways to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Method A:
<ol>
<li>Move the article to a new title (say, Stupidity/deleted revisions 2006-10-23).</li>
<li>Delete the article.</li>
<li>Restore all revisions except the ones you wanted to remove.</li>
<li>Move the article back to its original title.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Method B:
<ol>
<li>Delete the article.</li>
<li>Restore <i>only</i> the version you wanted to removed.</li>
<li>Move the restored revisions to a new title (as above).</li>
<li>Delete the moved revisions.</li>
<li>Restore all the remaining revisions of the original article.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The second method takes more work, but has the advantage that you don't need to select lots of checkboxes at any point. Also, before doing selective history deletion, it's a good idea to always check if the article already has deleted revisions, and, if so, move them out of the way first. This can be done using a similar sequence of moves and deletions as above:</p>
<ol>
<li>Move the article to a temporary title (say, Stupidity/temp).</li>
<li>Restore the deleted revisions.</li>
<li>Move the restored revisions to a new title (say, Stupidity/old deleted revisions).</li>
<li>Delete the moved revisions.</li>
<li>Move the temporarily renamed article back to its original title.</li>
<li>Continue with either method above.</li>
</ol>

<dd>This reminds me of the first time I realised that category renaming wasn't possible in any simple way. I thought "that must be a bug". But actually, if category moving was as simple as page moving, the vandalism possibilities would be endless! A big clue that categories can't be renamed in any simple way, which I only spotted recently, is that there is no "move" tab for category pages. This also means that the history of any work on a category page is lost (well, technically hidden) if it is deleted. Now <i>that</i> really is a bug! :-( <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 22:24, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

As part of this he pretty regularly semi-protects things; articles mainly. Only he has never, in the last month, unprotected a single thing, except one restoration he did. That'd be ok, only he never actually adds a tag, category, anything, to the articles he semi-protects. Now I suppose they get bot-listed at <a href="../../../p/p/_/WP%7EPP_1ffd.html" title="WP:PP">WP:PP</a>, but that's really only half the job and the tag and category exist for a reason. I can't get any response (to anything, at all, even why he blocked someone for 8.625 fortnights) from his talk page, I suppose he must not like me (fair enough, but still) so I'm kind of wondering whether this seems like a good balance to be striking or not?

<dd>For the most part, I try to appropriately tag pages I've protected, and I do dig through my protection log to unprotect every two or three days -- I'd encourage most any admin to do the same, I think. It does seem unusual that CSCWEM wouldn't reply to your message, though to be fair he might need or want more than sixteen minutes to do so; is there any history of bad blood, there, or is it just a case of a missed message? Or I guess more to the point, is this thread about reminding people to tag and eventually unprotect, in general, or about CSCWEM in particular?

<p>Splash, you have the opposite problem. You unprotect articles that are facing heavy ongoing vandalism and then walk away from them. Some of these are then re-vandalized within <i>minutes</i>.

<p>IMHO, if it's set in hours, then we can determine how long the next block should be. 99 hours is his most common number he uses, but what is 99 hours but a little under 3 "31 hour" blocks? The use of fortnights is a little excessive, true, but it's nothing to start a discussion, RFC or RFAr about. I mean if he all of his logs in fortnights, I guess that would be a problem, but he doesn't. For the most part he uses hours, which we can always just do the simple math. <i>semper fi</i> — <a href="../../../m/o/e/User_talk%7EMoe_Epsilon_62b6.html" title="User talk:Moe Epsilon"><font color="#000000">Moe</font></a> 00:57, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Splash, I agree with Flo, and RfC is the proper course. If you want a general admin discussion on protection then fair enough, but it looks to me like you are here 'requesting comments' on an individual admin. Yes, RfCs need to be seconded - and there are good reasons for us requiring that. Don't use this board to get round that requirement. If CSCWEM isn't responding to you, you should ask someone else to have a word.

<p>A few of the people working on the page: <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planets_in_Stargate_6ed0.html" title="Planets in Stargate">Planets in Stargate</a>, have noticed that for no reason whatsoever, the link in the toolbox to the French version appears more than a hundred times. There was nothing in the code of the page that would indicate this, and no oone had made any edit that would seem to cause this. After trying to Delete the French link entirely, they were still there. Even after screwing around on the French version, we still haven't been able to remove the links. I think this might be a glitch in the software, or some sort of Vandal virus that reprograms the codes. We need an admin with very good technical skills to take a look. <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobyk777_9e17.html" title="User:Tobyk777">Tobyk777</a> 03:56, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm fairly concerned that few admins have weighed in with opinions on the "random" rule <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Username#Random_Letters_3:_The_Debate" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Username#Random_Letters_3:_The_Debate" rel="nofollow">here</a> as 1. admins are the ones who make these blocks and 2. no one noticed when it was removed without consensus, yet people still used it for a blocking reason. (Does that make it de facto policy since people use it regardless of the wording? I don't know.) I personally think that usernames are meant to be a human, understandable interface that promotes collaboration. A random string of garbage made by a vandal as a throwaway account such as User:1524gf86d3sf546 should be disallowed. (The only reason "vandalism" appears in that block summary is that rather than doing the usual usernameblock on sight, I've been checking first to make sure innocent editors aren't harmed. So far I haven't found any that were traumatized as has been claimed.) One argument seems to be that regular editors can't trust admins to make good decisions based on this policy, though I have yet to see evidence that this rule is rampantly misused. More discussion is on the village pump <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28policy%29#Acceptable_username_policy" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28policy%29#Acceptable_username_policy" rel="nofollow">here</a>, but again few admins have weighed in and they should (whether you agree with my view or not) since ultimatley we are the ones who deal with enforcing this. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 05:31, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is the old descriptive not prescriptive. The policy itself gives various rationales and the lsit of inappropriate names is (in my understanding) not intended to be comprehensive just documents those frequently held to be inappropriate. As the policy states "...but it also means picking a name that others are comfortable seeing and collaborating with.", which is where I'd place the "silly" random strings, they aren't that easy for others to remember and work with. Also username blocks are generally without prejudice and autobocks removed without question. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 06:20, 24 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>mmm...well said and sensible. The issue I see is people saying we "can't" block these usernames if the random rule is removed or "only a suggestion". Perhaps that's just policy wonkism at its best? <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 07:06, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well that's not the way it works anywhere else, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">wikipedia is not a bureacracy</a>, <a href="../../../c/r/e/WP%7ECREEP_d9fc.html" title="WP:CREEP">Avoid instruction creep</a>, <a href="../../../w/l/_/WP%7EWL_5eab.html" title="WP:WL">wikilawyering</a> etc. all cover this, we aren't an experiment in rule making and it is the underlying rationale/purpose/spirit which is important. The username policy is quite clear as to it's aim as indeed is the list it gives as "Wikipedia does not allow certain types of usernames, including the following:" which quite clearly seems to indicate it is not exhaustive. The question still comes down to are the names being blocked because of the rationale behind the username policy. It would be silly (and wrong IMO) to block a name just because it could be interpreted within those criteria and we adopted a rules is rules approach when clearly it isn't problematic (say a username of asfdg which is of course a random set of letters, but is not problematic in regards to a "sensible" identifier of a user it isn't that complex or confusing) , similarly usernames which are within the base raitionale and purpose of usernames should be blocked regardless of an explicit mention in that list. It still comes down to a question of discretion on behalf of the admin and indeed the username policy recognises that too "Fairly or unfairly, the line between acceptable and unacceptable user names is drawn by those who find the username inappropriate, not by the creator of the name." --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 11:18, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>People unfortunately are policy wonking out about this though, there was a bit of a revert war on the page where this was discussed, and one editor kept insisting that there is no consensus for this policy, even though it has been this way for a while, and when it was changed, a number of editors spoke out against the change and for the status quo. That editor gave every appearance of trying to ruleslawyer. So I'm glad pschemp brought this up here so it could be discussed further. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 11:40, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Would it be possible to clarify what this is used for? I'm guessing it is for when you delete one article (presumably as a speedy, as anything else doesn't really need a tool like this to save time, as they have to go through AfD), you click on "what links here" to see if the article was linked from anywhere else that might also be suitable for deletion (eg. <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wikipedia%7EWalled_garden_a64f.html" title="Wikipedia:Walled garden">walled gardens</a>). But I'm wondering why this "delete" link is needed, as surely you have to go into the article and read it, and look at the history and so forth, first? After all that, how does having the delete button on "what links here" help?</dd>
<dd>I'm also concerned about the "move successful" page. I'm guessing this is for deleting the old page after a move (the old page turns into a redirect), but I was under the impression that this was only needed if moving pages out of the way to create space for moving another page to that location? I thought that in general, redirects after moving are nearly always left in place. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 13:04, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

The idea is that when doing a speedy, an admin should check the page first, then the history, then the WLH (because you can't easily get from WLH to the history), and it speeds up the deletion as there isn't a need to go back to the original page. Not being an admin, I can't comment on how useful this would be. --<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">ais523</a> 13:22, 24 October 2006 (<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">U</a><a href="../../../a/i/s/User_talk%7EAis523_6ca0.html" title="User talk:Ais523">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ais523_df26.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ais523">C</a>)
