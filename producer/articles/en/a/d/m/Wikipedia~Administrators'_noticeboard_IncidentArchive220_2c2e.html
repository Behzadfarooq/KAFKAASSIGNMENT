<p>Top Gun is an editor with a severe lack of understanding of copyright issues and a habit of copying material from websites. This editor was blocked twice for copyvio and the second time, the block was extended to indefinite duration for continuing to edit anonymously (also see <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_checkuser_Case_Top_Gun_9865.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Top Gun">Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Top Gun</a>, an older case). Top Gun was unblocked after promising ‘not to add any more copyrighted text to Wikipedia’ but ‘may be immediately and indefinitely reblocked in the event of any further copyvio edits’<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Top_Gun&amp;diff=110426648&amp;oldid=110360149" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Top_Gun&amp;diff=110426648&amp;oldid=110360149" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</p>

However, besides the fact that the initial revision was a copyvio, the article is now a derivative work (as clearly seen in its history) of a non-free copyrighted text.</p>
<p>Prior to being unblocked, Top Gun was told not to do this. I think this is a clear violation of Sandstein’s terms and Top Gun should be blocked. —<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzy_n_12cc.html" title="User:Xyzzy n">xyzzy</a><sub><a href="../../../x/y/z/User_talk%7EXyzzy_n_2d1b.html" title="User talk:Xyzzy n">n</a></sub> 09:24, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>He appears to think altering the text makes it a non-copyvio. An easy mistake to make.

<dd>(edit conflict) I disagree that Mel was being particularly incivil, and I'm still looking for a personal attack here. And <i>nb</i> for The Behnam- placing warning templates on a user's talk page is generally inferior to leaving them a written-out explanation of your grievance.

<dd>With all due respect, I don't understand how one could interpret the RFCN vote in the manner that you did. It looks more like an attempted light-hearted joke than an attack.

There's nothing that AN/I can do that actual one-to-one interaction wouldn't have done in this situation. <a href="../../../a/_/t/User%7EA_Train_c9b0.html" title="User:A Train">A Train</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../a/_/t/User_talk%7EA_Train_dd5d.html" title="User talk:A Train"><font color="DarkBlue">take the</font></a></small></sup> 19:39, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

Good grief.. Not only did I not call him a puritan (no-one did, though another editor used the term obliquely), but The Behnam is being incredibly thin-skinned.

<p>Someone that I presume to be the subject of the article, William (Bill) Bradford, has been trying <i>very hard</i> to get his article deleted. This involves what I suspect to be sockpuppetry, deleting what he doesn't like, tagging it for prod and speedy, and generally acting against the consensus at AfD and against the policies of Wikipedia. He also stated in an edit summary, <i>"I have removed false statements about claims Bradford is alleged to have made but which cannot be substantied by reliable sources. Previous edits have been libelous and actionable."</i> and <i>"The original purpose of this page, and recent edits to it, are libelous and false and allege statements and conduct by Bradford for which there is no reliable source."</i> I consider these to be <b>legal threats</b>, which I believe are a no-no. Note that the article is thoroughly cited, by my own work, as of last night. Whether those sources are reliable, I have no idea.

<dd>Be very careful here. This is a marginally notable biography and a very upset subject. This is one of the areas when wikipedians tend to lash out and act totally unethically. Yes the article is referenced, but we really need to ask ourselves whether we need it. Whether some of the information is one-sided, intrusive, or amounts to investigative journalism. We don't do investigative journalism.

<dd>After thinking about it a little bit, the main conflict has been over the military record. However, that's not the primary part of his story. That part of the the article says what he <i>did</i> or <i>claimed</i>. It should probably be worded that "news source xyz said that..." etc. It would also be helpful if we could access his profile, but not even archive.org has it. There's not a source that quotes him saying that he has a silver star, either; perhaps he says so in one of the FOX News clips. Also, there's the question of whether or not <i>Frontpage Magazine.com</i> (the source for the silver star information) is a reliable source. Bradley says they are not, (if not explicitly, then implicitly given his disagreement with the information in their article) and given their consistent POV and recent crusade against <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Technique_d83a.html" title="The Technique">The Technique</a></i>, I am inclined to agree with him. Ultimately, I want whatever results to be thoroughly sourced, and to remain relatively comprehensive. POV and RS are our big problems here. Deleting the article because someone whines about it doesn't seem <i>right</i>, or ethical for that matter. —<a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDisavian_2333.html" title="User:Disavian">Disavian</a> (<a href="../../../d/i/s/User_talk%7EDisavian_f80f.html" title="User talk:Disavian"><sup>talk</sup></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Disavian_e056.html" title="Special:Contributions/Disavian"><sub>contribs</sub></a>) 16:01, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I admit that the article was POV-ish, and I was attempting to remedy that by adding references and rewording it; however, his large deletions of content and attempts to delete the article were highly distracting, to say the least. By the way, the broken reference #13 was caused by the deletion of this line at the end of "tenure controversy":

<p><a href="../../../p/e/b/User%7EPebs96_42e0.html" title="User:Pebs96">User:Pebs96</a> created the Bloodless bullfighting article in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Bullfighting&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=57152065" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Bullfighting&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=57152065" rel="nofollow">early June</a> last year. The article was filled with improperly licensed pictures, mostly tagged with GFDL licenses but with no release by the photographer and a very large, clear copyright notice on them. I speedy-tagged them as incorrect license, and she responded <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Fethers&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=95678562" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Fethers&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=95678562" rel="nofollow">here</a> after they were deleted, with my admittedly steamed response <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Fethers&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=95678562" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Fethers&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=95678562" rel="nofollow">here</a> and following in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Fethers&amp;oldid=95955430" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Fethers&amp;oldid=95955430" rel="nofollow">my archive</a>.</p>
<p>After waiting several months for the Bloodless bullfighting article to become something more than an advertisement and word-for-word copy of her own commercial website, I submitted it to <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_N_51e3.html" title="WP:COI/N">WP:COI/N</a>. The decision was later made after <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConflict_of_interest_Noticeboard_Archive_3_8ccb.html" title="Wikipedia:Conflict of interest/Noticeboard/Archive 3">discussion there</a> to submit it for <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Bloodless_bullfighting_0d87.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Bloodless bullfighting">AfD</a>, where it was deleted, in process. 2 days after the close, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Bloodless_bullfighting&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=116972629" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Bloodless_bullfighting&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=116972629" rel="nofollow">she responded</a> on the closed AfD.

<li>Just an FYI, all of those folks whom you mentioned above NEVER went as far as you are going. It truly is amazing how a person can have so much energy with negativity.</li>
<li>You need to just STOP accusing me of "promoting".... when it is absolutely NOT true at all. You just can't leave stuff and people alone can you. You just have to go on and on about NOTHING!</li>

<dd>Whether we like it or not being an administrator can be seen as or used as a position of authority. Admins are usually pretty experienced users, and being an administrator shows that you have at least some level of trust from the community. Also, admins have certain abilities that other users do not, and thus non-admins approach admins for help. This is problematic if the person approached is also an inexperienced new user or, even worse, a user with malicious intentions. Lastly, less experienced users frequently do things like posting block messages or protection templates when those tools can not be used. A less experienced user, not knowing where logs are or how to read them, may just take those templates at their word, which isn't good. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalie_Erin_58a7.html" title="User:Natalie Erin">Natalie</a> 00:30, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

After these various discussions, one editor chose to slap a Notability tag on the article, though it was clearly established through the AFD and other discussions that the article and its topic is indeed notable. Betacommand has taken it upon himself to enforce this POV edit by threatening anyone who removes this tag with immediate blocking, and has followed through on that threat<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJaakobou&amp;diff=118029012&amp;oldid=118025822" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJaakobou&amp;diff=118029012&amp;oldid=118025822" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>.

<p>I've left a message at Betacommand's Talk page making similar points. My own feeling is that he ought to be blocked, and Jaakobou unblocked; he clearly isn't going to acknowledge his error [I was wrong about part of that; he's not admitting his error, but he has unblocked Jaakobou]. Looking at Betacommand's history, I don't really see how he can be held to be a safe pair of hands for admins' tools. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Talk</font></a>) 17:06, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

Three editors including Jaakobou then acted in a tag-team to repeatedly delete the {{Notability}} tag as a means of shutting down the debate (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pallywood&amp;diff=117867733&amp;oldid=117866196" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pallywood&amp;diff=117867733&amp;oldid=117866196" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pallywood&amp;diff=117757564&amp;oldid=117755647" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pallywood&amp;diff=117757564&amp;oldid=117755647" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pallywood&amp;diff=117788251&amp;oldid=117758100" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pallywood&amp;diff=117788251&amp;oldid=117758100" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>). To date, <i>none</i> of the editors who argued that the article is notable have bothered answering <i>any</i> of the questions, other than appealing to the number of Google hits (e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Pallywood&amp;diff=117791109&amp;oldid=117786337" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Pallywood&amp;diff=117791109&amp;oldid=117786337" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>) or arguing in effect that "it's notable because I say it is". This is in fact the third time that Jaakobou has done this; Betacommand's action was undertaken to stop Jaakobou continuing a tag-team edit war which he started (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pallywood&amp;diff=117065263&amp;oldid=116984993" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pallywood&amp;diff=117065263&amp;oldid=116984993" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>).</p>
<p>The notability questions haven't gone away, and I invite people to look at <a href="../../../p/a/l/Talk%7EPallywood_5bbc.html#Notability_questions" title="Talk:Pallywood">Talk:Pallywood#Notability questions</a> to judge for themselves whether they're justified.

<dd>Keep in mind that Meta + stewards work for/with <i>every</i> Wikimedia wiki, and not every wiki has the same structures that we do (in fact, very few do). To my knowledge there is presently no structure on en.wp to gain community consensus for a desysop as traditionally it has been handled by the Arbitration Committee, who would then request action from a steward. I doubt we could just have a discussion and then point a steward to it without significant discussion about implementing such a facility first. —<a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell"><span style="color:#555;font-weight:bold;">bbatsell</span></a> <a href="../../../b/b/a/User_talk%7EBbatsell_7978.html" title="User talk:Bbatsell"><span style="color:#C46100;font-size:0.75em;">¿?</span></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bbatsell_a457.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bbatsell"><span style="color:#2C9191;">✍</span></a> 18:28, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Husnock was an emergency desysopping based on the threat of a compromised account. The stewards are responsible for all wikimedia projects; only some have arbitration committees. Here, I believe they would not honor AN/I consensus. In fact, as an arbitration clerk in Seabhcan case, I was planning on posting a notice of the arbcom case on Meta:requests for permissions and was told that the arbitrators would communicate directly with the stewards to effect the approved desysoppings in that case. I don't have an opinion on the allegations here but I am reasonably certain that the only way to desysop someone on en-wiki is be decision of Arbcom, either as an emergency (such as the NSLE case) or after a hearing. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 19:14, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure there is any policy basis for your block in the first place, it seems punative rather than preventative since as far as I can tell he has already stopped the disputed activity pending the outcome of the discussion.

<dd>"In the first place" I'd wrongly understood that this string of blocks of User names was very recent, and the block was intended to stop him blocking any more.

<dd>I'd have thought a clearer statement of your position would have been to unblock on realising the block was made on a misreading of the situation, leaving the block in place certainly seemed to suggest (to me) you thought a block maybe justified just not on the basis that you blocked. Your initial statement on this regarded a single username block you undid, "I'm blocking Betacommand for an unjustified and unexplained block", though having looked closer I see the block summary you used was some what different.

<dd>If the pages in question were essentially a personal essay, written by Coppertwig, expressing his views and objections to ATT, I would have no problem. That is well within the idea of what user pages are for. If he wanted to <i>privately</i> invite a few specific individuals that shared his views to edit it, I would have no problem. Still in the acceptable user page mode. But... setting up what is in essence a counter poll, anouncing its existance in a public forum, <i>and</i> invitating the community to come and contribute makes the page something a bit different than a personal essay expressing his opinion. To my mind it moves the page away from user space and makes it semi-public. To then say that only those who agree with his views may comment or edit, and that he has deletion rights, etc., is something I do have a bit of a problem with. Combine this with his overly repeated comments on every single page that even remotely relates to ATT, and it definitely goes beyond <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> in my eyes. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 15:20, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

The users who bring up the issue of polarization have a good point. It may be beneficial for users to edit the page of the "side" they don't agree with, because trying to do this in such a way as to improve the document as a representation of that "side" involves a mental gymnastic that would tend to lead to understanding and collaboration.

<dd>Actually, Jossi, I'm not an Admin, just someone adding his two cents. I would also say I <i>am</i> somewhat involved... I have written negative comments on several talk pages in response to Coppertwig's repeated harping on the roll of truth subject ... and wrote a comment directly to him, expressing my displeasure with the way he set up his 'Stability_of_policy' page. I have also expressed strong support for the merge. I would not say I am neutral. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 18:15, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>On reviewing various policies, I've gained the impression that essays are written by either a single user or by all users -- not by groups of users. For this and other reasons I'm striking out my invitations to certain users to edit the user pages and inviting users to submit material for inclusion on the talk page instead. I hope this is satisfactory. Users may wish to comment on this at my talk page. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 22:04, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Being blocked doesn't necessarily mean you're always wrong, but it does mean that you can't claim ignorance of this variety of unacceptable behavior. You may consider asking for help, instead of demanding it; providing diffs that actually support your claim (your first diff shows a user changing a sentence from "endorse" to "endorse deletion of the article" - hardly damning); and not snapping at people that politely point out your own harrassment of other users. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalie_Erin_58a7.html" title="User:Natalie Erin">Natalie</a> 22:31, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So let me see if I am following the sequence of events here: On March 21st, without so much as a simple message on NewYork1956's talk page, you took it upon yourself to edit his userpage to conform with your view of policy on Wikipedia. When he quite naturally took umbrage at your presumptuous behaviour and tried to discuss the matter with you on your talk page, you escalated the conflict, repeated the behaviour, and are now taking it to ANI looking for support. Hmmmmm. You won't get any support from me. As I see it, you are guilty of editing his page without first discussing the matter with him, Had you taken that <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">basic, polite step</a>, this whole unfortunate situation could have been avoided. While you are within policy to do what you did, I certainly don't support the way you did it, and would have responded a lot less civilly than NewYork1956 did. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffpw_23d5.html" title="User:Jeffpw">Jeffpw</a> 13:43, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Uh....Jeffpw, I don't think it has anything to do with "his view of policy." <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">WP:FU</a> states "Fair use images may be used only in the article namespace. Used outside article space, they are not covered under the fair use doctrine. They should never be used on templates (including stub templates and navigation boxes) or on user pages." That's pretty cut and dry to me. The only incivility that I see here is your accusations and your claims that his behavior is "presumptuous". That was certainly uncalled for.

<dd>Obviously somebody hasn't cleaned their glasses this morning. I said it was done in accordance with policy. But it wasn't done in accordance with basic civility, which indicates Durin should have talked it out with NewYork1956 before acting.As to my "uncivil accusations", I don't see that I made any accusations at all. I merely gave my view of Durin's actions. Surely that is the purpose of ANI? <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffpw_23d5.html" title="User:Jeffpw">Jeffpw</a> 14:08, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Um, no. From the page on <a href="../../../f/u/c/WP%7EFUC_7b76.html" title="WP:FUC">fair use criteria</a>, "Fair use images may be used only in the article namespace.

<ul>
<li>Responding on two points; one, the concept of discussing a removal with someone has been proposed by people before. Enough people proposed it that I generated an RfC on it, which resulted in overwhelming consensus that what I am doing is appropriate and proper. You can view the RfC at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Durin_and_fair_use_image_removals_20ac.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Durin and fair use image removals">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Durin and fair use image removals</a>. Two, I brought the matter here because the matter has become a dispute with this user given their response. When I was an admin (a position from which I voluntarily stepped down), I would undo the re-insertion of the images and leave a note. Now that I am not, and given that this user is making a distinction between admins and other editors, I felt it appropriate to bring it here so that admins could comment on the user's talk page to help resolve the issue for this user since it is obvious he lacks respect for my opinion given that I am not an admin. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 14:22, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Fair use images are not acceptable in userspace any more than any other copyright image would be. It would be courteous to request their removal first, but in this is not a matter where there is grey area regarding what is permissible- fair use images must go. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WjB</b></a><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe"><i>scribe</i></a></span> 15:10, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Durin was, of course, in the right. The use of non-free images on userpages is clearly prohibited. That we don't simply have a bot doing this is testament the the efforts we're going through in order to be user-friendly. The idea that asking is nice is noble, but it implies the contributor has a say in the matter, when he doesn't, which just builds more animosity... It also makes handling a backlogged area worse, and I expect at the end it would reduce the overall friendliness of the process. --<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 15:20, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Durin probably knows that all users are equal. Admins do not have any extra magical-policy-sauce. Of course, if this particular user isn't listening, an admin can use their famous block button to actually enforce policy, as a form of <a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?PowerAnswer" class="extiw" title="meatball:PowerAnswer">meatball:PowerAnswer</a>. --<a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> 15:29, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Durin was absolutely right. I too have, lately, been removing fair use images from pages where they should not be. Originally, I left kind civil notes to the users, and some responded; some did not. Really, I completely lost track of who I had contacted about what, having 700+ pages in my watchlist. To suggest that users who are merely enforcing policy should go to the extra lengths to ask other users to stop breaking policy is unrealistic. And this it totally supported by the consensus shown at the rfc. --<a href="../../../i/a/m/User%7EIamunknown_d3ca.html" title="User:Iamunknown">Iamunknown</a> 16:45, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Evans1551 created a nonsense article entitled I Am A Monkey. The last line of the article even noted <i>The song was never published, but remains popular with a select few inhabitants of Crowthorne, now studying in Edgbarrow School Sixth Form (As of 2007)</i>. I deleted it.</p>
<p>He then began harrasing me on my talk page.

<dd>It seems to me that 15 year old allegations, which were never proven, or even brought to trial, and were only resurfaced for purposes of politically attacking the spouse of a non-public figure, have no place on Wikipedia.

<p>I agree. But several editors of the page have been working (while battling Kzq's unilateral edits) to come up with a rewritten section that takes all of the focus off the spouse.

<p>"Rikki Lee Travolta", master self-promoter throughout the Internet, has been attempting to re-establish his self-edited entries on Wikipedia after his self-created and sockpuppetted articles were deleted last year. I deleted several unsourced references to him from a variety of articles the other day, including <a href="../../../y/e/s/Yesterday_Was_a_Lie_7f72.html" title="Yesterday Was a Lie">Yesterday Was a Lie</a>. An anon, most likely "Travolta" himself, has re-added the information: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yesterday_Was_a_Lie&amp;diff=118365754&amp;oldid=118112149" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yesterday_Was_a_Lie&amp;diff=118365754&amp;oldid=118112149" rel="nofollow">[43]</a>. I've reverted it back out again, but just want to make sure that what I did was correct. See <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Rikki_Lee_Travolta_9625.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Rikki Lee Travolta">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Rikki Lee Travolta</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EArticles_for_deletion_Rikki_Lee_Travolta_3569.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Articles for deletion/Rikki Lee Travolta">Wikipedia talk:Articles for deletion/Rikki Lee Travolta</a> as a starting point for previous discussion. <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorvus_cornix_890e.html" title="User:Corvus cornix">Corvus cornix</a> 21:53, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, after a brief look at his logs I don't see any deletions marked "nonsense". I see some A7 deletions, some attack page deletions...but definitely not 20-30 nonsense deletions.

<p>Could some independent parties please take a look at the recent activity here? (And while we're at it, could more people please add this to their watchlist?) See also <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Mangojuice_7484.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Mangojuice">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Mangojuice</a>. Short summary: after thorough research, many "shock sites" have been removed from the list as having absolutely no reliable sources. People constantly re-add sites without the sources, and they are then removed with a request for sources usually by me. Recently a user named User:Aftli, apparently a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ciper&amp;diff=111626998&amp;oldid=111608397" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ciper&amp;diff=111626998&amp;oldid=111608397" rel="nofollow">shock site owner</a>, showed up claiming that all those people who made a single edit supporting the inclusion of information without sources represents overwhelming community support to ignore Wikipedia policies. Aftli also, I suspect, edits from User:167.206.107.110.

<p>Was doing an edit on the Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat page because it didn't make sense. When I checked the edit history it appeared Corvus Cornix removed some info that resulted in the flow of paragraphs not making sense so I was just going to revert it, but then I noticed that Corvus Cornix's edit history showed they were going through and deleting info from all sorts of sites based on their like or dislike of the individuals rather than based on facts (seems to have a big hate for the Travoltas). I'm a bit concerned by the user's actions. On their own page they admit a bad history and having to start over. I'm all for giving second chances but this behavior is looking somewhat stalker like from my outside prospective. Admin may want to watch if any more patterns like this develop. 66.99.121.245 18:05, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Right. Just happened to note that it isn't making sense. See my comments above about "Rikki Lee Travolta". I will continue to remove the link until such time as someone provides proof that gueststarcasting.com is a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. I have no feeling one way or the other about "the Travoltas", only about the hoaxer who claims that he is one without any proof whatsoever. <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorvus_cornix_890e.html" title="User:Corvus cornix">Corvus cornix</a> 18:16, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is an OTRS message from one of the Travoltas about this. Sorry, can't remember which one. Until Rikki Lee contacts the Foundation with proof of his claims, we should stick to verifiability and reliable source guidelines. Particularly related to the claims at gueststarcasting.com that Rikki is a top draw in "Joseph and the Amazing...", I did a Lexis-Nexis search last year and could not find a single review of any theater production in any major newspaper of his performance, except for a small community theater in a Chicago suburb. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 18:32, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I reverted the deletion for now and warned 76.16.54.49.</p>
<p>Because all of the statements that were offensive to 71.201.181.10 et al were statements of fact verifiable by edit histories, I don't think the claim has much merit, however I don't pay the legal bills around here.</p>
<p>Since this involves a claim of libel, I thought it best to make note of it here where high-paid admins would know exactly how to handle this matter. --<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A.

<p>I believe this user has exhausted the community's patience, and most certainly my own. I'd like to know if there is a good reason not to block him again, possibly indefinitely. I happened to notice that he moved his talk page to User:Parker007/article then blanked it and tagged it as {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-userreq_2a03.html" title="Template:Db-userreq">db-userreq</a>}}, and successfully duped the CSD folks into deleting it. I've restored his talk page history and moved it back to the correct location, as it will likely be referenced in future discussions. —<tt class="plainlinks"><b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Freakofnurture_77c8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Freakofnurture">freak</a>(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" rel="nofollow">talk</a>)</b></tt> 06:27, Mar. 28, 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not in violation of 3RR. The first edit was made to implement a compromise, the other 3 were reversions. The problem here is that YOU keep reverting without valid arguements. YOU revert because you claim that the essay was approved by a consensus established 3 months ago!

<p>I believe that this is User:Aidan Work who is banned. My reasons are that he just created Postal Orders of the British Field Post Office in Kosovo. Aidan Work had created a series of Postal Order articles, most of which are now in <a href="../../../p/o/s/Category%7EPostal_Orders_a570.html" title="Category:Postal Orders">Category:Postal Orders</a>. I recently requested deletion for several of them which had no real information in them. The ones that remain needed a lot of work and are still generally not great articles.

<p>As I noted on your talkpage, Avi, an admin blocking a user they are involved in a content dispute with is not a good idea. You don't seem to accept that, which is a worry. I believe the block was entirely justified, although 24 hours would have been sufficient, but I think you should have noted the problem here and allowed someone else to make the block. Allowing yourself to be painted as abusive is not a good idea when dealing with a troll.</p>
<p>Durova, I have left you a note on your talkpage. Your comment is entirely unacceptable. People have to be permitted to disagree with each other without then finding that the people they disagreed with mischaracterise them and attack them in other places. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 05:44, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>He removed my comment, and some others, classifying them as "<i>useless garbage</i>" in the edit summary<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jeffpw&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=118586665" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jeffpw&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=118586665" rel="nofollow">[63]</a>. and reverted his user page to the (IMHO) offensive version<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Jeffpw&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=118538244" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Jeffpw&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=118538244" rel="nofollow">[64]</a>.</p>
<p>I proffered to ask for some intervention here instead of edit-warring over this user's own userpage. As I said, I don't know for sure if some policy was violated, but his page simply doesn't seem ok.</p>

<dd>Agreed. He should be allowed to point out problems with his article on the talk page, banned or not. The letter of policy doesn't matter; we aren't robots, we are able to think and adapt as the situation requires. If we are going to insist on having an article against his wishes, we should at least have the common courtesy of allowing him to edit the talk page. There is no reason to remove his comments just to be vindictive, while claiming "Oh, it's policy, I have no choice." You do have a choice.

<p>I agree fully with Thatcher, Theresa, JzG, and Deskana, and I'm finding it hard to understand why people keep restoring his posts instead of just accepting that as a banned user he can e-mail his concerns to any admin and/or to the Foundation. It's not as if upholding the rule against letting banned users edit has to lead to inaccuracies in the article. There's a certain procedure he can follow if he wants to report a problem. Let him follow it. <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EElinorD_4da6.html" title="User:ElinorD">ElinorD</a> <a href="../../../e/l/i/User_talk%7EElinorD_6fce.html" title="User talk:ElinorD">(talk)</a> 01:18, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's very simple: If it is so absolutely imperative that he be allowed to edit, then figure out some way to get him officially unbanned by arbcom/the foundation, either from just his talk page or from Wikipedia as a whole. Until then, <i>stop violating policy and common sense by letting the banned troll post.</i> --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> <small><a href="../../../t/j/s/User_talk%7ETjstrf_3ddb.html" title="User talk:Tjstrf">talk</a></small> 01:26, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The reality is he only needs to post and then to a large extent whether or not his posts are removed is irrelevant because as long as they remain in the history anyone can look at them and decide whether his BLP concerns are worth investigating and/or acting upon. If the wikimedia office are willing to present his BLP concerns to the editors on the talk page (removing legal threats, personal attacks on third parties etc) that would be great but if not then I would rather see his edits on the talk page though I dont support the restoring of these edits iof another user removes them, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 01:39, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(outdent) I am aware that Mr. Brandt has already been informed of the site's banning policy and I see no need to either carve out an exception for him or to wring our hands about it. There is nothing special going on here; people get sitebanned all the time and people who are the subject of Wikipedia biographies contact the Foundation all the time. A calm and evenhanded approach is best here.

<li>Banned means someone isn't allowed to edit Wikipedia. This doesn't affect their ability to report BLP or accuracy issues which can still be sent in through email. He's still able to share his concerns if he's banned without posting to the wiki, so I don't see a reason to compromise the ban to allow for something he can already do while banned. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 11:07, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Editing an article talk page is not the same as editing an article. AFAIK, the talk page of his article is the only place he edits.

<dd>Hmmm, let me get this straight: You have already had me checkusered, but it turned up nothing. So now what you want to do is have someone block me until I cough up some username that doesn't exist, so you will know if I'm doing something that's not forbidden. And all of this is because I have advanced editing skills and defended a guy who I feel was improperly blocked.

<p>Apparently. I deleted the page <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_S._Greco_f556.html" title="Michael S. Greco">Michael S. Greco</a> that was a blatant copyright infringement off their website, although it was clearly a notable person. It was created by the account User:ABAORG (Username vio?) Anyway, then I get this email from them:</p>
<p><br />
Dear Swatjester:</p>
<p>My name is Jonathan Nichols, I am a current member of the American Bar Association's media board and practicing attorney. Among other sites, the ABA has maintained a wikipedia page on immediate past president Michael S. Greco, whose page was suddenly and inexplicably deleted in its entirety by you or someone using your member name. The reasoning given for this deletion was that the page consituted copyright infringement. As head of the ABA's media and publicity group, and an expert on copyright infringement as a practicing attorney, I would like an explanation behidn this lien of reasoning. Each of the three images utilized for the article on President Greco: the portrait, the Renaissance of Idealism cover, and the C-Span screen capture, were either owned by the American Bar Association (in the first two instances) or public domain (in the case of the the C-Span image). The article was written by myself and several other members of President Greco's administration and current staffers at the American Bar Association. Nothing on the page was an infringement of copyrighted laws, rules or regulations.</p>
<p>I am writing to formally request that this page be reinstated immediately. Law students and attorneys all over the country have written to the ABA and referenced this wikipedia page, among others, in asking more about President Greco and his activities as president and in his practice in Boston, Massachusetts and Washington, D.C., as well as his blue ribbon commission activities investigating the Bush administration and utilizing the talents of esteemed figures on both sides of the political isle. If this was in any way a politically motivated deletion, I would hope that the educational priorities of this wikipedia endeavor would trump any personal ideals. Otherwise, there is no reason for the deletion of the page, which again is directly maintained by the American Bar Association.</p>
<p>Please reinstate this page as soon as possible. Your cooperation is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Sincerely, J. Nichols.</p>
<p>So, what to do? I replied and told them that the page was deleted because it was GFDL incompatable due to lack of attribution. I did not mention the Username issue nor the conflict of interest issue, I'll leave that to someone else.

<dd>Also, are you sure that the e-mail is legitimately from Jonathan Nichols and that he is who he says he is?

<dd>Jon, may I point out that his editor is not a vandal, but a <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisruptive_editing_02a2.html" title="Wikipedia:Disruptive editing">tendentious editor</a>. Although it may appear that I am splitting hairs (because we do not want editors from either category), down the road it will be important. If this editor does <i>not</i> change his ways &amp; is indefinitely blocked, we'd look foolish <s>if</s> when he complains that we labelled his edits as vandalism &amp; argued that we didn't respect his POV. (All of the worst pains-in-the-behind do this.) If we say that this is a single-purpose account &amp; that he has refused to engage you in conversation, so we had no option except to block him, then he looks foolish. ("I was blocked on Wikipedia.

<dd>Okay guys, the username is <b>not</b> offensive. If you want to indefinitely block someone over a single case of vandalism, then I can't stop you (even though it's grossly inconsistent with typical practices), but autocockers (or cockers) are extremely well-known in paintball. I can see the logic in <i>asking</i> about it. Blocking based on it was incredibly premature and inappropriate. And using it in <i>any</i> capacity to decide whether or not to unblock is just plain wrong. If you think that indefinite blocks based on a single act of vandalism are very typical and normal, then so be it. But, if not, then you really need to lift the block. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBladestorm_00c0.html" title="User:Bladestorm">Bladestorm</a> 16:49, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have completely re-written the article in question, which was woefully in need of improvement anyway, and added a BLP tag (which it lacked before).</p>
<p>Just thought you should know, given the recent unfavorable publicity Wikipedia has had over similar instances.

<p>Can somebody have a look at <a href="../../../d/e/u/User%7EDeucalionite_118b.html" title="User:Deucalionite">Deucalionite</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/u/User_talk%7EDeucalionite_85cb.html" title="User talk:Deucalionite">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Deucalionite_75f8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Deucalionite">contribs</a>) and take action if deemed necessary? Deucalionite seems to conceive of his activities on Wikipedia as some kind of breaching experiment, as stated now on his userpage: <i>"any questionable/dubious statements or actions on my part are solely for social experimentation purposes (i.e. studying various user-to-user behavior dynamics, facets of the inhibition effect, HCI dynamics, etc.)"</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Deucalionite&amp;diff=118825040&amp;oldid=118798156" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Deucalionite&amp;diff=118825040&amp;oldid=118798156" rel="nofollow">[79]</a>). He has made similar claims before: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Deucalionite&amp;diff=75535365&amp;oldid=75533629" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Deucalionite&amp;diff=75535365&amp;oldid=75533629" rel="nofollow">[80]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Deucalionite&amp;diff=75556457&amp;oldid=75552962" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Deucalionite&amp;diff=75556457&amp;oldid=75552962" rel="nofollow">[81]</a>. Exactly what kinds of disruptive behaviour he is envisaging is not clear at this point - he's in fact been relatively well-behaved recently. Back when he made those earlier rants it was when he had been caught red-handed at plagiarism and copyright violations.

<p>I've had rather painful dealings with Deucalionite about similar issues and he's not been on speaking terms with me since then, so I'd rather not be the one to approach him this time if it can be avoided.</p>

<dd>Well, I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that there is no way I am going to be the one to check users' editcounts, delete the page, and probably have to deal with the user's injured feelings afterwards, and/or someone having their page deleted, then making enough edits to go over the 100 barrier and asking to have it back again (possibly making obviously useless edits purely for that end). In fact in writing this I've worked myself up to the point where I almost think this close should be reviewed, it being horribly against the goals of our project to say that once you've made an arbitrary number of edits to articlespace, you can have a certain type of page which has absolutely nothing to do with the encyclopaedia as a reward. Thing is, I don't really care. Oh, what the hell, I'll go and open it now before anyone goes and creates a shitstorm over these stupid things. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 00:06, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think it will suffice if you put a clear statement on your userpage that you have not edited under other accounts (or, if you have, not abusively, and that you are not Aucaman), and require of your accusers that they come up front with their allegations instead of conspiring behind your back.

<dd>Posting private emails is totally innapropriate, incredibly bad netiquette. Let me state for the record that as I am looking into User:Aucaman's edits, I am starting to get convinced that User:The Behnam is indeed User:Aucaman who is apprently banned from editing Iran-related article by the decision of ArbCom. There is a lot of evidnce that would suuport this assertion, for example I was looking at User:Aucaman's talk page today, and I saw a message invinting him to vote on an AfD <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Aucaman&amp;diff=116984711&amp;oldid=106947784" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Aucaman&amp;diff=116984711&amp;oldid=106947784" rel="nofollow">[98]</a>, then a just few hours after that message User:The Behnam shows up on the same AfD to cast his vote <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Enemy_of_Islam&amp;diff=117045724&amp;oldid=116993570" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Enemy_of_Islam&amp;diff=117045724&amp;oldid=116993570" rel="nofollow">[99]</a>. This was eight days ago, before User:The Behnam knew that anyone suspceted him of being User:Aucaman. Conindece? Could be, but there there is just too many such coincidences to be just coincidences. User:The Behnam is acknowledging that himself. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMardavich_3f4a.html" title="User:Mardavich">Mardavich</a> 12:06, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>I've seen more evidence, and there is a lot of similarity in POV and editing pattern between these two users, on the same articles, sometimes the same section of the same articles.

<p>When there is an editing war, I thought administrators are supposed to be neutral parties, or help with straw polls etc. That was true for months on the "breast implant" page, with a plastic surgeon making revisions to emphasize the benefits of breast implants, and several other editors (an epidemiologist, a doctor, and an editor of a women's health book, among others) making footnoted revisions to point out known risks, etc. Currently, an admin, JFW -- also known as JWolff, is taking the side of the plastic surgeon (droliver) and reverting everything that the other 3 editors (DrCarter, OBOS editor, and DrZuckerman) change, whether one paragraph or 20 paragraphs. We've tried voting on one paragraph at a time, but droliver always objects and changes it back to his preferred version, and the administrator has taken droliver's side and also reverts it back. Two other admin used to help but are no longer available. Even direct quotes from peer-reviewed scientific articles have been deleted if they indicate risks from implants. Can someone else help with this? As the author of 4 books and dozens of peer reviewed articles, I am accustomed to dealing with differences of opinions, but usually knowledge and information have some impact. I think it should on wikipedia too, shouldn't it? Drzuckerman 12:01, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>No comment on the specific dispute, but admins are allowed to have opinions and act on them, so sometimes they are going to get into content disputes. They just can not use admin powers (such as blocking, page protection, etc.) to gain any advantage in said dispute.

<p>there's been a terrible accident in sydney, killing several people, and one girl Morgan Innes is still missing, and unfortunately maybe also dead.
