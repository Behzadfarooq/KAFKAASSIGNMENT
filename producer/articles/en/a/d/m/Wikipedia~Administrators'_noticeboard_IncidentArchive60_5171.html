<dd>Hmm... I count about 10-20 good edits to articles other than conspiracy theory, 9/11, American terrorism, and related talk pages. I wasn't going in to look at all of those since the idea of POV there is too great to make any sense in a short check like that. Hmmm... an idea.

<dd>Where are they..? I'm sure there must be a few good edits in amongst the user's total edit count of 579, but I don't see any off hand. The proportions have some interest in themselves: only 119 of them are to article space, 123 to user talk alone. What stood out for me were PM's recent exchanges with two notably unflappable and polite editors, <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a>, on non-existent or nonsense issues, seemingly purely with the goal of somehow, by hook or by crook, needling those users into annoyance. (Unsuccessfully; well done, guys.) A <i>lot</i> of good-faith assumption has already been spent on this user, and has fallen on stony ground. I'm thinking RFAR rather than RFC, sooner rather than later, though perhaps not quite yet. Meanwhile, I advise only the coolest, most laid-back of us to try any interaction (me, I would be the very last).

<p>In my interpretation Peter has been a very worthwhile contributor to wikipedia. Peter fundamentally grasps the concepts of true consensus and collaborative editing and I have a learned a lot from his <a href="../../../0/r/r/WP%7E0RR_694b.html" title="WP:0RR">WP:0RR</a> guideline. I can give Carbonite the benefit of the doubt if he claims otherwise but I think it was reasonable for Peter to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Zero-revert_rule&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=32134396" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Zero-revert_rule&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=32134396" rel="nofollow">conclude</a> Carbonite was trying to damage the acceptance of <a href="../../../0/r/r/WP%7E0RR_694b.html" title="WP:0RR">WP:0RR</a>, first by moving it to Peter's userspace over a header dispute, then after that mistake was corrected and the guideline was moved back, Carbonite proposed a merge of it to a fundmanetally different and perhaps less effective guideline. However, Carbonite continues to maintain the two guidelines are similar which apparently is easy to do as he fails to even acknowledge the evidence to the contrary. I ask all of Peter's detractors to please assure me they are not attempting to stack the deck against him to ease future discrediting of <a href="../../../0/r/r/WP%7E0RR_694b.html" title="WP:0RR">WP:0RR</a> or any other guideline or proposal he might have? Please give Peter the benefit of the doubt and avoid statements such as the above "batshit crazy troll" that are out of line for an admin and portray him and his contributions way too negatively.

<dd>I have a tendency to disagree with Zen-master&#160;;-) , but here I fully agree. I also appreciate Carbonite's openly stated attempt to group all &lt;3RR on one page, but I can understand disagreement about it and coming from the 0RR page his actions may look a bit self serving and lacking openness. Apart of that, for an as yet unidentified reason some administrators seem not to understand Peter (see also the discussion with Voldemort on my talk page <a href="../../../h/a/r/User_talk%7EHarald88_9e75.html#A_.26_B.27s_discussion_and_Wikipedia_management" title="User talk:Harald88">User_talk:Harald88#A &amp; B's discussion and Wikipedia management</a>)... perhaps Texans and Dutch speak the same language? (I'm Dutch). Also, most of his edits and proposals that I saw on Conspiracy Theory were definitely good, helping to move in the direction of similar but already featured articles.

<dd>What you have above is all about "portrayal", you aren't letting the evidence speak for itself. Creating a small list of "productive" edits by an editor already labeled negatively can have the effect of getting people to further unquestioningly accept your negative portrayal -- though I can give you the benefit of the doubt if you assure me that isn't your intention. Regardless, please let the evidence speak for itself and refrain from excessive or multi-layered portrayals. In my interpretation Peter's response to Carbonite's actions was completely reasonable (I give the benefit of the doubt to both parties, miscommunication and misunderstanding can happen). Please simply list any other edits of Peter's you interpret to violate any wikipedia policy, and how? <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 22:13, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You did/do seem to support the notion Peter has only made "some" or a "few" good edits? That is a negative portrayal and I believe it is completely inaccurate. Perhaps Bishonen and David Gerard are the ones that may have portrayed PM excessively negatively, perhaps inadvertently. Please give me the benefit of the doubt, I interpret the possibility of a hastily made portrayal being excessively negative, perhaps inadvertently, and perhaps even within the motivation of finding "some good" edits. Focusing on some "good edits" of an already negatively portrayed editor can have the effect of switching around the burden of proof, which would be wrong and seems to have almost happened in this case. The actual burden of proof is on PM's detractors to give evidence of any violations, right? <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 22:45, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I am trying to help Peter, and you are fighting me on it. Why? There are people looking to ban him indefinitely, and I am trying to persuade them to be nice and give him a shot. Did you even read my first comment in this section? I was trying to act in PM's defense. Yet you have already prejudged me as being anti-Peter.

<dd>I understand you claim you want to "help" Peter and I can give you the benefit of the doubt. However, what I am telling you is your "help" or someone else's question that you responded to actually has had the effect of an excessive and very unfairly negative portrayal of Peter. The notion that Peter has only made a few good edits is completely inaccurate and taints a fair consideration. What further concerns me is now you seem to be hinting that Peter should be banned for good, that is also completely incorrect. Where did you get the notion Peter should be "blocked indefinitely" from, it seems you are definitely against him now? This page only contains a negative fluff portrayal of Peter, the only evidence presented here involves Peter's supposed "name calling". However, in my interpretation Peter's comparison of Carbonite to a troll made sense given the abusive and stifling actions Carbonite committed, though I give both parties the benefit of the doubt that tensions flare and mistakes happen. But it is starting to seem reasonable a small group of editors are systematically trying to portray Peter negatively because they really don't like his <a href="../../../0/r/r/WP%7E0RR_694b.html" title="WP:0RR">WP:0RR</a> or other posts for some fundamental reason. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 18:11, 22 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>Responding to Lord Voldemort, you seem to have accepted as a given that Peter should be "blocked indefinitely" and I think that is a completely inaccurate portrayal given the evidence presented. You say "there are people looking to ban him indefinitely" but where did anyone directly state that (innuendo doesn't count)? I am not "faulting" you for anything as I can give you the benefit of the doubt, I am merely only pointing out what you claim to be "help" has actually had the effect of an excessively negative and unfair portrayal. It is true that it was David Gerard not you that was the one who asked the leading question above: "By the way, has Mr McConaughey made any good edits at all, anywhere?" which should be obvious to see was meant prejudicially, perhaps inadvertently, as David's preceeding sentence contains the phrase "batshit crazy troll"... <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 19:43, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So apparently the answer is no, you haven't been reading what I've been writing? <b>Let me say this one last time, as clear as possible...</b> I was trying to help <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_McConaughey_8eba.html" title="User:Peter McConaughey">User:Peter McConaughey</a> from being indefinitely banned, by showing that he has made useful edits, and is not just a "batshit crazy troll". There are people looking to ban him indefinitely (You asked for evidence, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard%2FIncidents&amp;diff=32235430&amp;oldid=32235405" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard%2FIncidents&amp;diff=32235430&amp;oldid=32235405" rel="nofollow">here's your diff</a>), and I was trying to stop them by showing PM has been useful. And in fact, I wasn't even responding to David Gerard's question, I was responding to Bishonen's question and comment, "<i>Where are they..? I'm sure there must be a few good edits in amongst the user's total edit count of 579, but I don't see any off hand.</i>" If you continue to assert that I am against Peter, which I never have been (show me the diffs for evidence of me being anything other than civil or helpful towards Peter), I will not discuss this matter with you further. Your continued lack of good faith on my part leads me to believe that you just want to argue, and don't care what has actually been written. <b>Please, before you respond, make sure you read this entire comment.</b> Thank you, my friend. --<a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Voldemort_ca3f.html" title="User:Lord Voldemort"><font color="purple">LV</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../l/o/r/User_talk%7ELord_Voldemort_cf5f.html" title="User talk:Lord Voldemort"><font color="#3D9140">(Dark Mark)</font></a></sup> 19:57, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've always given you the benefit of the doubt that you are not directly against Peter, but I separately can't ignore the overall excessively negative and unfair portrayal on this page. Your citation of David Gerard's suggestion of blocking Peter indefinitely is precisely my other point, where has David or anyone actually presented actual evidence and made a case against Peter (again innuendo doesn't count)? It seems you've been following all the various Peter sections on this page quite closely? The Carbonite "troll" comment is small potatoes and was reasonable given Carbonite's actions that were interpreted as being stifling and I've seen no evidence of Peter "wikistaling" him, if anything an opposite case could be made. The entire concept of "search for any good edits" by a negatively portrayed user further stacks the deck against them, perhaps you have inadvertantly fallen victim to that, though I can also give David Gerard the benefit of the doubt as cases and arguments made hastily can have, perhaps inadvertent, prejudicial results. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 20:49, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps what you claim is my "not listening" to you is instead us simply disagreeing over whether looking for "good" edits is actually "helpful" or not in this case? I maintain that seeking "good" edits has the perhaps inadvertent effect of unfairly reinforcing a negative portrayal and characterization. I bring Carbonite up because the supposed "personal attack" by Peter against him is the only actual "evidence" on this page, but as I explained above I think that was completely understandable given the situation. What else, if anything, makes you think the case against Peter is so strong that redeeming edits must be found to "save" him? I do take issue with David Gerard's apparently hastily made portrayal that also lacks evidence, but I can give him the benefit of the doubt and need not follow it up with him if he refrains from repeating the same, perhaps inadvertent, mistake. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 21:58, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So you unquestioningly accepted David Gerard at his word that the case against Peter was so strong that redeeming edits must be found to save him, and, you dutifully took it upon yourself to spend a significant amount of time searching for only that without considering the possibility there is no case, and, you have repeatedly made a point of insisting: 1) you have nothing to do with Carbonite, 2) or David Gerard, 3) and you are not duplicitously against Peter? Ok, I can still give you the benefit of the doubt. Going forward, if you really want to "save" Peter, as you claim, then be aware that focusing on "redeeming" edits to "save" him can, perhaps inadvertently, reinforce an unfairly negative portrayal, which is exactly what almost happened in this case in my interpretation. The case against Peter is actually slim to none, no where near having to search for redeeming edits to "save" him. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 22:55, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I noticed this discussion after a few repeated instances of nonsense from this user on the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Islamic_Front_84ce.html" title="World Islamic Front">World Islamic Front</a> discussion page. The nonsense is accompanied with a supposedly authoritative <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Organization_layout.gif" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Organization_layout.gif" rel="nofollow">chart</a> that he only later in the discussion admitted was of his own creation. I haven't looked at his other edits but my sense on this page is that he is, as another editor noted above, needling people to try to pick fights over non-issues.

This all started when he insisted on the existence of an "International Front for Jihad against Zionists and Crusaders" that is different from the "World Islamic Front for Jihad against Jews and Crusaders," or "World Islamic Front," i.e. al-Qaeda. Peter, or Zeph, argues that there is a larger group with the former title that is different from the group with the latter title (somehow the Arabic words for the two different fronts are exactly the same, but he assures us that they should be translated differently in context). He then created a chart - gif linked above - to justify this bizarre interpretation, making the further bizarre and nonsensical claim that there are Jews and Christians who are part of the "International Front...." He continues to play bizarre semantic games like this.

<dd>LOL, it's a call for harmony, yes, but the question is who are the Muslims and Jews? I believe he refers to myself and Random Element, neither of whom identified ourselves in terms of religious affiliation in this discussion. I believe he refers to a previous discussion between myself and Mr. Stark and I believe the only reason to call attention to our religious affiliation is to be incendiary. I think it's interesting that you ignore most of my specific examples above and simply focus on this one -- his link to the graphic and his arguments on that page are literally nonsensical. They do not make sense. I've explained this above. Finally, his comments about my sex life, on an issue totally unrelated, is reminiscent of Mr. Stark. Ah well, I guess if there were no Zephram Stark, someone had to (re)invent him....--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 01:18, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps Peter is referring to Muslims and Jews getting along generally? I interpreted his "sex life" comment to be hyperbole, as in "why do you keep insinuating Peter is someone else, you must care a great deal and/or miss who ever 'Zeph' is"? Peter's chart conveys the fact, that many people in the West are perhaps unaware of, that many Jews and Christians are actually against Zionism for various reasons, he estimates 35-40% of Jews for example. I do think Peter's chart is a tad misleading in that anyone not against Zionism isn't necessarily for it. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 02:12, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I appreciate your generous readings of his posts, but you misunderstand my comments. His "Jews and Muslims" comment clearly referred to the "edit war" he was directly commenting on in that edit summary; not some abstract sentiment about Middle East peace prospects. My point is not that I am offended by these comments; I'm not; my point is that they are distressingly similar to the kinds of comments made by a known sock puppeteer who stopped posting right before Peter McC started editing wikipedia, coincidentally the same articles, picking fights with the same people that Zephram was in fights with. I'm commenting on a very similar writing style. I think it is very appropriate for such a user to be watched carefully.</dd>
<dd>As for Peter's chart, "a tad misleading" is a ludicrous understatement. The chart was first presented as some kind of authoritative map of an organized "Front" that he claimed actually existed. He later admitted he made up the chart but he continued to defend the nonsensical claim that such a Front existed. The chart does not convey the fact that some Jews and Christians oppose zionism; it conveys the false claim that there is a significant number of Jews and Christians who have declared "jihad" against it. That claim is utter nonsense.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 03:21, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Peter's point is simple really, many have proposed and perpetuated an "us" vs "them" mentality, and using that "logic", anyone that is against Zionism, to any degree, can be labeled a "jihadist", even 35-40% of Jews and Christians. Peter's chart exists to show the illogic of binary thinking. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 05:44, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That makes a lot of sense... if you're drunk. Seriously, that has nothing to do with anything he said or anything he was arguing against. I'm sure he can explain this better himself, but your claim about us v. them, which I agree with, has <b>nothing</b> to do with the discussion on that page. Peter was claiming that there was an actual group identifying itself as the IFJAZC (he actually called it that at one point) that encompassed non-Zionist Jews and Christians -- a claim that is demonstrably false. You are doing mental gymnastics to defend his position as a "simple point" about either/or thinking.

<p>Then why did Peter include George Bush's statement that frames the world in "no neutral ground" and "good vs evil" terms if he wasn't trying to make a point about the problem known as tunnel vision or binary thinking? This binary thinking, that Bush perpetuated, had allowed the real powers that be to hide the existence of attrocities and war crimes from us the people, but not any longer. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 20:19, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>WTF? Why are you trying to bait me? I agree with you about Bush, about binary thinking, and about war crimes, but that has <b>nothing</b> to do with this dispute! The problem is not that Peter is against binary thought but that he is <b>making shit up</b>. Which would not be so bad if he wasn't insisting it be on wikipedia! Do you really think wikipedia should start listing organizations that don't exist as legitimate organizations in order to score points against binary thinking?? Why are you doing back flips trying to defend this behavior?--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 21:29, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Peter is "making shit up" as you say to show the eventual result of binary thinking. I believe Peter created the image to show that the World Islamic Front and al-Qaeda are not the same thing. What specifically is he insisting must be in the wikipedia article that you believe is made up? I don't think Peter is saying an "organization" exists but it is a de facto coalition of anyone that is to even the slightest degree against "Zionists and Crusaders". It might be easier if you simply asked Peter for clarification. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 06:37, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In my case, I wasn't one of the people who did or said anything nasty to you in the first place; I'm just an outsider who stumbled on all of this arugment here, and added my own comments. I'm not the one you have a beef against. Anyway, you'll get much kinder treatment if you don't keep cursing and screaming, like you're still doing (with comments like "Why the hell..."). Given that some of your edits were vandalism, it's understandable that people weren't completely nice to you, but it's still possible to put it in the past by being cooperative and constructive, and not "hazing" the "oldbies" back. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan T.*</a> 19:01, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm reading this and I'm like WTF. In my humble opinion, you're overreacting. But if you really want to know why it was protected, this is probably why. First edit, you vandalize Jimmy Wales. This does not give a very good impression. Editors here are very intolerant of vandals, and even less so of vandals that accuse editors of "hazing".</dd>
<dd>Fortunantely, you are not a common vandal, and you engage in discourse with other editors, particularly FireFox and Titoxd. First you go "What?" to Titoxd, and he points out your vandalous edit. Then you reply:
<dl>
<dd><i>Calling it as I see it boss, sorry if your kilt is all messed up. I'll cease. I thought Wiki was open for any edits.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>If I had been dealing with you, I would not have recieved a very favorable impression of this anonymous editor. Unfortantely, Titoxd didn't respond to your "smart" comment, but here is what the reply probably would have said.
<dl>
<dd><i>The wiki is not open for any edits. We are here to make an encyclopedia, and the wiki is a means to that end. Vandalism is unacceptable. Don't do it again.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Now, from the following discourses, I can see where you got the impression that these people were <i>hazing</i> you. FireFox gives you another warning for the same infraction Titoxd had given you. It seems that they considered the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jimmy_Wales&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=32144192" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jimmy_Wales&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=32144192" rel="nofollow">infraction</a> quite serious. You engage with a talk with FireFox, and the conversation goes like this:
<dl>
<dd><i>Yeah so someone already told this to me... I'm just a dumb slashdotter trying out the Wikipedia. Didn't realize it was so territorial what with y'all peeing all over my carpet. Don't get your skirt out of whack, settle down, have a beer. We're just here from Slashdot to look around. Judging by the number of hilarious edits on the page in question... I'd say my comment ain't far off the mark.</i></dd>
<dd><i>What does rvs mean?</i>
<dl>
<dd><i>RVS is Revert S.... The S is whatever you want it to be.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd><i>How am I supposed to learn the ropes of Wikipedia if you won't even talk to me? Is this community really this unfriendly? I'm trying to open a dialog and you're just ignoring me... thats pretty rude.</i>
<dl>
<dd><i>Yes</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>FireFox is somewhat exasperated by your flippant attitude and your accusatory manner.</dd>
<dd>The next edit you make is not much better. It's an addition of "It is quite possible people are seeking to vandalize it. Be aware and prepared to respond. Only you can help prevent vandalism!'" to {{<a href="../../../h/i/g/Template%7EHigh-traffic_8aaf.html" title="Template:High-traffic">High-traffic</a>}}. Curps reverts you, and you respond, in accord to your previous attitude and demeanor:
<dl>
<dd><i>I come bearing edits yet you rebuke me and disregard them like I was a can of spam on a grocery shelf with a $99 price tag. What wantest thou from us, the lowly unwashed slashdotters. Tell us Great Pooba! Tell us that our edits might please thee!</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Curps responds in a meaningful manner:
<dl>
<dd><i>As discussed on my talk page, your edit to <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Wales_abf5.html" title="Jimmy Wales">Jimmy Wales</a> was clearcut vandalism as you have admitted, and likely not your first vandalism of Wikipedia. It was reasonable to interpret your further edits as vandalism and revert accordingly. Be aware of the <a href="../../../t/h/r/Wikipedia%7EThree_revert_rule_7218.html" title="Wikipedia:Three revert rule">Wikipedia:Three revert rule</a> in the future and seek discussion and consensus if you wish to modify a commonly-used template.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>And you respond:
<dl>
<dd><i>:"Likely not my first vandalism of Wikipedia"? Where does this come from? There is no logic behind this line of reasoning. I just started editing today and you're all peeing on my carpet. It was not reasonable to interpret my further edits as vandalism. I specifically asked for pointers from those doing the reverting. Guess what? Y'all fucking ignored me. So I did what was reasonable, I tried again using different language. In the absence of helpful comments from y'all how else am I supposed to get it right. Y'all should be blocked for bad stewardship and negative attitudes. What the heck is this? A members only club? You guys treat n00bs worse than Slashdot does, and y'all should be blocked for failure to help out the new guy.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>And add:
<dl>
<dd><i>BTW, what are you, some European facist scum? This is America. Guilty until proven innocent, trial by jury of your peers.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Which you promptly revert. There are more responses:
<dl>
<dd><i>Referring to Wikipedia newcomers as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:High-traffic&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=32166586" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:High-traffic&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=32166586" rel="nofollow">n00bs</a> on a template which is visible from dozens of pages was reason enough for the 3 hour block, especially considering this was your</i> fifth <i>attempt to deface this template with "Leet" style nonsense. Under most conditions this would have earned you a 24-hour block, but since I saw some of your other edits were done in good faith, I chose a shorter block. Please keep in mind that this is not an online gaming chat board; terms like "n00b" and "0wn3d" are not welcome here, and trying to add them to official templates is clear vandalism.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>You revert war on {{<a href="../../../h/i/g/Template%7EHigh-traffic_8aaf.html" title="Template:High-traffic">High-traffic</a>}} several times, and at this point, all your good faith has been used up (as noted in the above comment).</dd>
<dd>Your edits continue, with several dubious edits that could have been construed as good faith if it hadn't been for previous vandalism, and some more clearcut vandalism to other users. You have a revert war on your own talk page, and eventually the admins get fed up and block the page.</dd>
<dd>Here is my verdict after this investigation: you are a Slashdot user that decided it would be funny to vandalize a Wikipedia change. When various other users reacted and told you to stop vandalizing, your attitude and flippant remarks prevented them from fully appreciating the "I'll cease." You offered early on.</dd>
<dd>You then went on to make some controversial edits (which could have been good or bad), and got reverted again, and by then, everyone was convinced you were a hard vandal. Then you got into an edit war on your talk page.</dd>
<dd>I have attempted to present the dialogues that led to these "injustices" in a neutral manner, and have come to the conclusion that if you had acted a little more humbly and a little less "smart-aleck," these people would have been more willing to help you "learn the ropes." Instead, you blew it with immediately controversial edits. Feel free to get a user account and <i>seriously</i> contribute to Wikipedia, but please don't disrupt Wikipedia to make a point. — <span style="font-variant:small-caps;font-family:sans-serif;"><a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbush_Commander_08e2.html" title="User:Ambush Commander">Ambush Commander</a></span><sup style="font-family:serif;">(<a href="../../../a/m/b/User_talk%7EAmbush_Commander_60e0.html" title="User talk:Ambush Commander">Talk</a>)</sup> 20:11, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Done. I agree fair use tag is reasonable.

<ul>
<li>Yes, however fair use only allows direct use on articles and even then only on certain articles that directly pertain to the topic. Unless Mozilla Foundation is willing to license the image under a compatible license or release it into the public domain our image guidelines state that we cannot even upload the images except in this case as fair use for articles. <small><a href="../../../j/t/k/User%7EJtkiefer_5ea4.html" title="User:Jtkiefer"><font color="red">Jtkiefer</font></a><sup><a href="../../../j/t/k/User_talk%7EJtkiefer_123b.html" title="User talk:Jtkiefer"><font color="orange">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jtkiefer_4fd4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jtkiefer"><font color="green">C</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jtkiefer_1273.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jtkiefer"><font color="blue">@</font></a></sup></small> ---- 19:38, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>The policies make good sense, in the sense that we can use fairuse images on articles directly pertaining to the organization of the image but fairuse doesn't stretch any farther than that and userboxes are way beyond the scope of fairuse in the conventional sense. <small><a href="../../../j/t/k/User%7EJtkiefer_5ea4.html" title="User:Jtkiefer"><font color="red">Jtkiefer</font></a><sup><a href="../../../j/t/k/User_talk%7EJtkiefer_123b.html" title="User talk:Jtkiefer"><font color="orange">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jtkiefer_4fd4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jtkiefer"><font color="green">C</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jtkiefer_1273.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jtkiefer"><font color="blue">@</font></a></sup></small> ---- 19:42, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Just for reference, here is Mozilla's (Firefox's owner) official logo policy. "You may make t-shirts, desktop wallpaper, or baseball caps with Mozilla logos on them, though only for yourself and your friends (meaning people from whom you don't receive anything of value in return). You can't put the Mozilla logo on anything that you produce commercially -- at least not without receiving Mozilla's permission. Of course, Mozilla owns and operates the Mozilla Store, which sells a wide range of CDs, Guidebooks, T-shirts, and products with Mozilla software and logos. That's how we make some of the money that keeps us around.There are two additional broad categories of things you can't do with Mozilla's logos. The first is to produce modified versions of them. A modified logo also would raise the possibility of consumer confusion, thus violating Mozilla's trademarks rights, too (remember the overarching requirement that any use of a Mozilla trademark be non-confusing?). The second concerns high-resolution copies of Mozilla logos, which you cannot have or use. If you've a very good reason to seek an exception to the rule against having and using high-resolution copies of Mozilla logos please contact the Trademark and Licensing Team."<a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 19:44, 29 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As you can see a userbox logo does not violate their logo policy and shouldn't violate ours either in this case as a low resolution image may be used for ANY non commercial purpose.<a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 19:45, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The issue never was and never will be Mozilla policy, the issue is that even though they give up certain uses they aren't licensing it in a way we can use except for fair use which allows certain rights. If you want to change the way they license their images feel free to ask them to release it into the public domain but I doubt they'll say yes. <small><a href="../../../j/t/k/User%7EJtkiefer_5ea4.html" title="User:Jtkiefer"><font color="red">Jtkiefer</font></a><sup><a href="../../../j/t/k/User_talk%7EJtkiefer_123b.html" title="User talk:Jtkiefer"><font color="orange">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jtkiefer_4fd4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jtkiefer"><font color="green">C</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jtkiefer_1273.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jtkiefer"><font color="blue">@</font></a></sup></small> ---- 19:46, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Also if this is the case perhaps a new licensing option is in order as fairuse is overly contrictive in this case if we are to follow your interpretation of it.<a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 19:50, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Gateman, what Jtkiefer is trying to get that while the Firefox logo has been granted, by them, for use on our website, we still need to realize that their logo is their logo and they still have some rights for it. And, since it is a logo, it falls under the fair use rules that we have at <a href="../../../f/u/c/WP%7EFUC_7b76.html" title="WP:FUC">WP:FUC</a>. And, one of the fair use rules for images that was created was that fair use logos, icons or photos of anykind should not be used in templates and should not be used anywhere outside of the article space. While I think that the Firefox guys are glad that we love and support their browser, do understand that we are serious about copyright violations and try to follow and understand them next time. While this is not related to you Gateman, if you think other templates are violating the fair use rules, just change the icon and null edit every user page that you can. That will be a whole lot easier. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zach</a> <sup><a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Smack Back)</a></sup> 19:57, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The problem is that licensing Wikipedia content as "non-commercial" produces a surprising amount of problems - it means, essentially, that producing hard-copy versions (a massive success story for de.wikipedia) becomes financially impossible.

<li>Back to the heart of this however. I would like to point out that <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAIR_1f27.html" title="WP:FAIR">WP:FAIR</a> is only a guideline... not policy. I think there needs to be alot more discussion before any users go around deleting images from users pages simply because that is their interpretation of a guideline or until it becomes policy.<a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 01:03, 30 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>While this is not policy, per say, if you scroll down, there is a list of agreed upon uses that are acceptable for FU images. This is what I have been pointing to this day: "Fair use images should only be used in the article namespace. They should never be used on templates (including stub templates and navigation boxes) or on user pages. They should be linked, not inlined, from talk pages when they are the topic of discussion. This is because it is the policy of the Wikimedia Foundation to allow an unfree image only if no free alternative exists and only if it significantly improves the article it is included on. All other uses, even if legal under the fair use clauses of copyright law, should be avoided to keep the use of unfree images to a minimum. Exceptions can be made on a case-by-case basis if there is a broad consensus that doing so is necessary to the goal of creating a free encyclopedia (like the templates used as part of the Main Page)." So, all we want to do is limit the amount of FU images, and also limit on how they are used. If the picture is used for an article, fine, but if the FU, all it's doing is decorating a user page, has no need to be on Wikipedia servers. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zach</a> <sup><a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Smack Back)</a></sup> 01:13, 30 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>No, that's fair because it relates to the article. Back on topic: even if it is guideline (<i>not policy!</i>) says that use outside of the encyclopediac (sp?) context is illegal, that gives you <i><b>no right to abruptly change dozens of userpages without warning</b></i>. This admin has abused his powers, if even with the right intentions, and should be blocked for some period of time. If you are going to make abrupt changes like this, tell us first. give us time to change it. And <i>allow the average user to participate in interpreting the policy</i>. This user broke <a href="../../../f/i/v/Wikipedia%7EFive_pillars_e0d5.html" title="Wikipedia:Five pillars">pillar</a> four (writer's rules of engagement) and five (no other firm rules) in pursuit of a nuance of pillar three (free content). Let's talk this over, not go about changing hundreds of pages without warning. Also:I don't know who deleted Image:MozillaFirefoxLogo.png, but somehow it is no longer part of the wiki. We have to go to Mozilla for this one; my copy has some sort of copy protection that keeps me from getting a good quality image. Even it was being (ab)used in userpages, <i>there was no reason to irreversibly get rid of an image that could be used for encyclopediac purposes</i>.

<ul>
<li>I have to admit that is part of what is rubbing me the wrong way about this. Not only the questionable interpretation of policy but the unilateral action being taken by one or two users over a broad spectrum of pages, user or otherwise.<a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 04:03, 30 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>When legal concerns are involved, that is necessary and appropriate. For what it's worth, I agree with Jtkiefer's analysis of the relevant laws/policies, and oppose the proposed changing of the rules to allow this. Fair use is one of those things we need to be especially careful with, and this falls outside the bounds. We cannot use special-use licenses that the mozilla foundation would grant us because they would not transfer to (possibly commercial) project mirrors. Fair use is the only acceptable use of the relevant logo, and use on userpages falls outside that scope. There's no way around that, and if this argument holds, it is necessary to remove the image from user pages for legal/policy reasons, regardless of how many users would like otherwise. --<a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImprov_b282.html" title="User:Improv">Improv</a> 06:47, 30 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, true. But if this has to be enforced, give us a deadline to find or create new images to replace the fair use ones. To go around and delete images off hundreds of community pages is simply unacceptable. It's a violation of the trust that outside of typos userpages are the domain of the user. About the Firefox logo: wouldn't that be promoting firefox on the mirrors and thus acceptable? Regardless, I propose, as mentioned above, a <b>deadline that is not immediate</b> for the users to remove fair use images from their own pages and find substitues. Before hat happens, I also suggest that <b>the entire community take part in this discussion</b> to increase awareness of this major change and also give people a chance to fight it. Even if they (i.e. we) wind up losing, they'll (we'll) be much happier about it if they know why they have to change and have time to do it.--<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHereToHelp_1de7.html" title="User:HereToHelp">HereToHelp</a> (<a href="../../../h/e/r/User_talk%7EHereToHelp_c207.html" title="User talk:HereToHelp">talk</a>) 13:31, 30 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If it is illegal or against policy, it would be inappropriate to give a deadline (especially in the illegal case). Userpages are generally considered domain of the user, but illegal things and things against policy are and always will be candidates for removal, without necessarily warnings or the like. The "entire community" cannot decide to ignore the law -- <b>that</b> is not open for debate.

<li>Re: Project mirrors... I'm sorry if I'm missing something, but how are copyright violations on mirrored pages a Wikipedia problem? If the images can be used fairly in the user namespace at en.wikipedia.org, but not at mirrored sites such as answers.com, why should that effect what the user namespace can do? It seems to me if the copyright holder wanted to sue someone, they would have to go after the servers that are using the content illegally, not Wikipedia. Is this interpretation wrong?

<p>I seriously don't get why being eable to use unfree images on theyr userpage is such a huge deal to some people. This project is about creating a freely redistributable free licensed ensyclopedia. In exactly what way does allowing people to stuff theyr userpage full of unfree images benefit that goal? Use of unfree images should be kept to a minimum, and all recent policy changes with regards to images are moving in that direction, first getting rid of non-commercial and used with permission only images, then trying to get to grips with the mountain of untagged and unsourced images, and lastly putting the tourch to all fair use images that are not used in articles. Suddely allowing fair use on userpages just to acomodate users who would like to promote theyr favourite organisations and corporations seems like an odd direction to take the policy considering all the efforts that have been made so far to reduce our use of such images. If there is one place we defenently don't <i>need</i> to use unfree images it's on userpages. If the price for keeping the use of copyrighted material to a minimum is that a couple hundred users have to do without the logos of theyr favourite "causes" on theyr userpage then that's hardly a national tradegy. It doesn't limit theyr ability to anounce theyr POV to all who care to look, and it doesn't limit theyr abilities to participate in the comunity or contribute to the project, so I'm sure they will surive. Many of the other language Wikipedias get by just fine without allowing fair use at all after all. Remember we primarily here to make an esyclopedia, not promote web-browsers or political parties, that stuff is strictly secondary, so I see no reason to reshape copyright policy around what people would like to be eable to do on theyr userpage.&lt;/rant&gt; --<a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESherool_fe99.html" title="User:Sherool">Sherool</a> <span style="font-size:75%"><a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7ESherool_9233.html" title="User talk:Sherool">(talk)</a></span> 19:46, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

And suggesting replacing the images with PD etc images doesn't work in may cases because no PD equivalent exists or will exist. And frankly the reasoning behind keeping it all free is absurd. We're protecting people who copy Wikipedia as mirrors? Why?<a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 21:53, 30 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It does not even have to be PD, the image has to be under a fair license, which includes GFDL, Creative Commons. And, if that is not possible, then you can seek out Wikigraphic-designers (ahem) and they are willing to help you design a logo for the icon. Examples: with the Coke/Pepsi templates, all someone needs to do is take a picture of the soda cans or find an add that is older than 1934 (I think) and that should be no problem. Eagle Scouts: just find a picture of an bald eagle taken by the US Government. I managed to find photos of some gaming systems on the Wikimedia Commons, a huge depository of freely licensed images. And, the amount of templates that have FU images is very, very small and one just has to look at the Commons or Google to find a PD image. If Hedley was still around, I had a PD image he could have used for his Sealand template. As for "are we pretecting the mirrors," I do not think so, we are protecting ourselves. Most mirrors say that information came from us, so people will find us and tell us about the mirrors, so we could purge the history later on. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zach</a> <sup><a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Smack Back)</a></sup> 22:07, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I intentially did not use the old English font because that would have looked like the A's logo.

<dd>I would argue that it is a bot (or it effectively is at least how he is using it). He is making edits at a phenomenal rate, as I mentioend above up to 10 a minute. I believe the AWB requires the running user to verify the edits themselves, I'm not sure exactly how this works but Bobblewik can't be taking more than a cursory glance if he is making one edit every 6 seconds. <a href="../../../t/a/l/User%7ETalrias_6b30.html" title="User:Talrias">Talrias</a> (<a href="../../../t/a/l/User_talk%7ETalrias_9ef0.html" title="User talk:Talrias">t</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Talrias_7d2c.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Talrias">e</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Talrias_2658.html" title="Special:Contributions/Talrias">c</a>) 21:00, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's hardly surprising that people are voicing opposition to it being done automatically because that's what the proposal is. Some people might expand on their beliefs on the opposition (like Ral315 did) while others might just reply to whether they think the bot proposal is a good idea.

<p>Having been blocked for his campaign the user in question then opted to come on using an anonymous IP to continue the campaign. That I think is overstepping the line. I have blocked that IP and reverted the edits he was doing using it. Frankly Bobbywik's campaign is really annoying me at this stage. I see no evidence that he is taking any care to only remove unnecessary links and instead seems to removing all links but one irrespective of whether a particular other link may be necessary.

<p>If you are refering to the edits at User:66.24.251.76 those were NOT made by Bobblewik, they were made by me. I was not trying to evade a block -- I had not been blocked. My login cookie apparently expired without my being aware -- as soon as I notice I logged back in. I might add that I have been using AWB for date link removal, but I have been significantly examing each such edit, in several cases I have restored a datge that AWB would have removed, in a number of other cases i have added birth/death category links, in yest others I have done minor manual cleanup edits. Whatever may be said of Bobblewik's edits, i deny that my edits are in any way those of a bot, and I do not feel the need for a bot flag to make them. Indeed I have previously made similar edits with similar levels of scrutiny on a purely manual basis. I also suggest you note the alphabetical list in my edits just befofre and after those of User:66.24.251.76 as evidence that these edits were mine. Perhaps ssuming that Bobblewik was evading a block (IMO an invalid block) does not quite squarte wiht <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>.

<dd>Is that the case? I find the fact that you have been doing exactly the same kind of edits that Bobblewik got a block for, when he was blocked, incredibly disruptive and not at all helpful. We're trying to resolve a situation here to come up with a consensus for how to act. If people carry on making edits which there is currently clear disapproval of, I personally find that inconsiderate and rude. <a href="../../../t/a/l/User%7ETalrias_6b30.html" title="User:Talrias">Talrias</a> (<a href="../../../t/a/l/User_talk%7ETalrias_9ef0.html" title="User talk:Talrias">t</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Talrias_7d2c.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Talrias">e</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Talrias_2658.html" title="Special:Contributions/Talrias">c</a>) 15:10, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I understand that you and some others disapprove of these edits. They are exactly the same types of edits I have been making on this issue long before the AWB tool (not a bot) was created. I see no consensus <b>against</b> such edits -- indeed i belive that there is an exizting consensus, represented by the MOS page, in favor of them. I understand that soem people want to change that, but IMO they are a long way from gaining vonsensus for that change. When i have been using the AWB tool for date de-linking, i carefully examine every proposed change. I have on several occasions not accepted proposed changes, and i have fairly often added manul changes -- particualrly adding proper year-based categories. i have not been editing with the same speed that Bobblewik was using. I will, of course, stop such edits if a consensus to link years or not to unlink them developes -- tha has not happend yet and i will argue againsat it. I do not think year links add anything of value in the vast majority of cases, and they reduce the signal-to-noise ratio IMO. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 22:08, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Complaining about and/or blocking editors that act in accordance with the Manual of Style is not productive. Some of the complaints are of the type <i>a year must be linked in circumstanceA</i> or <i>a day of the week must be linked in circumstanceB</i>. These are easy to turn into Manual of Style guidance.

<dd>Yes I have considered that. I do not want more constraints in the Manual of Style, it seems fine to me. But some editors complain about and block the acts of other editors and quote undocumented constraints as applicable. Some of the constraints quoted are specific and auditable. If such constraints are to be imposed on editors, then they should be documented in the Manual of Style. If editors stop complaining/blocking and stop asking for more constraints, then that is fine by me. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblewik_fbc0.html" title="User:Bobblewik">Bobblewik</a> 16:42, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yet again I'll make my proposal regarding this sort of harassment: <i>Anyone using Wikipedia to divulge another person's personal contact information without their consent thereby elicits a permanent ban.</i> Posting the contact information of "enemies" serves <i>no</i> other purpose but to facilitate physical, real-world harassment and violence. There's a vast difference between online name-calling "harassment" and the sort of harassment that involves inviting thugs to abuse the "enemy" in person. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 08:45, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with you in principle - intentionally revealing the personal contact information of editors who do not publicize their identity is a dangerous form of harassment which serves no useful purpose. However it's like blackmail, in that the victims may not wish to draw further attention to the posting by bringing a case. A formal proposal might adress that problem. I suggest that, aside from any formal policy, we as administrators should be vigilant about removing personal information quickly and even deleting it from the edit history. Editors shouldn't have to make a big noise in order to get personal info erased. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 09:12, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><i>"Quoting web pages shouldn't be bannable."</i> is a rather silly straw man. Your actions on Wikipedia can in some cases be bannable, and it doesn't matter if they come from some webpage. For instance, we will ban people spouting nazistic comments, but there are quite some webpages where they may have been quoting it from. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 10:41, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I am all for stopping stalking, but we have to make sure we are stopping the stalker, not the stalkee. Given what Antaeus has done to me, I am in no doubt who is the culprit in this case.</p>
<p>Oh, and his web page *DID* say his true name, as you can tell here <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;c2coff=1&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22antaeus+feldspar%22+%22joseph+crowley%22&amp;spell=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;c2coff=1&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22antaeus+feldspar%22+%22joseph+crowley%22&amp;spell=1" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>. He's just wiped it.</p>
<p>But the point of the matter is that this guy didn't start the revelation, Daniel Brandt did. So punishing someone for repeating that would be as good as punishing anyone who was involved in the editing of <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Brandt_7979.html" title="Daniel Brandt">Daniel Brandt</a>, since a simple click on to the hivemind page reveals details like that. That is the point here.</p>
<p>If this guy was presenting his personal details by himself, then sure, he's done the wrong thing. But he's quoting Brandt, which in turn is quoting off Wikipedia, so he's done nothing wrong.</p>
<p>And you should not, no matter what you do, excuse Antaeus' behaviour, and Antaeus did stalk this user. So if you ban the user, you are effectively saying to him "Banned for being the victim of stalking" which is entirely the wrong message. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 12:48, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>As a matter of fact, it is Zordrac (in addition to Danny, of course) who has been harassing me. He has been telling numerous lies about me, and then screams that I'm "stalking" him if I post the truth on a page where he posted lies about me -- such as that I supposedly violated 3RR with 15 reverts in 24 hours, a claim he makes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ta_bu_shi_da_yu&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=32251828" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ta_bu_shi_da_yu&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=32251828" rel="nofollow">here</a>. If he actually believed that I committed this violation, why did he post no report of it to <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_3RR_4b52.html" title="WP:AN/3RR">WP:AN/3RR</a>? Zordrac had earlier tried to make trouble for me by sending an e-mail to <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Brandt_7979.html" title="Daniel Brandt">Daniel Brandt</a>, giving Brandt his own lopsided interpretation of an edit I had made; Zordrac describes it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Antaeus_Feldspar&amp;diff=31878088&amp;oldid=31876306" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Antaeus_Feldspar&amp;diff=31878088&amp;oldid=31876306" rel="nofollow">here</a>: "you were trying to imply that he was a hypocrite, by using weasel words in an underhanded way to discredit him, something which I advised him is defamatory of nature. Just so you know." Now he is claiming, incredibly enough, that I <b>requested</b> him to be my go-between to Brandt and 'explain' my edits to Brandt in that fashion! <i>Why</i> on Earth would I have asked that? And why on Earth would he have accepted, if it was true what he <i>now</i> claims, which is that "before we had communicated, he threatened me on the Daniel Brandt talk page, and made wild accusations about me, claiming to have been "watching me""? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zordrac&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=32624419" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zordrac&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=32624419" rel="nofollow">[33]</a> As Zordrac (ironically) says, "we have to make sure we are stopping the [harasser], not the [harassee]".

<p>After a recent dialog with DannyWilde, I've blocked him indefinitely for continued use of what he thinks may be Antaeus' real name. Feel free to shorten the block if you feel it's too long, but it's obvious that he's only here for some sort of weird revenge and doesn't care about making any meaningful contributions.

<p>For over two weeks now, <a href="../../../n/i/x/User%7ENixer_51c2.html" title="User:Nixer">User:Nixer</a> has been unilaterally warring to write "Ioann the Terrible" rather than "Ivan the Terrible" in <a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_of_Discovery_8204.html" title="Age of Discovery">Age of Discovery</a>. He hasn't quite crossed 3RR, but he has now reverted over 10 times in two weeks and has, in turn, been reverted by at least three different people, nyself included. ("Ioann" exists—our article <a href="../../../i/v/a/Ivan_IV_of_Russia_e7f2.html" title="Ivan IV of Russia">Ivan IV of Russia</a> acknowledges it as the Church Slavonic form of his name—but I gather that it's pretentious even in Russian and almost unknown to native speakers of English.)

<p>Yes, but he is now blocked for <i>a week</i> - I still think it's too much. What we need is an ArbCom decision limiting his reverts to one each day or something. Izehar 19:50, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>A user, Projects (also known as Vesa and many others) is repeatedly removing the templates I have added asking for sources to be cited and for it to be copyedited. I have discussed the issue with the user and they are not budging on it. They are stating that they are a historian but will not state any references. I have put 3 warnings on their talk page but they are not paying attention - instead reverting to being aggressive/childish.

This all stems from a page i mistakenly created for Mandy Moore. I was told that Ms. Moore's new album will be called Once Moore. I later found out that the information i got was false. I aided in the destruction of the article. But for some reason, a user named Extraordinary Machine created the article and mereged it with an already existing article. I didn't even know this user until later. But Quirkywiki claimed it was me or we were one and the same. And went to every user she could find and spammed them with lies, talking about the Mandy Moore forum (which has nothing to do with this site) to my book (which is also irrelevent). She tried to blame me for her getting banned. I did request it, but i didn't place the banned. I haven't the power. Quirkywiki has many sockpuppets, 206.170.104.27, 206.170.106.42, 206.170.106.48 just to name a few. People have warned her constantly but she refuses to listen. She thinks because she is on a public computer, she won't get banned. She needs to be proven wrong... again. -<a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParys_d8c8.html" title="User:Parys">Parys</a> 16:09, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I once talked to a policeman about the issue of death threats. He said that a threat that even hinted at something like that, even if probably was a joke, <b>must</b> be reported in all cases to the police. The reason is straight forward. If it is reported then it is on record so if anything was ever to be attempted that in any way compromised the safety of the person targeted, even if didn't amount to much, there is something on file for the police to look back on. Having something on record is vital. In addition <i>they</i> have experience in accessing these things. Something that us might seem just a sick joke might to them, from their experience, not seem so innocent. A friend of mine, John, once received a death threat. It looked like a joke but to be safe he reported it. The police weren't as convinced as he was about its innocence and checked it out. The managed to find out who had found it and found that the sender did have a habit both of stalking people and of becoming violent when his victim challenged him about it. What seemed like possible joke turned out not to so innocent at all. Even if the sender did not at the time intend it as a threat, his past behaviour meant that if he was interested enough to send something, he was likely at some stage to start stalking and could have become violent. Reporting it nipped the threat in the bud. He was severely warned off by the police but John was warned to keep an eye out for the individual and shown a photograph of him.</p>
<p>The threat above probably is just a sick joke, but to be safe it is important that the police are informed of it. They are the people who can form a professional judgment on how innocent or threatening it really is. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:#006666; background-color:orange"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 23:16, 30 December 2005 (UTC) Could you tell me if "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Coins_of_Ireland.&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Coins_of_Ireland.&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">numbskull</a>" is the correct terminology to use when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Jtdirl&amp;offset=20051229002947&amp;limit=50" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Jtdirl&amp;offset=20051229002947&amp;limit=50" rel="nofollow">correcting</a> a new user? --Period</p>

<dd>Fplay still hasn't indicated his bot is turned off. That's what this block was needed for; Fplay was running an unauthorized bot, doing something possibly unnecessary, and using quite a bit of server capacity to do it. Nobody's saying Fplay is a bad person, but Zoe did the right thing. I, or any other admin, can (and will) undo the block as soon as it's warranted. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 01:48, 31 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Nope. But all Fplay has to do is say on his userpage that it isn't, and the block will be undone.

<p>To explain what he was doing... on <a href="../../../w/a/n/Special%7EWantedpages_a3ac.html" title="Special:Wantedpages">Special:Wantedpages</a> there is a Votes for Willys page which still has over a thousand red-links to it. This was apparently some kind of predecessor to 'Votes for Deletion' (now split into the various AfD, TfD, IfD, et cetera pages). Fplay was running the bot to make null edits to pages linking to that old article so that the old links would update to 'Votes for Deletion' and 'Votes for Willys' would no longer be listed so high up on the Wantedpages list. Or so I surmise from his edit summaries / actions. There's a more detailed explanation of it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3ASpecial%3AWantedpages&amp;diff=14150440&amp;oldid=13586726" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3ASpecial%3AWantedpages&amp;diff=14150440&amp;oldid=13586726" rel="nofollow">here</a>, which is probably where he got the idea.

<p>ZOE: Your logic is flawed. Trying to retroactively saddle Fplay with "intentionally disrupting Wikipedia" after YOU disabled his account. He was not bothering anyone. Your approach is revisionist and hypocritical. Did he taunt anyone or ask for this trouble? No. Why did you disable his account? Because you did not understannd.

<p>Just to review: Is does not matter was Zoe digs up after the fact about Fplay.

What matters is what she knew when and what she did with her admin priviledges. By the account in existed only for a moment in this log (before one of her supporters removed it), but still resides in Jimbo's talk page, she acted hastily and, apparently, overreacted.

<dd>SlimVirgin asked me to look into this issue as an uninvolved party and offer my opinion. Without getting in to the specific merits of whether or not I personally think the page "should" have been renamed, I think this is a case of biting the oldies. Page moves are typically doable by anyone, and the 60% guideline on <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a> is phrased somewhat loosely. The whole point is that if you end up on <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a>, the move is controversial. The stakes are, frankly, low here — the substance of the article is unchanged — and getting worked up over a few percent one way or the other seems to me to be missing the forest for the trees. It seems wrong to me that we should give an admin less discretion in deciding how to close a page move discussion than we do when closing an article deletion discussion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think Marudubshinki should be encouraged to close out the discussion however he thinks appropriate, and people should be encouraged to redirect their energy into improving the article and making sure it stays properly focused, rather than fretting over the semiotics of whether or not a parenthesized word appears in the article title.</dd>

<p>Yeah, some day I'll make a list of things you generally shouldn't do on WP:RM. Like moving a page against a WP:RM descision when <i>you were involved in the debate</i> just a couple of days afterwards. Arg!</p>
<p>And well - there a lot of simple moves on WP:RM like:</p>
<ol>
<li>Normal page moves</li>
<li>Cut n' paste fixups</li>
<li>History merges</li>
<li>Simple mispellings by authors</li>
<li>Plainly obvious uncontroversial moves, usually changing a case of a letter for updates in the MoS.</li>
<li>Sometimes some minor merges, but those are rare</li>

<p>After some wikipedians had trouble accepting the WP:RM (see above <a href="#Arabic_numerals_requested_move" title="">#Arabic_numerals_requested_move</a>) and started <a href="../../../a/r/a/Talk%7EArabic_numerals_naming_e7bd.html" title="Talk:Arabic numerals/naming">Talk:Arabic numerals/naming</a> as "disgruntled users spin-off", but more or less "controllable", protracted <b>edit warring</b> on the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_numerals.html" title="Arabic numerals">Arabic numerals</a> page itself has far from stopped.</p>
<p>It appears extremely difficult to direct users who want to impose either the "arabic" or the "hindu" POV in the page towards the ongoing discussions at <a href="../../../a/r/a/Talk%7EArabic_numerals_890a.html" title="Talk:Arabic numerals">talk:Arabic numerals</a>, prior to proceeding with major swaps/"cultural superiority"-type intrusions in the article.</p>
<p>OK, so far, but now <a href="../../../d/p/s/User%7EDPSingh_472e.html" title="User:DPSingh">user:DPSingh</a>, whom, as far as I know, just comes out of a week of block, gives it another go: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arabic_numerals&amp;curid=1786&amp;diff=33478925&amp;oldid=33420813" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arabic_numerals&amp;curid=1786&amp;diff=33478925&amp;oldid=33420813" rel="nofollow">diff</a></p>
<p>This is not 3RR (one of this user's first edits after a week of block), yet "mildly" disturbing, on top of all the other disturbance going on.</p>
<p>I post this here, while:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blocking the <i>article</i> would not solve anything in this stage IMHO;</li>
<li>Sysops keeping an eye on this might be beneficial (I think several of you do this already: thanks for your patience and efforts!)</li>
<li>Maybe act very strict on disturbing behaviour: help users see, that whatever the cultural differences, it's best to tackle differences on the talk page, and not by POV-pushing/slow revert warring directly on the article.</li>

<dd>Sorry, but one of the proposed decisions (which only didn't pass because one member changed a vote) is that "Instantnood sometimes insists on using the phrase "Mainland China" in contexts which seem incongruent with the sovereignty of the People's Republic of China." So how is it inappropriate of me to correct exactly that when he insists on using "mainland China" when China or PRC is more correct? If I'm "editing inappropriately" (the requirement for me to be banned) then YOUR CLIENT needs to quit putting forth the kind of BS that needs correcting. I'm the one there adding more information to a translated article. I'm not the one that went past 3RR. I'm the one driving the talk page to try and find what compromises there can be. All 'nood can do is play revert games. He hasn't once put forth a defense of the use of that term other than that was the term in the translation. So who's editing inappropriately?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In the meantime, he's banned from proposing multiple renames and page moves in a week, and I detailed half a dozen to ArbCom for clarification of just what the enforcement mechanism is. Maybe instead of asking for me to be page banned, you should advise 'nood on how to actually comply with his much more restrictive probation. Are you just playing tit-tat for him? <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchmuckyTheCat_0da1.html" title="User:SchmuckyTheCat">SchmuckyTheCat</a> 05:36, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Assuming if any of what you say is true how could one ever figure that out given the blatant hostility?

<dd>And yes there is blatant hostility. For over a year now Instantnood is trawling Wikipedia and changing references to China to "mainland China", placing Hong Kong as an independent country, creating POV forks, and etc, and it's still going on, he's still at it. On some articles he does the same edits that he did <i>months</i> ago and got smacked for it. Why? Does he think nobodies watching? No, it's because that's the kind of subterfuge he wants to use to push his agenda - over and over and over. I'm going to call him on it, and it's a game to him, but at least I'll play by the rules. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchmuckyTheCat_0da1.html" title="User:SchmuckyTheCat">SchmuckyTheCat</a> 06:21, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Zephram Stark was banned on 12 November 2005 (for six months). Peter's first edit was on 23 November 2005.</li>

<ul>
<li>Both editors are extremely vocal about alleged administrative abuse and are prone to Wikilawyering and long diatribes.</li>
</ul>

<dd>The case against Peter being a sockpuppet is circumstantial at best, is it possibly you just don't like what other people point out? More than one person is likely to have similiar opinions to both Peter and this "Zephram Stark". If I take up Peter's cause are you going to accuse me of being a sockpuppet too? The Zephram Stark arbcom evidence page actually lists quite interesting evidence that some admins often claim "sockpuppetry" against groups of users that have very geographically distinct IP addresses and in every case one or all of the users directly challenged the admin's interpretation of an article's content or sources. This seems like a case of admin retribution after protracted POV disagreement. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 16:27, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I didn't block Peter for having similar opinions to Zephram, I blocked him because he <i>was</i> Zephram Stark (who was banned by the ArbCom). Over many months I has the unfortunate experience of becoming an expert on Zephram's behavior. I've strongly suspected that Peter was Zephram for some time now, but wanted to wait until I was 100% confident before blocking. As a side note, I am also quite sure that you are '<i>not</i> a sockpuppet of anyone. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 16:32, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How can you possibly be so sure Peter is Zephram Stark? Is it possible your frustration over the Zephram Stark case has clouded your judgement? Though I've been looking over the Zephram Stark arbcom case and I can't seem to find a justification for that original block, certainly 6 months seems exponentially disproportional of a punishment. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 16:42, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Read the evidence above. Does it seem reasonable to suggest that someone who joined days after Zephram was banned, and edits the same pages with the same edit style and happens to be from the same state and gets into conflict with the same editors and makes the same rants (on and off Wikipedia) is <i>not</i> the same person? I wouldn't have blocked if I wasn't <b>100%</b> sure they were the same. As for Zephram's original block, I believe it absolutely was deserved, but that's a matter for the ArbCom. However, the six month ban will be reset since he never actually stopped editing. Bans are per person, not per account. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 16:47, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I saw Zephram Stark's personal attacks but I wonder if he himself got frustrated over being censored and mislabeled? Does wikipedia policy allow an admin to block a user with numerous edits as a sockpuppet merely if they are 100% confident? Surely a committee should decide, perhaps the arbitration committee itself? Allowing one admin to block an editor, who I believe has contributed significantly to Wikipedia, is way too dangerous of a power as it has too much potential for abuse. It is obvious you and Peter have disagreed over many issues so perhaps you should have asked a neutral admin to investigate your belief of sockpuppetry rather than block him yourself? <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 16:57, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

If the ArbCom wants to review the evidence, they're more than welcome and in fact I posted a request for a CheckUser there before it was brought up that the data only goes back a week or two. If an admin reviews all the evidence about (and that provided by Commodore Sloat <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;diff=33304989&amp;oldid=33303923" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;diff=33304989&amp;oldid=33303923" rel="nofollow">[44]</a>) and <i>still</i> truly believes that these two users are <i>not</i> the same, then the ArbCom should look into the case. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 17:02, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Basically, the fact you and others have had multiple disagreements with Peter taints any possibility of your appearing neutral on this issue. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 17:37, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The evidence seems kinda good, but Carbonite has had the pleasure of studying ZS's style in more detail than I have (my mind tended to blank after just a few sentences of his blathering, so I'm not sure I ever finished any of his longer rants.) For me, the graphic evidence (use of graphics, that is) is quite strong; annoying as ZS is, his graphic skills are very good; it galls me a bit that some of his more complicated stuff is done using software I worked on for a decade (AutoCAD), and he does a good job of it. He explained his process on some or another page. Quite talented; it would be wonderful if his energy could be harnessed for good. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 18:38, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Right, I have tried to work with this user but progress is just too slow, it taking an great deal of time, and now I he is angry at me also. Also he <i>will</i> not sign his posts despite re-peat-ed requests and help, and I have told him I can't talk with him anymore if he can't agree to do that. So I don't know what more I can do. I have asked him to get an advocate, and quick. I have looked for signs that he can be turned around but I haven't seen a single good edit yet, just insults and blind determination.</li>

<li>Jmabel, you are clearly NOT one of the sockpuppets. The list and evidence is maintained at User:Dijxtra/Sock by Dijxtra who first discovered this user. You haven't been put on the list, and you haven't had a warning tag put on your user page, and nobody ever considered that. It was just an off-the-cuff remark by Wahkeenah, probably made in the heat of fighting off real sockpuppets. These things happen, but you're right, he should NOT have said that.

<dd>The only problem with editing for the betterment of a page, is that betterment is a very subjective concept. It's hard to use "betterment" or "fair" (such as that proposed group of yours, WAFE) since what may be "better" or "fair" for one group, is not necessarilly true for another group. The best compromise I would suggest, is trying to edit to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, which is a neutral point of view. I think that while it's possible Bigfoot does exist, portions of me don't think so.

<p>I'm a bit concerned about this one. Firstly, though, let me state for the record a few things to get them out of the way:</p>

<li>I find porn to be vile and exploitatious (if that is indeed a word - you know what I mean however)</li>

<dd>The ones that are orphaned clearly can't be fair use, and so should be listed for deletion (it's only fair to give the uploader the opportunity to attach any that he's missed to the appropriate articles).

<ul>
<li>they're web-sized (we might want to downscale a few to the size called for by the infobox, but I've found none that are big)</li>
<li>they're intended for publicity</li>
<li>free images of the subjects are very difficult to obtain (although not impossible, as the comparable Image:Tera Patrick 2.jpg shows)</li>
<li>they represent a tiny proportion of the overall work concerned (the DVD movie), and no loss of income for the copyright holder is forseeable (who buys a DVD just to look at the cover?).</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>It would be better if the DVD cover images were used for the articles corresponding to the DVDs themselves (gosh, I hope we never have a bunch of those), but I think it's not unreasonable to use a DVD cover showing the star of a film on the star's page. -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinlay_McWalter_466b.html" title="User:Finlay McWalter">Finlay McWalter</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/n/User_talk%7EFinlay_McWalter_a93f.html" title="User talk:Finlay McWalter">Talk</a> 14:49, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, I haven't used up my 3 reverts on the article. My 3rd edit was to comment out the paragraph and ask for another source, so I still have one more revert left if I choose to use it. Also, if you look at the contribs of that anon, you'll see I made an edit to the talk page 2 minutes after he or she did, and the address doesn't seem to be an open proxy anyways. <s>I suspect it's just Farhansher editing while logged out.</s><a href="../../../y/u/b/User%7EYuber_3068.html" title="User:Yuber">Yuber</a><sup><small><a href="../../../y/u/b/User_talk%7EYuber_629b.html" title="User talk:Yuber"><font color="#FF8C00">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 22:02, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please read the semi-protection policy more closely. <i>Do not</i> semi-protect in the case of edit warring simply to stop the anonymous editors. Semi-protection is only for severe vandalism.

<dd>My point is that 1) considering they were (and are) already blocked, there is no edit war to stop, and 2) <i><a href="../../../s/e/m/WP%7ESEMI_521e.html" title="WP:SEMI">semi-protection</a></i> is not to be used for edit wars.

<dd>My bad, I was looking at the Full Protection policy, and then applying it to the Semi-protection policy, In that case I should have fully protected it, as semi protection is only for vandalism and full protection is for edit wars. However since there was a large number of anon users, it looked like that after those 3 were banned that more would come. But either way it looks like they are gone. --<a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EEliezer_60dc.html" title="User:Eliezer">Eliezer</a> | <a href="../../../e/l/i/User_talk%7EEliezer_170a.html" title="User talk:Eliezer"><small>£€åV€ m€ å m€§§åg€</small></a> 03:09, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>64.229.170.117 is neither Yuber nor Farhansher; the technical evidence is conclusive. Nor do I see any evidence of malfeasance on the part of the individual editing from that IP address.

<p>I didn't want to get this homework! Seriously! It was up to the notifier to bring the board their justifications on why this <i>islamist</i> <a href="../../../f/a/y/User%7EFayssalF_b498.html" title="User:FayssalF">Godzilla</a> (and all the names on my talk page that never bother me - cool beens!) admin who shut the doors to the angels, the lovely flying birds, at their face! But, anyway, for the sake to get rid of the <font><i><b>ist syndrome</b></i></font>, I decided to state that this time will serve as a testemony and I'll be tolerant as I am judging on a per case basis. I also has to add that tolerance is too much in demand and risking having a <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economic_bubble.html" title="Economic bubble">an eco bubble</a> burst would be no good thing. I hope I presented my stuff clearly and happy to answer any reasonable question whatsover!

<p>The technical evidence indicates that <a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDisposableAccount_42bc.html" title="User:DisposableAccount">User:DisposableAccount</a>, User:Paulcardan, User:Llbb, and User:Bbll are all the same editor. I've blocked Llbb and Bbll, but I wasn't sure which of the other two to block, since DisposableAccount is the older one, but Paulcardan appears to be the real one. They should both be blocked, one permanently, and one temporarily to discourage sockpuppeting; I leave it to other admins as to which. Also, I've permanently blocked User:Marx marvelous; though the technical evidence tying it to the others isn't strong, it's still obviously a sockpuppet created for the purpose of policy violation. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 00:27, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Multiple accounts belonging to the same person is not the same as these accounts being sockpuppets, and is not cause for blocking. Sockpuppetry is <i>abusing</i> multiple accounts to create the illusion of agreement, not simply owning several accounts. As the blocking admin, the onus is upon you to demonstrate this deception has been undertaken; technical evidence alone is not evidence of sockpuppetry. User:Bbll appears to have no edits at all. -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinlay_McWalter_466b.html" title="User:Finlay McWalter">Finlay McWalter</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/n/User_talk%7EFinlay_McWalter_a93f.html" title="User talk:Finlay McWalter">Talk</a> 00:40, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's not how things work, at least not how they should. When someone blocks an account, they need to explain their reasoning. They shouldn't wait to be questioned, and its not a respectful use of others' time to have that evidence, but not to bother presenting it in the forum where they announce the block. The burden of proof lies entirely with the blocking admin. -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinlay_McWalter_466b.html" title="User:Finlay McWalter">Finlay McWalter</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/n/User_talk%7EFinlay_McWalter_a93f.html" title="User talk:Finlay McWalter">Talk</a> 02:38, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Having been blocked for 48 hours for disruption, RJII commenced the exact same behaviour on his return at <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economics_of_fascism.html" title="Economics of fascism">economics of fascism</a>. He refuses to discuss edits on the talkpage and has made the article very difficult to edit. This behaviour has scared off other editors. He is also agitating to have a page unlocked with the aim of creating a POV fork, which was one of the actions that had him blocked in the first place. The consensus on talk was clear that the article needed fixing, and the first step was to change its name. RJII insists that this contravenes the vote on AfD, because the latter did not call for a redirect. However, the content of the article is largely the same and a redirect has not been created, only the title changing. I've asked him to discuss edits on talk and his response was to tell me I was "disruptive". <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames_James_2d06.html" title="User:James James">James James</a> 06:24, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
