<p>Speaking of user pages...<a href="../../../i/b/r/User%7EIbrahimfaisal_46ee.html" title="User:Ibrahimfaisal">User:Ibrahimfaisal</a>...it's every bit as much in violation of <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSER_5ae6.html" title="WP:USER">WP:USER</a> as the last report. Frankly, I think the one provokes the other, in both directions. My feeling is, don't ask, don't tell. All editors ought be brought into compliance. Tony Sidaway is the best example here - he doesn't even <i>have</i> a userpage.Timothy Usher 12:07, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This isn't really true. I actually have lots of userspace pages, but they're all subpages of the user page, which for convenience points to my hybrid user/talk page at <a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">User talk:Tony Sidaway</a>.

<dd>I will remove myself from wikipedia if it cannot give me freedom to have such a simple userpage.

<dd>I've taken a quick look at the user page <a href="../../../i/b/r/User%7EIbrahimfaisal_46ee.html" title="User:Ibrahimfaisal">User:Ibrahimfaisal</a> and I have to say I think it's really well written. It expresses his islam-inspired approach to a number of issues in a way that commands respect, without straying into proselytism. It expresses some disquiet (which I think most of us share) at the lamentable state of the religion-related articles on Wikipedia, specifically those about Islam. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 13:49, 13 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Tony, I'm flummoxed. That's totally absurd. Weren't you <i>just saying</i> that we want editors who will treat subjects <i>neutrally</i>? Also, see <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSER_5ae6.html" title="WP:USER">WP:USER</a>. To wit: "What can I not have on my user page? Generally, you should avoid substantial content on your user page that is unrelated to Wikipedia...Personal statements that could be considered polemical, such as opinions on matters unrelated to Wikipedia."
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Timothy, if there were a double standard in the treatment of religions on Wikipedia, it would work to the advantage of the disfavored religion; readers would see us bending over backwards to accomodate one. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 14:12, 13 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think we do, Tom. Editors which show up and blather on about Jesus saves, accept Jesus Christ as your lord and savior etc. are immediately dismissed as spammers, trolls or vandals, even by editors who personally wholeheartedly agree with the sentiment.Timothy Usher 14:34, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>So, are you saying we are not bending over backwards? Pecher <sup><a href="../../../p/e/c/User_talk%7EPecher_4b24.html" title="User talk:Pecher">Talk</a></sup> 14:30, 13 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, I'm not saying that. To the extent that we are going out of our way to avoid offending some sensibilities but not others, the reader sees that and reads more skeptically to accomodate. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 14:57, 13 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>What's the evidence that the readers are reading more skeptically? And why should they; are you really arguing that NPOV has become a joke? People come to Wikipedia anticipating a factual and neutral account; 99% of readers don't even look at talk pages, and they have no idea of what's actually going on here. We must be fair to all editors regardless of religion, otherwise Wikipedia will indeed become a soapbox or, rather, a pulpit. Pecher <sup><a href="../../../p/e/c/User_talk%7EPecher_4b24.html" title="User talk:Pecher">Talk</a></sup> 15:07, 13 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, I read more skeptically when I sense political correctness. I hope others do as well, but I guess it is only hope. I agree that we should continue to work toward a presentation that neither favors nor disfavors any religion. I agree that we should not bend over backwards to show respect to one religion while telling followers of another to lighten up. It looks to me like we still have a ways to go. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 15:22, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The guideline you cite emphasizes that "The Wikipedia community is generally tolerant and offers fairly wide latitude in applying these guidelines to regular participants." I don't know anything about Faisal's edits, and if they're non-neutral that is a quite separate matter. The user page, however, is a very respectful and Wikipedian one, emphasizing the tolerance and high moral values that he atttributes to his religion. That is a very good use of a user page. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 14:07, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, okay, I think you need some diffs then. The talk page contributions are essentially continuations of the user page. I never met Jason Gastrich, but it sounds like the same idea. At this point, I've little choice but to post here, but it'll have to be tomorrow.</dd>

<dd>However, I'm still very confused about how you can take such offense at Chooser's statements, but not this. Are you under the mistaken impression that Islam promotes abortion? Guess again. In any case, neither can be squared with "Generally, you should avoid substantial content on your user page that is unrelated to Wikipedia...Personal statements that could be considered polemical, such as opinions on matters unrelated to Wikipedia." I'll say this until I'm blue in the face: the enforcement of established policy is the key to all of these conflicts. It doesn't matter if it's "well-written", or interesting, or in some vague and subjective way "wikipedian" The <i>only</i> thing that matters here is if it has to do with Wikipedia.Timothy Usher 14:15, 13 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Timothy Usher, one question: you say "<i>I'm still very confused about how you can take such offense at Chooser's statements, but not this</i>".

I'd be fine with it were it consistent, but since then I've seen a defense of transexual advocacy and now a defense of user page Islamism...go figure.Timothy Usher 15:27, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

All the data comes from devout admirers of Muhammad, who considered his actions and those of his companions - the cold-blooded execution of Jewish POWs, the taking of female Jewish captives as slaves and wives, the sale of Jewish children into slavery, the confiscation of Jewish property and the imposition of serfdom upon its former owners, the murder of Jewish poets, etc. - right, just and glorious.Timothy Usher 23:02, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm quite surprised at Pecher's and TimothyUsher's recent edits here. There seems to be a certain amount of scrabbling for discrediting evidence going on that is most disquieting. On Faisal's part he makes a routine complaint about a content tagging dispute, but does so without incivility. Pecher describes that as "whining about being on the losing side in a content dispute" and TimothyUsher makes an off-the-wall attack on Faisal's user page. This is not a good way to interact with other editors. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 10:18, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>guys, as long as we allow expression of personal bias, including religious bent, on userpages, there is nothing wrong whatsoever with Faisal's page. If we disallow expression of religious affiliation, we should do away with userpages altogether. I have no idea what this is doing on WP:AN/I. Is it an "incident" that Faisal on his userpage says he tries to be a good Muslim? I don't see how this is polemical at all. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 10:39, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Second, I'm not sure who created this section. It wasn't me, as the history will show, and I'm rather upset that my comments have been resectioned to create the impression that I'd meant to file a report against this user for his userpage.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'd only brought up Faisal's userpage as related to the block of FairNBalanced, then someone else sectioned it off. My point was that the real issue comes down to <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSER_5ae6.html" title="WP:USER">WP:USER</a>. Either editorial statments on matters unrelated to WP are allowed, or they are not. If there is some nuance here, it's not adequately expressed in policy. For example, write, it's okay to express support for a religion, but not to express opposition. That would be clear enough. I don't think it wikilawyering to ask that written policy bear at least some resemblance to enforcement. If <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSER_5ae6.html" title="WP:USER">WP:USER</a> is considered unactionable, then I really can't see the basis of FNB's block, particularly in light of the fact that the image was speedy deleted (by me). We can't say, controversial statments are okay, and then block people for making them. Conversely, if controversial statements are <i>not</i> okay, we're kidding ourselves to pretend that promotion of religion - any religion - is not inherently controversial.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I once again refer to the text of the userpage policy, which prohibits <b>"personal statements that could be considered polemical, such as opinions on matters unrelated to Wikipedia."</b> Are we just going to proceed as if this text means nothing? For the record, once again, I advocate the aggressive removal of <i>all</i> such statements from <i>all</i> userpages as per policy. It would spare us a lot of controversy, such as the perennial userbox nonsense, go a long way towards busting cabals or the appearance of cabals (both of which are harmful), and in cases of instransigence, purge editors who are here for the wrong reasons, as per, wikipedia is <i>not a soapbox</i>. Allowing userpages to be soapboxes sends precisely the wrong message.Timothy Usher 11:04, 14 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>User:Timothy Usher please do proper research when trying to argue your points. <b><a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSER_5ae6.html" title="WP:USER">WP:USER</a> is not policy.</b> It is a <i>guideline</i>, there is a rather significant difference. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott">Netscott</a> 11:24, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>DAB, once again, it was never my intention of reporting this on incidents, and the history will show that I didn't. The original point of contention was that another user had been blocked for editorial statements in userspace, and I'd mentioned this userpage as a counterexample. That's all. What you call "disruptive" is highly interpretive: to a feminist, "I support Sharia" might be considered offensive. To a Palestinian, "I love zionism" might be considered offensive. I'm not saying there are <i>no</i> common-sense rules we can apply here, but frankly, writing the arabic word for "God" on a pig is <i>not</i> offensive to many people, and the choice of whose offense to mind is at best a concession to real-world fears of extra-legal threats - in which case <i>let's say so</i> - and at worst, arbitrary. Besides the copyright violation, which is a real issue, I still fail to see how or that FNB's editorial statement lies outside the policy as it's being represented here.Timothy Usher 11:59, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Netscott, I removed these images <i>not only</i> because I found them inappropriate to Wikipedia, but also to protect this naive user from being involuntarily recruited as your whipping post. My goal was not only to protect others from offense, but also to protect him from controversy, because I saw him as a good-faith, potentially valuable contributor, in spite of several missteps. My position on userspace is 1) the policy should be<i>no unrelated material whatsoever</i>, including Allah Pig, I love Islam, I follow Pope Benedict, Make Abortion History, etc. 2) whatever the policy is, it should be explicit and consistent. I'm very sorry if/that you interpret this as hypocrisy.Timothy Usher 12:36, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Timothy Usher, your mischaracterization of my motives (ie: "whipping post"?) are unfounded as I have previously explained to you on your talk page, I previously counciled <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairNBalanced_c59c.html" title="User:FairNBalanced">User:FairNBalanced</a> to refrain from inflammatory editing that sooner demonstrated a lack of good faith. In response to my last council, he put up the pig image, really stabbing the sword in to the hilt in demonstrating a lack of good faith. Let me remind you that I have been similiarly involved in examples similar to this one relative to both Muslim and non-Muslim editors. Again, you keep referring to <i>policy</i>, <b>there is no policy</b> there are only <i>guidelines</i>.

<p>I hear you, and I agree the general principle needs to be applied uniformly. Also the user's statement that he will leave Wikipedia if not allowed to express these views on his user page is not encouraging.

<dd>User:72.65.68.229, it is true that you're not allowed to start edit wars or edit the talk page as if you "own" the talk page. Doing so is highly disruptive, leads to misattribution, and confuses the other editors. It is also true that you're not allowed to break the 3RR, which you have clearly done so <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR#User:72.65.68.229_reported_by_User:RevolverOcelotX" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR#User:72.65.68.229_reported_by_User:RevolverOcelotX" rel="nofollow">here</a>. --<a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolverOcelotX_fe1a.html" title="User:RevolverOcelotX">RevolverOcelotX</a> 23:39, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay, yea, don't insert comments in the middle of another user's comments in general. Just respond below it. Makes it a lot easier to read and understand. And if you seriously are going to complain about indentation or moving comments to another place, it will probably be ignored. Get over it. Frankly, there's no point to block over 3RR on such a pointless issue either. Just don't do it again.

<dd>No, User:72.65.68.229 clearly placed his comments in between my comments and another user's comments to try to make it appear that he "refuted" them. That is against the talk page guidelines because it is disruptive. User:72.65.68.229 should have placed his comments at the end of the section so it would have been easier to read and respond to, but he keeps reverting back to the disruptive version, and broke the 3RR. User:72.65.68.229's edit wars are highly disruptive and he clearly broke the 3RR and should be blocked as such. --<a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolverOcelotX_fe1a.html" title="User:RevolverOcelotX">RevolverOcelotX</a> 00:01, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There were a series of different comments lined up in a row, which were separated by signatures. It appears that User:72.65.68.229 has replied to a whole series, indenting to indicate that he was replying to each question individually. There is not instance where he butted into a person's comment at all. It is more convenient to have the reply indented below the post to which it replies, rather than having them at the bottom in chronological order, as RevolverOcelotX did by moving them. The positioning of the comments was not against the guidelines. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">Have your say!!!</a> 02:49, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

A number of editors, both liberal and conservative, have been trying to craft a fair and accurate description of these criticisms. One user, <a href="../../../e/r/_/User%7EER_MD_98e3.html" title="User:ER MD">User:ER MD</a>, doesn't want it in there, and after an admin stepped in and said, "it's valid, keep it," he continues to blank it out anyway, or modify it so that instead of being a list of things that critics of conservatism actually believe and say, it's a list of things to laud and recommend conservatism ideology. ER MD's defense is couched in semantics (philosophy vs policy, etc). I've run out of patience with this article and have stopped working on it. I've never run into a more belligerant and uncooperative editor on Wikipedia. There will be no satisfying this guy until the criticism section contains no criticism. <a href="../../../b/j/s/User%7EBjsiders_eb21.html" title="User:Bjsiders">Bjsiders</a> 19:56, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm a bit suspicious about RevolverOcelotX's evident experience with Wikipedia. He looks like somebody's sock. As it happens he seems to share similar interests with Instantnood. And also, he first edited at 0447 UTC on 19 May, just 35 hours after Phil Sandifer blocked Instantnood for two weeks, implementing the two week Wikipedia ban under Instantnood's General Probation. This was a ban that was proposed by me as part of my enforcement of the arbitration remedies on Instantnood.</p>

<p>Of more concern is the second message [140.159.8.2 posted] after the blocked, by 140.159.8.2, repeating similar racial slurs and saying "you can't block me". Note that 140.159.8.2 has now also been rightfully <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:140.159.8.2" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:140.159.8.2" rel="nofollow">blocked</a>, for vandalism, by <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a>. It's possible, I suppose, that by "you can't block me" he was referring to his own blocking in a confused way. Another theory would be that he is a meat-puppet of 220.239.134.188.</p>
<p>A look at both users' contribs indicates a history of extremely similar edits: vandalism of pages with the word "gay" and repeated personal attacks against other editors, usually using racial slurs. I haven't see one constructive contribution in 220.239.134.188's contribs history, and very few in 140.159.8.2's.</p>
<p>I think it would be worthwhile to consider whether these two accounts, or at least the first, are vandalism-only accounts, one possibly the meat-puppet of the other. 220.239.134.188 in particular does not seem to have anything to offer this project but abuse.</p>

<dd>To add to that - one's an ISP, and the other's an academic site, so it's possible that it's the same person editing from home and college/uni. The problem with blocking academic IP addresses is that often the same physical machine is used by many unconnected people every day (and also that a single person will have easy access to many machines within the same IP range), and the problem with ISPs is that sometimes they reallocate IP addresses (extremely frequently, in the case of AOL). --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 11:26, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> As a curious observer of the situation who has experienced DreamGuy’s behaviour before, I feel that he has stepped up a gear in order to try and provoke another edit war/conflict intentionally. A quick look at his edit summaries will suggest this. However, this time he has been found out for used socks and he has used them to break the 3RR.</dd>

<dd>It appears DreamGuy hasn't used the DreamGuy account since May 31, meaning it's likely this behavior has stopped (unless another user has stepped in). Seeing that, I'm inclined to ask DreamGuy/Victrix to pick an account, and indef block the other one. Usually users are permitted to use sockpuppets, but DreamGuy/Victrix was using them maliciously, and I see no reason why both should remain unblocked. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315">talk</a>) 15:23, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Oh, hey, I think you're getting ahead of yourself, Ral315. The scale of likelihood that the CheckUser admins use goes Confirmed-Likely-Possible-Inconclusive-Unrelated. In other words, "likely" is not "confirmed". I also can't find any Victrix instances of the type of language in edit summaries that Englishrose claims is typical of both accounts. Where are the examples of that? <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 18:04, 12 June 2006 (UTC).

<dd>Note that checkuser is an <i>aid</i> to determining sockpuppetry but it can be fooled and can also be wrong. Quoting Essjay, "Checkuser, as David Gerard says, is not magic wiki pixie dust, and is never the be-all-end-all of evidence; it's the similarity in edit pattern and interests that confirms sockpuppetry, checkuser just helps confirm or refute what is already known." <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 18:13, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well I rather more agree with Ral315. Quite a while back I had my run-in with DreamGuy so I can't claim to be totally un-biased on the issue. However, I think the style of contributions from Victrix is very similar to what I saw from DreamGuy, that combined with the 'likely' checkuser result is very suspicious. I'm talking about edit summaries like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Victrix&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=58180862" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Victrix&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=58180862" rel="nofollow">this one</a>, and in general the long summaries like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Beelzebub&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=56101795" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Beelzebub&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=56101795" rel="nofollow">this</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_proposed_Jack_the_Ripper_suspects&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=25636476" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_proposed_Jack_the_Ripper_suspects&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=25636476" rel="nofollow">this</a> as pointed about before (many examples). See also the non-checkuser evidence present on the checkuser case page. Therefore I would fully support a block on one of these accounts. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetros471_bbc1.html" title="User:Petros471">Petros471</a> 18:27, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I too am not unbiased, as I was the recipient of multiple personal attacks and accusations of <i>being</i> a sockpuppet by DreamGuy several months ago, but I would point out that at right about the same time on May 31st, <i>both</i> Victrix and DreamGuy ceased posting for several days <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/DreamGuy" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/DreamGuy" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Victrix" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Victrix" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, and the first action done upon Victrix' return, was the removal of the "odd tag placed there by some unknown vandal." I agree with Petros471 that there is a clear similarity in edit summaries between the two accounts, especially the style of removing warnings from their respective talk pages, in combination with an abusive edit summary which accuses the original poster of harassment. Most Wikipedia editors, in my experience, when faced with vandalism simply use a variation of "rv" or "rvv", without the harassment/vandalism commentary. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 20:28, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The evidence does certainly suggest that they are the same person. While many users can be sharp and rather bitchy sometimes (*hold up hand here*) the scale of edit warring and personal attacks by DG is deeply unpleasant to users. A glance at his edits suggests that the clear majority are concerned with edit warring, with abuse attached.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=DreamGuy" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=DreamGuy" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> I've had my own experience of dealing with him: he posted a merge tag on some articles a long time ago, trying to merge any mention of a topic anywhere else into "his" article. Though not a single person has supported the merge, any removal of the ancient tag leads to chronic abuse. I thought I was the only one receiving it and ignored it, but he really goes overboard in his edit warring. It is bad enough putting up with one DreamGuy edit warring and abusing users.

<dd>&lt;unindenting&gt;If DreamGuy and Victrix are socks, they've been used in violation of WP:3RR policy, and one of the accounts should probably be permablocked. Can we avoid the general piling-on regarding DreamGuy's character, though? His article edits are good ones; they improve the encyclopedia and maintain the integrity of articles which seem to attract every kook, crank, and POV-pusher on the internet. Yeah, he gets cranky.

<dd>Cranky? Let's put things in perspective here - <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> is downright abusive - consistently, at length and in the most repugnant manner possible.

I myself have encountered his abusive comments during DreamGuy'S tirade against anybody who voted keep on the aladin debate, which included Elonka who suffered much more personal attacks than me. So much so that they had to be refactored. As far as I'm concerned DreamGuy has not and will not change his ways. To be blunt, the only thing that saves him from being blocked is that certain admins seem to want to stick up for him no matter what he's done. <a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEnglishrose_b44b.html" title="User:Englishrose">Englishrose</a> 15:16, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

It's nearly always the same unimpartial admins (ie Android79 who is on wikibreak, Bunchofgrapes, Bishonen etc) who stick up for him. It amounts to bullying, it's like saying this is our gang and anyone who doesn't like us will be eliminated. As I said, DreamGuy has issued personal attacks to a number of users.I personally think some of the personal attacks DreamGuy makes are quite nutty but maybe you can't see that. <a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEnglishrose_b44b.html" title="User:Englishrose">Englishrose</a> 16:17, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The fact of the matter is that his edits are of little significance, contribute almost nothing to "improving" Wikipedia, and mostly appear designed to provoke edit wars. That constitutes the definition of serial trolling in most people's book. All of that aside, the purpose of this discussion is to determine what should be done to address the matter of his using sockpuppets to subvert the 3RR - a reality that has now been established to the satisfaction of all (except for "certain admins"). --<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 21:57, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Damn it, are people going to <i>do</i> something constructive, or is everyone who has ever disagreed with DreamGuy going to play to the bleachers non-stop? If you folks have an RFC complaint, then open the RFC. Otherwise, Bunchofgrapes and Bishonen are right: the proper thing is to say that a Checkuser request suggests that it is likely that DreamGuy and Victrix are the same person. We can take it from there on the sockpuppet front, and no one can take anything from the "he was mean to me" front except the people with the complaints. I've not seen Englishrose be thuggish before, but the same cannot be said of Elonka or Centauri, so their allegations aren't winning the day because...well...they just don't have a great deal of <i>ethos</i> for their complaints. That said, let's leave everyone's character alone. If someone wants to announce an RFC and invite input, cool. If folks want to report the Checkuser request, fine.

<p>This has been a non stop process of arguing policy, edit wars and disruptive behavior. I'm not paticularly concerned with the sensibility of his policy arguments as its edvident they will bear no changes on the policy pages. This is acceptable. However wikipedia does not condone personal attacks.</p>

<dd>Not that it matters, but your claims are demonstrably false. Even a quick glance at the edit and ban histories reveal that you are a long-time ally of Nandesuka and JakeW. The three of you have a strong pro-circumcision POV, while Dabljuh is known for his strong anti-circumcision POV.

<p>I think this entire affair has been unfortunate for everyone involved. I'm not an administrator and haven't had much involvement with Dabljuh outside the confines of <a href="../../../c/i/r/Talk%7ECircumcision_a023.html" title="Talk:Circumcision">Talk:Circumcision</a>, so I'm new to this discussion. Within that talk page, I had already become aware that he was an iconoclast, very outspoken, and as he has described himself above on this page, a "smartass". However, there are a couple points I think should be made. Some editors seem to be of the opinion that Dabljuh cannot be reasoned with and that he should therefore be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3ANo_original_research&amp;diff=58455817&amp;oldid=58455808" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3ANo_original_research&amp;diff=58455817&amp;oldid=58455808" rel="nofollow">ignored</a> as incorrigible. I was a bit bothered by this, since I prefer to believe people can always be reasoned with. All you have to do is put yourself in their shoes and understand their frame of reference and their initial premises.</p>
<p>For instance, <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolitician818_2c9b.html" title="User:Politician818">User:Politician818</a> began his Wikipedia use as a typical POV-pushing MPOV editor, convinced there was a liberal conspiracy preventing the "truth" from being told about such right-wing luminaries as <a href="../../../a/n/n/Ann_Coulter_3c97.html" title="Ann Coulter">Ann Coulter</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Savage_c5ad.html" title="Michael Savage">Michael Savage</a>. I believe he got blocked a time or two in there. By extending Politician818 courtesy and sticking up for him on the occasions that he's been correct, I seem to have gotten him to calm down and edit in a more constructive manner. At least he isn't railing about cabals and revert warring as often as he used to. Maybe I'm assuming too much credit for this, but from what I can see, the turning point was about when I talked with him.</p>
<p>With this recent experience in mind, I visited Dabljuh's user page, read up on his interests, and read his Politics subpage, which for some reason which escapes me has now been deleted, despite containing nothing offensive that I could see. So rather than applying a label to him or calling him a name, I posted a polite and careful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADabljuh&amp;diff=58398438&amp;oldid=58381161" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADabljuh&amp;diff=58398438&amp;oldid=58381161" rel="nofollow">critique</a> of one of the proposals on his Politics page. What did this incorrigible "troll", who some feel cannot be reasoned with, do in return? He <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADabljuh&amp;diff=58398438&amp;oldid=58381161" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADabljuh&amp;diff=58398438&amp;oldid=58381161" rel="nofollow">replied</a> with equal civility and thoughtfulness, and <i>conceded the point</i> and abandoned the proposal due in part to the objections I raised.</p>
<p>This does not appear to be the act of a megalomaniacal "troll" who cannot be reasoned with. This is the act of a person who certainly is not obeying Wikipedia policy <i>at this moment</i>, but I feel can be reasoned with. Anyone who's capable of listening to a critique of their ideas and politely responding, recognizing the flaws in their ideas, and conceding a point, <i>can</i> be reasoned with. To me this indicates that Dabljuh should not be driven away from Wikipedia, but instead encouraged to do better. I believe the reason Dabljuh <i>listened</i> to me was because I did not base my comments on a presumption that he is unreasonable. People respond well to being treated with respect; this is the entire point of being civil.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it appears that some of his comments on other topics, such as his vocal opposition to the NOR policy, are being responded to in a way colored by the respondants' opinions of Dabljuh the person. This is not appropriate. I do not agree with Dabljuh's critique of NOR but I will listen to what he has to say about it. Refusing to acknowledge someone's arguments because you feel they're a jerk is called the <i>ad hominem</i> fallacy. Every argument should be dealt with on the face of its own merits. The history of the person making that argument does not enter into the equation unless givens are proposed, in which case trust becomes an issue.</p>
<p>I'm certainly not defending Dabljuh's attempts to evade his block, but if a comment was removed, make sure it's removed for the reason stated. I'm sure there are aspects of this I haven't considered, and there are probably policy violations he's committed which I'm ignorant of. These considerations do not alter my main contention, which is that Dabljuh responds better to engaged debate than he does to being ignored or punished.

<dd>I would like to point out that the original block of Dabljuh <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=58286151&amp;oldid=58285999" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=58286151&amp;oldid=58285999" rel="nofollow">lacked any basis</a> and I can very well understand that he feels treated unfair.

<p>I'm going to add my support here. Dab is outspoken and blunt, but he is quite capable of reason when treated reasonably. He is also entirely impatient with blocks that appear to have no basis whatsoever, which is understandable. Of course, he shouldn't be evading the block but I'm not clear why he was blocked in the first place. I realize he speaks out against popular policies, but since when has that ever been justification for a ban? I would think we should want editors to be active and controversial, rather than suppressing all dissent.</p>
<p>My take on Dab is that he's the sort who acts out only when provoked by unreasonable behavior. The solution, then, is not further unreasonable behavior but simply letting him speak. If you remove the block that shouldn't have been set in the first place, there will be nothing to evade, hence nothing to punish him further for. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus"><font color="darkcyan">Al</font></a> 02:41, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This might be a case of Ignore all the Rules. The initial block might have been a mistake. It sure seems not only ineffective but counter-effective. Its creating a bigger problem than we started with. If the goal is not submission, obedience but to get him to behave in accordance with the system and rules then we sometimes must be creative and use the right kind of tools to reinforce good behavior. Sometimes sticking to strict punsihments for rebelling, resulting in more rebellings, resulting in greater blocks, just spins negative cycle that only adds to the distruption. I say first the admin who did the block apologize and say he was sorry, he blocking was the wrong solution in this case and ask Dab to forgive him and that if he will be nice so will all the admins. Be extra nice and see if he will be nice in return. Use kindness as a tool. The carrot, not the stick. This approach will probalby work much better with Dab. If it fails, then too bad, back to the classic model. But, this is a good case to experiment given the personalities and the issues.<a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">Giovanni33</a> 03:28, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was kind of leaning toward an indef block against Dabljuh for disruption. I am shocked that you are suggesting that I should appologize for blocking a user who makes personal attacks after having a history of being blocked for personal attacks. If he cannot deal with a block for making personal attacks he should have not made them to begin with. He has outused the carrots a long time ago. --<a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinchasC_0ba2.html" title="User:PinchasC">PinchasC</a> | <a href="../../../p/i/n/User_talk%7EPinchasC_df31.html" title="User talk:PinchasC"><small>£€åV€ m€ å m€§§åg€</small></a> 03:35, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am, shocked that you refuse to apologize for blocking someone without any basis. There was no personal attack in the originally contested statement, and four users already told you so. All you do is to repeat yourself, unsupported with any argument.

<dd>Its not clear we have exhausted the carrot approach. Dab didn't see his comment as a personal attack and therefore we should assume good faith that didn't intend any such thing. Lets not hold his history against him, lets focus on the incident itself. I think a polite warning should have been tried first before the block, which is excessive. This is, in my view, part of the problem and is feeding a negative cycle. Oppression breeds resistence. He is just rebelling against what he pereceives to be an injustice. This is not wrong. We should back down and start over on a more correct footing. Otherwise we turn a good editor into a real distruptive bad one--even if he was never perfect to begin with. We should not be doing that just for egos. We can admit we are wrong and start over and make Wikipedia happy as that should be our real goal.<a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">Giovanni33</a> 04:10, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Doesn't it trouble you that he could make such a comment and fail to see that it is inappropriate? It's not as though he's naive. He's basically said in an <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Dabljuh_9749.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Dabljuh">RfC</a> on his behaviour that he knows he's incivil and he doesn't care. It's an attitute that is readily seen in his evasion of this block: "my opinion is more important than Wikipedia policy and other editors".</dd>

<dd>It's debatable as to whether it's a personal attack or simply extremely incivil, but why don't you try wandering into a synagogue and saying "hey, I hear you guys don't want to hear about why your stupid practices should be outlawed"?

<dd>This is a complete distortion of his statement.

<p>And if I said pork was delicious, should I be banned for anti-semitism? There will always be topics that certain people are unreasonably sensitive about, but that's no reason to walk on eggshells or to ban people who refuse to. The whole point of Dabljuh's post was to warn a newcomer about how unreasonably sensitive the pro-circ group is, and it's clear that he was correct. Unfortunately, there is still no basis for the original block. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus"><font color="darkcyan">Al</font></a> 19:05, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is nothing anti-semitic about saying that pork is delicious. Your opinion on the flavour of pork cannot in any way affect other people. Try to find a better example.</dd>
<dd>As for 'warning people about how unreasonably sensitive' people are, that is itself incivil. You do not, in a civilised discussion about editing an encyclopaedia, 'warn' people about other editors. As a minimum, it's divisive, and - as here - it unfairly misrepresents the editors and the situation. Furthermore, by giving such examples that would clearly violate NPOV, and dismissing objections as bias, it encourages the assumption of bad faith. <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakew_2ade.html" title="User:Jakew">Jakew</a> 19:20, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That's simply false. It is entirely civil and reasonable to warn people about a pattern of blocks caused by the oversensitivity of others. In a perfect world, there'd be nothing to warn about.

<p>User:Sussexman has used this talk forum in order to make a series of barely concealed legal threats against me on the grounds that I have made mention of a criminal conviction obtained by the subject Gregory Lauder Frost which in my opinion and the opinion of other administrators is essential to a fairer understanding of the article.</p>

<li>This complaint by Chilvers is against Sussexman. Not one of the above quotes which are <b>not from the Wikipedia</b> are by him, or by Lauder-Frost. So what is the point here? 86.129.79.148 20:09, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It appears (from the article's Talk page that it was suggested by another editor, User:Homeontherange, that Ed come here in order that he might reference Sussex's legal threats and incivility. SlimV, Fred Bauder, JzG, and other admins seem to be active in editing the article and discussing edits and user conduct on the article's talk page, so I'm inclined to think Ed's concerns might be better directed to them; they are, I think, already intimately familiar with the situation. AFAICT, Sussex has made legal threats (although, in this case, the new off-wiki comments guideline shouldn't apply; he has made on-wiki threats); many on the talk page, though, also seem to think Ed's been inserting material inappropriately (though I disagree), so I think this is a situation best dealt with my those who are well acquainted with the discussion. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 18:27, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In the past hour I have received the following threatening message on my talk page: <i>Good, 81.131. Let's hope that our British compatriot will be held to account for his activities. 86.129.79.148 17:43, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</i> (Under section "Your points answered") <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Edchilvers" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Edchilvers" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Edchilvers</a></p>
<ul>
<li>The problem with Chilvers is he came onto Wikipedia as part of his off-Wikipedia campaign (all to evident on Google - just type in Ed Chilvers) and has gone into overdrive smearing people, vandalising articles, etc etc. Hoping for something is not yet a crime or a threat. Or is it? He can give it but he cannot take it. 86.129.79.148 20:20, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I also feel the need to point out that an outstanding editor,<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumansdorpie_a9a9.html" title="User:Humansdorpie">User:Humansdorpie</a> has been hounded to quit Wikipedia altogether after a series of disgraceful legal threats made against him on his talk page by supporters of Mr Lauder Frost: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Humansdorpie#Gregory_Lauder-Frost" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Humansdorpie#Gregory_Lauder-Frost" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Humansdorpie#Gregory_Lauder-Frost</a> (See sections 'Gregory lauder Frost') <a href="../../../e/d/c/User%7EEdchilvers_d93e.html" title="User:Edchilvers">User:Edchilvers</a></p>
<ul>
<li>I have been on Wikipedia for about six months. I have witnessed more bullying, unnecessary smearing, biased attacks on articles, by politically motivated Users than anything Sussexman or GLF's supporters ever dreamt of. Humansdorpie made his fair share of irrelevant and sneering remarks and got a robust response. If he has drifted off it is of his own accord. One might say don't give it, Mr.Chilvers, if you cannot take it. 86.129.79.148 20:09, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, I wish to give my support to Sussexman who, unlike troublemaker Chilvers, has obviously done substantial research on the many good contributions to Wikipedia articles. He has defended Gregory Lauder-Frost's natural civil and human rights out of respect he had for someone he was familiar with and clearly respected some 15 years ago. That is all. 86.129.79.148 20:09, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>To repeat what I posted on Talk:Gregory Lauder-Frost:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I would like to point out that veiled threats by indirection are in my opinion still threats. I would urge Sussexman and sundry IP contributors to avoid anything along those lines. Further, I would encourage the cessation of personal characterisations of other Wikipedia contributors. Bluntly, it <i>is going to do you no good</i> and will simply serve to weaken your argument among Wikipedians neutral to your conflict, regardless of their appeal to your own factions. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorven_1e3d.html" title="User:Morven">Matthew Brown (Morven)</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorven_2a5f.html" title="User talk:Morven">T</a>:<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Morven_de06.html" title="Special:Contributions/Morven">C</a>) 20:34, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Then I must repeat also what I said on that page:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I hear what you say, but are you saying that anyone who supports GLF should just lie down and take everything that is often very provocatively thrown at them and various other articles on Wikipedia? As for "sundry IP contributors" most people with their funny titles (Homeontherange, et al) are 100% anonymous to the rest of us and act with impunity. Why does not having a funny name make us second-class citizens here? I am not appealing to any "faction" but to commonsence decency. 86.129.79.148 20:55, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To sum up (more detail on that page), my response is that you look better than an opponent if you comport yourself with dignity and do not stoop to their level. While IPs are no more anonymous than usernames, I have trouble distinguishing one from another and prefer addressing people who give me a name to use - my personal preference. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorven_1e3d.html" title="User:Morven">Matthew Brown (Morven)</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorven_2a5f.html" title="User talk:Morven">T</a>:<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Morven_de06.html" title="Special:Contributions/Morven">C</a>) 21:38, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I too wish to give my fullest support to Sussexman. All he has done is to advise malicious posters that they are breaking UK laws. He has not personally threatened anyone. How could he?

<dd>And certainly we didn't have a source for crap like "on her official message board are immediately removed and denied, as are similar references here on Wikipedia (her entry is continually edited to eliminate such information; see page history for details)."&#160;!!! The tv.com page referenced does not appear to be fact-checked, and certainly isn't a source <i>in itself</i>: they get their trivia from user submissions and might check it - but how much? TV.com's credits and 'biography' page are probably more reliable. And I simply can't believe anyone is proposing using "amiiannoying.com" as s source&#160;: in this particular case it says "Credit: Julie C", who doesn't appear to even be a regular poster, having submitted only that page as far as I can tell.

<p>This guy has many sockpuppets blocked on the NL and EN wiki, only has HEAVY personal attacks and blanking pages under this IP. Please no patience with this guy. Is there someone in the admin team who can follow this up closely and who I may contact when he returns with a different name... cause his been active for days again now, without any action whatsoever; and he's been promising for months he'll continue "attacking wikipedia"</p>
<p>You might ask admins on the NL-wiki to confirm the history of this guy.</p>

<dd>Thank you for addressing this. Not to prolong this or anything, but now I need to cite how many copies he's sold? I feel this is a bit extreme. Just because a few people havent heard of the author, doesnt mean that he is not a worthy source. While I understand why this article was deleted, it does appear that requiring 5000 of his books to be sold merits some bias. He <i>has</i> had 4 books published. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is a guideline, not a policy. I feel that this is a wrongful deletion and I quote <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html#Articles" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">Wikipedia:Criteria_for_speedy_deletion#Articles</a>:</dd>

<ul>
<li>Very short articles providing little or no context (e.g., "He is a funny man that has created Factory and the Hacienda. And, by the way, his wife is great."). <i>Limited content is not in itself a reason to delete if there is enough context to allow expansion.</i></li>
</ul>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I was getting ready to add to the page, previously stated here, and on the talk page of the article in question, so I do no see why this was deleted so fast.</dd>

<ul>
<li>The "Speedy deletion" policy governs limited cases where Wikipedia administrators may delete Wikipedia pages or media "on sight" without further debate, as in the cases of patent nonsense or pure vandalism.</li>
</ul>

<dd>This is also not the case. So I feel I can reopen the article, to add more to it, without using the sandbox. My first comment on the talk page was a request for other who have book sources for his bio to please add to it.</dd>

<dd>Yes and its also a guideline, and I do not have to submit to it. So thanks for commenting, but the page will in fact be reinstated unless an actual policy is stated to me. I've already requested that the admin who deleted it comment on the wp:ani page, but alas, he is on wiki-break.

<dd>Um, Zos, please don't be <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">rude</a> about this. I disagreed with the speedy delete, but the article that was deleted was, in fact, completely <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unreferenced</a>. Refusing to follow Wikipedia guidelines when writing articles will, in fact, lead to their deletion or avoidable disputes. If one of your readers, in this case Zoe, is telling you that they're not absolutely clear that the article belongs in Wikipedia, that should be a clear indication that the article needs work. We are, in fact, trying to write a great encyclopedia here. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 02:32, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Today has been especially active for folks incorrectly blocking AOL proxies. User:Can't Sleep Clown Will Eat Me blocked the <i>IP range,</i> and Curp's bot got a few users who resolved to AOL, and Drini blocked some IP's that resolve to AOL. The point is that at least one of the vandals operating from AOL appears to <i>know</i> that being blocked is going to result in damage to the project. He's counting on it. In other words, when people blindly reach for the indefinite blocks or the big blocks on him, that's actually accomplishing his vandalism and giving him his jollies. Again, if the IP resolves to AOL, please don't block for more than&#160;:15. I know they're pests. I know AOL sucks. I know that AOL shouldn't have access to the Internet. All of that is true, but there is nothing we can do about it except use SProtect more and debate whether or not the autoblocker should hit logged in users. (If it doesn't, the AOL problem is lessened, but the sockpuppet catching is destroyed.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 20:30, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, absolutely not. We cannot semi-protect each and every article that an AOL vandal touches. If there is evidence that some roaming AOL vandal is systematically hitting articles within a finite AOL range, it is completely reasonable to block that range, temporarily, for 15 minutes. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECan%27t_sleep%2C_clown_will_eat_me_7058.html" title="User:Can't sleep, clown will eat me">Can't sleep, clown will eat me</a> 21:04, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comment</b> I hope my history shows I am a good editor despite/because of my use of AOL (and I'm a Brit, I mean honestly...) Anyway, I am all in favour of assisting in the blocking of vandals and general trouble makers, and whilst I have been struck down by "collatoral damage" in the past and not been happy with it, I understand it is all down to being an AOL user. If I am stopped from editing for a short while then it is understandable; I know the problem will be resolved in time. I would rather know something was being done to stop the vandals than leaving AOL alone. <a href="../../../d/o/k/User%7EDoktorbuk_af25.html" title="User:Doktorbuk">doktorb</a> | <a href="../../../d/o/k/User_talk%7EDoktorbuk_4b6f.html" title="User talk:Doktorbuk">words</a> 23:21, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Wikipedia,</p>
<p>I'm just beginning to learn about your site and how to edit it. A few hours after I first edited the Emmaus High School, Emmaus, PA section, "PAWiki" deleted my comments without ground, etiquette or civility. I then went to "PAWiki"'s discussion area after viewing the history. Apparently other people have had trouble with this person. I just wanted to infom Wikipedia that I am very upset in my first efforts to contribute because of "PAWiki"s actions. My letter to the user who deleted my info is as follows:</p>
<p>to PAWiki-</p>
<p>Thanks (sarcastic) for deleting my first-ever edits on Wikipedia site. I put some data on the Emmaus High School page. I added information about Marty Nothstein being a noted alumni as a professional and olympic cyclist, and the Marine Fitness Team frequently being ranked #1 in the nation. I cannot link articles as you requested to my statements- I am a newcomer to Wikipedia. I was a cyclist myself who followed Marty closely in his Olympic debut though, and was on the Marine Fitness team under Coach Gibbs when the team won one of its many national championships. Maybe you are a self-proclaimed know-it-all about Pennsylvania, but you need to go back to college to learn how to deal with people and accept the fact that there are things out there you don't have a grasp of. Please feel free to correct my grammar as you choose- apparently you know everything about that also.</p>

<dd>Although I think that PAWiki was overzealous in deleting the Olympic medalist, the assertion of the marine fitness team's national championships really did need a link to something which verifies the claim. See <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> for explanation of proofs of claims. I do think that PAWiki should have discussed it first, or at best, put a "citation needed" tag on the article before deleting completely. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 21:39, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Zoe. The Marty Nothstein article was a redlink, and I think it's within an editor's discretion to want an article, to establish notability. Your personal involvement with the team is really irrelevant to the article, except that it perhaps makes it a little harder for you to keep this issue in perspective. Obviously more discussion would have been good, but that wasn't a bad edit, and the edit summary was constructive and civil. I think you should try to calm down and realize no offense was intended, and there was nothing personal in the edit. <b><span style="color: #f33">·<a href="../../../r/o/d/User_talk%7ERodii_6c72.html" title="User talk:Rodii"><span style="color: #669">&#160;rodii&#160;</span></a>·</span></b> 02:13, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Understood. I did need to calm down, and more time and knowledge of the Wikipedia site has helped. I recently read an article about the creator or Wikipedia and how he wants more quality information and less quantity on the site. With that, I'll be sure to do proper research before submitting again. Thank you for your discussion, I'll contribute again sometime. -no longer a first time user</p>

"Program" is the correct modern Australian spelling, and "programme" is regarded as archaic.

<p>It actually was not five weeks for a spelling change. <a href="../../../p/n/a/User%7EPnatt_7e2f.html" title="User:Pnatt">User:Pnatt</a> has only been on Wikipedia since April. In that time he had received continuous last warnings and 5 previous blocks, climbing from 24 hours right up to 1 month for continuous edit wars, misleading edit summaries, personal attacks, etc etc etc. Every time a block was imposed he was warned when he came back to stop behaving as in the past or he would be blocked again. Every time he would only be back on WP when he would take up where he left off and start the same behaviour all over again. On his <i>second</i> (yes, second) edit after the expiry of his last one month block he began the exact same edit warring on the exact same issues, abusing the exact same users, and carried on as if nothing happened. He had already been warned many times that such was his behaviour that the length of blocks would climb every time he was blocked until he stopped the edit warring and attacks. Given that it was a repeat performance of his previous behaviour, and the last block was for one month, this time, as warned, the block was upped again, this time to 5 weeks. BTW this user, when blocked, has also a habit of posting constant {{<a href="../../../h/e/l/Template%7EHelp_me_7760.html" title="Template:Help me">help me</a>}} messages on his talk page, to the annoyance of many users who keep telling him to stop doing it. For his last block, his posting of false templates and attacks necessitated that his talk page also be protected for the duration of the block. Already since this block another user have had to threaten to protect the page again to stop him posting the disruptive templates. At this stage this user has been blocked for more often than he has been allowed to edit Wikipedia. He had contributed little but edit wars and attacks. It is getting to the stage where quite possibly he should be blocked indefinitely. In less than two months he has contributed nothing but aggro and edit wars. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:green; background-color:pink"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 22:37, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>On investigation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Pnatt" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Pnatt" rel="nofollow">Pnatt's edits</a>, I must respectfully differ. His second edit on returning was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nine_Network&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=56958009" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nine_Network&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=56958009" rel="nofollow">this one</a>, where he changed the archaic "programmes" to "programs". He was absolutely correct in this, and he has cited several widely used sources, such as current Australian dictionaries and the Australian Government Style Manual. He has not been abusive, nor has he made misleading edit summaries. He referred to correction of vandalism, which from his perspective (and mine) it certainly is. Articles on Australian subjects should use current Australian spelling, and when such a conservative network as the <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/tv/programs/" class="external text" title="http://www.abc.net.au/tv/programs/" rel="nofollow">Australian Broadcasting Commission</a> uses "program", we may safely say that this spelling is current. He does not deserve a five week block for making beneficial edits. New editors should be guided rather than chastised, and whatever his past sins may have been, he does not seem to have resumed them. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperJumbo_33a0.html" title="User:SuperJumbo">Jumbo</a> 23:57, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Referring to others' good faith edits as vandalism is provocative and incorrect. I'm not surprised it upsets people. "Vandalism" is when someone is trying to make the encyclopedia worse, not better. There's no compelling reason to think that someone using the spelling "programme" is trying to compromise the quality or integrity of Wikipedia - they probably think that's an acceptable spelling. I suggest that this user (and everyone) refrain from characterizing the other side of a style dispute as "vandals". -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 19:29, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The user is occasionally very incivil in his edit summaries (e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Pnatt&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=51637479" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Pnatt&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=51637479" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>)</li>
<li>This user spends a lot of time in revert wars, often with really strong POV statements such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Japan&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=49580001" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Japan&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=49580001" rel="nofollow">this one</a></li>

<p>Although I personally saw this latest edit war and was not planning on blocking him myself, I do support the block. -- <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesTeterenko_c1e2.html" title="User:JamesTeterenko">JamesTeterenko</a> 23:59, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for that. Some of those early edits are disturbing. However, I note that since returning he has made no similar edits. Maybe he HAS listened to advice this time? He has hardly been given a chance and if we can make a productive editor out of him than turning him into <a href="http://www.chaser.com.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3170&amp;Itemid=31another" class="external text" title="http://www.chaser.com.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3170&amp;Itemid=31another" rel="nofollow">an embittered critic of Wikipedia</a>, then so much the better. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperJumbo_33a0.html" title="User:SuperJumbo">Jumbo</a> 00:16, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In the very brief period before he was reblocked, his edit summaries included the misleading "revert vandalism" twice and he tells an editor <i>" "Program" is the preferable spelling, like it or not"</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Beneaththelandslide&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=56994319" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Beneaththelandslide&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=56994319" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>. That does not suggest to me that this editor is close to being 'reformed'. Note that "being right" is never an excuse for continuous edit warring (since everyone's right in at least one person's opinion). We have a dispute resolution process for people who think they're right when the other editors don't, and "edit warring" does not feature in any stage. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 09:02, 6 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>He is not alone in stating that he is right. Other Australian editors prefer "program" over "programme". The naming of articles and categories such as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_programs_broadcast_by_Seven_Network_b7af.html" title="List of programs broadcast by Seven Network">List of programs broadcast by Seven Network</a> indicate that this has been the preferred spelling for some time. Government and university style guides state "program not programme". The Macquarie Dictionary - the acknowledged standard for Australian English - has a headword for "program" and not for "programme". (See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Australian_English#Program.2FProgramme" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Australian_English#Program.2FProgramme" rel="nofollow">here</a> for a page scan.) I had not given this matter much thought until this morning, but all my research indicates that he is entirely correct, and quite entitled to think of reversion to an archaic form as "vandalism". I note that it is common practice amongst established editors to label such small details as vandalism: here is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Diana%2C_Princess_of_Wales&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=52203728" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Diana%2C_Princess_of_Wales&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=52203728" rel="nofollow">one</a> from the blocking editor, who could be described as Wikipedia's revert warrior <i>par excellence</i>, judging by his extraordinary edit history.</dd>
<dd>However, some of Pnatt's early edits and attitude (as pointed out earlier, for which many thanks, JamesTeterenko) trouble me deeply, and if he had returned to this style of editing, then I would not feel inclined to defend him at all. But there seems to be a gradual improvement in his attitude, and I feel that imposing a five week block and threatening longer for such a small impoliteness in a new editor is going too far. Such long blocks are more properly the preserve of the ArbCom, imposed for more serious and protracted matters. I feel that this matter should have been handled so as reduce confrontation and encourage co-operation. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperJumbo_33a0.html" title="User:SuperJumbo">Jumbo</a> 09:34, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I thought this comment from him was extremely encouraging: "<i>After the recent 4-week block I made a choice that if I wanted to stay on Wikipedia, that I would have to make reliable and factually correct edits.</i>" Now one more avenue of communication has been blocked off, and heaven knows what his opinion of Wikipedia management is now.

<dd>He wasn't altering template text, he was adding a template that he knew damn well he wasn't allowed to add again.

<dd>With respect, this behaviour came <b>after</b> he received a block of five weeks! I suggest that with sufficient provocation even the most angelic editor is going to get hot under the collar. On being unblocked - after a four week block - his Wikistress was at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Pnatt&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=56957691" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Pnatt&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=56957691" rel="nofollow">three</a>.

<dd>I repeat - his page has been protected <i><b>five times</b></i> now for abuse of the {{<a href="../../../u/n/b/Template%7EUnblock_0164.html" title="Template:Unblock">unblock</a>}} template. The first time can be put down to ignorance, the second to frustation (or 'provocation'), but the third is downright refusal to listen, and the fourth and fifth are just taking the piss. It looks like no-one is willing to lift or shorten the five-week block, so I simply don't buy that throughout his block he should be allowed to continue adding {{<a href="../../../u/n/b/Template%7EUnblock_0164.html" title="Template:Unblock">unblock</a>}} templates and get in the way of legitimate requests because he was 'provoked'. The block is, after all, already under review - the {{<a href="../../../u/n/b/Template%7EUnblock_0164.html" title="Template:Unblock">unblock</a>}} template is for getting a second opinion and there are plenty of those here. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 13:39, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I disagree on your reading of his motivation: "just taking the piss". It seems to me that this new editor feels he has been unfairly blocked and nobody gives a damn, except to kick him in the face longer and harder. I ask again, wouldn't YOU be stressed and upset under such circumstances? If your Wikistress level was set to "ready to pop', then how much would you care about niceties of policy? This editor started off on the wrong foot with some attitude problems, but all I see is steady improvement despite severe provocation. I'd like to see understanding and co-operation next time around. If he feels interested enough to return. In the meantime I can only imagine what he is saying about Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperJumbo_33a0.html" title="User:SuperJumbo">Jumbo</a> 21:01, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>He can have all the understanding he likes when he stops doing the same things that get him blocked and his talk page protected, over, and over, and over again. I don't know what he's saying about Wikipedia, but the truth would be along the lines of "Wikipedia has better things to do than act as the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">battleground</a> for people who obsess over dialect spellings". --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 23:06, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>With respect, you shouldn't lump the two misbehaviours together. It takes two to make a battle, and his changing of "programme" to "program" was quite correct, in Good Faith and he provided sources. See the discussion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Australian_English#Program.2FProgramme" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Australian_English#Program.2FProgramme" rel="nofollow">here.</a> This should have been discussed at the time by the other parties, but apparently they chose to revert without discussion. His edit summary when he was reverted was perhaps a little incivil, but certainly not worth a five week block, which is what he got, with the promise of a much longer one. On that note, the blocking admin appears to be a big booster of monarchies and nobility around the world and <a href="../../../p/n/a/User%7EPnatt_7e2f.html" title="User:Pnatt">User:Pnatt</a> is apparently not. There may be some issues there. However, as has been pointed out, there are far worse examples of incivility in edit summaries which go unpunished.</dd>
<dd><b>After</b> he was given a five week block for doing what he regarded as improving the encyclopaedia, then he sought outside assistance. I imagine that, as his Wikistress level indicates, he was quite upset. It is quite unfair to justify this very long block by what he did <i>after</i> getting it.</dd>
<dd>I am also quite concerned that the increasing improvement in his behaviour has been met with increasing harshness of treatment. He has also stated that he wants to be a good editor and this has been ignored. Surely he should be assisted in his stated aim rather than beaten and abused until he gives up in disgust? --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperJumbo_33a0.html" title="User:SuperJumbo">Jumbo</a> 00:20, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

This is the very heart of many accusations of admin abuse, and so unnecessary.

<dd>I have to say having followed his edits that I see no evidence of good faith whatsoever. All I see is a user who has consistently sought to pick fights, waged edit wars, attacked other users and contributed little of value on WP. The fact that his <i>second</i> action after coming back from a month's block was to pick a fight and start an edit war suggests no evidence whatsoever of good faith. His behaviour has not changed one iota no matter how many warnings and blocks he has had. Do you really believe that removing a block will produce a change? I very much doubt it. If the block is removed the odds are, going by past behaviour, that he will be edit warring within minutes and will end up blocked again almost straight away. Even when blocked he then uses his own talk page to cause so much trouble that <i>that</i> ends up having to be locked repeatedly and users who have had no experience with him before end up leaving messages on his talk page in sheer frustration telling him to stop. Users who cause the amount of trouble, who cause so much edit wars, who get so many warnings and so many blocks in such a small space of time (he has only been on since April) at this stage usually find themselves blocked indefinitely. If he is unblocked, the odds are that we will be back here almost straight away dealing with yet more edit warring by him, with those who have had to deal with him in the past saying "I told you so." If he is let back, it needs to be made clear to him that <i>any</i> more abuse of his position will lead to a long block. But then if a month's block isn't enough to cure him of his edit warring, what length will? <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:green; background-color:pink"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 23:30, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>His second action after coming back from a long block was to correct an error. That wasn't picking a fight or starting an edit war. He quoted sources and was quite justified in his edit. You seem to want to punish him all over again for his actions of five weeks ago, which seems wrong to me, especially as he has stated that he wants to be a good editor from now on.

<dd>Sorry Jumbo, you are missing the point. That user didn't simply correct an error. His past behaviour involved edit warring over use of language, spelling and Australian English usage. He had been involved in very bitter exchanges with <a href="../../../x/t/r/User%7EXtra_5b60.html" title="User:Xtra">Xtra</a>. There are over one million articles on Wikipedia, yet he chose the <i>same</i> issue, with the <i>same</i> users, to start off his post-block edits. Going <i>straight back</i> to the very topic that had got him repeatedly warned for his behaviour, picked up where he went off and started <i>yet</i> another row on the issue is tactless to put it mildly. Posting an edit summary <i>revert vandalism by Xtra</i> sums up his approach. It is hard to believe that someone who <i>deliberately</i> targets the same topic after repeated blocks for his behaviour on the issue before, and who seems to target someone he had been rowing with before, is anything other than a troll. He could have edited anywhere on Wikipedia. He chose to go straight back to his old fighting on the same topic with the same users. That pretty much sums up his attitude and explains why he has been repeatedly banned, and going by past behaviour, why he will no doubt be banned again. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:green; background-color:pink"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 20:15, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry for butting in. Am I allowed to ask this editor how old he is? I know, I know, it shouldn't matter but after reading his/her talk page I sense alot of immaturity, sorry dude,dudette...If Jumbo would like to mentor/monitor this editor, that seems like a nice solution, imo. I know there is a definate learning curve to this project, but after repeated attempts at correcting behavoir, the wood has to be layed down it seems. This user says on his talk page "I can't help myself" and that concerns me a little...anyways, I'll butt back out now, thanks! --<a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThreeafterthree_41a1.html" title="User:Threeafterthree">Tom</a> 14:57, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Pnatt has expressed intent to be a good citizen. As we agree, it was an unwise choice of edit for soon after his block, but it turns out that this spelling change has been accepted in those articles once they were considered. Both spellings appear to be acceptable in Australian English, and "program" is listed as the primary one in two different Australian dictionaries, as well as having been the original spelling in at least one of those articles. I feel confident that he knows he is very closely watched, and in fear of being blocked again. A previous version of his user page said he had some sort of compulsive disorder, which perhaps explains the "can't help myself" comment (but does not <i>excuse</i> bad behaviour, only <i>explain</i> it). The debate on this page should be about whether 5 weeks was an appropriate response to <b>this</b> action. Would I have been blocked for making that edit? I have been known to change "kilometer" to "kilometre" in Australian articles without getting myself blocked. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">Scott Davis</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottDavis_9428.html" title="User talk:ScottDavis">Talk</a></sup> 09:16, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The only way you would have been blocked for that length is if you had received repeated final warnings, had gotten yourself repeatedly blocked five times in almost as many weeks, had ignored each block and when back continued the exact same edit warring against the same people despite appeals to stop, had been told unambiguously that the length of block would climb each time until the provocative edit warring stopped, and after a months block had finished had gone <i>straight</i> back to the <i>exact</i> same edit warring on exactly the same edit war you had been warned about, coupled with posting provocative edit summaries to someone you have been warring with accusing them of vandalism. The issue is not the spelling. It is the behaviour continually since April. Maybe the five week block will finally get it through to him that when users all over the place tell him to stop picking fights and waging edit wars he'd better stop. Or else, as has happened with the various users who have blocked him in the past, the length of block will <i>continue to climb</i> until the fighting and provoking of edit wars stops. All he has to do to stop being blocked is contribute to Wikipedia and work with users. All he has done practically every time is, as soon as a block ends, come in fists first to start off the next round. <i>That</i> was the game behind the spelling change. He starts his fight off that way, and users who was had to deal with him knew immediately that this was no "oh lets correct a spelling". It was round six of his warring, his opening move in the next edit war he wanted to ignite. And <i>that</i> is why, as he had clearly been warned, he was blocked and the length of blocked upped from the last time. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:green; background-color:pink"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 21:33, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In the face of <b>improving</b> behaviour, handing out ever-longer blocks is hard to justify, as has been demonstrated above.

<dd>"improving behaviour"!!! lol He has consistently been getting worse, making less credible edits and trying to provoke more edit wars. Jumping straight back in to restart an edit war on his second edit is anything not improving behaviour. Deliberately posting an edit summary calling the edits someone he rowed regularly in the past made "vandalism" is not evidence of improving behaviour. I'm afraid your efforts to santify someone who has contribution little to Wikipedia but rows, edit wars and who got more warnings and blocks in two months (from a host of users) than most users would get in a decade, is wearing a little thin. He wasn't making a spelling correction. He was, as in the past, trying to provoke an edit war on the topic of language usage. Anyone who had dealt with him in the past knew exactly what his game plan was. They'd seen it over and over again. You, who didn't deal with him, still niavely don't get it and think him some niave little newbie. He behaviour since April shows him to be anything but some niave little newbie but someone constantly edit warring in a provocative way on the same topic and trying every time he gets the chance to restart his battles and attack his critics. Credible users don't spend two months doing that despite constant warnings from everyone to stop. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:green; background-color:pink"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 23:16, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I should not have to ask an admin to calm down, but please do so. Looking at Pnatt's edits, there is no doubt that he began his wikicareer with some very disturbing edits, but he recently said, "After the recent 4-week block I made a choice that if I wanted to stay on Wikipedia, that I would have to make reliable and factually correct edits." His first act was to correct "programme" to "program". In Australian usage, "program" is the far more widely accepted spelling. That is not provoking an edit war, that is improving our encyclopaedia. The fact that he got reverted and given a very long block was understandably unjust to him, and expressing his indignation a natural thing to do. On examining the example he has been set, who can blame him?</dd>

<dd>I would like to see how he performs when he returns to editing. If he returns to the behaviour he exhibited at first, then I shall have no hesitation in dropping any support. I have the same repugnance for vandalism and personal attacks as any other editor. But I must ask that he not be antagonised and goaded into misbehaving, especially when he has expressed a desire to follow the righteous path. Let's see if we can turn him into a worthwhile contributor. Please. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperJumbo_33a0.html" title="User:SuperJumbo">Jumbo</a> 00:33, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Jumbo. In the short time between the current and previous blocks, Pnatt demonstrated improved behaviour. He edited three articles, and <b>all</b> of his changes remain in those articles almost two weeks later. Theses are not "less credible edits" as User:jtdirl AKA FearÉIREANN claims. The first two edits had correct and useful edit summaries (3rd and 4th had no summary). User:Xtra (who had previous run-ins with Pnatt) almost immediately reverted the first two edits, also with reasonable edit summaries. Six hours later, things went downhill. Next time, Pnatt will be expected to use a talk page after the first revert, not the third, and to keep his edit summaries civil like he has showed he can. If he stuffs up again, he will have no supporters at all. Past behaviour should not have been used in the decision whether to block, only to decide how long it should be. This time round, a polite reminder note was the appropriate solution, not a block. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">Scott Davis</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottDavis_9428.html" title="User talk:ScottDavis">Talk</a></sup> 07:51, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It is the difference between a blatant vandal that is blocked on sight to a person that would end up being blocked through a <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAr_9ea1.html" title="WP:RFAr">WP:RFAr</a>.

<dd>I'm rapidly becoming fed up with the behaviour of everyone involved in this. Including myself for poking my curious nose in. Please, could everyone stop provoking each other over such utter trivia? When his block expires, we'll all keep an eye on him and his behaviour will be obvious. What <b>is</b> obvious at the moment is that some of the admins involved are engaging in undiscussed reverts and abuse ("morons" is hardly professional language, Xtra!) and these are the very things that got Pnatt blocked. Understandably he perceives the whole Wikipedia thing as a case of "ignore the rules if you are an admin". --20:59, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think the best thing we can all do is just close this discussion and when the block expires watch his behaviour closely.

<p>He basically seems to accuse anyone who removes the pov passages from the article of being Jews. I am really not sure that Shamir is even notable enough for an encyclopedia article, and especially not such a long one.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 19:12, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think he's notable enough to have an article. I have no reason to believe User:Israel shamir is not <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel_Shamir_9e98.html" title="Israel Shamir">Israel Shamir</a> (though, to be frank, there's some debate on whether Israel Shamir is Israel Shamir), I just have no proof that the user and the subject of the article are the same person and don't want to make an assumption either way.</p>
<p>My problem is with this user's anti-Semitic slurs both in asserting a "Jewish conpiracy" and in inverting the historical fact of anti-Jewish pogroms by accusing Jews of launching a pogrom against him, a Christian. He's crossed the line from incivility into base racism and should be blocked indefinitely. Homey 19:39, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I totally agree. Accepting Shamir's "philosemite" slurs against editors would be much the same as putting up with a contributor calling opponents "niggerlovers". Also the user has steadily ignored, as far as I can see, the exhortations on his talkpage to say whether he's really Shamir or not, and to either a) stop adding OR and opinions to the article if he is, or to b) change his username if he's not. As for notability, I doubt that he's remotely wellknown even in Sweden where he lives. I'm Swedish and take an interest in these matters, and I haven't heard of him. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 19:53, 14 June 2006 (UTC).

<dd>That is a separate issue. The issue here is this user, and any way you slice it he does not belong as an editor here. His comments were deeply offensive even to a parochial school kid like me.

<dd>I don't have a lot of time today to go into much more depth than others already have on this issue, but I have to say Timothy Usher's analysis hits the bulls eye. "Outrageous is only appropriate because a stronger word doesn't exsist...and outrageous leads to only one conclusion: this guy is unacceptable. If we can't get non-trolling unanimity that he should be blocked indefinitely at this point as a useless editor, I don't see that he'll be with us much longer anyways...if we're not going to all agree, we may as well just stop talking about whether or not we should, right now, and just let the blocks get longer and longer until he's finally booted permanently. From what I'm seeing, dragging it out like that does nothing but give him more opportunities to disrupt WP and wastes a great deal of other editors' time.</dd>

<p>Hey -- can someone please help me out with this? Through the course of discussion on <a href="../../../s/h/o/Talk%7EShock_site_56f7.html" title="Talk:Shock site">Talk:Shock site</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_shock_sites_5251.html" title="Talk:List of shock sites">Talk:List of shock sites</a> before the two pages were merged, we've built some consensus about certain sites. One site in particular, "porkhole," we rejected because it gets very few Google hits, a puny Alexa rank, and we didn't have any sources for it. However, a particular anonymous user, User:67.22.144.93, has added "porkhole" back to the article at least 2 dozen times in the last month. The first several times when I reverted this, I have asked in the edit summary for discussion to be made. Eventually, I started leaving spam warnings on the user's talk page (after all the pleas for discussion, I figured this person must be trying to promote the porkhole site for whatever reason). Earlier today, the user <i>finally</i> asked me on my talk page why I was opposing porkhole, and I explained thoroughly on his/her talk page: basically, the reasons we had for the consensus, and that they should enter the discussion instead of just repeatedly adding the site back. Nonetheless, they have continued to add porkhole back to the list. I don't know what should be done, exactly, so I'd like someone to take a look at the situation and do what they can.</p>
<p>As a note, I requested semi-protection for the page a while back and it was denied. Many other anonymous IP editors have added random non-notable sites to the list that we've had to revert, on top of this continual re-introduction of porkhole, but it was felt that this wasn't frequent enough to justify semi-protection. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 03:36, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have recently put up verify and citeneeded tags on this article where information was not cited through direct citations or through the external links. The user Guettarda informed me that it was an abuse of tags but I feel that it is not so since the info in articles must be verifiable and cited and comply with <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. Perhaps I am wrong but Guettarda seems defiant on accusing me of Wikistalking which I have been adamantly denying and thus refuses to point me in the direction of the appropriate policy which regards the abuse of tags. I'm not quite sure how to deal with this situation. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 05:11, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Fundamentally, there is no reason to use {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}} when the information is not disputed by anyone and has been affirmed by the subject of the article. Sure, we need sources that meet <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. But we don't need a plethora of tags when the content is not in dispute.</dd>
<dd>The real issue though is one of harrassment. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> (<a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStrothra_f129.html" title="User talk:Strothra">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Strothra_7dee.html" title="Special:Contributions/Strothra">contribs</a>) has been engaging in a campaign of low-level harrassment against <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETaranRampersad_d7aa.html" title="User:TaranRampersad">TaranRampersad</a> (<a href="../../../t/a/r/User_talk%7ETaranRampersad_e8b3.html" title="User talk:TaranRampersad">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TaranRampersad_e8b1.html" title="Special:Contributions/TaranRampersad">contribs</a>) for the past couple weeks. The dispute between the two users began when Taran complained about a number of articles that Strothra had listed on AFD. Strothra retaliated by adding {{<a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnreferenced_31dd.html" title="Template:Unreferenced">unreferenced</a>}} to the latest articles that Taran had edited. When I saw that, I told Strothra that behaviour like that is often seen as bad form, and that you shouldn't dig through the contributions of someone with whom you were in conflict - that things like have prompted accusations of Wikistalking in the past.</dd>
<dd>I hoped that I had defused the issue, but Strothra followed this up by nominating Taran Rampersad for deletion, and seeking out the support of other self-identified deletionists when he got no support at AFD (e.g., <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Proto&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=58575546" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Proto&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=58575546" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>). He also continued to harrass Taran to the point where he considered leaving the project (note: while he is not a high volume editor, Taran has been here since early 2003 and has also done much to boost Wikipedia in other fora). I honestly think that Strothra has abused his editing privileges. Despite evidence to the contrary (e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ATaranRampersad&amp;diff=58709292&amp;oldid=58686444" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ATaranRampersad&amp;diff=58709292&amp;oldid=58686444" rel="nofollow">[33]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ATaranRampersad&amp;diff=58760032&amp;oldid=58710067" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ATaranRampersad&amp;diff=58760032&amp;oldid=58710067" rel="nofollow">[34]</a>), Strothra insists that he has not been in conflict with Taran and is doing nothing wrong. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 06:21, 17 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I did not seek out the support of other deletionists because they were deletionists or because I wanted them to delete the article. I asked Proto (the only said deletionist I contacted) to relist the nom as I felt it merited further discussion. He was not the only admin I requested to do that and I'm not surprised that your usage of my requests is selective as it would damage your argument. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Naconkantari/archive4&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=58496942" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Naconkantari/archive4&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=58496942" rel="nofollow">[35]</a> Other admins have also seen fit to state that this information needs to be sourced as per my <a href="../../../3/o/_/WP%7E3O_1830.html" title="WP:3O">WP:3O</a> request to bring in a neutral third party which Guettarda clearly is not. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ATaran_Rampersad&amp;diff=59078175&amp;oldid=59012576" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ATaran_Rampersad&amp;diff=59078175&amp;oldid=59012576" rel="nofollow">[36]</a>.

<p>PatCheng continues to rant and rave in the mailing list at the same time that he is returning via anon IPs to continue his harassment and disruptive revert warring.</p>
<p>You can see on his first ranting <a href="http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2006-June/048757.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2006-June/048757.html" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>, among other things, that he was observing the <a href="../../../a/b/u/Talk%7EAbu_Musab_al-Zarqawi_01f3.html" title="Talk:Abu Musab al-Zarqawi">Talk:Abu Musab al-Zarqawi</a> page when I briefly visited it around the time of the reports of his death.

<p>Let's be clear about what the evidence shows. That the anonymous person in question:</p>
<ol>
<li>Was observing the <a href="../../../a/b/u/Talk%7EAbu_Musab_al-Zarqawi_01f3.html" title="Talk:Abu Musab al-Zarqawi">Talk:Abu Musab al-Zarqawi</a> page in a narrow frame of time.</li>
<li>Reinstated the deletion of a personal attack (referenced specifically by PatCheng).</li>
<li>Is from Australia.</li>
<li>Is revert warring.</li>
<li>Has been posting harassing information on ANI and talk pages concerning my IP addresses.</li>
</ol>
<p>PatCheng is the only person who meets all of these qualifications and has reason to do so.</p>
<p>In other words, he has not merely created blatant sockpuppets to extend his campaign for parole, but he is busy continuing the same disruptive practices that helped to get him blocked in the first place, even as he gives token "apologies" for his behavior and pledges to stop revert warring "as a compromise" for his return. He obviously feels he has the license to behave this way unimpeded in any case, but is on the mailing list simply to seek official sanction from administrators to do so with their blessing. I hope everyone can now see his crocodile tears for what they are. --<a href="../../../t/j/i/User%7ETJive_a615.html" title="User:TJive">TJive</a> 07:41, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This was brought up previously, I am sorry it seems to be rehashed yet again. Following the users block they have continued to revert articles removing all mention of Operation Iraqi Freedom from wikipedia. I once again ask for an admin to please clarify to me if the policy is that operation names cannot be used anywhere in articles. I am fine with them being removed from titles perhaps, but this user is removing them from the body of the articles now. Two previous discussions took place here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive108#User:A.C3.B1oranza" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive108#User:A.C3.B1oranza" rel="nofollow">[53]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive108#User:A.C3.B1oranza_again" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive108#User:A.C3.B1oranza_again" rel="nofollow">[54]</a>.

Even as good-faith editing isn't vandalism, it can nevertheless be disruptive, and blocks can, I think, be appropriate even for users who edit toward the end of improving the encyclopedia (I don't think a block is yet appropriate here, but I can imagine a situation under which a short block to prevent continued disruption might be in order). <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 23:51, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it sets a bad precedent to suggest a block for an inconvenient good-faith edit, when editors are in the first instance encouraged to—be bold! Then any edit one disagrees with can be classified as disruptive and administrators would encroach into the editing process in a way which has not been seen as their prerogative. There are established ways of dealing with edit disputes, which is what this appears to be. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 00:15, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is not a matter of "an inconvenient good-faith edit", but rather repeated edit warring, with literally no attempt at discussion, against Wikipedia policy. She <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ALucy-marie&amp;diff=58990393&amp;oldid=58987801" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ALucy-marie&amp;diff=58990393&amp;oldid=58987801" rel="nofollow">crossed out</a> warnings placed on her talk page and proceeded with a further round of edit warring. I'm not sure that your visions of the oppression of minority opinion are applicable. I agree with Joe that a block would be premature, but I believe that if this proceeds an administrator should at least step in and warn her. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 01:38, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, like Tom, I don't mean to suggest that ill-advised or poorly-made edits ought to result in blocks. Where a user edits in good faith, where disruption concomitant to that editing is avolitional, the net effect of his/her contributions may be disruptive; even as one may make valuable edits to some articles, he/she may also make less-than-constructive edits the reversion/repair of which consumes the time and energy of other editors who might otherwise contribute productively. When a user, irrespective of his/her intentions, proves a baneful influence, the community's patience might be exhausted. Never ought we to block a user simply for his/her non-conversance with the project, but where a user demonstrate profound intransigence in dealing with other editors, eschewing the collaborative process on which the project depends, we've a different. Now, the editing here isn't particularly disruptive; it's fairly easy to revert redirects. If we had, though, a user whose English was so poor as to render his/her contributions less-than-useful, and were he/she apprised of the problem and, whether as a result of intrinsic intractability, intellecutal infirmity, or some other factor, didn't reply to the entreaties of other users and continued to disrupt the project, a block might be in order. This would, I think, be consistent with <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_therapy_a7d9.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not therapy">Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not therapy</a> (not, of course, a guideline or policy), a fundamental assumption of which is that an editor who acts in good faith but cannot help but disrupt the project, having been asked by other editors to stop disrupting, may be blocked indefinitely. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 04:03, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've checked out the article history and relevant discussion pages. It seems to me this dispute is at an early stage and relatively light-weight compared with many of the edit disputes in Wiki, and that there needs to be a lot more discussion first. There is hardly any at the moment. It is a penalty of the collaborative process that these differences occur, and they need patience to address. I don't think it's the best approach to this to talk about good-faith edits which are disruptive, as the same argument could easily be put the other way round. However, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:200.38.7.41&amp;diff=57951314&amp;oldid=22767090" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:200.38.7.41&amp;diff=57951314&amp;oldid=22767090" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> is certainly a cause for concern. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 13:33, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yesterday, I, stevenscollege, and others worked together to produce a section on Jake's friendship with Austin Nichols. Since then, this section has been reverted repeatedly by an IP number, 64.12.116.137, which has also, upon looking at the history, also vandalised many other pages.</p>
<p>Since making our edits, both my and stevenscollege's user pages have been blanked, by 64.12.116.7 for my page and 64.12.116.199 for stevenscollege. Given that the vandalism patterns are the same, and my page has never been vandalised before, I can only conclude that this was the revenge of someone who did not want that edit up there, but knew they couldn't fight consensus. However, because all these IP numbers are used by Aol, I don't know what to do.

<dd>Imacomp is being unfairly targeted here. He made some good faith edits to the article because he has concerns about the veracity of certain statements in the article. He attempted to introduce cited material to show a contrary view, only to have his material summarily dismissed. While I do think he showed a lack of patience in dealing with this dismissal, I do understand his frustration. A look at the edit history, talk page and talk page history should surfice to show that there is another side to any claim of "disruption". <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 17:35, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>I need an advocate who will walk me through the mediation process.</p>
<p>I am trying to get the following added to the Many Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics. Max Tegark is a renown physicist and a PhD profressor of cosmology at MIT. He agrees with my addition. Please note that I have supported everything I wish to add on the talk page of the article, and nothing I wish to add is original research. I only wish I had the ability to do original research in theoretical physics.</p>
<p>For a good explanation of Hugh Everett's Many World Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics please see Michael Clive Price's Hugh Everett FAQ: <a href="http://www.hedweb.com/manworld.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.hedweb.com/manworld.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.hedweb.com/manworld.htm</a></p>
<p>Hugh Everett's Interpretation does not add one equation to quantum mechanics. An article filled with equations only obscures the significance of his theory.</p>
<p>I am having problem with an editor by the name of Lethe who follows me around Wikipedia reverting all my edits without commentary.</p>
<p>I have tried reasoning with him on discussion pages, but he refuses to read what I write.</p>
<p><b>Advantages of MWI</b></p>
<p>If Hugh Everett's theory was just another interpretation of Quantum Mechanics it would have no followers, especially since it proposes the existence of countless other universes which theoretically can never be observed. Because it is not falsifiable it seemingly violates Popper's criteria for a good scientific theory. The reason it has so many adherents is because it offers numerous advantages over the Copenhagen Interpretation, among which are the following:</p>
<p>1. Quantum mechanics becomes a deterministic theory making it more compatible with the theory of relativity and all other physics theory to date which are all deterministic. The Copenhagen Interpretation introduced indeterminacy and randomness into science. Aside from the Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics there is no scientific theory that includes indeterminacy or randomness. Einstein particularly objected to this aspect of the Copenhagen Interpretation. In response to it, he said, "God does not play dice with the universe."</p>
<p>2. It eliminates the "measurement problem."</p>
<p>3. It eliminates Von Neumann's "boundary problem": where to draw the line between the micro world where quantum mechanics applies, and the macro world where it does not. Shortly before his death in 1953, Albert Einstein wrote: "Like the moon has a definite position whether or not we look at the moon, the same must also hold for the atomic objects, as there is no sharp distinction possible between these and macroscopic objects."</p>
<p>4. It eliminates the special place for an observer and human consciousness.</p>
<p>5. It restores objective reality of the universe between measurements. Shortly before his death, Albert Einstein also wrote: "Observation cannot CREATE an element of reality like a position, there must be something contained in the complete description of physical reality which corresponds to the possibility of observing a position, already before the observation has been actually made."</p>
<p>6. The wave-particle duality paradox evaporates. It does away with Bohr's "principle of complimentarity." It simply and naturally explains the double-slit experiment. Richard Feynman said, "[the double-slit experiment] has in it the heart of quantum mechanics. In reality it contains the only mystery." David Deutcsh wrote: ". . . the argument for the many worlds was won with the double-slit experiment."</p>
<p>7. Schrodinger's Cat paradox evaporates.</p>
<p>Einstein's main objections with quantum mechanics had more to do with the Copenhagen Interpretation, than with quantum mechanics itself. While MWI does not quite generate the kinds of worlds necessary to justify the anthropic principle, it is a step on the way to Stephen Hawking's No Boundary Proposal and Max Tegmark's All Universe Hypothesis which do justify the anthropic principle.</p>
<p>John Wheeler was Everett's thesis advisor. He put his name on Everett's thesis, but later criticized it as "carrying too much metaphysical baggage." Hugh Everett left physics because of the poor reception his theory received. It initially attracted no followers and was largely ignored. It gained adhereants in the 1980s, and today is considered a mainstream interprepation.</p>

<p>I have filed for mediation in the long-standing and very problematic Golden Dawn articles, as I am attempting to resolve this situation and make ground with a mediator involved. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrater_FiatLux_1c04.html" title="User:Frater FiatLux">Frater FiatLux</a> 14:22, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I removed the rest of the complaint; it does not seem to require administrator intervention. You can see it in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;oldid=59278292" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;oldid=59278292" rel="nofollow">history</a> if you are interested.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>It looks like the page has been fixed; Essjay has asked that the issues be described in brief bullet points. Since Zos has agreed to mediation, the only dispute would seem to be over how to word the application. Why don't you try working on a set of bullet points on a user subpage until you get a description of the problem that you both can live with. ("Zos says article X should say Y; Frater believes it should say Z.") <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 15:18, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I will do so as the mediator that contacted me asked me to do so, this was not what I asking advice for.</p>
<p>The problem was that user Zos had edited the medaition page and also added commentary, this is aganst mediation protocol as stated on the mediation page. Please refer to the version in the history that documents this.</p>

<ul>
<li>It frankly doesn't look like a big deal. Baba Louis has also edited the page, fixing some minor formatting issues and adding confirmation links. Essjay is not so anal retentive that he will reject the mediation based on a stray remark; the point is the parties should not be arguing with each other in the mediation request itself. To avoid this, you could ask Zos to collaborate with you on the summary of the dispute before you post it. It doesn't have to be perfect, just something you both can live with as a joint opening statement. Anyway, the only thing admins can do that you can't on your own is protect pages and block users, and I hardly think that's necessary, so you'll have to work this out elsewhere. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 15:34, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I've left messages on thier talk pages, they won't do this, now there are more users reverting the medaition file. I have contacted the mediator. The carn't even leave the mediation file without editing and reverting the dam thing. They should just simply leave it alone as per the medaition rules on the mediation page. They will turn this into a revert war on the medaition file next. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrater_FiatLux_1c04.html" title="User:Frater FiatLux">Frater FiatLux</a> 16:14, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>If a group of users can not create a mediation request without edit warring over it, they are probably not good candidates for mediation. One final thought: in this case, the first one to back off wins. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 18:22, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I was never asked to help. I did however help Frater FiatLux, and he got upset. This is the kind of thing that has happened all over the pages he has listed for mediation.

<p>I write on request (and also through my own personal experiences with) regarding the attitude of <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeline1_dd6c.html" title="User:Feline1">User:Feline1</a> and the way he reacts to other users. Simply observing his talk page and the <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolver_%28album%29.html" title="Revolver (album)">Revolver</a> talk page will illustrate my complaint. I oringinally referred my complaint to <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">User:Kingboyk</a>, who has ingnored it and <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">User:Tony Sidaway</a>, who acknowleged it but rather than deal with it himself, advised me to report it here. <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeline1_dd6c.html" title="User:Feline1">User:Feline1</a> is very difficult to work with - he is argumentative, acidic and confrontational. He causticly abuses well-meaning editiors who make honest mistakes and then, when he is questioned on this, further insults them, insinuating that they are "whimps" for questioning him. He seems to think himself infallable - everyone else is wrong, never him. All in all, this is an attitude completely contraty to the wikipeida ethos or respect and co-operation. His actions are likely to put people off working with him, and as a result, important issues may go unattended to. I feel a stern talking to as to the nature of wikipedia is in order (a block probably wouldn't do the job). I realise this may seem hypocritial coming from me as I have been blocked for personal attacks in the past, but I have made a concious effort to amend thisk, and maintain that I was never even close to being as awkward, rude, or mean-spirited as this user.
