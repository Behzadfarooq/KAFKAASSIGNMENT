<dd>There was never an arbitration case on user:Homey. The page you referred to was a subpage created for the case application comments which got very long; when the case was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;diff=67864131&amp;oldid=67863798" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;diff=67864131&amp;oldid=67863798" rel="nofollow">rejected</a> the subpage should have been too.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Homey's current status is in doubt. Fred Bauder has argued that he should be given the chance to register an account and edit peacefully; so long as he edits peacefully he should not be "outed" or blocked. Jayjg has argued that Homey has used up his supply of second chances. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 01:30, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As I recall, it was "rejected" on the naive presumption that Homey had gone the way of the buffalo. Granted, the chips are a bit stale now, but somebody should toss them back on the table and pursue the fabled persona non grata dentata remedy. —<tt class="plainlinks"><b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Freakofnurture_77c8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Freakofnurture">freak</a>(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" rel="nofollow">talk</a>)</b></tt> 10:01, Oct. 29, 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If that's what happened, that's unfortunate. Whenever something's left in limbo like that it's hard to get going again. I don't feel particularly inclined to pursue arbitration myself, but I certainly can agree with your sentiments. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnoutwood_5c9e.html" title="User:Snoutwood">Snoutwood</a> <a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnoutwood_5ab6.html" title="User talk:Snoutwood">(talk)</a> 15:42, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Apparently per Fred Bauder's talk page, Homey, Fred, SlimVirgin and Jimbo are in negotiations regarding his status. I would probably leave things at status quo (neither unblock nor block any new suspected socks) until something is worked out and they let us know. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 17:17, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I wish the arbcom would stop taking the easy way out of avoiding making a decision based on the usually faulty argument that the troublesome user has left the project, as they almost invariably come back and we have to start all over again.

<dd>Or, to put it otherwise, that the decision is made regardless of the person having left. However, that does seem to be changing (cf. <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Giano_fdc9.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Giano">Giano's ArbCom case</a> and the remedies regarding Kelly Martin after her leaving the project).

<dd>I was referring to Flowcube's most recent edit summary "<i>FUCK OFF HOMEY IS BACK U WANKER</i>", which you can see by scrolling down on the undelete page, as well as the contents of the entirely self-created talk page, which includes a number of sockpuppet templates in which Flowcube claims to be Homey. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnoutwood_5c9e.html" title="User:Snoutwood">Snoutwood</a> <a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnoutwood_5ab6.html" title="User talk:Snoutwood">(talk)</a> 22:09, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Okay, thanks, Snoutwood.

<dd>We'll do a checkuser to be sure, but my own guess is that this is a troll who is just trying to stir the pot with respect to Homey. It would be very odd for Homey to do this sort of thing at the very same time that we are having a big conversation about his future status.</dd>
<dd>This example shows quite nicely why good users should never sockpuppet. And especially by users who have been involved in conflicts should never sockpuppet. Once you sockpuppet and get caught, you are an easy target for trolls to pretend to be you sockpuppeting again, just to make more people mad at you. I have no actual evidence that this is or is not homey, other than his denial and that it would seem rather a bit strange for him to do this at this time.--<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> 01:30, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Pardon my language, but this is&#160;!@#!@# great. I had practically given up editing in articles related to <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malayalam.html" title="Malayalam">Malayalam</a> because of the sheer impossibility of getting nn articles deleted because of stray votes and "reverse-systemic bias". But stuff like this one and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Kumaranalloor_Mani_a8a1.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Kumaranalloor Mani">AfDs like this</a> keeps me going.</p>
<p>I was active in the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_S._Jithesh_7641.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/S. Jithesh">first AfD</a> for Jitesh and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Chiricheppu_1cb4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Chiricheppu">a related one</a>, but by the time I saw the second nomination, it was well on the way to keep and did not even bother to comment.</p>
<p>Many of us who work in the Malayalam articles "knew" that they were sockpuppets, but the way Checkuser terms are phrased, it was pretty difficult to get one done on mere suspicion. See <a href="../../../a/g/e/User_talk%7EAgeo020_Archive_1_c089.html#List_of_suspected_socks_of_User:S.Jithesh" title="User talk:Ageo020/Archive 1">User_talk:Ageo020/Archive_1#List_of_suspected_socks_of_User:S.Jithesh</a> for some "new" users who appeared for the first AfD.

See:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Achaia_Football_Clubs_Association" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Achaia_Football_Clubs_Association" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Achaia_Football_Clubs_Association</a> <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBilly_i.e.The_Billster_4438.html" title="User:Billy i.e.The Billster">Billy i.e.The Billster</a> 23:43, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I couldn't help noticing this, since I was interested in the subject exactly above. I think it is kinda unfair to treat a team like that, no matter how un-notable it may be. I'll go ahead and vote, but you must admit there's a huge fuss about nothing. I also noticed several accusations about sockpuppets of the other side... <a href="../../../n/%21/_/User%7EN%21_8b75.html" title="User:N!"><span style="color:#fff;background:#88b">•N<span style="background:#99c">i<span style="background:#aad">k<span style="background:#bbe">o<b><span style="background:#ccf">S</span>il</b></span><b>v</b></span><b>e</b></span><b>r</b>•</span></a> 23:15, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It can be problematic if the recruiter is only enlisting people who agree with him. Usually that's fairly easily dealt with by assuring that those who voted in favor of the deletion are also contacted; maybe ask him to do that himself just for the sake of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>?

<dd>Has it been a problem yet? If not, I wouldn't worry too much, but you're right that it could be confusing.

<p>All right. I've put this message on the top of my userpage:</p>

<p>If Grace Note wants to put something like that at the top of his userpage, he should feel free, or someone else could do it. Interesting, this is not an "Incident" per se. I really don't want to change my username, because it's in my e-mail adress, AIM name, Slashdot account, account on other Wikimedia things... so, the above should work. By the way, Idont Havaname, what edit did you see of mine?

<dd>Maybe the checkuser came back inconclusive because I am not Cretanpride and actually innocent. Akhilleus, just because certain editors oppose your views doesn't mean you have to find ways to get rid of them. Do I share similar views as Cretanpride on this issue? Sure, but then again the vast majority of Greeks do, and I am not the only one who opposes undue weight of homosexuality injected into Greco-Roman articles. <a href="../../../t/a/k/User%7ETakidis_9bb8.html" title="User:Takidis">Takidis</a> 05:29, 30 October 2006 (UTC) <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: <a href="../../../t/a/k/User%7ETakidis_9bb8.html" title="User:Takidis">Takidis</a> (<a href="../../../t/a/k/User_talk%7ETakidis_9826.html" title="User talk:Takidis">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Takidis_29cf.html" title="Special:Contributions/Takidis">contribs</a>) has made few or no other contributions outside this topic.</small></dd>

<dd>I gave diffs in the initial post. Aside from this "fresh user"s familiarity with processes like Checkuser, there's also the small fact that he's edited two of Cretanpride's favorite articles. On <a href="../../../h/o/m/Talk%7EHomosexuality_in_ancient_Greece_9821.html" title="Talk:Homosexuality in ancient Greece">Talk:Homosexuality in ancient Greece</a> he insists that the views of Robert Flaceliere and Bruce Thornton must be included; in the past Cretanpride and his many socks have argued the same thing. Somehow I don't think there are many users that would start posting long passages from these particular scholars within a few weeks of joining WP; I doubt most new users even know that Flaceliere and Thornton exist. Takidis also insists that the views of Mary Lefkowitz and Victor Davis Hanson must be included in the article; thing is, these views come from blurbs on the back of Thornton's book, which a sock of Cretanpride has quoted before. (Diffs are above in the initial post of this thread.) The stuff about Vrissimtzis is also a continuation of argument that was already in process. (see, for instance, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AHomosexuality_in_ancient_Greece&amp;diff=77058503&amp;oldid=75719144" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AHomosexuality_in_ancient_Greece&amp;diff=77058503&amp;oldid=75719144" rel="nofollow">this diff</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Homosexuality_in_ancient_Greece&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=77093116" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Homosexuality_in_ancient_Greece&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=77093116" rel="nofollow">this diff</a>). Takidis has added a few new wrinkles like the quote from David Cohen, but this is largely a rehash of material already posted by Cretanpride's socks. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 16:04, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It sure is suspect - while I find the Apro - Malaccoas farfetched, the only thing that can be said of Takidis that if he's not Cretanpride he must be his clone, because he doesn't only imitate his pov, but also his editing style. Also, it's hard not to remember that C. is certainly still editing, and has edited less than a month ago the article Alexander the Greece through a sockpuppet.--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 18:14, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, none of the above is conclusive. Anybody having enough patience to read the archives and edit history could see those things. As per his non-newbeeness, that doesn't necessarily make him CP either. Many legit users have dissappeared and reappeared under a different username. That may well be the case here, and it is not objectionable. Also, keep in mind that people may not wish to use their real username for such issues, in order not to be called 'homophobic'. I suggest we watch this user's edits (as we obviously already do) and try to find anything that <i>really</i> connects him to CP. Other than that, and <i>until proven otherwise</i>, and <i>unless violating a policy</i>, he cannot be "ignored" in talk-pages. So go ahead and block him for something, or I'll be seconding every single edit of his, as if it were mine. PS.

<p>I don't think we need checkuser here, since these are all obvious. They're all editing the same things, they're echoing each other in AfD's, they're all pushing the same POV - namely labelling certain rabbis and rabbinical institutions as practicing/condoning child molestation in total violation of BLP, and promoting certain activists and organizations that advocate against "clergy abuse". I am asking for another sysop to review these users and to indefblock the whole lot for abusive sockpuppetry and coordinated POV pushing. - <b><a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">CrazyRussian</a></b> <small><a href="../../../c/r/z/User_talk%7ECrzrussian_d07a.html" title="User talk:Crzrussian">talk</a>/<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Crzrussian_13af.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Crzrussian">email</a></small> 05:00, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It has come to my attention that someone has created an account using my real life name (Adam Gawronski) and proceeded to vandilise the <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Pius_X_College_c407.html" title="St Pius X College">St Pius X College</a> article with offensive edits. Although these have since been revereted, the username (and hence my real name) still exists in the history. As you can imagine, I do not wish to have these comments under my name as they can be used against me even though I am not at fault. It appears that the same has happened under the username Leonie Miller - St Pius X Administrator Extraordinaire (<a href="../../../l/e/o/User_talk%7ELeonie_Miller_-_St_Pius_X_Administrator_Extraordinaire_9192.html" title="User talk:Leonie Miller - St Pius X Administrator Extraordinaire">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Leonie_Miller_-_St_Pius_X_Administrator_Extraordinaire_3f9f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Leonie Miller - St Pius X Administrator Extraordinaire">contribs</a>), which is in fact the real name of a staff member at the school. As these users are both 'joke' users, obviously created exclusively with the intention of vandalising the <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Pius_X_College_c407.html" title="St Pius X College">St Pius X College</a> article I do not believe that prior warning is required / would have any effect. This type of vandalism and misrepresentation I consider cowardly and also borderline illegal.</p>
<p>I would request that both Leonie Miller - St Pius X Administrator Extraordinaire (<a href="../../../l/e/o/User_talk%7ELeonie_Miller_-_St_Pius_X_Administrator_Extraordinaire_9192.html" title="User talk:Leonie Miller - St Pius X Administrator Extraordinaire">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Leonie_Miller_-_St_Pius_X_Administrator_Extraordinaire_3f9f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Leonie Miller - St Pius X Administrator Extraordinaire">contribs</a>) and Adam Gawronski (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adam_Gawronski_f01b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adam Gawronski">contribs</a>) have their names changed so they are not impersonating anyone then blocked (so that their names do not appear in the history of the article, as I gather that deleting history of an article / deleting evidence of specific posts is not permitted/possible). I will then request (in the appropriate section) to have my current username (Gawronski) changed to Adam Gawronski to protect my online identity.</p>

<li>Please do not unblock anyone after a death threat, even if they say they're sorry or whatever. Even if you're okay with it, bringing them back gives them a chance to similarly harass and threaten others who might not be. I know the vast majority of them say they'd never really go through with it (etc) but that's no excuse to make it easy for the few who would. There's already been real-life murders on Myspace, and we don't need that here as well.

<li>I agree with Andrew. Certain edits are beyond the pale; death threats are one of those. If the person is truly contrite, they will create a new ID and edit properly from now on.

<li>I think it's high time we had a formal policy on Wikipedia specifically prohibiting death threats and excplicitly defining them as a bannable offense (our harassment policy mentions them in passing but is very vague).

<dd>Blocks are not punitive; they are deterrent, preventive, and recording. In this case, the blocking administrator thinks that a 3-hour block will be sufficient to deter the user from future disruptive behavior.

<p>Cowman109 just directed me to this discussion. I filed a report at <a href="../../../a/n/3/WP%7EAN3_1491.html" title="WP:AN3">WP:AN3</a> before realizing that a three-hour block already was in place. Had I noticed Steel359's 3RR violation before I became involved in the American/British spelling dispute, I would have placed a 24-hour block myself. If anything, administrators should be held to a <b>higher</b> standard than other users. It's true that 3RR blocks aren't punitive, but Steel359 reverted the page <b>six times</b> in a 14-hour period (during which he protected the page to gain the upper hand in a content dispute).

<p>I think I'll take a break. I've been really moody for a while and I'm surprised it took so long for something like this to happen. Some important things in RL are coming up and I'd rather not be dealing with this at the same time. I don't intend to start a huge discussion on ANI when there are more suitable places, but I'm going to vent a little. The content dispute itself is about vgcharts - a site of videogame sales figures. This site (apparently) uses shipping figures to estimate a game's sales, and ALTTP has been removing these in good faith on the grounds that they're misleading. The text in the article makes it explicitely clear that they're estimates, so I'm not sure what the problem is. Also, when removing the sales info, ALTTP carelessly left sentence fragments lying around (see the third line <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Metal_Gear_Solid_3:_Snake_Eater&amp;oldid=84281473" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Metal_Gear_Solid_3:_Snake_Eater&amp;oldid=84281473" rel="nofollow">here</a>), and then later removed content unrelated to the dispute when reverting me <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Metal_Gear_Solid_3:_Snake_Eater&amp;diff=84308797&amp;oldid=84290077" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Metal_Gear_Solid_3:_Snake_Eater&amp;diff=84308797&amp;oldid=84290077" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>. As for the spelling, the article was almost totally rewritten during the process of taking it to FA. There was no conscious effort to change the style. But seeing as along the way it did change, I can't see why so much effort is being put into changing it from one version which isn't inconsistent to another version which also isn't inconsistent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Metal_Gear_Solid_3:_Snake_Eater&amp;diff=84324852&amp;oldid=84317752" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Metal_Gear_Solid_3:_Snake_Eater&amp;diff=84324852&amp;oldid=84317752" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>. When I was reverted, I was pointed to the manual of style. The first bullet point there says: "<i>Articles should use the same dialect throughout.</i>". It was unconsciously changed from one to another as huge chunks of text were removed and new chunks were written (by me) from scratch, and the end product <i>did</i> use the same style throughout.<br />
Like I said, sorry to moan about article stuff on ANI. I've been spending too much time on Wikipedia lately, and formal logic isn't going to revise itself, so this is quite a convenient point to take a break. I worked really hard on <a href="../../../s/n/a/Metal_Gear_Solid_3%7E_Snake_Eater_4db9.html" title="Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater">MGS3</a> to get it to FA, and suddenly people are parading in and making all these changes without a whisper on the talk page.

<dd>Steel, no. Just saying that it's an estimate does not cut it. Wouldn't you do the same if you saw a featured article saying "according to false information, Pocky &amp; Rocky sold 800,000 copies"? Because that's what it is. I know the person who owns the site; on the forum that he posts on he's constantly plugging his site. It got so bad that VGCharts was banned from all sales discussions at NeoGAF. The owner of the web site, ioi, is not a professional by any definition of the word. In fact, I get review copies from various developers in the industry to review on a site I work on, so I am actually more connected to the industry than he is, because he has absolutely no connections. Just because you specify that the source is an unprofessional estimater does not make the numbers any less bogus. Additionally, just because I unintentionally reverted something, yes, but that could have easily been added back without reverting the VGCharts information back, so don't claim I did it when you did it as well. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 19:42, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Firstly, your decision to take a break is a wise one. As I commented at <a href="../../../a/n/3/WP%7EAN3_1491.html" title="WP:AN3">WP:AN3</a>, it was obvious to me that you were under a great deal of stress. (In our one prior interaction, you seemed quite reasonable.)</dd>
<dd>Regarding the dialect switch, I believe you when you say that this was unconscious, but that doesn't change the fact that it was improper. American spellings (such as "organization" and "humor") had been in use in the article since February 2005 (when the first dialect-specific spelling was introduced). You recently substituted British spellings, thereby creating inconsistency that remained until an anonymous user changed the heading "localization" to "localisation" a few days ago. When someone switched it back, you twice reverted (the first time with no explanation) on the basis that the article used British spellings.</dd>
<dd>Quoth the portions of the MoS to which I was referring:</dd>
<dd><i>"If an article is predominantly written in one type of English, aim to conform to that type rather than provoking conflict by changing to another. (Sometimes, this can happen quite innocently, so please do not be too quick to make accusations!)"</i></dd>
<dd><i>"Follow the dialect of the first contributor."</i></dd>
<dd><i>"If all else fails, consider following the spelling style preferred by the first major contributor (that is, not a stub) to the article."</i></dd>
<dd>I don't doubt that your conversion from American to British spellings was innocent, and I never ascribed malice; I simply restored the English variety originally used in the article. I've done the same thing with articles that were improperly changed from British English to American English.</dd>
<dd>In any event, I wish you the best of luck in your personal matters (and your wiki matters upon your return). —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 12:43, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The way I've always understood it is that the first contributor thing should be brought into play when there's an inconsistency. At the time you changed the style, there was no inconsistency, and so no need to revert to American spellings. Anyway, consider that my last message, I'm off now. -- <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteel359_41ed.html" title="User:Steel359">Steel</a> 13:34, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The "first contributor" rule takes effect when there's a dispute regarding which variety of English to use and no other valid reason to select one in particular. Otherwise, we would be inviting users to deliberately change established articles to their preferred dialects (citing the fact that this results in "no inconsistency, and so no need to revert"), thereby sparking massive edit wars. The fact that the article existed in consistent British English for two days (as opposed to the 1 ½ years in which it was written in consistent American English) didn't somehow render that particular status quo sacrosanct. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 16:10, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>However, if there were no dispute, such as if someone were to re-write a dormant article, the "first contributor" rule is irrelevant. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 05:12, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello! I recently made the following comments on the talk page of <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_people.html" title="Chinese people">Chinese people</a> and was blocked indefinitely. The reason given to me is a sock puppet case. <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_checkuser_Case_Snle_3bad.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Snle">Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Snle</a>. The computer I used is one at my university computer lab, which is shared by all students. I think the administrator's action is totally unfair. I took a look at the sock puppet case and didn't see many similarity among those blocked editors. Most of them are just temporary accounts people use for the purpose of not revealing IP address. The accused user SNLE was indefinitely blocked only for sock puppet. I don't think sock puppet is justifiable for indefinitely block, as indicated in the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppetry_eb4f.html" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppetry">Wikipedia:Sock puppetry</a> page. Anyway, I think the administor is too arbitrary in making his decision in case of shared IP address. I wonder if some outsider could come and solve this case or at least ask the administrator to stop blocking people on unjustified bases.

If you have checked the facts of the case, you would know very well that Snle and his/her sock puppets have not only engaged in disruptive edits and repeated violations of <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>, but also made abusive edits and restored those edits when they were deleted.

<p>I looked at SNLE's talk page. There is only a warning of possible 3RR. I don't think violation of 3RR deserves to be indefinitely blocked. I also see that SNLE engaged in discussion on the talk page. There is no disruptive edits.

<p>Well, if the reason for you to decide whether SNLE has sockpuppeted is on a shared IP address.

<p>People keep reverting this editors userpage. While I don't think much of the content being reverted, agreement appears to have been reached (and concensus) on the users talk page, yet evern editors involved in that formal request to <a href="../../../c/e/r/User%7ECerebral_Warrior_22cc.html" title="User:Cerebral Warrior">User:Cerebral Warrior</a>.</p>
<p>It appears that there is an edit war of sorts on that page, where people come along and revert it, and others (myself included - twice at least lol) have reverted it back to the users version (as disagreeable as I find it), because there is a WP disclaimer at the top of the page, and it is for the editor to remove on request if required, not other editors. In my understanding, the only other people that should be taking direct action on an actual userpage are admins, pending refusal to comply with the rules or formal consensus requests (a formal request and apparent agreementof sorts being in evidence on this users talk).</p>

<dd>I don't agree that only admins should edit another person's userpage. All Wikipedia pages, including userpages, refeclect on Wikipedia's reputation IMO. We are here to write an encylopedia, not stir up hate or state our political opinions.If he wants to do that let him get a website - it's very easy nowdays. I believe that the userpage should go. I don't know if the consensus is with me on this, I will not act at the moment. However I urge those who are reverting the deleters to simply stop. No one has the right to say whatever they like on thier userpage, anything that inhibits conversation and compromise on articles is bad for wikipedia and hate speech does just that. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> | <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">Taste the Korn</a> 20:14, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm with you on this. There are so many restictions on userpages already, we may as well do away with them. So let's phase them out. The next logical step in this process is to outlaw "Vanity pics". We are, indeed, here to write..not to advertise what a "cute kitty" or "bitchin car" I gotz duude.

<dd>Actually I meant - his userpage should go, not all of them.

<dd>No problem. I should mention though that in this case, the disclaimer was added per the talk page agreement with an administrator. I happily accept what you say as the norm, but surely after administrator agreement, the both sides of the dispute should drop the issue usually? The thing is, as disagreeable as I find it, I can't bring myself to define what's currently there as hate speech. A fine line is being tread with it undoubtedly, but in the context of the disclaimer, it's not really reflecting directly on wikipedia so much either. I believe the agreement on the talk page was twofold in this respect.</dd>

<li>I don't think such issues can (or should) cleanly be seperated from the nature of the dispute and its solution.

Unfortunately, <a href="../../../c/e/r/User%7ECerebral_Warrior_22cc.html" title="User:Cerebral Warrior">Cerebral Warrior</a> now believes that: "After extensive discussion, a compromise has been reached-I can put what I want on my userpage, provided I agree to a disclaimer stating that my views do not reflect those of the community. The disclaimer is prominently displayed, as is the content I see fit to put on my userpage.", which seems iffy to me. The editor continues to post to areas where his user page will continue to give offence (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:2006_Israel-Lebanon_conflict&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=85012887" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:2006_Israel-Lebanon_conflict&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=85012887" rel="nofollow">[25]</a> for example) and has somewhat misrepresented my intervention (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Yandman&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=85023880" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Yandman&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=85023880" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>).

<dd>Nuclear and I have some of the same interests (political articles), and I have actively avoided editing any articles which he has edited. The Afds, on the other hand, where everyone can "vote" does not disrupt Nuclear's editing. I had not mentioned Nuclear at all on this AfD, he began attacking me.

<dd>Sorry but tell you that you are violating WP:AGF by calling a large group of editors to be votestackers, then to remove proof that you indeed do vote in the same manor, in an article you complained about the votestacking at, is far from a personal attack. Further pointing out the nominator's block 3 days before for vandalizing that page and disruption as well as WP:POINT violation, is certaintly relevant to the discussion. Your arguement that people who follow that noticeboard are votetacking is quite obsurd when faced with the fact that you have voted in a similar fashion. I would like to point out that he removed also a listing of who voted how on the article he was complaining about, showing his voting in step with the majority of editors on that noticeboard, however also showing that they did not all vote alike.

<dd>Looking briefly at this current dispute, we have Travb refactoring comments on the MfD (not just Nuclear's) and deleting Nuclear's explanation of his&#160;!vote and replacing it with a simple signature. We also have NuclearUmpf personalizing his response to Travb rather than just focusing on the matter at hand. I would advise Travb not to refactor comments on XfDs (admins are generally not dummies about double votes) and <i>especially</i> not to refactor or edit comments made by someone with whom he is in frequent dispute. Nuclear should stick to the matter at hand and not discuss motivations or behaviors of other editors. (Fair to point out the nominator's history regarding the page; unhelpful to accuse Travb of violating AGF.)</dd>

<dd>Since you guys seem to generate the most friction over XfDs, I think the next step would be <a href="../../../c/o/m/Wikipedia%7ECommunity_probation_92b5.html" title="Wikipedia:Community probation">Wikipedia:Community probation</a> banning both of you from all XfD discussions for some period of time (2 weeks, a month?). Nuclear's arbitration probation allows him to be banned from pages he disrupts, but I don't think it would be equitable to ban only Nuclear from XfD since this seems to be a mutual thing. (There's probably enough crap just in the AN/I archives to file a new RFAR, which neither of you wants; Nuclear for obvious reasons, but I doubt Travb would be treated like an innocent victim.) <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 15:04, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you again Thatcher131, I appreciate you actually looking into the disputes to see what the issue is. I apologize for my accusation of AGF to Travb. But the truth is this constant bumping heads with him is starting to annoy me, and worse that fact that admins simply do not want to deal with it. I am tired of being poked and prodded and would prefer not to edit Wikipedia anonymously, but it seems this issue will keep coming up as long as Travb has a name to attach me to. I will start logging my interactions with him now on as I do not see an a RFAr too far off in the future and I feel I am being constantly baited and threatened by this user. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 15:16, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In the future, accounts that have vandalised over a period of time can generally be reported at AIV - basically, anything that merits an obvious block after cursory investigation can be reported there. There's no 'statute of limitations' on accounts in the same way that there is on IPs - we ask for recent warnings/vandalism on IPs as otherwise we might block unrelated people, but with accounts we know for certain it's the same guy. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 15:16, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

I unfortunately can't finish the job of de-speedying all of those right now. Could someone pick this up? Also, some kind of process should probably be opened to discuss those articles: while each one is distinct from the source (and has been from the start), the number of these articles all with derived text from the same source is worrying.

<dd>These articles need to be looked at for copyright violation - the source material is clearly cited within the copyvio tag. In all cases, the content of the text is identical with minor rewording. This has been discussed at great length at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:LordAmeth" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:LordAmeth" rel="nofollow">Lord Ameth's</a> Talk page. The end result was a call to "take whatever actions we deem necessary", so I have gone through and looked at the original source material on the Samurai archives, and have included the direct links in the copyvio tag. The tags I put in should not be removed without first taking a look at the source - the only source - used for these areticles. The definition of copyright violation needs to be discussed, then, however taking a paragraph and changing a few words around but keeping the meaning and idea the same probably should constitute copyright infringement. If someone had noticed this issue 10 months ago, it would not have become such a large job. I was trying to help out all of us contributors by taking care of this. There are well over 100 articles copied from the source website with minor rewording. As has been brought up on the lordameth page, a simply reworded copy of an article probably constitutes copyright violation. Furthermore, that aside, it shows poor scholarship, as these articles can not be verified.

<dd>Hmm. Deathrocker has violated his revert parole imposed at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Deathrocker_ddb8.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Deathrocker">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Deathrocker</a> by reverting the disputed source 5 times in the last 6 days (he is limited to one revert per day and two per week). I <i>could</i> block him. But I am not inclined to do that because <i>no one</i> has discussed this issue on the article talk page. There's a right way and a wrong way to deal with this kind of content dispute. You're both going about it the wrong way, so I'm not going to drop the block hammer on him just yet. Bring it up on the article talk page, explain why it is a non-reliable source, and if he continues to revert, report it here or at <a href="../../../a/e/_/WP%7EAE_df73.html" title="WP:AE">Arbitration enforcement</a>. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 00:27, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Can't see why posting on the articles talk would make a difference, sure it could get wider input, but the user has tried to bring this up directly and (without checking) he apparently has chosen to ignore it. As far as I am aware there is no rule which says "thou shalt use the article talk page rather than approaching an editor directly to resolve an issue", and if there were such a rule, I'd certainly ignore it as being ridiculous. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 07:12, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Revert warring without discussion is bad whether the reverts are rapid or slow. Over the period of time where this citation has been inserted and removed there was no discussion on the talk page, just in edit summaries. Still, you have the same block button I do, and if you see it differently then drop a block on Deathrocker per his arbitration. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 12:46, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think you miss the point (or I miss the point). I read the above comment as being I'm not going to act because you didn't follow some "correct form" of posting on the articles discussion page. Indeed on Deathrockers talk your comment comes across (to me) as suggesting that <a href="../../../e/n/d/User%7EEndlessVince_8ffe.html" title="User:EndlessVince">EndlessVince</a> is in part to blame for Deathrockers actions, by putting him in a situation where he could easily archive the comments without responding. If EndlessVince has made a good faith effort to resolve the situation that should be recognised, and there should be no excuse for Deathrocker ignoring that (regardless of Arbcom sanctions or not). Elsewhere anyone saying you didn't dot all the i's and cross all the t's would be pointed towards wikilawyering or not a bureacracy. In this case by the word of the arbcom ruling Deathrocker is in the wrong without any discussion on any page being required. Now I haven't looked into the situation and I'm quite prepared to accept that this situation may be resolvable without resorting to a block, but that is different from saying I'm not going to do it because you didn't follow the correct form. Maybe I'm just being pedantic, but that's how it came across to me. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 17:00, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I believe this was an abuse of administrator's powers because; 1. There was no consensus, not even close. 2. The rules do not allow for personal opinions in that role. 3. The article absolutely met WP:NOT and WP:BIO. Finally, this AfD was launched for political reasons because the subject of this article is an embarrassment for certain groups of American Ultra-conservatives.

"The rules", as you call them, actually allow for administrators to use discretion in closing AfDs, and indeed to close against the numbers if the policy based arguments are stronger on that side.

<dd>I have to disagree. Looking at the page in question, arguing consensus seems hard. If the AfD was closed for any other reasons, that needs a clear and conspicious explanation. I see nothing in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> that forces the deletion of this article (and indeed, it is only a guideline). The place to assess notability is the AfD. It may very well be that <a href="../../../n/a/c/User%7ENaconkantari_d810.html" title="User:Naconkantari">User:Naconkantari</a> had good reasons for his decision and acted in good faith. But then it is his duty to commincate these reasons. Wikipedia is run by the community of editors, not by admins.

<dd>This is a common problem when 'consensus judging' becomes 'process judging'. Naconkantari closed it as a delete not due to consensus, but for 'failure to meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>'... but many respondents to the AFD argued that it <b>did</b> meet WP:BIO - and many argued that it did not. At which point Naconkantari decided whether or not HE thought it met the WP:BIO standards and that's the way the AFD went. Essentially, his opinion alone. I tend to think in situations where there is a disagreement about how policy applies to something that's where we <i>need</i> to look to consensus... rather than saying 'this view of policy is correct and therefor consensus is irrelevant'. The latter seems to get used for alot of controversial closes. It makes me nervous when we start doing things that don't have consensus because 'this is the right decision'. That essentially makes consensus subservient to the personal opinions of admins. We trust admins to interpret consensus, but does that extend to saying that 'we trust admins to interpret policy regardless of consensus'? Obviously, I've got a 'dog in this hunt' as I created the page. At the time, an ArbCom member said we needed to have it. Now it is described (by some) in rather less positive terms.&#160;:] Opinions shift over time and vary by individual... which is why I <i>thought</i> we had consensus as the standard for decision making. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 12:00, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That determination is part of the AfD, not a task for the closing admin. In fact, I would say that determining notability is the <i>main</i> purpose of AfD. Copyvios or violation of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> are something that usually can reasonably be decided by an admin. It's much less a matter of opinion. Notability cannot so easily be decided by one person alone, and luckily it does not have to be decided by one person alone. There is no urgency in that case. To quote from <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion</a>: " the deletion process proceeds based on Wikipedia <i>community consensus</i>" (emphasis by me).

<p>(Reset indent} Stephen, you said "That determination is part of the AfD, not a task for the closing admin." This is partially incorrect: while notability can be argued in AfD, admins are not only required, but empowered, to make decisions regarding notability, verifiability, and reliability of sources. They can be overturned by deletion review (or by ArbCom if it comes to that)--but this case was reviewed by DRV, and the decision to close and delete was <i>upheld</i>--not by Naconkantari, but by a different admin. Then when the article was re-created, it was speedied by yet another admin.</p>
<p>Stephan, Andy's death was a tragedy--I completely and totally agree with that. Andy is remembered by his friends and co-workers, and I respect not only that memory but the grief of those who lost a friend and loved one. But these are emotional considerations--Wikipedia cannot be swayed by emotional considerations, no matter how convincing such arguments seem to be when those emotions are running high. Naconkantari was required to decide whether or not Andy Stephenson met the requirements of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>--and in his best judgement, he did not. DRV concurred. While Andy's friends and family will grieve, <b>Within the context of Wikipedia</b> the issue is over and done. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustin_Eiler_f9c0.html" title="User:Justin Eiler">Justin Eiler</a> 18:58, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ok. To make my position clear: I do not argue that the article should be recreated. In fact, I have not heard about Andy Stephenson outside this discussion - if he is notable, the notability has not reached my side of the pond. As you can probably deduce from that, I don't forward the argument that he was (or is) notable myself. What I do complain about is an admin disregarding (my interpretation of) reasonable policy. It's not the result I'm concerned about, it's the process (or lack of the same). If we follow your argument, we don't need AfD at all. Just delete, and shoot it to <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a>. But of course, as "no consensus" means "maintain the status quo", a controversial delete will not be undone at DRV. Our policy up to now has been "if in doubt, let's keep it" and I think that's reasonable. Having a non-notable article is not a serious problem. In fact, add a million of them, and Wikipedia will still be nearly as useful and as valuable resource as it is now. Deleting a notable article lowers the value of Wikipedia (deleting a millon will do so in a <i>very</i> noticable way). --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephan_Schulz_3024.html" title="User:Stephan Schulz">Stephan Schulz</a> 19:26, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>As far as "disregarding reasonable policy," that is an unfortunate effect of the guideline that AfD is not a "vote." Admins must exercise judgement on these issues ... and unfortunately, such judgement is subjective, because like regular editors, admins are only human. Naconkantari is of course no better than you or I, but he is more experienced in Wikipedia policies than I am. In his judgement, the article's lack of notability over-rode the results of the specific AfD discussion.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Stephan, <i>any</i> subjective judgement made is not going to please all people involved or interested in that particular decision. The only other solution, however, is to make the AfD process entirely objective--but that would reduce the AfD process to a simple vote, complete with the ballot-box stuffing and sock-puppet brigades that have been seen in some of the more contentious AfD debates. If your issue with this particular deletion is the process by which it was undertaken, I can only tell you that I feel it is the better of the two alternatives.</dd>

<li>I concur with Justin -- judgement calls have to be made, and a simple vote is far worse than admins, who understand and respect project goals, reading the AfD comments and judge based on that. If anything, we've seen far too little of what Naconkantari has done. Our policies mean nothing if we ignore them whenever enough people show up, without even giving much reason, and "vote" against them in the specific case. Good judgement and discussion is what we need, not simple voting. --<a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImprov_b282.html" title="User:Improv">Improv</a> 19:57, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Actually, they're not. There are two groups of indigenous Australians - Australian Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. The term "indigenous Australian" is a more all-encompassing term - as Zarbat notes in his edit summaries. I suspect that this is the reason for the moves, which seem quite reasonable ones when viewed from that viewpoint. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 11:45, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>I don't get <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">User:Str1977</a>'s logic. He is removing sourced material because he thinks that he understand Islam better the Cambridge History of Islam. His arguments are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>He says: "The Quran (and note, it is the' Quran) as a book did not exist at that time. If Muhammad used an argument, attribute it to him.", "If we say The Quran we immediately associate the book of that name or the Islamic revelation in its entirety. If individual revelations are referred to, then use a different wording, to avoid confusion to the reader."</li>
</ul>
<p>My answer as posted on the talk page of Muhammad: 1. The source puts it exactly in this way 2. For the record, his understanding of the Qur'an is inaccurate. The Qur'an refers to itself as Qur'an. In fact, the word has no precedant in Arabic language before Islam.</p>
<ul>
<li>He says: "If you read carefully I did not say that "Abraham was not a Jew" was wrong but problematic as it is misleading. What the Quran says is completely irrelevant in this matter. Abraham is not a Jew, since that means either a descendant of his great-grandson Judah, or an inhabitant of the kingdom of Judah, or descendant of his grandson Israel, or a adherent to the religion of Judaism. But nonetheless, Abaraham is the patriarch of all Jews. He was not an Arab and he was not a Muslim in the sense that he adhered to the religion historically founded by Muhammad. We should not use this as cheap trick insinuations. That was all my remark was about."</li>
</ul>
<p>My answer: I am saying what the source says. He doesn't agree with the source. That doesn't mean he has the right to censor the source. All I am saying is that he should back up his thought based on academic sources. But of no avail. I am fed up.</p>
<ul>
<li>He says: "And judging from what the WP article and what I could google says about Abdallah ibn Ubbay, this passage involving him here is highly inaccurate. It is also clearly speculation what would have happend "if" Muhammad had not come to Jathrib."</li>
</ul>
<p>My answer: He is more than welcome to contact the Cambridge university and explain their errors to them.</p>
<p>All in all, I believe every neutral observer can see that he is using these pretexts to censor information.</p>

<p>User:Xchanter, just back from a 24-hour block that came from some rather strident arguments regarding his dislike of images in sexual-organ-related articles, has put a statement up on his user page suggesting that he feels Wikipedia is not complying with obscenity statutes, that he has contacted the Foundation, and is awaiting "their reply before contacting the apporpriate legal authorities (specifically the Attorney General of the State of Florida, the Attorney General of the United States, and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement's Law Enforcement Against Child Harm (LEACH) Task Force)."

<p>I’ve known since soon after <a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> (<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentauri_6ee4.html" title="User talk:Centauri">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Centauri_54c6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Centauri">contribs</a>) arrived that he was a sockpuppet of <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Poole_836b.html" title="User:Gene Poole">Gene Poole</a> (<a href="../../../g/e/n/User_talk%7EGene_Poole_f355.html" title="User talk:Gene Poole">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Gene_Poole_32c2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Gene Poole">contribs</a>). All the evidence it really takes to confirm that conclusion is a review of their contribution histories. Even just reading their edit summaries is enough. They’re nearly exactly the same, on the same topics, and from what I’ve seen always take the same positions in debates. But just for the sake of arguments, consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_Archive_6_9bb8.html" title="User talk:Jayjg/Archive 6">User_talk:Jayjg/Archive_6</a> (first two sections)</li>

<li>But <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Irate&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=10516600" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Irate&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=10516600" rel="nofollow">this diff</a> of course takes the cake. George later tried to claim that they knew each other and he left his computer logged in and Centauri made the edit. If that was true, why would he need to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Irate&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=10523323" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Irate&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=10523323" rel="nofollow">cover it up</a>? Also coming up with that story after the fact isn't exactly trust inspiring.</li>
</ul>
<p>After editing <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sealand.html" title="Sealand">Sealand</a> and working on the talk page to try to moderate the situation between Gene Poole and others throughout much of 2004 I came to know his editing style pretty well. Then a month after Gene Poole quit apparently due to <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Gene_Poole_vs._Samboy_b883.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Gene Poole vs. Samboy">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Gene Poole vs. Samboy</a>, Centauri showed up with exactly the same views and editing style. Quite a number of people have noticed they were sockpuppets over time including <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> and myself as just a few examples.</p>
<p>Though I’ve known they were alternate accounts, I didn’t really reallize that they were used so extensively to stack votes in AfD. It came to my attention when he did it <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Elonka_fafe.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Elonka">recently in an RfA</a>. It seems he’s been abusing them for quite some time to double vote and me too in various debates. I’m completely confident that they are sockpuppets and therefore more than comfortable making a block, but I still wanted to post here for discussion. Since it’s the same person, blocking one of the accounts won’t have any harm, he can still contribute from the other. While George can be difficult to reason with I think he makes enough useful contributions that blocking both accounts or wasting time with RfC or arbcom would not be fruitful. Thanks, I plan to make the block soon. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 19:31, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Support. One issue I want to raise though, is how uninvolved one has to be. I'm not seeing Taxman involved in this except as an admin... I don't see why it's not OK for Taxman to place the block. I think we have to be careful not to get too leery of placing blocks, or this can be used by the Wikilawyerish to work through lists of admins, using each one up, till there are none left...

<dd>I don't see that it would be wrong for Taxman to do the block, but he is right that there is benefit to it being done by someone previously uninvolved.

<dd>I agree, I'm not so involved that there's a problem here and we shouldn't be afraid to enforce policies if our only involvement is in acting as admins. In this case I am only involved in my capacity as an admin and a bureaucrat to stop disruption, though in the past I have edited the same articles as mentioned. As I said I am comfortable making the block, but I'm also interested in causing the least fuss. There's no harm here in having Matt do it, he's not remotely involved as far as I know, and neither are you. Waiting a day is fine too as there's no huge rush here now that he know the likely outcome he's probably not going to vote in anything, and if he does, it can be reverted until the block is made or decided against. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 18:16, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Agree that Taxman could make the block; especially after consensus is found here.

<dd>I've been pretty darn sure people were socks before and been wrong.

<dd>Well, yes, either they are or aren't socks, but CheckUser shows whether they have edited using the same <a href="../../../i/p/_/IP_address_6ed9.html" title="IP address">IP address</a> in the last month or so.

<dd>In the last year, I've sat down and borrowed my wife's computer at times, and once did a WP edit while doing so and forgot to check who I was, and ended up with her account. I've also watched other friends do the equivalent at their houses. There is general agreement that this does happen innocently from time to time. I don't think the suspicions here are grossly unreasonable or anything, but AGF should still be considered. If CU shows they're always using the same IP then, as much as I get along with them (him?), they have been using socks to vote multiply on various things and get around 3RR at times. If CU shows they're distinct, they credibly could just be real life friends or aquaintences, who tend to think alike on some issues. I wouldn't defend multiple voting or getting around 3RR, but I'd like CU to resolve the issue not people's gut feelings. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 23:22, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Do you always agree with your wife? I don't think that's possible, but Gene Poole and Centauri do. Also they don't claim to live together which would make it reasonably likely to happen sometime, just to have been acquaintences a few times, and that story only came out after he was confronted with the diffs. Also, why would he need to cover it up if it was just an acquaintence? - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 19:02, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I suppose the question is whether we would still block if CheckUser comes back as "unrelated"; if we wouldn't, then yes, it would be unfair not to run the test. However, my understanding is that CheckUser provides some reasonably strong positive evidence of sockpuppeting, but only weak negative evidence. For example, to defeat CheckUser, all you need is to edit using a different ISP for each account. Personally, I think the above evidence is sufficient, so I view CheckUser as unnecessary, although not harmful. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 23:54, 1 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's been done in the past and come back inconclusive, predictably. As Jonathunder notes, he's known since days after Centauri arrived in 2004 that people suspected sockpuppetry, so he would have known to be careful. Checkuser isn't magic pixie dust, it can only confirm, not clear suspicions. And as the checkuser policy states, it's not to be used for obvious cases. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 00:36, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Where has it been done in the past? There's no CU case archived for them...</dd>
<dd>Conclusively avoiding a positive CU requires getting another ISP and always reliably using one ISP for each account. While that's certainly possible, doing it reliably enough for extended periods of time is unlikely. It seems hardly credible that someone who spends most of their time doing what everyone seems to believe are basically ok WP editing would go to the effort to both purchase and totally reliably use another ISP to cover up these actions.</dd>
<dd>My impression has been that Centauri and Gene have overlapping, but not exclusively overlapping, areas of interest. Though micronations stuff is clearly overlapping, there are other areas that they tend to not meet in. This is not proof positive they aren't socks, but is a negative indicator. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 01:03, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you're going to go down that road, you're going to have to be willing to fully analyze the rest of the edit histories. From 2004 and earlier. Always supporting the same positions, timing of editing articles, often the same ones, style of commenting, arguing, etc. For someone determined to use two accounts to show multiple support for their positions, it's not implausible to avoid CU. Remember, he's known since the beginning he was suspected. So of course, he's going to try to differentiate the two accounts, but the things that are important to him he overlaps. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 01:35, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just a note about Checkuser requests: after I came across GP/C's most recent instance of double-voting at an RFA, I went to the Checkuser to make a request, but their rigidly bureaucratic code system seemed to explicitly EXCLUDE making the request. I asked why on <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_checkuser_6f35.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for checkuser">the talk page</a>, and got back a bunch of bureaucratic bafflegab from <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> (<a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedux_26e5.html" title="User talk:Redux">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Redux_736e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Redux">contribs</a>), so I didn't bother.</p>

<p>Even without having spent much time on this, it's apparent that there is some similarity in writing style. Just to pick one example: how common is the edit summary, "rewrite/ing for coherence"? To me, that seems a somewhat unusual and idiosyncratic turn of phrase, yet it crops up several times in both Gene Poole and Centauri's recent edit summaries. Given the evidence, I think the explanation that Gene Poole and Centauri are real world acquaintances who just happen to write in a very similar style to each other, and who just happen to share common interest in certain obscure topics, and just happen to have once edited under the other person's account by accident, is looking increasingly far-fetched. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 17:37, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Add to that, just happens that no one can find an example where they haven't voted the same way or didn't support the same positions, Centauri just happened to show up editing the same articles in the same style just after Gene Poole said he had quit, and they just happen to have the same grudges. Even if a few token disagreements were found, no two people agree that often. I suppose everyone can look at the evidence and see this for themselves, but might as well make it even more obvious. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 19:02, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You can continue this for as long as you like Taxman, but the bottom line is you're just making it up as you go. There's no actual evidence of anything, and the fact you're avoiding checkuser like the plague speaks volumes. There are a much larger number of both articles and votes where neither Centauri and I have <i>ever</i> crossed paths than there are examples of where we have - and that too, speaks volumes. I don't intend making any further comment on this matter, but I will conclude by stating that I believe your actions here are totally lacking in credibility, and that you and your friends are behaving in a manner that is both cowardly and hypocritical in attacking two editors whose contributions to this project are valued, and above reproach. --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Poole_836b.html" title="User:Gene Poole">Gene_poole</a> 22:36, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Absurd -I told him he was free to post his allegations at the bottom, where they belong. See the edit summaries. I even reposted them there myself as a favor to him. Pages go in chronological order except for replies and additional comments to existing commentary.

<dd>OK, I've banned Fairness and Nuclear from making any further edits to the MfD page, although (perhaps unwisely) I'm allowing them to use the talk page. I'll keep an eye on that too. I'm not particular concerned about comments being in chronological order as long as they are properly signed; very few admins are idiots and I expect whomever closes the debate can find the thread without difficulty. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 22:35, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I wont comment there either, most of my last comments have been trying to tell him to relax and laughing at the secret society conspiracy theory that is being cooked up there.

<dd>Agreed with User:Joke137 and User Talk:JzG. <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairness_And_Accuracy_For_All_6573.html" title="User:Fairness And Accuracy For All">User:Fairness And Accuracy For All</a> is a <s>pain in the arse</s>, unfortunatly, he is no better than the other user he was fighting with. It does take two too tango, after all.</dd>
<dd>In my experience, the other user has a history of <a href="../../../t/e/n/Wikipedia%7ETendentious_editing_11fb.html" title="Wikipedia:Tendentious editing">Wikipedia:Tendentious editing</a> and using ANI and other wikipolicies to push his POV.</dd>
<dd>Although I have less contact with User:Fairness And Accuracy For All, and although User:Fairness And Accuracy For All doesn't know how to push his POV by using wikipolicy as well as the other user, he is just as partisan and liable to use AfDs as weapons.</dd>
<dd>I personally think that the AfD should remain closed until after November 7th. <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairness_And_Accuracy_For_All_6573.html" title="User:Fairness And Accuracy For All">User:Fairness And Accuracy For All</a> seems to be on a personal crusade of sorts, to make his "side" win.

<dd>I say <b>for the sake of</b> <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairness_And_Accuracy_For_All_6573.html" title="User:Fairness And Accuracy For All">User:Fairness And Accuracy For All</a>, we should keep this AfD closed until <b>after</b> November 7th. After he has had time to think about how close he is to a AfD and eventually being booted by those partisan admins and veteran wikipedians who disagree with him, he can reopen a new Afd, if he wishes, after November 7th. I know <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairness_And_Accuracy_For_All_6573.html" title="User:Fairness And Accuracy For All">User:Fairness And Accuracy For All</a> will be angry for this opinion today, but if he manages to not be booted <i>(which appears unlikely at this point)</i>, he will thank me later.

<dd>Travb, I would like to suggest that it is at best impolitic to describe respected long-term editors as "powerful" - the only merit long-term editors have is their long involvement with the project, their understanding/acceptance of project goals, and the lattitude they're given towards achieving those goals. Calling them powerful risks serious misinterpretation. Take care. --<a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImprov_b282.html" title="User:Improv">Improv</a> 11:43, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Reasoning as follows: GabrielF is a reasonable person, and has acknowledged and dealt with concerns with the original formulation of the page. The MfD was headed for keep, and two editors had to be banned from disrupting it. There really was no point in extending the discussion since sufficient input had already been obtained to recognise that the consensus is to keep, albeit perhaps with some slight work on the criteria by which pages are added or the terms in which they are discussed. There is, to my reading, widespread support for the view that 911 conspiracy theory POV-pushing is a problem, and we need <i>somewhere</i> to keep an overview of it - this page is as good a place as any. The theorists are welcome to watch the page as well, everything being out in the open and all. There does not seem to be any overt advocacy going on on that page, so there is no pressing need to delete it to avoid harm to the project. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 12:27, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I documented advocacy, or at least POV, in the specfic case of Kathleen Christison, and I contend that may be why they moved that discussion onto the talk page. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Miscellany_for_deletion/User:GabrielF/ConspiracyNoticeboard" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Miscellany_for_deletion/User:GabrielF/ConspiracyNoticeboard" rel="nofollow">please see</a> . The nominator intentionally chose an extremely narrow Google search, and then used those results to misrepresent her 'notability'. To say that her 'only' notability comes from one particular book is demonstorably false. If you Google just her name you get 91,100 Ghits. I included a link from a University that returned DOZENS of publications from her. <a href="http://cosmos.ucc.ie/cs1064/jabowen/IPSC/php/customSearch.php?byauid=26" class="external text" title="http://cosmos.ucc.ie/cs1064/jabowen/IPSC/php/customSearch.php?byauid=26" rel="nofollow">Christison publications - University College of Cork, Ireland</a> . It turns out HER HUSBAND is a 9/11 theorist. She's not. She's got AfD'd cause they don't like her HUSBAND'S views. If that's not a misuse of AfD, and a POV Agenda, I don't know what is. I don't have the time to DRV until after Nov 8. <b>But I'd like to challenge you</b> (if you're not overtly partisan politically) or <b>ANY other top level admin who is politically neutral.</b> Review my argument - That Kathleen Christison EASILY passes 'notability' and that she never should have been AfD'd. (please note, I don't even agree with many of her views on Israel) and that the AfD was 'bad faith' as it intentionally used an overlynarrow search to draw a demonstrably false conclusion as the basis of the AfD. If this is the ONLY example of the Conspiracy Noticeboard acting improperly, it's still one example WAY too many.

<dd>I will DRV after Nov 8. The point of me documenting this case was that I contend the actions were so overt (especially using as narrow a search as possible to 'lessen' her notability) and against the spirit of Wiki that it proved impropiety and that 7 members of the board acted not in good faith, (on her real notability) but with a specific agenda. - <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairness_And_Accuracy_For_All_6573.html" title="User:Fairness And Accuracy For All">F.A.A.F.A</a> 19:54, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>A few months back an anonymous editor was going around adding to articles such as <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glenn_Ford_6ae7.html" title="Glenn Ford">Glenn Ford</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Hope_c9fc.html" title="Bob Hope">Bob Hope</a> a rather nonsensical statement, usually a variant of "In their later years they concentrated on their passion for collecting salt and pepper shakers." When I saw the exact same wording appearing in a few places I got suspicious, and I actually contacted a relative of Glenn Ford's who is a friend of mine and asked if he could confirm the information, and he said it was nonsense. So I've been reverting this statement whereever it appears. This vandal seemed to disappear for awhile but reemerged earlier today at <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glenn_Ford_6ae7.html" title="Glenn Ford">Glenn Ford</a>. I blocked that IP but he might turn up again elsewhere. Just a heads up more than anything else that should admins or other editors come across reference to "salt and pepper shaker collecting" in any biographical articles, they should treat this as suspicious and probably revert without question. I'm also leaving a copy of this note over in the Biography Wikiproject area, too.

<dd>Above and beyond any possible meat/sock puppetry (or an oddly strong grasp of Wikipedia policy and lingo), Caloon2000 *has* been making bad faith, POV edits (primarily from a religious POV, but oddly deleting religions the user does not agree with, such as Wicca, from the article) using unreliable sources as citations, as well as making false statements insinuating that a) they are an admin, b) they have the backing of an admin, and c) that there is a non-existent "consensus"; in addition to being in violation of the three-revert rule. Caloon2000 is the only user making any threats; or discouraging users from participating. I suggested that they create a new page detailing the religious reaction to Halloween, which could contain minority viewpoints not needed on the Halloween page; which apparently wasn't an interesting idea to him/her, as it didn't call for making wholesale changes to an existing article, or adding links to unreliable websites with extreme religious viewpoints as citations, as the user seems to enjoy enacting upon the Halloween article. -- <a href="../../../w/e/i/User%7EWeirdoactor_7234.html" title="User:Weirdoactor">Weirdoactor</a> 13:14, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Caloon2000 is also retaliating for my warning him about POV and 3RR violations by placing unwarranted vandalism templates on my talk page. Another editor has since removed it, but Caloon also posted on the Halloween talk page that I should not be allowed to work on the article because I am a "Feminist" and a "Wiccan". Not that it matters, but I'm not a Wiccan and am somewhat insulted to be called one. The links Caloon2000 kept reinserting as "sources" also contained hate speech and gross misinformation about Irish history and Gaelic culture. Very offensive stuff. He also deleted Christian links I added because they were to Celtic Christian groups who do not have religious objections to Halloween. --<a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_9cdf.html" title="User:Kathryn NicDhàna">Kathryn NicDhàna</a> 00:13, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'd be hesitant to call someone a sock when it is entirely unclear <i>who</i> he could be a sock of, but he definitely isn't your average "new" user (but he doesn't seem terribly experienced...). I've been trying to clean up the mediation case he... started and as a side checking his contributions, which are startling. Picking fights on <a href="../../../r/f/a/WT%7ERFA_66f4.html" title="WT:RFA">WT:RFA</a>, unilateral pagemoves of widely used templates, pasting a Britannica article verbatim, no concept of consensus, frequent refrains of NPOV vs POV (which he is apparently the ultimate authority on), and no understanding of mediation. I've been trying to at least enlighten him a bit as to what mediation and consensus are, but the whole process has been extremely frustrating and he keeps insisting upon his "NPOV" solution to a mediation... Blocking for disruption doesn't seem farfetched to me, but I'm clearly biased. --<a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeitei_af28.html" title="User:Keitei">Keitei</a> <span style="font-size:75%">(<a href="../../../k/e/i/User_talk%7EKeitei_ced4.html" title="User talk:Keitei">talk</a>)</span> 21:58, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I hope it's not inappropriate for me to interject here, but in addition to W.Creek there seem to be other sockpuppet(s) involved in the mediation at <a href="../../../a/l/e/Talk%7EAlexander_the_Great_2250.html" title="Talk:Alexander the Great">Talk:Alexander the Great</a>, and I'd really appreciate it if someone took a closer look.

<p>I'm with Physicq210 ... In my view, if some identity is editing disruptively, (especially, editing trollishly) and gives the appearance of being a sock, it is not really necessary to determine exactly whose sock it is in order to justify a block. The disruption is enough. I have not reviewed the contrib history closely myself but if other well respected editors and admins say there is disruption, my first instinct is to trust them and support the block, should one ensue. (Certainly exploring whose sock it is may be useful to consider applying further blocks, but it is not necessary to block THAT identity) That's my view... Hope that helps. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 15:11, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I know nothing of how it's programmed, but if it uses an integer to determine number of edits, you may need to increase the size of the int. What might be happening is it may be attempting to stick a value in the integer that is larger than the integer can hold, causing it to wrap back down near zero. This, obviously, would be annoying. A quick check on the size of the integer it's using might reveal the problem, but once more I have no knowledge about the inner workings of the bot. -<a href="../../../n/i/a/User%7ENiarbeht_8b6e.html" title="User:Niarbeht">Niarbeht</a> 10:24, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't know if this is the place to raise it (and if I should be leaving a message elsewhere, please point me to where I should be going), but I've just seen five accounts make edits to various porn star articles... in each instance the account is in the name of the porn star, and in each instance the link added is to the "biography" of the star at a website which has been pulled out of other pages as being linkspam. I have an extremely strong suspicion that the accounts in question were created strictly to try and lend undue credence to the links being added in an attempt to forestall their removal.</p>
<p>The linkspammed page is always a subpage at dv8.com that is specifically about the star in question.</p>
<p>The accounts in question are:</p>
<p>User:Holly Body, editing Holly Body</p>
<p>User:Jasmin St. Claire, editing <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jasmin_St._Claire_7fff.html" title="Jasmin St. Claire">Jasmin St. Claire</a></p>
<p>User:Hyapatia Lee, editing <a href="../../../h/y/a/Hyapatia_Lee_3a21.html" title="Hyapatia Lee">Hyapatia Lee</a></p>
<p>User:Katja Kean, editing <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katja_K_43f0.html" title="Katja K">Katja K</a> (Katja Kean is an earlier pseudonym of the actress in question)</p>
<p>User:Sindee Coxx, editing <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sindee_Coxx_f6a4.html" title="Sindee Coxx">Sindee Coxx</a></p>
<p>At the least I think these accounts, unless they can be shown to be the celebrity in question, should be blocked. I think it might also be useful to add dv8.com to the blacklist to prevent further attempts to spam that link. <a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabercil_a2ff.html" title="User:Tabercil">Tabercil</a> 03:34, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Very bizarre. They're obviously the same person, and all the porn actresses were born in 1970 or earlier. Anyone else notice that? Anyway, they're all username blocked. As to blacklisting the link, I think it takes a more widespread problem than this, but if the linkspamming comes back we can certainly look into that. Oh, and this is an appropriate place for something as weird as this. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmasterka_6922.html" title="User:Grandmasterka"><font color="orange">Grand</font></a><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrandmasterka_5f38.html" title="User talk:Grandmasterka"><font color="black">master</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Grandmasterka_b497.html" title="Special:Contributions/Grandmasterka"><font color="orange">ka</font></a> 04:32, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I put my opinion on how we can improve the John Kerry article page on the John Kerry discussion page. Isn't that what the discussion page is for? To talk about thoughts on how to improve the article? I didn't do any editing to the article at all. I believe that if John Kerry had made a remark about Hilary Clinton, then the article would have her response, so what is wrong with having the soldiers response? Even if the joke was not about them, many people thought it was and they had a stron response to that. But to make it clear I did not do any editing, I just put my thoughts on how to improve the John Kerry article on the John Kerry discussion page. <a href="../../../b/c/o/User%7EBcody_e034.html" title="User:Bcody">Bcody</a> 01:58, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, talking's good with reasonnable people. Problem here is:
<ul>
<li>People who ignore a half dozen signs screaming it's a legit edit (as I listed on Dina's page), and ignore basic rules (reasonnable people don't need to read <a href="../../../r/e/v/WP%7EREVERT_1079.html" title="WP:REVERT">WP:REVERT</a> to know they shouldn't revert wholesale an edit they object only to a part thereof, "Don't delete, improve" is common sense), and the difference between and article page and a dab page, and due process for identifying actual vandalism such as looking up edit history and edit summary, and HTML comment information (especially flaming ALL-CAPS ones), etc.</li>
<li>People like that, in my experience, are NOT reasonnable and will continue to delete and remove useful content out of incompetence, just to up their edit count, until told not to by an authority figure, like an admin.</li>
<li>Hence my plea here, to attract attention to this singing-n-dancing nuisance, because it's not just a one t-time, local disagreement about one point of one article, it's an editor ignoring all due process for fighting vandalism or reverting, and using an automation tool "VandalProof" to massively apply those reverts, and thus it's an ongoing problem that will continue and affect any number of pages until an authority figure tell her that's not how it's done.</li>
<li>And since a half dozen screaming signs it was a legit edit removed her any excuse whatsoever, and since she's wasting people's time by reverting wholesale regular edits, well, I call 'em like I see 'em. Because assuming good faith on her part doesn't remove the fact she's incompetent at reverting articles, possibly doing more harm than good overall, and will continue to until told not to by an authority figure, if even that.</li>

<dd>And I maintain that deleting the entry for a notable audio manufacturer called Alice, from the Alice dab page, was incompetent. Furthermore, dab pages are the least interesting for spam: nobody's supposed to get there under normal conditions, any link to a dab page is temporary by nature, and destined to be fixed, until the dab page's "What links here" is empty and the dab page orphaned - only there to catch the next erroneous wikilinks that'll need to be disambiguated. Dab pages are the last page one would target for linkspam.</dd>

<li>I already saw the history, and I really don't care. Perhaps if you had been civil with the people reverting you, then others would be more interested in paying attention to you; your edits up to the Alice point are pretty good. However, creating a redlink on the Alice dab page for a company, knowing full well that Alice is a rather common name, and then going on an insult spree when it gets reverted, pretty much negates any hope of others having patience with you.

<dd>Brilliant solution, whatever the outcome of the AFD!
<ul>
<li>Funny thing is, I have no special interest in Alice (which is why I just drop them in the hellpit of a dab page, instead of aiming at making an article for them), and yet I'll now have to do some notability googling about them in order to put my dollar where my mouth is.</li>
<li>But yours is a constructive and objective solution. Constructive because it doesn't just blindly delete information, but encourages creation and research instead. And objective because it's not just one deletionist who decide to remove information from the encyclopedia based on whim or ignorance, but a peer review at AFD that'll decide if said creation can stay. Controlled creation instead of uncontrolled destruction.</li>

<p>Wow, that will teach me to go to bed early. My reasoning was pretty straight forward (in an evening with tons and tons of vandlism of various sorts): It looked like spam to me. And the "revert vandalism" was a very gentle first level spam nudge. The edit summary was kind of confusing since it contained an external link. Honestly, a simple "I think you made a mistake &amp; here's why" probably would have convinced me to revert myself and remove the warning. The stub/Afd is a good solution. I won't be participating in the Afd because I really have no vested interest in seeing Alice <i>not</i> get an article, however I'm curious to see the outcome. I remain comfortable in my basic competence.

<p>Could somebody help me out here? There's an anon user (using a varity of IPs in the 62.47.180s range, and claiming to be <a href="../../../../de/a/n/d/Benutzer%7EAndrea1984_bc5a.html" class="extiw" title="de:Benutzer:Andrea1984">de:Benutzer:Andrea1984</a>) who keeps on reverting the article because of some strangeness regarding the English word "presumptive." The disagreement has something to do with the fact that the German synonym is <i>präsumtiv</i>. Originally, the anon wanted to use "presumtive" instead of "presumptive" in the article (a campaign that, so far as I can tell, goes back several months, if not years), and then today has decided to remove the word "presumptive" from the article entirely and replace it with an awkward euphemism, on the basis that it is a "bad word" and that removing it will end the "argument." She has now reverted the article four times today (I've reverted it three times), and is basically saying that she doesn't care about the 3RR after I warned her about it. I think the article needs to be semi-protected and reverted back to the form that everybody else seems to agree is fine. Any help greatly appreciated! <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 16:53, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'll watchlist it, but keep in mind, the message you recently left on their talk page may be the first time they've seen any messages. Some people don't know how to see the history or the talk page, they just know how to click edit and save page. So if they don't get the hint the first time, just revert them and explain on their talk page that they need to explain themselves with references on the article's talk page and provide a link to it.

<p>I was recently dealing with a situation in which I had to check several references on a particular administrator's talkpage. In doing so, I found myself repeatedly misspelling the admin's username (it's a long name and readily misspelled). I suggested that the admin create a user account under the alternative spelling with a redirect to the real username, to avoid the possibility of a very credible impersonation account being created. I have seen several other administrators and experienced editors create redirects in exactly this fashion to avoid impersonation worries, but this admin, coloring by the numbers, wanted to make sure doing this was acceptable. Can someone confirm that it is? Thank you. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 18:06, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hell, even if the common misspelling was already registered in an impersonation attempt, go ahead and make it a protected redirect to assist search attempts.

Since Hilda Toledano a/k/a Maria Pia is deceased, references to her do not implicate an issue of libel as to a living person, and my limited review of the edit histories didn't see any negative references to her designated successor (who is living).

<p>A user on the "Anarchism" talk page called "Anarcho-capitalism" is causing a lot of trouble. He continually abuses other members on the board calling names. He refers to Anarcho-Communists with epithets like "commies" and accuses people who don't agree with his personal view on "Individualism" to be "haters of freedom" and "anti-individual". Lately he's been vandalizing the page on Anarchism to push his pro-Anarcho-Capitalism POV which I and others have had to erase several times. He also vandalizes the page on Mutualist Anarchism and Individualist Anarchism to push his POV and seems to get support from a sockpuppet called "Doctors without Suspenders". Can he be stopped? <a href="../../../f/u/l/User%7EFull_Shunyata_bffa.html" title="User:Full Shunyata">Full Shunyata</a> 01:55, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

Kropotkin is certainly one of the best secondary sources you've come up with, but the claim about Proudhon looks questionable. The "national bank" would be the Bank of Exchange of 1848, which was to issue a secured currency, based on discounted business paper. The Bank of the People, proposed the same year, also issued a secured currency. All of the claims about Proudhon and "credit checks" seem to ultimately source to either Kropotkin or Marx, and neither of them are particularly clear about their sources. Only on Wikipedia would anyone think this cut it as proof.</i> <b>[Libertatia] 16:04, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</b> <a href="../../../f/u/l/User%7EFull_Shunyata_bffa.html" title="User:Full Shunyata">Full Shunyata</a> 06:27, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What's going on is anarchists (by definition anti-capitalist) are not happy with your attempts to redefine the history of anarchism to push your minority POV. "Anarcho"-capitalists are rejected by anarchists around the world because you reject all but one narrowly defined element of anarchism. But, while we're willing to compromise and accept a mention of "anarcho"-capitalism within the article on anarchism, you, on the other hand, wish to change the entire article so that it argues against the dominant forms of anarchism - anarchist-communism, collectivism and anarcho-syndicalism. That is a clearly breach of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undue_weight#Undue_weight" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undue_weight#Undue_weight" rel="nofollow">NPOV policy</a>. Furthermore, your user page is insulting, your attitude is uncompromising and hostile and, as for your chasing editors off the page, that's very clear from the edit history [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anarchism&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anarchism&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">of Anarchism</a>].

<dd>I knew it. You didn't like my Userpage. I'm not the one that put anarcho-capitalism in the article so I don't know why you're complaining to me about it. But, you're not "compromising" by allowing it in. You have to let in. That's because it is regarded as a form of anarchism by virtually all scholars and there are a million sources for that. The only people who disagree are anarcho-communist - of course! I'm not doing any "POV pushing" at all in the article. You've presented no evidence of that. No evidence for any of the claims above have been presented. The reason for that is that there is none.

<p>Okay, so if the accuser doesn't show some evidence really soon that this case needs to be on this page, I think it can be pretty clear marked off as a content dispute. --<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasamage_4cdb.html" title="User:Masamage">Masamage</a> 01:49, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, please read the thread <b>in full</b>. So many times administrators dismiss this as a mere content dispute, when it is in fact a pattern of disruptive behaviour. As <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisruptive_editing_02a2.html" title="Wikipedia:Disruptive editing">Wikipedia:Disruptive editing</a> says:

I'm not an admin, but I do try to help out with stuff that doesn't necessarily need their attention; I think this dispute clearly does, so I had probably best step aside.

<dd>For there to be a "pattern of disruptive behavior" needs at least one example of disruptive behavior wouldn't you think? So far there are none.

They especially don't like the details of the Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit over civil fraud, particularly the quote</p>
<dl>
<dd>"In the words of the SEC complaint, "As of late 2002, MI's approximately 40 years' of development has resulted in a prototype Skycar capable of hovering about fifteen feet above the ground.""</dd>
</dl>
<p>It's accurate and properly cited; they just don't like it. (Here's the <a href="http://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/comp17987.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/comp17987.htm" rel="nofollow">actual SEC court filing in SEC vs. Moller</a>, which Moller settled by paying $50,000. It's much harder on Moller than the Wikipedia article: "From at least 1997 until October 2001, Paul S. Moller ("Moller"), a university professor and inventor, sold unregistered shares of MI stock directly to the public, raising approximately $5.1 million from more than 500 investors. MI fueled investor interest through materially false and misleading statements about the company's imminent listing on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") and the Nasdaq Stock Market, the projected value of MI shares after such listing and the prospect for product sales and revenue.") So there's an established history of fraud here. The history is long; Moller has been promising a flying car in about three years since 1974. The company would apparently prefer that their embarassing history be less visible.</p>

<p>Someone up there in Davis really wants this article written their way.

<dd>If they offer you money, take it!

<dd>They may have a point; I'm not sure that the SEC stuff being so prominently near the start is not POV. Nobody has doubted that the physics and engineering can work for something along these lines for a long time - it's a question of how much money would it take to make it work and whether Moller had what it took, in both engineering and financial senses, to do it.</dd>
<dd>Moller was doing some dodgy financial stuff and got called on it, but the SEC doesn't let serious criminals get away with a fine and staying in business. I don't think it's criminal to be a pie-eyed wild visionary.</dd>
<dd>I would support keeping the existing SEC stuff in the article, in a "Criticism" section down at the bottom, after a more extensive list of the vehicle characteristics along the lines of their proposed changes. Those are verifyable - I've seen them somewhere, I don't know where or I'd just put the reference in now, but I have seen them. Av Leak article maybe. They should be cited properly. And the article should accurately and in detail explain the SEC charges. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 04:41, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>You could offer to open a content RFC, if the editor wishes. It all depends on why Moller Skycar is known. If it's known generally as an example of scandal, then the scandal/allegations should be in the lead. If it's known as a corporation trying to fly, then the allegations belong in a criticism section. If there are charges only, then the company's answer to those should also be given in a reduced form. Is this, in other words, Enron (the article for which would have changed enormously in 1999) or British Harrier? <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 10:33, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>As Hoopydink points out, this is not against any rule. If you disagree with someone's actions, you need to at least make the effort to have a discussion with them about it. Apparently all you've done is post "Are you kidding?" on Mjal's talk page, which isn't exactly <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">neighborly</a>.

<dd>Actually, it is disruption. We have blocked people for it in the past. However, it's evidence to be used in conjunction with other abuses and not enough by itself. Going in and "support" to every nomination is the same as going in and "oppose" every nomination: both are unconsidered motions. Since RFA, like AfD, is for discussion and opinion, knee jerk votes should, at the very least, be discounted, but they are also -- as surely as an "oppose i hate admins" -- attempting to disrupt by inflating/skewing results. However, nothing on the first offense except a friendly query and a query on the RfA for the beaurocrats, at least in my opinion. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 10:38, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The aforemetnioned user deleted entire sections of the Tammy Duckworth article without posting proposed changes, garnering the appearance of vandalism. Normally, someone informs that editor that their actions could be considered vandalism. Perhaps it is just me being a well-meaning yet inexperienced noob, User:75.2.250.145 does not exist. User talk:75.2.250.145 exists as a <i>Special Page</i> - a new term for me. When I posted a comment on what appeared to be a brand new user-talk page, I was informed by icon box that User:75.2.250.145 is an anonymous user.
