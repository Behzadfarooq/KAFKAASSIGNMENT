<p>"Captain Ozzel became the commander of the Super Star Destroyer Executor when it was launched" - This does not match up with what Timothy Zahn wrote in 'Allegiance'. In that book he has Ozzel as the captain of the Reprisal, and in the same book the Executor also plays a role, and it has a different captain. Therefore, unless there are two such ships (both SSDs and both Vader's personal flagships) I don't see how both statements can be true...</p>
<p>Please get Ozzel's picture, but not from the scene where he was killed by Vader.- <a href="../../../b/-/1/User%7EB-101_6b01.html" title="User:B-101">B-101</a> 12:39, 15 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I see that Ozzel's height is 5'3". Should his height be in English or in Metric? The same goes for all SW characters (there's a little inconsistency with what system their height is in). I think it should be in Metric.- <a href="../../../b/-/1/User%7EB-101_6b01.html" title="User:B-101">B-101</a> 17:27, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Wasn't Ozzel's death actually a mistake on Vader's part? Vader assumed the Rebels knew the Imperial Fleet was on its way because Ozzel came out of hyperspace too close to the system. However, they knew because they found the probe droid. The probe droid wasn't able to get a message out because the confrontation with Solo was over so quickly (we saw before that it had to extend its antenna, and its signaling was audible), so the Empire never knew that they found it. (DrZarkov 23:11, 11 April 2006 (UTC))</p>
<dl>
<dd>Dunno. The Rebels certainly knew the Imperials were coming <i>eventually</i> because of the probe droid, but I think Ozzel's maneuver gave them the exact time and immediate warning, if you catch my drift. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarudubshinki_b9b7.html" title="User:Marudubshinki">maru</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarudubshinki_ad9c.html" title="User talk:Marudubshinki">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Marudubshinki_980c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Marudubshinki">contribs</a> 03:26, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think this could be considers a bit of a plot hole or tech error depending on one's point of view. If the Imperials knew that that the Rebels knew that they where coming then logically they would want to come out of hyperspace as close as possible to prevent the rebels from escape. I think it is safe to assume the the Imperials knew the probe was detected since there was no reason that the probe would have not transmitted the fact that it was discovered. If the Rebels know the Imperials are coming, it would be nearly impossible to sneak up on them. They will certainly be paying more attention in a way that is difficult to maintain for the long-term. Furthermore if the Imperials already know where they are that, the Rebels can use active scanners that would have given away their location if the Imperials had not already know their location. (The Rebels could put an active scanner off-base to prevent the equivalent to the real-world missiles that follow radar transmissions to active radar sites.) Also the Imperials would not have known that the Rebels did not have any patrols. The Imperials don't know how long it will take the Rebels to get important people, troops, and/or equipment off Hoth. So sneaking up on the Rebels risks allowing the Rebels to escape before the noose is closed. Then there is a question of how such large ships that lack stealth can sneak up on anything. I might also point out that Ozzel's put down of Piett was just. The odds that the discovery was the Rebel base was low. A Galaxy-wide search should have produced many possible "rebels." Piett's job would have been to do a better analysis than what he gave to Ozzel and Vader. A group of humans on a planet not previously known to have them is a bit underwhelming. It just so happened that Vader's use of the force told him the right answer. He might have even had a feeling that he should be on the bridge... Of course one can say this is over-analysis of a series of movies that is loaded with many far more elementary plot holes. And that would probably be right. MichaelSH 02:46, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I know I read somewhere that Ozzel was able to reach the highest echelons of the Imperial Navy due to him being the son of a wealthy and influential family with firm loyalties to the Empire. I can't remember if this was from one of the games or from one of the novels, but I believe it's a part of the same story that describes General Veers as being "A good man fighting for the wrong side" due to the fact that he believes the Empire has the potential to be a just and noble governing body, were it run by less corrupt leaders. If I recall correctly, he describes them as benign cancers that merely need to be removed. Does anybody else remember this at all? <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamer_Junkie_f015.html" title="User:Gamer Junkie">Gamer Junkie</a> 06:29, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
