<dd>I'd like to see something done, and strongly urge other admins to do so; the userpage definately is an attack page, and honestly, seems like trolling itself. Since Keith (KHM03) is a friend, I don't feel neutral enough to take action, but someone uninvolved with the parties should take a look and do something. <font color="#696969"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> <sup><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><i>Talk</i></a> • <i>Contact</i></sup></font> 06:19, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can't intervene, as I'm involved with this. In fact, I've no doubt that I'll soon be mentioned by name as one of the "trolls" (he still has these attacks on his talk page). We have two new (very similar) users, John1838 (<a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn1838_97a7.html" title="User talk:John1838">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_John1838_c9e0.html" title="Special:Contributions/John1838">contribs</a>) and Trollwatcher (<a href="../../../t/r/o/User_talk%7ETrollwatcher_3950.html" title="User talk:Trollwatcher">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Trollwatcher_5b77.html" title="Special:Contributions/Trollwatcher">contribs</a>), who both appeared around the time that the Checkuser showed that <a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">Giovanni33</a> (<a href="../../../g/i/o/User_talk%7EGiovanni33_9764.html" title="User talk:Giovanni33">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Giovanni33_df83.html" title="Special:Contributions/Giovanni33">contribs</a>) was also <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBelindaGong_bd31.html" title="User:BelindaGong">BelindaGong</a> (<a href="../../../b/e/l/User_talk%7EBelindaGong_f84e.html" title="User talk:BelindaGong">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BelindaGong_2da5.html" title="Special:Contributions/BelindaGong">contribs</a>). There is some reason to suspect that they are the same user as each other, and may even be part of the Giovanni/Belinda sockpuppet/meatpuppet group. They use similar language (both referring to some editors as "DEWCs"...shorthand for devout, ecumenical, western Christians), and before either of them registered, IP <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.22.236.111_350e.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.22.236.111">82.22.236.111</a> posted very similar stuff (about the established editors being "trolls" and part of a "clique" to the Christianity talk page, signing himself "Trollspotter".<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Christianity&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=38489006" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Christianity&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=38489006" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> He later posted to John1838's talk page, obviously as John himself.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:John1838&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=39613042" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:John1838&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=39613042" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> We also had <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreethinker99_5e1e.html" title="User:Freethinker99">Freethinker99</a> (<a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreethinker99_5091.html" title="User talk:Freethinker99">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Freethinker99_e0a4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Freethinker99">contribs</a>) appearing on the Christianity talk page while Giovanni and Belinda were blocked, saying that he was new and had read the talk page and agreed with Giovanni, reverting to Giovanni's version, and then accidentally signing one of Giovanni's talk page posts (denying association with any of the new users) while still logged on as Freethinker<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giovanni33&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=39658454" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giovanni33&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=39658454" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> and immediately changing it to Giovanni.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giovanni33&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=39658454" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giovanni33&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=39658454" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> Various explanations were given — Freethinker and Giovanni knew each other and Giovanni happened to be at Freethinker's house, and Freethinker let him use his computer, and Giovanni denied association with Freethinker because he hadn't seen Freethinker's name in the people being referred to. In one place, Freethinker said <i>he</i> wrote the post <i>for</i> Giovanni; in another place, he said that he allowed Giovanni to write it.</dd>

<dd>An unfortunate result of the checkuser was that <a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESOPHIA_915a.html" title="User:SOPHIA">SOPHIA</a> left in anger after the checkuser showed that she was editing from the same IP address as <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheShriek_2b43.html" title="User:TheShriek">TheShriek</a>. (Unlike Giovanni/Belinda, SOPHIA and her husband had no history of casting double votes or taking six reverts between them.) We all regreat that, and we posted some very nice messages to her, telling her that we did not <i>in any way</i> associate her with Giovanni, but she was unable to accept that there was no cloud over her name. I can't blame admins if they haven't fully read my request for help <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_feeb.html#Advice_requested_from_experienced_admins" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard">here</a> and <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_feeb.html#Advice_requested_Part_Two" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard">here</a>. It's complicated, and probably not particularly interesting for those who aren't involved. Basically, a new user, Giovanni33, turned up, and began to insist on inserting very controversial stuff into Christianity-related articles. He met with resistence from "older" editors. He went way beyond three reverts per day, despite pleadings and warnings. The other editors, who were trying to stay within 344, were reluctant to report a newcomer, so he was not reported for nearly three weeks. Four new, redlinked, editors appeared on the talk page and supported him. Some of them began to revert to his version, and followed him to other pages, where they did the same thing. <i>That</i> was why I (in consultation with the others) requested a checkuser, which did not include SOPHIA, but did include her husband.</dd>

<dd><i><b>Please</b></i>, we need help. What's to be done about John1838 and Trollwatcher (if they're two people), who seem to be here just to stir up trouble on the Christianity talk page? What's to be done about Giovanni and Belinda (if they're two people), who actively went through a pretence of not knowing each other, while taking at least six reverts per day, plus voting twice on some issues? Giovanni seems to be claiming that since she is is wife, her reverts and votes are legitimate. We also sometimes get reverts (to Giovanni's version) from IP addresses when the new, registered users have run out of reverts. Doesn't anyone have time to read "Advice requested from experienced admins" and "Advice requested Part Two" above? It will probably be archived soon.&#160;:-( <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 11:02, 21 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I can't even follow all that. It would help if you could provide sumaries of the situation that are <b>much</b> shorter including links to specific diffs and other evidence of what you are talking about. It all looks fishy and some of what you refer to looks blockworthy. Repeatedly counting up 3 reverts and returning the next day to do the same is blockable as disruption anyway, and I'm not swayed by the wife argument anyway. If they can't provide reliable references for their position, they shouldn't be allowed to revert back to their version. Consider creating and RFC to organize all the information and come to a consensus about how to stop the disruption. If they have valid points they don't need the sockpuppetry to improve the articles. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 11:57, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>Giovanni33 wants to add what I think is a rather fringe minority view of the historical development of Christianity. It is too detailed and too far from the mainstream for the general survey article, but it could easily go in <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Christianity_e274.html" title="History of Christianity">History of Christianity</a>, <a href="../../../e/a/r/Early_Christianity_6b3f.html" title="Early Christianity">Early Christianity</a>, or any of half a dozen others. The problem is not the content, but the behavior, which has brought progress on the article to a standstill. When he was unable to get a concensus to support his changes, he edit-warred to force them. When he was blocked for 3RR, and used puppets to avoid the block. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 16:29, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It seems to me that both of the users in question have made it their primary mission to engage in <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a> and violate the <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">civility rule</a>.

<dd>Well, not really, if you know the trick: if you have a "chained move" A-&gt;B-&gt;C, simply undo the moves in reverse order (C-&gt;B-&gt;A). The rules which the software uses to decide when to allow overwriting a redirect allow that. Of course, once any of the other pages on the chain have been edited, you need an admin to delete the target pages. --<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesarB_5f7f.html" title="User:CesarB">cesarb</a> 00:14, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If they're going to keep changing IP (and you did say they were <i>various</i> IPs) then there is little point in blocking an IP for six months when we know he/she(/it?) has moved on to another IP.

<p>User:Njfreen1 whose only text contribution seems to be the now-deleted nonsense article Andrew David Wong uploaded an image. Can someone make sure that it should be deleted?

<dd>For an image with no source, like that one, you can just put {{subst:nsd}} and an admin will delete it. I've already done this.

<p>I probably should have mentioned that I am an admin. I do almost all admin activities daily, including article deletions and blocks, but feel uncomfortable with image deletions because I cannot see well enough to see images, and images cannot be restored. <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcademic_Challenger_1bc6.html" title="User:Academic Challenger">Academic Challenger</a> 06:51, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ah, I'm sorry, I misunderstood.

<dd>I would suggest as someone concerned with the issue as an AOL user you may actually be in a better position to convince AOL to cooperate and come up with a tehcnical work around which would allow much better selective blocking (allowing not just registerd users but those who wish not to register), by raising a query with AOL themselves as to the issue and to what they propose to do about it (i.e. providing some unique although not "identifying" header within AOL proxy requests such that selective blocking is practical for any site like wikipedia wishes to do so.) --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User%7EPgk_d0c7.html" title="User:Pgk">pgk</a><sup>(<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk"><font color="mediumseagreen">talk</font></a>)</sup> 01:55, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just wanted to check if there are any special rules or guidelines for editing protected MediaWiki pages, aside from obvious things like using common sense and discretion. For concreteness, I'm interested in adding a link back to the <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">WP:PROD</a> list from the page that comes up after you delete something (for the same reason there's already a link to <a href="../../../c/a/n/Category%7ECandidates_for_speedy_deletion_4c9c.html" title="Category:Candidates for speedy deletion">Category:Candidates for speedy deletion</a>).

<li>I can't imagine many people watch the Mediawiki pages—there are a lot where changes would be quite noticable—which is why I figured I had better post somewhere else.

<p>If you check out <a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/queries/en_proposed_deletion" class="external free" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/queries/en_proposed_deletion" rel="nofollow">http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/queries/en_proposed_deletion</a> , the list of proposed deletions, you'll notice that almost every entry was added to the list at 14:59 25th February. This is not the case, the bulk of those were prodded before that date. So you have articles like Ogie which should now be in the red csd zone looking like theres 5 days left to run.</p>
<p>I notified Interiot of this pretty much as it happened. I come back now later, and see that it hasn't been fixed. A possible cause for his script breaking, is that <a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">Template:Prod</a> was blanked. It was only reverted half an hour later, at 14:59, which is also when all the proposals have been logged to have taken place. So this post is twofold really:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the breakage is due to the blanking of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">Template:Prod</a>, then maybe it's best to protect it.</li>
<li>Maybe you should go through the list and look for articles which should now be deleted, like Corinis</li>

<dd>In the context of this vandalism, it's not going to be reliable, or are you saying cl_timestamp won't be reliable in other contexts too?

<p>It seems clear to me that at least three of the vandals (Fry, Ryan, and Pjh) are the same person: the edit histories and vandisms of all three are nearly identical, occurring on the same pages to the same users. Take a look at Frys104's contributions: [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Frys104" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Frys104" rel="nofollow">[36]</a>], compare to <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanlong_5839.html" title="User:Ryanlong">User:Ryanlong</a>'s: [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Ryanlong" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Ryanlong" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>] and <a href="../../../p/j/h/User%7EPjh1810_fad4.html" title="User:Pjh1810">user:Pjh1810</a>'s: [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Pjh1810" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Pjh1810" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>]. They are the same.</p>
<p>Many of the guy's contributions seem sound, but he vandalizes any user he doesn't like, and it's become a bad situation.</p>
<p>I am less certain about <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorstnightmare_8db9.html" title="User:Worstnightmare">User:Worstnightmare</a>'s identity, because he was blocked so early that he didn't have a chance to make other contributions before he was blocked.</p>
<p>Please block this user/users for an extended period. I'm tired of dealing with his vandalism, and I suspect about 20 other people are as well. User active today.--<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirsfron_bff1.html" title="User:Firsfron">Firsfron</a> 19:02, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've come across a whole slew of movie articles recently created by User: Katja9 10. They've all got very brief descriptions ("19xx film directed by ___"), a brief cast list, and a plot synopsis which in every case I've looked at was cut-and-pasted directly from imdb.com or some other site. You can look at <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Katja9_10_cd18.html" title="Special:Contributions/Katja9 10">the user's contributions list</a> and probably spot lots more.</p>
<p>I tagged several of these with {copyvio} and listed them at <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_problems_2006_February_26_09fa.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright problems/2006 February 26">Wikipedia:Copyright problems/2006 February 26</a>, but I'm thinking that's too tedious and the wrong approach. I'm afraid the expedient thing to do will be simply to delete every article this user has created since at least February 9. Checking all the text is timeconsuming, and the trend is clear, and the articles aren't worth keeping once the copied synopses are removed. (They aren't encyclopedic; they don't contain anything the imdb doesn't. I assume we don't want to try to duplicate imdb, that if we're going to have an article on a movie, it ought to have some pretense of being notable and encyclopeic.)</p>
<p>I left a message on <a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKatja9_10_8f7c.html" title="User talk:Katja9 10">the user's talk page</a> a little while ago. They may have seen it, because the synopses they've posted since then (yes, they're still at it) are lightly paraphrased from the imdb ones, although I notice they're now cutting and pasting the "goofs" list, too. <a href="../../../u/m/m/User%7EUmmit_38d5.html" title="User:Ummit">Steve Summit</a> (<a href="../../../u/m/m/User_talk%7EUmmit_97c6.html" title="User talk:Ummit">talk</a>) 18:58, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I disagree, you can't go through and delete all of this users contribs because she has copyvios, the right thing to do is go through each and every article and tag it.

<dd>We can assume good faith–I'm sure that the new editor does <i>mean</i> well–while still cleaning out the copyvios.

<dd>What's the point of process for the sake of process when we already know what the outcome will be? Save the bandwidth, server space, time, effort, and potential legal exposure. As far as I know, there hasn't been any objection to deleting these cut-and-paste copies; unless there's a serious objection here, then I think it's not unreasonable to assume that there is a consensus to delete them. We're better off saving the 'process' for cases where there <i>is</i> some dispute. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 02:54, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I have no objection to a mass deletion. If the cases are identical, it makes sense.

<dd>TenOfAllTrades == mega-correct. Process is important only in disputes; anywhere else (where <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a> applies) can have process safely ignored. Anyway, this sounds familiar; I distinctly recall we used to have someone who added almost totally useless articles on TV shows, actors, and movies. I don't think they were copyvios, though. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 03:28, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I tagged 10 or 15 of the worst of them as {copyvio} before I got tired of it. I tend to agree with TenOfAllTrades and Johnleemk, although anything truly expedient would have to be done by an admin.

<p>I would very much appreciate more input from admins on this matter, as otherwise this can just turn into a back-and-forth litany of accusations between Giovanni and me. The <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> article has now been protected. I would like to answer some of the accusations made against me, and then to request advice as to what should happen now.</p>
<p>I seem to be accused of having driven <a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESOPHIA_915a.html" title="User:SOPHIA">SOPHIA</a> away. I disagreed with SOPHIA about some of her edits (while agreeing with others). I respected her and have never at any stage suspected her of anything dishonourable. At one stage, she said on the Christianity talk page that it had been "scary" to have me and two others "at" her at the same time. Following that statement, <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> left her a message saying that he was sorry if we had scared her, that it had not been our intention, and that he appreciated her efforts at calming down tension. I followed that with a post saying that <i>I</i> also regretted if we had scared her off, although I didn't recall having done so, and that I respected her as a genuine editor, here to improve the encyclopaedia. Our posts (Str1977's and mine) are <a href="../../../s/o/p/User_talk%7ESOPHIA_c099.html#Further_Reading" title="User talk:SOPHIA">here</a>. She replied <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_Archive08_525a.html#That_fateful_.22scary.22_quote" title="User talk:Musical Linguist/Archive08">here</a> that she had expressed herself badly, and that she had been trying to explain that the <i>process</i> of trying to reply to three simultaneous editors who agree (and can type a lot faster than she!) was scary when she was new. She also said that Str1977 had left her a nice message and that she regarded us both and <a href="../../../k/h/m/User%7EKHM03_7873.html" title="User:KHM03">KHM03</a> as serious, thoughtful editors, and that she admired the patience that we had shown towards <a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">Giovanni33</a>.</p>

<p>I need some assistance from my fellow admins. I placed a prod tag on the article Siflige, as I considered it a non-notable gaming community. The prod tag was contested by User:Erik Navkire, so I attempted to change the prod to an AfD nomination. When I did this however, I discovered that the article had previously been deleted through AfD, so the AfD tag automatically linked to the old <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Siflige_9d00.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Siflige">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Siflige</a> discussion. How can I renominate this article, without it linking to the old AfD discussion?

<dd>I don't know if a particular nation's laws are preferred here, but in the United States, artistic derivative works, in particular, artistic pieces making use of other works -- whether the original work was copyrighted or not -- do not generally require approval from the original copyright holder -- it's typically considered fair use. See Andy Warhol's Campbell Soup Cans as a reference.

<dd>That's an amazing idea, and after providing their email addresses, how exactly <i>do</i> they edit from a blocked iP? Oh yes, wonderful plan! Hey, here's an idea, maybe even though AOL 100% ignores its own paying customers, maybe they'll be more responsive to an administrator from an online encylopedia! That will certianly inspire them to radically overhaul a server system that hasn't been updated since the 1990s!

<li><b>Interesting</b> that out of all the times people complain about AOL, no one ever mentions that having or not having a unique sharedip is a choice made by a given user, AOL not withstanding, the only time AOL actually applies it's bizaire sharedip system is if you're one of those idiots who thinks that AOL is a perfectly good web browser, the second you exit the AOL shell you <b>are</b> assigned a reasonably unique IP in the <b>172.128.0.0 - 172.191.255.255</b> range, yet I don't think I've ever seen a single AOL user on wikipedia actually fess up to this, the only inention I can gather from that is that all the AOL sharedips are either idiots, or harboring some sort of malice against wikipedia, and since 10 minutes on an AOL message board will clarify that it is in fact the former, not the later, there's little than can be done about it--172.149.179.164 00:40, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

The only excuse I have to offer is that in the last week I have been autoblocked <i>every single time</i> I was trying to contribute, any edits I succeeded in making only being lucky enough to make it in before I got the door slammed in my face (yes, it's <i>that</i> bad). Having said that, I apologize if I hurt anyone's feelings. Insert your favorite picture of Vremya munching humble pie here. However, I would still like an answer to my question, so let me try to frame it less abrasively: The statement of User:172.149.179.164 that "no one ever mentions that having or not having a unique shared IP is a choice made by a given user, AOL notwithstanding" may be technically true in the same sense that having or not having a French-Latvian dictionary is a "choice" made by a given user, but just try to buy one at your corner bookstore. Note the operative phrase "no one ever mentions." I <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume</a> that 172.149.179.164 has not realized that one likely consequence of the fact that no one ever mentions this is that for the vast majority of AOL users for whom, like myself, computers are not their field of technical expertise but tools to do something else with (like, say, contributing to an encyclopedia), the fact that unique IPs are available to AOL users under certain technical circumstances amounts to a <i>well-kept secret</i>. So: <b>What is the secret?</b> How exactly does one obtain a unique nonshared IP from AOL? As far as I could gather, it involves shutting down the AOL browser. Unfortunately, I have no idea how to do that without effectively losing my connection (and I have tried); as far as I with my lack of technical training can tell, AOL's dial-up program <b>is</b> the browser. Could someone please give a more extensive, less technical, and (pretty please) less sneering explanation? I promise I won't snarl again if it means chewing my own arm off (which I've nearly done in frustration at the constant blocking anyway&#160;:-( <a href="../../../v/r/e/User%7EVremya_d4a9.html" title="User:Vremya">Vremya</a> 04:17, 28 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>Given that the discussion seems to have focused on AOL (naturally enough, as AOL users are among the most common victims of collateral damage), it may be worth recalling that dynamic IPs vulnerable to collateral damage are <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_proposal_01f4.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy proposal">not confined to AOL users</a>.

<p>I notice that many users are blocked with cryptic summaries like "User...". Since the summary is shown to the user as the reason for their block, these are totally useless. Please use "Inappropriate username" or another wording that provides a valid reason for the block to the user. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User_talk%7EZocky_f226.html" title="User talk:Zocky">Zocky</a> | <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_Picture_Popups_bee7.html" title="User:Zocky/Picture Popups">picture popups</a> 05:11, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Many of the usernames that get blocked are just throwaway sockpuppets or vandals playing denial of service games or username creation performance art and watching the block log and never even triggering a block (for instance the "block me" accounts... but if we ignore them and don't block, they sometimes go ahead and vandalize anyway, for instance <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=50_Cent&amp;diff=37583227&amp;oldid=37579179" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=50_Cent&amp;diff=37583227&amp;oldid=37579179" rel="nofollow">[47]</a>). In other words, much of the time when "user..." is used, the user who actually created the username will never even read or see the block message.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Because of autoblocking, meaningful block summaries very often do more harm than good. In cases of vandalism, I do put "vandalism" in the block summary, but every single day I get e-mail from one or more collaterally damaged AOL users asking "why are you accusing me of vandalism?"</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The way that the Mediawiki software handles autoblocking is entirely inadequate and often harmful. At the very least, "established users" (non-throwaway accounts) should be immune from all forms of IP-based blocking, and since autoblocks almost never make sense for AOL addresses, the software should internally detect AOL IP ranges and silently not autoblock them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps it's time to get rid of autoblocking altogether. Half the time it doesn't work because the vandal can shift IP addresses, and most of the rest of the time it causes more harm than good because it blocks everyone stuck behind an ISP or school or corporation proxy IP. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 06:43, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A few in-favour-of-Georgian-POV editors are currently discussing with a few Abkhazia-and-South-Ossetia-are-sovereign-the-same-way-that-Transnistria-and-Northern-Cyprus-are editors, and I'm currently a bit stressed out and don't want to participate too much in the debate (since I tend to violate <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> when I'm under stress, which I don't usually do).

<dd>I believe Nightstalion either misunderstood or misinterpreted or misrepresented the position of some of the editors (including myself). They are not in-favour-of-Georgian-POV only. They are, using Nightstalion's terminology, Abkhazia-and-South-Ossetia-and-Transnistria-and-Northern-Cyprus-are-not-sovereign.

What I found was an attack page for a made-up holiday, Caucazia, and an edit history that indicated that the user had been moving it around for nearly a month, see <a href="../../../u/n/d/Special%7EUndelete_Caucazia_ad50.html" title="Special:Undelete/Caucazia">Special:Undelete/Caucazia</a>. The user also linked a number of pages (his user page, his talk page, the talk pages for several other articles) to that page.</p>
<p>As near as I can tell, this account has been used for nothing but vandalism and disruption. I deleted the attack page, blocked the account for 24 hours while deciding what to do, and cleaned up after the hideous, tangled mess of redirects this user left in her or his wake. I'd like to solicit opinions on what the appropriate block length for this user is. As always, if any admin feels I have overstepped my bounds, feel free to review or reverse my changes.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Archive32_7672.html" title="Edit section: SOPHIA">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">SOPHIA</span></h2>
<p>SOPHIA was extremely hurt and angry when the checkuser result came through, showing her connection to <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheShriek_2b43.html" title="User:TheShriek">TheShriek</a>. It was I who requested a check, and I did so in consultation with other editors. I did not include SOPHIA in it. When Giovanni arrived, he engaged in massive edit warring. I don't mean an accidental slip into a fourth revert (as I did myself on one occasion) — I mean six and five and eleven, ignoring warnings and pleas from other editors. It was unfair because none of the "older" editors had a history of running to <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_3RR_4b52.html" title="WP:AN/3RR">WP:AN/3RR</a> to report an opponent, <i>especially</i> not if he was new, and we were all trying to stay within the rules ourselves. At least four new redlinked users appeared and said on the talk page that they agreed with Giovanni. Most of them began reverting to his version, and also following him to other pages, voting where he voted, claiming that there was consensus, etc. These users were <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBelindaGong_bd31.html" title="User:BelindaGong">BelindaGong</a>, <a href="../../../k/e/c/User%7EKecik_2b59.html" title="User:Kecik">Kecik</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikaM_b05b.html" title="User:MikaM">MikaM</a>, and <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheShriek_2b43.html" title="User:TheShriek">TheShriek</a>. All except TheShriek have been blocked for 3RR, and again they were <i>not</i> reported for a first, accidental slip into a fourth revert. When I requested the check they were all fairly new. The contributions of the first four would probably show that at least 95% of their contributions are agreeing with Giovanni on the talk pages of various articles, voting where he votes, and reverting (or doing partial reverts) to his version. The fact that the checkuser showed Giovanni to be the same as BelindaGong certainly justified requesting it, since Belinda and Giovanni constantly took double votes, took at least six reverts, made claims about the number of editors who agreed with their version, and set up an elaborate pretence of not knowing each other. TheShriek was also shown to be the same as SOPHIA. However, when that result came through, I saw that there was no evidence of gaming the system, taking double votes, or multiple reverts. I sent SOPHIA a polite message <a href="../../../s/o/p/User_talk%7ESOPHIA_c099.html#Sockpuppetry" title="User talk:SOPHIA">here</a>, telling her about the result, and asking if she would like to clarify anything, as there was now a statement (not an image) on TheShriek's page that he was a sockpuppet for SOPHIA. She posted a rather angry reply <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html#Sockpuppets" title="User talk:Musical Linguist">here</a>, saying the TheShriek was her husband. We all accepted that, and were sympathetic, but she could not be pacified. I posted two more friendly messages on her talk page, and some one the Christianity talk page (e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Christianity&amp;diff=39670334&amp;oldid=39669125" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Christianity&amp;diff=39670334&amp;oldid=39669125" rel="nofollow">this one</a>), explaining that we respected her, and that nobody thought she had done anything wrong, and that I had personally removed the sockpuppet notice from her husband's page. When she complained that the would be permanently in the edit history, I told her that I had used my admin powers to remove it from the history, and asked her to let me know if there was anything else I could do. KHM03 was also sympathetic to her, and Str1977 posted a very friendly message to her. So much for the accusations made by Giovanni and his supporters that she left because she was persecuted and hounded for her POV by the Christian editors.</p>
<p>With regard to <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreethinker99_5e1e.html" title="User:Freethinker99">Freethinker99</a> (<a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreethinker99_5091.html" title="User talk:Freethinker99">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Freethinker99_e0a4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Freethinker99">contribs</a>), he arrived at the Christianity talk page while Giovanni was blocked, and told us that he was a new user and that he agreed with Giovanni. His writing style and arguments were simlilar to those of Giovanni. His second edit was a revert to a Giovanni version. He reverted three times in a little over two hours (like Giovanni/Belinda).</p>
<ul>
<li>At 20:24 on 14 February, KHM03 posted a message to Giovanni33's talk page, asking him to clarify if he had any connection with Trollwatcher, John1838, or Kecik. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giovanni33&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=39645660" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giovanni33&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=39645660" rel="nofollow">[49]</a></li>
<li>At 23:08 on 14 February, KHM03 added "And <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreethinker99_5e1e.html" title="User:Freethinker99">User:Freethinker99</a>".<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giovanni33&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=39645660" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giovanni33&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=39645660" rel="nofollow">[50]</a></li>
<li>At 23:59 on 14 February, Giovanni answered "I'll . . . state for the record that these users are not in any way associated with me, present or past." <i><b>But he signed his post while logged on as Freethinker99.</b></i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giovanni33&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=39651547" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giovanni33&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=39651547" rel="nofollow">[51]</a></li>
<li>At midnight on 15 February, Giovanni logged on as Giovanni33, and replaced Freethinker's signature with his own.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giovanni33&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=39658454" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giovanni33&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=39658454" rel="nofollow">[52]</a></li>
<li>At 00:04 on 15 February, Freethinker99 posted a comment with little relevance to anything being questioned on Giovanni's talk page. It would give an ostensible reason for Freethinker still to be in the edit history after the telltale signature had been replaced.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giovanni33&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=39658698" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giovanni33&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=39658698" rel="nofollow">[53]</a> I'm sure many Wikipedians who have been away from a talk page for several hours just check the difference between the last version they were familiar with and the current one, rather than going through each diff.</li>
<li>At 00:11 on 15 February, Freethinker posted that <i>he</i> had written that message for Giovanni and had signed it by mistake.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giovanni33&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=39659796" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giovanni33&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=39659796" rel="nofollow">[54]</a></li>
<li>At 00:19 on 15 February, Freethinker claimed that he had let Giovanni write a post to his own talk page on his (Freethinker's) computer.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Christianity&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=39661190" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Christianity&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=39661190" rel="nofollow">[55]</a>. (Eight minutes earlier, he had claimed that <i>he</i> had written that post for Giovanni.)</li>
<li>At 00:23 Giovanni posted to his talk page that he had not seen KHM03's question about Freethinker when he answered that he had no connection to any of those users, and that he did, in fact, know Freethinker.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giovanni33&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=39660090" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giovanni33&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=39660090" rel="nofollow">[56]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I did not attack Freethinker. I did not block him. (I don't block people I'm in dispute with.) Nor did I add the sockpuppet template to his userpage (though I support the admin who did). I did say that his story, if true, makes him a meatpuppet.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Christianity&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=39661190" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Christianity&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=39661190" rel="nofollow">[57]</a> I stand by that remark. If he really is a different person, he arrived at Wikipedia to revert to Giovanni's version, and to argue for it on the talk page.</p>
<p>Giovanni recently followed me to <a href="../../../j/d/a/User_talk%7EJdavidb_d285.html" title="User talk:Jdavidb">Jdavidb's talk page</a>, and saw a message I had posted there thanking Jdavidb for bringing me to Wikipedia, as I believed it was he who had posted someething on some blog asking people to join Wikipedia <i><b>if they were prepared to respect NPOV.</b></i> On discovering that post, Giovanni posted to several talk pages and project pages that I, despite saying that it wasn't allowed to invite friends to join Wikipedia, had joined in exactly the same way. For the record, I have never met Jdavidb, and have never, as far as I know, reverted to his version of any article. We very seldom edit the same articles. That is now being compared to Giovanni's friend and wife (if they're not Giovanni himself) reverting constantly to his version, while pretending to have no connection to him.</p>
<p>I apologize for boring everyone with such a long account, but I really would appreciate some input, as BelindaGong and Freethinker have now both been unblocked, and the Christianity and Adolf Hitler articles will presumably soon be unlocked. I really have no idea whether Giovanni, Belinda, and Freethinker are one person, or two, or three; but their connection to each other (which they tried not just to keep secret but actually to mislead people about) has been shown. What is their position now? <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a> says that "Proven sock puppets may be permanently blocked if used to cast double votes." Well, Giovanni and Belinda have taken double votes, (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Transubstantiation&amp;diff=36646484&amp;oldid=36646429" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Transubstantiation&amp;diff=36646484&amp;oldid=36646429" rel="nofollow">[58]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Transubstantiation&amp;diff=36661635&amp;oldid=36656525" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Transubstantiation&amp;diff=36661635&amp;oldid=36656525" rel="nofollow">[59]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Historicity_of_Jesus&amp;diff=38361907&amp;oldid=38336312" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Historicity_of_Jesus&amp;diff=38361907&amp;oldid=38336312" rel="nofollow">[60]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Historicity_of_Jesus&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=38361907" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Historicity_of_Jesus&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=38361907" rel="nofollow">[61]</a>) but Giovanni is now insisting that Belinda is his wife, and is therefore not a sockpuppet.</p>
<p>Can someone clarify what the situation is now? I seem to recall that it came up in the case of Hollow Wilerding, but am not sure where to look for information regarding that case. Was there reference to some policy or some ArbCom ruling that a family under one roof is officially one single user for voting purposes, or am I imagining that? I'd like some reassurance that Giovanni and Belinda are not entitled to 6 reverts between them every day. And to anticipate his likely statement that I have reverted to Str1977's version, I'd like to say that I have never met Str1977, and we both have a long history editing articles in which the other user has no interest. We do have some overlap of interest and of POV in Christianity-related articles. Before Giovanni and his sockpuppet(s?) arrived, I would say my average was lower than one revert per day.</p>
<p>We now also have new users John1838 (<a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn1838_97a7.html" title="User talk:John1838">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_John1838_c9e0.html" title="Special:Contributions/John1838">contribs</a>) and Trollwatcher (<a href="../../../t/r/o/User_talk%7ETrollwatcher_3950.html" title="User talk:Trollwatcher">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Trollwatcher_5b77.html" title="Special:Contributions/Trollwatcher">contribs</a>). I certainly don't want to imply that every new user who supports Giovanni is a sockpuppet or a meatpuppet. (I was once a new user with a POV!) But these two users seem to be just criticizing editors, rather than making helpful contributions. In particular I'd like someone to take a look at John1838's user page.</p>

<dd>To be fair, 'waya sahoni' is probably something meaningful in the Cherokee language and (assuming it's not offensive in Cherokee) probably shouldn't be blocked for that particular reason. I recommend finding some sort of excuse to get waya sahoni blocked or banned from Wikipedia though, because Jeff just won't stop being a disruptive influence and making a mess all over the place until he has complete control over his article.

I have been quietly editing Cherokee articles. I added Jeff's article to the Indigeneous People project because it appeared on the Cherokee People category page. I have ONLY been placing the {{NorthAmNative]] tag and flagging the article for POV cleanup on the Talk page and a revert war ensued. THESE editors resort to Sock puppet and fantasy banned user allegations when they loose their arguments. They started this by creating multiple sockpuppets and vandalizing my user page. I opened an RFC on moving the LKML content to <a href="../../../l/k/m/LKML_9d03.html" title="LKML">LKML</a> where it belongs and this is the result. Aim Here is a meat puppet for SCOX and a role account. I listed ALL the SCOX meat puppets on the RFC page. These accounts are duckblinds for POV pushing, stalking, and harassent of Wikiepdia editors. They operate these other accounts for DOS attacks on people they really don't like, I guess we should feel lucky. Waya sahoni 07:52, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Using <a href="http://yah.warmcat.com" class="external text" title="http://yah.warmcat.com" rel="nofollow">Warmcat's Yahoeuvre</a> I cannot find any proof for your allegations. Just 'wikipedia' gives lots of hits, and all I see is discussion and speculation about edits occuring here on WP. Granted, many of the posters there do not hold very flattering views of Jeff Merkey, but such opinions outside of WP have no bearing on what happens here, right? I then tried combining 'wikipedia' with various keywords, such as 'msn', 'proxy' or 'anonymizer' and can not find any relevant hits. There <i>are</i> posts discussing how to access Jeff Merkey's website 'merkeylaw.com' through proxies (such as <a href="http://finance.messages.yahoo.com/bbs?.mm=FN&amp;action=m&amp;board=1600684464&amp;tid=cald&amp;sid=1600684464&amp;mid=331928&amp;thr=331928&amp;cur=331928&amp;dir=d" class="external autonumber" title="http://finance.messages.yahoo.com/bbs?.mm=FN&amp;action=m&amp;board=1600684464&amp;tid=cald&amp;sid=1600684464&amp;mid=331928&amp;thr=331928&amp;cur=331928&amp;dir=d" rel="nofollow">[62]</a>), mostly because Mr. Merkey was in the habit of publicizing IP addresses that accessed that site. --<a href="../../../m/j/p/User%7EMjpieters_3aa7.html" title="User:Mjpieters">MJ</a><sup>(<a href="../../../m/j/p/User_talk%7EMjpieters_1e43.html" title="User talk:Mjpieters"><span style="color:green">☎</span></a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Mjpieters_7fcc.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Mjpieters"><span style="color:red">@</span></a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mjpieters_de3f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mjpieters"><span style="color:blue">C</span></a>)</sup> 14:28, 2 March 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>Well, we don't allow the use of anonymous proxies on Wikipedia. Mostly are already indefinitely blocked.

<p>As some of you may already know, there's been an ongoing war of POV edits on a number of articles relating to political figures in <a href="../../../v/a/u/Vaughan%2C_Ontario_c875.html" title="Vaughan, Ontario">Vaughan, Ontario</a>, with a number of users asserting that <a href="../../../p/m/_/User%7EPm_shef_cbd9.html" title="User:Pm shef">User:pm_shef</a> is inherently biased because of his own family connections. While admittedly there <i>may</i> be some truth to that, these people have not directly addressed any specific examples of what they believe to be biased editing on pm_shef's part; instead, they engage almost entirely in ad hominem attacks and reversion wars. In truth, pm_shef really hasn't broken any conduct rules, while several of his accusers (a handful of newly registered usernames who've never edited anything not directly related to this dispute) have already had to be blocked for 24 hours for page blanking, 3RR, etc. Because I've already been involved to an extent in the discussion, however, I'm asking if somebody neutral can assist in reviewing and resolving the situation. Thanks. The main articles in question so far are <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Shefman_7f72.html" title="Alan Shefman">Alan Shefman</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/s/Susan_Kadis_f939.html" title="Susan Kadis">Susan Kadis</a>. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 05:38, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have been proved right - despite being mocked by some administrators. The article about Robert sTeadman is essentially a vanity article created by the subject in a shameless attempt at self promotion. The subject used sockpuppets to block any attempt to edit the article and to smear anybody who attempted to do so. The subject attempted to get the article protected - and cheekily wished to have access whilst everybody else was blocked. When the article was referred for deletion, the subject privately contacted administrators to discredit those voting against it and to canvass support. The subject then went on to vote for himself. This is a shameful business. I did point all of this out to the administrators at the time and was dismissed as a troublemaking crank. Ironically, the subject of the article has proved himself to be a much more troublesome user.Crusading composer 00:02, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

</dd>
<dd>Only first name is correct, we use many IL proxies (legal access)and I was never a member and president of any club, lol. I was an international tournament director for 2 years 97-99, only, however, I never give my exact name exact, anywhere, including on your 'great finds' lol and there are many mistakes there, I want to let you know we contacted phroziac asking for assistance what to do, because many posts were being reverted automatically, even those where they eventually were prooven to be concise/exact and true and to the best of our knowledge. But Phroziac and others gave us trouble. There are three of us. I am a historian, not a vandal, but I am working on a program that will autmoticlly catch on your site and change many pages without any of us being present. By loosing us, you lost huge knowledge of sports and much more, all the things we said e.g. about 1998 1999 nba season, eventually, reverted, and on many other topics. I will not go into the details here. And no,</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I do not live in Chicago, but use Chicago proxy, I am from Indiana, I contacted certain lady at wikipedia, then she passed on info to that whore phroziac, did you honestly think i would give my real name and even if u do find, that makes no difference, we will keep on bothering you all, just so you know. But it's inappropriate to post any names, even if they are half correct, because they were written to one party, THE WIKI ADMINISTRATION, Ms. Carter, she forwarded our concern to that whore phroziac, carter said it's best for us not to post here, since many sites will automatically be reverted, you have codes you inserted which automatically notify aholes like curps, i am a computer programmer and I know all the codes in the world, you could have had a top commander and anti vandal guard in your sects, if you just allowed us to talk normally, now you have chosen war, a war, which we intend to continue one way or the other. I demand that you enforce the rules and not user people's names, because I do not want members of any club to be on vandal list, if they are, even better, we can not wait to sue you.</dd>

I gave the information I had to an editor trying to stop the vandalism, but all of the names I found may have been aliases. If they were, it probably means that he uses aliases offline in day-to-day life. The name above was taken from an email. I also found names that he used for his websites, chess tournaments, newsgroups and a newspaper article. I have not had any contact with him and I have not been involved with the case in any other way, so that's all I can say. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 03:01, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Userspace exists as a scratchspace, a personal office if you will, to help with building the encyclopaedia. It's not a free patch of land that anyone who registers a free account can regard as their entitlement, and it's not somewhere where one can put inappropriate content and hide behind a kind of "<a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliamentary_privilege.html" title="Parliamentary privilege">userspace privilege</a>" to protect it.

I humbly suggest that both be given clear warnings to cease and desist from any sort of editing in the article for now and that neither be blocked unless it becomes necessary as a preventative step to enforce the existing ruling (which I strongly disagree with but respect in terms of process).</li>

<p>Wilkes has repeatedly violated the arbcom ruling. I banned him for 24 hours some days ago because of a number of violations, but treated them collectively as one breach. He has now committed two more unambiguous breaches. I have imposed a 1 week ban for the two breaches and am treating them as two clear and deliberate breaches. He is now up to three. If (and given his behaviour it seems a case of when) he hits five as per the arb ruling he will be banned for one year. He seems to treat arbcom rulings as a joke. They aren't. If he doesn't get the message then he will soon have a year to cop himself on. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:#006666; background-color:orange"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 20:09, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

No mistake. She deleted lines of another article dealing claims about someone's homosexuality. That breached the arbcom ruling which says that she and Wilkes are <i><b>banned from making any edit related to a person's alleged homosexuality or bisexuality. The clauses "any edit" and "related to homosexuality or bisexuality" shall be interpreted broadly.</b></i> This is not the first time she has broken the ruling. The first time I judged given past behaviour to be unintentional. In this case however she unambiguously disobeyed the arbcom ruling at least 3 times. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=August_Kubizek&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=41682688" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=August_Kubizek&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=41682688" rel="nofollow">breach 1</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=August_Kubizek&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=41686703" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=August_Kubizek&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=41686703" rel="nofollow">breach 2</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=August_Kubizek&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=41784729" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=August_Kubizek&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=41784729" rel="nofollow">breach 3</a> As a result there was no choice but to block her. I have to say that while Wilkes seems a complete nutcase (who is strongly suspected of being a notorious multiple hardbanned user from some years back) Wyss normally acts more responsibly. But in this case the enfringments were clearcut and necessitated a block. Indeed she is very lucky that she only got a 24 hour block having made three clear breaches. She could have been blocked for longer. Some users would have imposed longer for three clear unambiguous breaches like those. To breach the ruling once is wrong. To do it three times in the one article smacks of giving the two fingers to the ruling.</p>
<p>Here is just one of the bits of text she deleted. <i>According to a theory by Professor Machtan, which he explained in his book</i> <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hidden_Hitler_a4f2.html" title="The Hidden Hitler">The Hidden Hitler</a><i>, August Kubizek had a <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexual.html" title="Homosexual">homosexual</a> relationship with <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>. Both Brigitte Hamann and Professor Machtan wrote that after meeting Hitler during the latter part of 1905, the two quickly became close friends and lived together, sharing a small room they rented on the Stumpergasse in Vienna. In</i> Young Hitler, the Story of Our Friendship<i>, Kubizek wrote that during their time together Hitler "always rejected the coquettish advances of girls or women. Women and girls took an interest in him in <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linz.html" title="Linz">Linz</a> as well as <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vienna.html" title="Vienna">Vienna</a>, but he always evaded their endeavors." Kubizek also wrote that Hitler had a great love for a girl named "Stefanie" and wrote her countless love poems but never sent them. Instead, Kubizek says Hitler read his poem "Hymn to the Beloved" to him. Professor Machtan stated that while the Stefanie girl definitely existed, some of Kubizek's 1953 writing was a deliberate "heterosexualizing" of Hitler in retrospect (p. 43).</i></p>
<p>She replaced the above text with <i><a href="../../../w/i/l/William_L._Shirer_d2d0.html" title="William L. Shirer">William L. Shirer</a>, in his book</i> <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Rise_and_Fall_of_the_Third_Reich_619a.html" title="The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich">The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich</a> <i>cites a letter dated August 4, 1933, six months after Hitler became Chancellor of Germany, in which he wrote his boyhood friend, "I should be very glad . . . to revive once more with you those memories of the best years of my life."</i></p>
<p>Deleting that was a clear and unambiguous breach of the prohibition "from making any edit related to a person's alleged homosexuality or bisexuality". <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:#006666; background-color:orange"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 05:18, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm hoping another admin can give me some fresh insight. I've reverted the page twice and redirected to the show the characters were on, <i><a href="../../../a/n/o/Another_World_%28TV_series%29_9fdc.html" title="Another World (TV series)">Another World</a></i>, on the grounds that all the information in the article is already at the AW page, and that having a daughter article solves nothing as it's not telling anything new or in-depth, just stating the exact same things that can be found at the article on the series. The user, MrKing84, is not great at discussion from what I've gathered. I think it should be one way, and he thinks it should be his. Rather pigheaded, both of us, so hopefully someone else can mediate on the Mac and Rachel talk page.

<p>I've removed the {{libel}} template. It is a serious problem if we find libellous material and don't deal with it. The correct thing to do, is to remove the text until it can be verified, sourced, put into neutral language and replaced (or forgotten never to be seen again if that's more appropriate). Just tagging it is a Bad Thing.

<dd>The templates actually seem to be verbatim copies of the Wikinews main page templates, with some minor changes and after having lost their various CSS styles on account of having been moved. They aren't linked to anything. My only guess is that he wants to perform some kind of bizarre mix-up in vandalising articles to look like the Wikinews main page, although that seems tenuous and I can't possibly see why he'd be creating them as templates. Note he's used identical nomenclature to the Wikinews main page templates. I can only fathom that he may well actually just not understand that the main page isn't editable, or thinks he can somehow get around it. I'll leave a talk page message and if he doesn't respond within 24hrs satisfactorily I'll delete them. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicholasTurnbull_9d8a.html" title="User:NicholasTurnbull">Nicholas<b>Turnbull</b></a> | <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENicholasTurnbull_45f8.html" title="User talk:NicholasTurnbull">(talk)</a> 03:15, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just wanted to check if there are any special rules or guidelines for editing protected MediaWiki pages, aside from obvious things like using common sense and discretion. For concreteness, I'm interested in adding a link back to the <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">WP:PROD</a> list from the page that comes up after you delete something (for the same reason there's already a link to <a href="../../../c/a/n/Category%7ECandidates_for_speedy_deletion_4c9c.html" title="Category:Candidates for speedy deletion">Category:Candidates for speedy deletion</a>).

<li>I can't imagine many people watch the Mediawiki pages—there are a lot where changes would be quite noticable—which is why I figured I had better post somewhere else.

<p>If you check out <a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/queries/en_proposed_deletion" class="external free" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/queries/en_proposed_deletion" rel="nofollow">http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/queries/en_proposed_deletion</a> , the list of proposed deletions, you'll notice that almost every entry was added to the list at 14:59 25th February. This is not the case, the bulk of those were prodded before that date. So you have articles like Ogie which should now be in the red csd zone looking like theres 5 days left to run.</p>
<p>I notified Interiot of this pretty much as it happened. I come back now later, and see that it hasn't been fixed. A possible cause for his script breaking, is that <a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">Template:Prod</a> was blanked. It was only reverted half an hour later, at 14:59, which is also when all the proposals have been logged to have taken place. So this post is twofold really:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the breakage is due to the blanking of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">Template:Prod</a>, then maybe it's best to protect it.</li>
<li>Maybe you should go through the list and look for articles which should now be deleted, like Corinis</li>

A new user <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorstnightmare_8db9.html" title="User:Worstnightmare">User:Worstnightmare</a> vandalizes my page and the pages of other a half dozen contributers to those pages, and reverters of Frys104's, Ryanlong's, and Pj1810's vandalism [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Worstnightmare" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Worstnightmare" rel="nofollow">[93]</a>] He is quickly blocked.</p>

<p>It seems clear to me that at least three of the vandals (Fry, Ryan, and Pjh) are the same person: the edit histories and vandisms of all three are nearly identical, occurring on the same pages to the same users. Take a look at Frys104's contributions: [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Frys104" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Frys104" rel="nofollow">[97]</a>], compare to <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanlong_5839.html" title="User:Ryanlong">User:Ryanlong</a>'s: [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Ryanlong" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Ryanlong" rel="nofollow">[98]</a>] and <a href="../../../p/j/h/User%7EPjh1810_fad4.html" title="User:Pjh1810">user:Pjh1810</a>'s: [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Pjh1810" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Pjh1810" rel="nofollow">[99]</a>]. They are the same.</p>
<p>Many of the guy's contributions seem sound, but he vandalizes any user he doesn't like, and it's become a bad situation.</p>
<p>I am less certain about <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorstnightmare_8db9.html" title="User:Worstnightmare">User:Worstnightmare</a>'s identity, because he was blocked so early that he didn't have a chance to make other contributions before he was blocked.</p>
<p>Please block this user/users for an extended period. I'm tired of dealing with his vandalism, and I suspect about 20 other people are as well. User active today.--<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirsfron_bff1.html" title="User:Firsfron">Firsfron</a> 19:02, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've come across a whole slew of movie articles recently created by User: Katja9 10. They've all got very brief descriptions ("19xx film directed by ___"), a brief cast list, and a plot synopsis which in every case I've looked at was cut-and-pasted directly from imdb.com or some other site. You can look at <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Katja9_10_cd18.html" title="Special:Contributions/Katja9 10">the user's contributions list</a> and probably spot lots more.</p>
<p>I tagged several of these with {copyvio} and listed them at <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_problems_2006_February_26_09fa.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright problems/2006 February 26">Wikipedia:Copyright problems/2006 February 26</a>, but I'm thinking that's too tedious and the wrong approach. I'm afraid the expedient thing to do will be simply to delete every article this user has created since at least February 9. Checking all the text is timeconsuming, and the trend is clear, and the articles aren't worth keeping once the copied synopses are removed. (They aren't encyclopedic; they don't contain anything the imdb doesn't. I assume we don't want to try to duplicate imdb, that if we're going to have an article on a movie, it ought to have some pretense of being notable and encyclopeic.)</p>
<p>I left a message on <a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKatja9_10_8f7c.html" title="User talk:Katja9 10">the user's talk page</a> a little while ago. They may have seen it, because the synopses they've posted since then (yes, they're still at it) are lightly paraphrased from the imdb ones, although I notice they're now cutting and pasting the "goofs" list, too. <a href="../../../u/m/m/User%7EUmmit_38d5.html" title="User:Ummit">Steve Summit</a> (<a href="../../../u/m/m/User_talk%7EUmmit_97c6.html" title="User talk:Ummit">talk</a>) 18:58, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I disagree, you can't go through and delete all of this users contribs because she has copyvios, the right thing to do is go through each and every article and tag it.

<dd>We can assume good faith–I'm sure that the new editor does <i>mean</i> well–while still cleaning out the copyvios.

<dd>What's the point of process for the sake of process when we already know what the outcome will be? Save the bandwidth, server space, time, effort, and potential legal exposure. As far as I know, there hasn't been any objection to deleting these cut-and-paste copies; unless there's a serious objection here, then I think it's not unreasonable to assume that there is a consensus to delete them. We're better off saving the 'process' for cases where there <i>is</i> some dispute. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 02:54, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I have no objection to a mass deletion. If the cases are identical, it makes sense.

<dd>TenOfAllTrades == mega-correct. Process is important only in disputes; anywhere else (where <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a> applies) can have process safely ignored. Anyway, this sounds familiar; I distinctly recall we used to have someone who added almost totally useless articles on TV shows, actors, and movies. I don't think they were copyvios, though. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 03:28, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I tagged 10 or 15 of the worst of them as {copyvio} before I got tired of it.

<p>I would very much appreciate more input from admins on this matter, as otherwise this can just turn into a back-and-forth litany of accusations between Giovanni and me. The <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> article has now been protected. I would like to answer some of the accusations made against me, and then to request advice as to what should happen now.</p>
<p>I seem to be accused of having driven <a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESOPHIA_915a.html" title="User:SOPHIA">SOPHIA</a> away. I disagreed with SOPHIA about some of her edits (while agreeing with others). I respected her and have never at any stage suspected her of anything dishonourable. At one stage, she said on the Christianity talk page that it had been "scary" to have me and two others "at" her at the same time.

<p>I need some assistance from my fellow admins. I placed a prod tag on the article Siflige, as I considered it a non-notable gaming community. The prod tag was contested by User:Erik Navkire, so I attempted to change the prod to an AfD nomination. When I did this however, I discovered that the article had previously been deleted through AfD, so the AfD tag automatically linked to the old <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Siflige_9d00.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Siflige">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Siflige</a> discussion. How can I renominate this article, without it linking to the old AfD discussion?

<dd>I don't know if a particular nation's laws are preferred here, but in the United States, artistic derivative works, in particular, artistic pieces making use of other works -- whether the original work was copyrighted or not -- do not generally require approval from the original copyright holder -- it's typically considered fair use. See Andy Warhol's Campbell Soup Cans as a reference.

<dd>Yes, I also have the same bad habit of not using edit summaries on my own userspace; I've been trying to avoid it. Sorry for not noticing the paired edit to your user page; if you were a vandal or a new user, checking the contributions would quickly spot the other part of the move; however, I remembered seeing your name before, and went the "old user, probably did a small mistake, no need to even look beyond the diff" route. --<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesarB_5f7f.html" title="User:CesarB">cesarb</a> 13:31, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Sigh</i>. I have just been autoblocked <b>again</b> for happening to share an AOL dynamic IP (in this case 152.163.100.204) with a suspected vandal. Although this is usually already extremely frustrating, in this case insult was added to injury, because the autoblock was under the signature of Lucky 6.9, an administrator who, according to their own <a href="../../../l/u/c/User_talk%7ELucky_6.9_c058.html" title="User talk:Lucky 6.9">talk page</a>, no longer wishes to be affiliated with Wikipedia! I try not to lose my temper that easily but I should very much like to know how the clucking bell being autoblocked by an absentee admin who has apparently just packed up and gone is <b>any</b> different from vandalism perpetrated by an anonymous hit-and-run vandal?! As I have noted before, I think the collateral damage issue has gotten to the point where the autoblocking is <i>more</i> disruptive than the vandalism it is supposed to combat <a href="../../../v/r/e/User%7EVremya_d4a9.html" title="User:Vremya">Vremya</a> 16:16, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

Hey, here's an idea, maybe even though AOL 100% ignores its own paying customers, maybe they'll be more responsive to an administrator from an online encylopedia! That will certianly inspire them to radically overhaul a server system that hasn't been updated since the 1990s!

<li><b>Interesting</b> that out of all the times people complain about AOL, no one ever mentions that having or not having a unique sharedip is a choice made by a given user, AOL not withstanding, the only time AOL actually applies it's bizaire sharedip system is if you're one of those idiots who thinks that AOL is a perfectly good web browser, the second you exit the AOL shell you <b>are</b> assigned a reasonably unique IP in the <b>172.128.0.0 - 172.191.255.255</b> range, yet I don't think I've ever seen a single AOL user on wikipedia actually fess up to this, the only inention I can gather from that is that all the AOL sharedips are either idiots, or harboring some sort of malice against wikipedia, and since 10 minutes on an AOL message board will clarify that it is in fact the former, not the later, there's little than can be done about it--172.149.179.164 00:40, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>(<i>Deep breath</i>) Okay, I probably should <a href="../../../s/t/a/Wikipedia%7EStay_cool_4d94.html" title="Wikipedia:Stay cool">not have lost my temper</a>. The only excuse I have to offer is that in the last week I have been autoblocked <i>every single time</i> I was trying to contribute, any edits I succeeded in making only being lucky enough to make it in before I got the door slammed in my face (yes, it's <i>that</i> bad). Having said that, I apologize if I hurt anyone's feelings. Insert your favorite picture of Vremya munching humble pie here. However, I would still like an answer to my question, so let me try to frame it less abrasively: The statement of User:172.149.179.164 that "no one ever mentions that having or not having a unique shared IP is a choice made by a given user, AOL notwithstanding" may be technically true in the same sense that having or not having a French-Latvian dictionary is a "choice" made by a given user, but just try to buy one at your corner bookstore. Note the operative phrase "no one ever mentions." I <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume</a> that 172.149.179.164 has not realized that one likely consequence of the fact that no one ever mentions this is that for the vast majority of AOL users for whom, like myself, computers are not their field of technical expertise but tools to do something else with (like, say, contributing to an encyclopedia), the fact that unique IPs are available to AOL users under certain technical circumstances amounts to a <i>well-kept secret</i>. So: <b>What is the secret?</b> How exactly does one obtain a unique nonshared IP from AOL? As far as I could gather, it involves shutting down the AOL browser. Unfortunately, I have no idea how to do that without effectively losing my connection (and I have tried); as far as I with my lack of technical training can tell, AOL's dial-up program <b>is</b> the browser. Could someone please give a more extensive, less technical, and (pretty please) less sneering explanation? I promise I won't snarl again if it means chewing my own arm off (which I've nearly done in frustration at the constant blocking anyway&#160;:-( <a href="../../../v/r/e/User%7EVremya_d4a9.html" title="User:Vremya">Vremya</a> 04:17, 28 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's exactly what I mean, the second part anyway, more or less, the trick is that of course, you can't actually close the AOL shell because it's what's providing your interent access, but you certianly can open a new window, the part about a continuous internet connection however, is, creative.. but nothing more than a rumor, and I'm sorry if I offened, to be fair my harsher comments were directed at the <b>un</b>registered users who are always going "<i>oh I'm not a vandal, that other guy who looks like me is</i>", sorry if I offended</dd>
<dd>The only drawback, is that editing like this, AOL behaves like a true rotating IP address, so you have to contantly explain to people "<i>yes I know how to use wikipedia and only have 2 contributions but I'm not a sockpuppet</i>" which gets tiresome--172.145.206.190 04:51, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Given that the discussion seems to have focused on AOL (naturally enough, as AOL users are among the most common victims of collateral damage), it may be worth recalling that dynamic IPs vulnerable to collateral damage are <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_proposal_01f4.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy proposal">not confined to AOL users</a>.

<p>I notice that many users are blocked with cryptic summaries like "User...". Since the summary is shown to the user as the reason for their block, these are totally useless. Please use "Inappropriate username" or another wording that provides a valid reason for the block to the user. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User_talk%7EZocky_f226.html" title="User talk:Zocky">Zocky</a> | <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_Picture_Popups_bee7.html" title="User:Zocky/Picture Popups">picture popups</a> 05:11, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Many of the usernames that get blocked are just throwaway sockpuppets or vandals playing denial of service games or username creation performance art and watching the block log and never even triggering a block (for instance the "block me" accounts... but if we ignore them and don't block, they sometimes go ahead and vandalize anyway, for instance <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=50_Cent&amp;diff=37583227&amp;oldid=37579179" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=50_Cent&amp;diff=37583227&amp;oldid=37579179" rel="nofollow">[110]</a>). In other words, much of the time when "user..." is used, the user who actually created the username will never even read or see the block message.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Because of autoblocking, meaningful block summaries very often do more harm than good. In cases of vandalism, I do put "vandalism" in the block summary, but every single day I get e-mail from one or more collaterally damaged AOL users asking "why are you accusing me of vandalism?"</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The way that the Mediawiki software handles autoblocking is entirely inadequate and often harmful. At the very least, "established users" (non-throwaway accounts) should be immune from all forms of IP-based blocking, and since autoblocks almost never make sense for AOL addresses, the software should internally detect AOL IP ranges and silently not autoblock them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps it's time to get rid of autoblocking altogether. Half the time it doesn't work because the vandal can shift IP addresses, and most of the rest of the time it causes more harm than good because it blocks everyone stuck behind an ISP or school or corporation proxy IP. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 06:43, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I noticed an odd link that went into the <a href="../../../k/w/a/Kwanzaa.html" title="Kwanzaa">Kwanzaa</a> article, and followed it up. What I found was an attack page for a made-up holiday, Caucazia, and an edit history that indicated that the user had been moving it around for nearly a month, see <a href="../../../u/n/d/Special%7EUndelete_Caucazia_ad50.html" title="Special:Undelete/Caucazia">Special:Undelete/Caucazia</a>. The user also linked a number of pages (his user page, his talk page, the talk pages for several other articles) to that page.</p>
<p>As near as I can tell, this account has been used for nothing but vandalism and disruption. I deleted the attack page, blocked the account for 24 hours while deciding what to do, and cleaned up after the hideous, tangled mess of redirects this user left in her or his wake. I'd like to solicit opinions on what the appropriate block length for this user is. As always, if any admin feels I have overstepped my bounds, feel free to review or reverse my changes.</p>

<p>Are we likely to get caught or face a lawsuit? Nope. Was the uploader's heart in the right place? Probably.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Archive32_7672.html" title="Edit section: SOPHIA">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">SOPHIA</span></h2>
<p>SOPHIA was extremely hurt and angry when the checkuser result came through, showing her connection to <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheShriek_2b43.html" title="User:TheShriek">TheShriek</a>. It was I who requested a check, and I did so in consultation with other editors. I did not include SOPHIA in it. When Giovanni arrived, he engaged in massive edit warring. I don't mean an accidental slip into a fourth revert (as I did myself on one occasion) — I mean six and five and eleven, ignoring warnings and pleas from other editors. It was unfair because none of the "older" editors had a history of running to <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_3RR_4b52.html" title="WP:AN/3RR">WP:AN/3RR</a> to report an opponent, <i>especially</i> not if he was new, and we were all trying to stay within the rules ourselves. At least four new redlinked users appeared and said on the talk page that they agreed with Giovanni. Most of them began reverting to his version, and also following him to other pages, voting where he voted, claiming that there was consensus, etc. These users were <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBelindaGong_bd31.html" title="User:BelindaGong">BelindaGong</a>, <a href="../../../k/e/c/User%7EKecik_2b59.html" title="User:Kecik">Kecik</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikaM_b05b.html" title="User:MikaM">MikaM</a>, and <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheShriek_2b43.html" title="User:TheShriek">TheShriek</a>. All except TheShriek have been blocked for 3RR, and again they were <i>not</i> reported for a first, accidental slip into a fourth revert. When I requested the check they were all fairly new. The contributions of the first four would probably show that at least 95% of their contributions are agreeing with Giovanni on the talk pages of various articles, voting where he votes, and reverting (or doing partial reverts) to his version. The fact that the checkuser showed Giovanni to be the same as BelindaGong certainly justified requesting it, since Belinda and Giovanni constantly took double votes, took at least six reverts, made claims about the number of editors who agreed with their version, and set up an elaborate pretence of not knowing each other. TheShriek was also shown to be the same as SOPHIA. However, when that result came through, I saw that there was no evidence of gaming the system, taking double votes, or multiple reverts. I sent SOPHIA a polite message <a href="../../../s/o/p/User_talk%7ESOPHIA_c099.html#Sockpuppetry" title="User talk:SOPHIA">here</a>, telling her about the result, and asking if she would like to clarify anything, as there was now a statement (not an image) on TheShriek's page that he was a sockpuppet for SOPHIA. She posted a rather angry reply <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html#Sockpuppets" title="User talk:Musical Linguist">here</a>, saying the TheShriek was her husband. We all accepted that, and were sympathetic, but she could not be pacified. I posted two more friendly messages on her talk page, and some one the Christianity talk page (e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Christianity&amp;diff=39670334&amp;oldid=39669125" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Christianity&amp;diff=39670334&amp;oldid=39669125" rel="nofollow">this one</a>), explaining that we respected her, and that nobody thought she had done anything wrong, and that I had personally removed the sockpuppet notice from her husband's page. When she complained that the would be permanently in the edit history, I told her that I had used my admin powers to remove it from the history, and asked her to let me know if there was anything else I could do. KHM03 was also sympathetic to her, and Str1977 posted a very friendly message to her. So much for the accusations made by Giovanni and his supporters that she left because she was persecuted and hounded for her POV by the Christian editors.</p>
<p>With regard to <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreethinker99_5e1e.html" title="User:Freethinker99">Freethinker99</a> (<a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreethinker99_5091.html" title="User talk:Freethinker99">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Freethinker99_e0a4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Freethinker99">contribs</a>), he arrived at the Christianity talk page while Giovanni was blocked, and told us that he was a new user and that he agreed with Giovanni. His writing style and arguments were simlilar to those of Giovanni. His second edit was a revert to a Giovanni version. He reverted three times in a little over two hours (like Giovanni/Belinda).</p>
<ul>
<li>At 20:24 on 14 February, KHM03 posted a message to Giovanni33's talk page, asking him to clarify if he had any connection with Trollwatcher, John1838, or Kecik. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giovanni33&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=39645660" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giovanni33&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=39645660" rel="nofollow">[112]</a></li>
<li>At 23:08 on 14 February, KHM03 added "And <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreethinker99_5e1e.html" title="User:Freethinker99">User:Freethinker99</a>".<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giovanni33&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=39645660" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giovanni33&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=39645660" rel="nofollow">[113]</a></li>
<li>At 23:59 on 14 February, Giovanni answered "I'll . . . state for the record that these users are not in any way associated with me, present or past." <i><b>But he signed his post while logged on as Freethinker99.</b></i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giovanni33&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=39651547" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giovanni33&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=39651547" rel="nofollow">[114]</a></li>
<li>At midnight on 15 February, Giovanni logged on as Giovanni33, and replaced Freethinker's signature with his own.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giovanni33&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=39658454" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giovanni33&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=39658454" rel="nofollow">[115]</a></li>
<li>At 00:04 on 15 February, Freethinker99 posted a comment with little relevance to anything being questioned on Giovanni's talk page. It would give an ostensible reason for Freethinker still to be in the edit history after the telltale signature had been replaced.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giovanni33&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=39658698" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giovanni33&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=39658698" rel="nofollow">[116]</a> I'm sure many Wikipedians who have been away from a talk page for several hours just check the difference between the last version they were familiar with and the current one, rather than going through each diff.</li>
<li>At 00:11 on 15 February, Freethinker posted that <i>he</i> had written that message for Giovanni and had signed it by mistake.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giovanni33&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=39659796" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giovanni33&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=39659796" rel="nofollow">[117]</a></li>
<li>At 00:19 on 15 February, Freethinker claimed that he had let Giovanni write a post to his own talk page on his (Freethinker's) computer.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Christianity&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=39661190" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Christianity&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=39661190" rel="nofollow">[118]</a>. (Eight minutes earlier, he had claimed that <i>he</i> had written that post for Giovanni.)</li>
<li>At 00:23 Giovanni posted to his talk page that he had not seen KHM03's question about Freethinker when he answered that he had no connection to any of those users, and that he did, in fact, know Freethinker.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giovanni33&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=39660090" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giovanni33&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=39660090" rel="nofollow">[119]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I did not attack Freethinker. I did not block him. (I don't block people I'm in dispute with.) Nor did I add the sockpuppet template to his userpage (though I support the admin who did). I did say that his story, if true, makes him a meatpuppet.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Christianity&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=39661190" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Christianity&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=39661190" rel="nofollow">[120]</a> I stand by that remark. If he really is a different person, he arrived at Wikipedia to revert to Giovanni's version, and to argue for it on the talk page.</p>
<p>Giovanni recently followed me to <a href="../../../j/d/a/User_talk%7EJdavidb_d285.html" title="User talk:Jdavidb">Jdavidb's talk page</a>, and saw a message I had posted there thanking Jdavidb for bringing me to Wikipedia, as I believed it was he who had posted someething on some blog asking people to join Wikipedia <i><b>if they were prepared to respect NPOV.</b></i> On discovering that post, Giovanni posted to several talk pages and project pages that I, despite saying that it wasn't allowed to invite friends to join Wikipedia, had joined in exactly the same way. For the record, I have never met Jdavidb, and have never, as far as I know, reverted to his version of any article. We very seldom edit the same articles. That is now being compared to Giovanni's friend and wife (if they're not Giovanni himself) reverting constantly to his version, while pretending to have no connection to him.</p>
<p>I apologize for boring everyone with such a long account, but I really would appreciate some input, as BelindaGong and Freethinker have now both been unblocked, and the Christianity and Adolf Hitler articles will presumably soon be unlocked. I really have no idea whether Giovanni, Belinda, and Freethinker are one person, or two, or three; but their connection to each other (which they tried not just to keep secret but actually to mislead people about) has been shown. What is their position now? <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a> says that "Proven sock puppets may be permanently blocked if used to cast double votes." Well, Giovanni and Belinda have taken double votes, (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Transubstantiation&amp;diff=36646484&amp;oldid=36646429" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Transubstantiation&amp;diff=36646484&amp;oldid=36646429" rel="nofollow">[121]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Transubstantiation&amp;diff=36661635&amp;oldid=36656525" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Transubstantiation&amp;diff=36661635&amp;oldid=36656525" rel="nofollow">[122]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Historicity_of_Jesus&amp;diff=38361907&amp;oldid=38336312" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Historicity_of_Jesus&amp;diff=38361907&amp;oldid=38336312" rel="nofollow">[123]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Historicity_of_Jesus&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=38361907" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Historicity_of_Jesus&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=38361907" rel="nofollow">[124]</a>) but Giovanni is now insisting that Belinda is his wife, and is therefore not a sockpuppet.</p>
<p>Can someone clarify what the situation is now? I seem to recall that it came up in the case of Hollow Wilerding, but am not sure where to look for information regarding that case. Was there reference to some policy or some ArbCom ruling that a family under one roof is officially one single user for voting purposes, or am I imagining that? I'd like some reassurance that Giovanni and Belinda are not entitled to 6 reverts between them every day. And to anticipate his likely statement that I have reverted to Str1977's version, I'd like to say that I have never met Str1977, and we both have a long history editing articles in which the other user has no interest. We do have some overlap of interest and of POV in Christianity-related articles. Before Giovanni and his sockpuppet(s?) arrived, I would say my average was lower than one revert per day.</p>
<p>We now also have new users John1838 (<a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn1838_97a7.html" title="User talk:John1838">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_John1838_c9e0.html" title="Special:Contributions/John1838">contribs</a>) and Trollwatcher (<a href="../../../t/r/o/User_talk%7ETrollwatcher_3950.html" title="User talk:Trollwatcher">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Trollwatcher_5b77.html" title="Special:Contributions/Trollwatcher">contribs</a>). I certainly don't want to imply that every new user who supports Giovanni is a sockpuppet or a meatpuppet. (I was once a new user with a POV!) But these two users seem to be just criticizing editors, rather than making helpful contributions. In particular I'd like someone to take a look at John1838's user page.</p>

<dd>As someone familiar with this soap opera, I feel I have to point out that <a href="../../../w/h/y/User%7EWhy_you_so_hawny__3ed2.html" title="User:Why you so hawny?">Why you so hawny?</a> was a phonetic variation on the second, and has been banned already for stalking/username violations. waya sahoni is almost certainly a sockpuppet of a blocked user, Gadugi, which happens to be the account of an irritating and disruptive net.kook called <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeffrey_Vernon_Merkey_d6f4.html" title="Jeffrey Vernon Merkey">Jeffrey Vernon Merkey</a>, and there's some sort of bizarre edit war going on over the article which bears his name.</dd>
<dd>To be fair, 'waya sahoni' is probably something meaningful in the Cherokee language and (assuming it's not offensive in Cherokee) probably shouldn't be blocked for that particular reason. I recommend finding some sort of excuse to get waya sahoni blocked or banned from Wikipedia though, because Jeff just won't stop being a disruptive influence and making a mess all over the place until he has complete control over his article.

<dd>This user <a href="../../../a/i/m/User%7EAim_Here_37ff.html" title="User:Aim Here">User:Aim Here</a> is an SCOX role account that comes through an anonymous proxy and is shared by multiple users via a VNC server. I have been quietly editing Cherokee articles. I added Jeff's article to the Indigeneous People project because it appeared on the Cherokee People category page. I have ONLY been placing the {{NorthAmNative]] tag and flagging the article for POV cleanup on the Talk page and a revert war ensued. THESE editors resort to Sock puppet and fantasy banned user allegations when they loose their arguments. They started this by creating multiple sockpuppets and vandalizing my user page. I opened an RFC on moving the LKML content to <a href="../../../l/k/m/LKML_9d03.html" title="LKML">LKML</a> where it belongs and this is the result. Aim Here is a meat puppet for SCOX and a role account. I listed ALL the SCOX meat puppets on the RFC page. These accounts are duckblinds for POV pushing, stalking, and harassent of Wikiepdia editors. They operate these other accounts for DOS attacks on people they really don't like, I guess we should feel lucky. Waya sahoni 07:52, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Just 'wikipedia' gives lots of hits, and all I see is discussion and speculation about edits occuring here on WP. Granted, many of the posters there do not hold very flattering views of Jeff Merkey, but such opinions outside of WP have no bearing on what happens here, right? I then tried combining 'wikipedia' with various keywords, such as 'msn', 'proxy' or 'anonymizer' and can not find any relevant hits. There <i>are</i> posts discussing how to access Jeff Merkey's website 'merkeylaw.com' through proxies (such as <a href="http://finance.messages.yahoo.com/bbs?.mm=FN&amp;action=m&amp;board=1600684464&amp;tid=cald&amp;sid=1600684464&amp;mid=331928&amp;thr=331928&amp;cur=331928&amp;dir=d" class="external autonumber" title="http://finance.messages.yahoo.com/bbs?.mm=FN&amp;action=m&amp;board=1600684464&amp;tid=cald&amp;sid=1600684464&amp;mid=331928&amp;thr=331928&amp;cur=331928&amp;dir=d" rel="nofollow">[125]</a>), mostly because Mr. Merkey was in the habit of publicizing IP addresses that accessed that site. --<a href="../../../m/j/p/User%7EMjpieters_3aa7.html" title="User:Mjpieters">MJ</a><sup>(<a href="../../../m/j/p/User_talk%7EMjpieters_1e43.html" title="User talk:Mjpieters"><span style="color:green">☎</span></a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Mjpieters_7fcc.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Mjpieters"><span style="color:red">@</span></a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mjpieters_de3f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mjpieters"><span style="color:blue">C</span></a>)</sup> 14:28, 2 March 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<p>As some of you may already know, there's been an ongoing war of POV edits on a number of articles relating to political figures in <a href="../../../v/a/u/Vaughan%2C_Ontario_c875.html" title="Vaughan, Ontario">Vaughan, Ontario</a>, with a number of users asserting that <a href="../../../p/m/_/User%7EPm_shef_cbd9.html" title="User:Pm shef">User:pm_shef</a> is inherently biased because of his own family connections. While admittedly there <i>may</i> be some truth to that, these people have not directly addressed any specific examples of what they believe to be biased editing on pm_shef's part; instead, they engage almost entirely in ad hominem attacks and reversion wars. In truth, pm_shef really hasn't broken any conduct rules, while several of his accusers (a handful of newly registered usernames who've never edited anything not directly related to this dispute) have already had to be blocked for 24 hours for page blanking, 3RR, etc. Because I've already been involved to an extent in the discussion, however, I'm asking if somebody neutral can assist in reviewing and resolving the situation. Thanks. The main articles in question so far are <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Shefman_7f72.html" title="Alan Shefman">Alan Shefman</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/s/Susan_Kadis_f939.html" title="Susan Kadis">Susan Kadis</a>. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 05:38, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

I replaced the links with one common link to all their Ajax tutorials as I believe that should be sufficient.

<p>I have been proved right - despite being mocked by some administrators. The article about Robert sTeadman is essentially a vanity article created by the subject in a shameless attempt at self promotion. The subject used sockpuppets to block any attempt to edit the article and to smear anybody who attempted to do so. The subject attempted to get the article protected - and cheekily wished to have access whilst everybody else was blocked. When the article was referred for deletion, the subject privately contacted administrators to discredit those voting against it and to canvass support. The subject then went on to vote for himself. This is a shameful business. I did point all of this out to the administrators at the time and was dismissed as a troublemaking crank. Ironically, the subject of the article has proved himself to be a much more troublesome user.Crusading composer 00:02, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Only first name is correct, we use many IL proxies (legal access)and I was never a member and president of any club, lol. I was an international tournament director for 2 years 97-99, only, however, I never give my exact name exact, anywhere, including on your 'great finds' lol and there are many mistakes there, I want to let you know we contacted phroziac asking for assistance what to do, because many posts were being reverted automatically, even those where they eventually were prooven to be concise/exact and true and to the best of our knowledge. But Phroziac and others gave us trouble. There are three of us. I am a historian, not a vandal, but I am working on a program that will autmoticlly catch on your site and change many pages without any of us being present. By loosing us, you lost huge knowledge of sports and much more, all the things we said e.g. about 1998 1999 nba season, eventually, reverted, and on many other topics. I will not go into the details here. And no,</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I do not live in Chicago, but use Chicago proxy, I am from Indiana, I contacted certain lady at wikipedia, then she passed on info to that whore phroziac, did you honestly think i would give my real name and even if u do find, that makes no difference, we will keep on bothering you all, just so you know. But it's inappropriate to post any names, even if they are half correct, because they were written to one party, THE WIKI ADMINISTRATION, Ms. Carter, she forwarded our concern to that whore phroziac, carter said it's best for us not to post here, since many sites will automatically be reverted, you have codes you inserted which automatically notify aholes like curps, i am a computer programmer and I know all the codes in the world, you could have had a top commander and anti vandal guard in your sects, if you just allowed us to talk normally, now you have chosen war, a war, which we intend to continue one way or the other. I demand that you enforce the rules and not user people's names, because I do not want members of any club to be on vandal list, if they are, even better, we can not wait to sue you.</dd>

If they were, it probably means that he uses aliases offline in day-to-day life. The name above was taken from an email.

<p>Userspace exists as a scratchspace, a personal office if you will, to help with building the encyclopaedia. It's not a free patch of land that anyone who registers a free account can regard as their entitlement, and it's not somewhere where one can put inappropriate content and hide behind a kind of "<a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliamentary_privilege.html" title="Parliamentary privilege">userspace privilege</a>" to protect it.

<p>Wilkes has repeatedly violated the arbcom ruling. I banned him for 24 hours some days ago because of a number of violations, but treated them collectively as one breach. He has now committed two more unambiguous breaches. I have imposed a 1 week ban for the two breaches and am treating them as two clear and deliberate breaches. He is now up to three. If (and given his behaviour it seems a case of when) he hits five as per the arb ruling he will be banned for one year. He seems to treat arbcom rulings as a joke. They aren't. If he doesn't get the message then he will soon have a year to cop himself on. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:#006666; background-color:orange"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 20:09, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

No mistake. She deleted lines of another article dealing claims about someone's homosexuality. That breached the arbcom ruling which says that she and Wilkes are <i><b>banned from making any edit related to a person's alleged homosexuality or bisexuality. The clauses "any edit" and "related to homosexuality or bisexuality" shall be interpreted broadly.</b></i> This is not the first time she has broken the ruling. The first time I judged given past behaviour to be unintentional. In this case however she unambiguously disobeyed the arbcom ruling at least 3 times. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=August_Kubizek&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=41682688" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=August_Kubizek&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=41682688" rel="nofollow">breach 1</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=August_Kubizek&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=41686703" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=August_Kubizek&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=41686703" rel="nofollow">breach 2</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=August_Kubizek&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=41784729" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=August_Kubizek&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=41784729" rel="nofollow">breach 3</a> As a result there was no choice but to block her. I have to say that while Wilkes seems a complete nutcase (who is strongly suspected of being a notorious multiple hardbanned user from some years back) Wyss normally acts more responsibly. But in this case the enfringments were clearcut and necessitated a block. Indeed she is very lucky that she only got a 24 hour block having made three clear breaches. She could have been blocked for longer. Some users would have imposed longer for three clear unambiguous breaches like those. To breach the ruling once is wrong. To do it three times in the one article smacks of giving the two fingers to the ruling.</p>
<p>Here is just one of the bits of text she deleted. <i>According to a theory by Professor Machtan, which he explained in his book</i> <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hidden_Hitler_a4f2.html" title="The Hidden Hitler">The Hidden Hitler</a><i>, August Kubizek had a <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexual.html" title="Homosexual">homosexual</a> relationship with <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>. Both Brigitte Hamann and Professor Machtan wrote that after meeting Hitler during the latter part of 1905, the two quickly became close friends and lived together, sharing a small room they rented on the Stumpergasse in Vienna. In</i> Young Hitler, the Story of Our Friendship<i>, Kubizek wrote that during their time together Hitler "always rejected the coquettish advances of girls or women. Women and girls took an interest in him in <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linz.html" title="Linz">Linz</a> as well as <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vienna.html" title="Vienna">Vienna</a>, but he always evaded their endeavors." Kubizek also wrote that Hitler had a great love for a girl named "Stefanie" and wrote her countless love poems but never sent them. Instead, Kubizek says Hitler read his poem "Hymn to the Beloved" to him. Professor Machtan stated that while the Stefanie girl definitely existed, some of Kubizek's 1953 writing was a deliberate "heterosexualizing" of Hitler in retrospect (p. 43).</i></p>
<p>She replaced the above text with <i><a href="../../../w/i/l/William_L._Shirer_d2d0.html" title="William L. Shirer">William L. Shirer</a>, in his book</i> <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Rise_and_Fall_of_the_Third_Reich_619a.html" title="The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich">The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich</a> <i>cites a letter dated August 4, 1933, six months after Hitler became Chancellor of Germany, in which he wrote his boyhood friend, "I should be very glad . . . to revive once more with you those memories of the best years of my life."</i></p>

<p>I'm hoping another admin can give me some fresh insight.

The user, MrKing84, is not great at discussion from what I've gathered. I think it should be one way, and he thinks it should be his.

<dd>The templates actually seem to be verbatim copies of the Wikinews main page templates, with some minor changes and after having lost their various CSS styles on account of having been moved. They aren't linked to anything. My only guess is that he wants to perform some kind of bizarre mix-up in vandalising articles to look like the Wikinews main page, although that seems tenuous and I can't possibly see why he'd be creating them as templates. Note he's used identical nomenclature to the Wikinews main page templates. I can only fathom that he may well actually just not understand that the main page isn't editable, or thinks he can somehow get around it. I'll leave a talk page message and if he doesn't respond within 24hrs satisfactorily I'll delete them. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicholasTurnbull_9d8a.html" title="User:NicholasTurnbull">Nicholas<b>Turnbull</b></a> | <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENicholasTurnbull_45f8.html" title="User talk:NicholasTurnbull">(talk)</a> 03:15, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Kayabusa futura has a good number of legitimate edits and therefore is less likely to be an impersonator, I think. *brew only has two edits so far, both seemingly legitimate, but due to the few edits is more problematic, but I'd suggest only keeping watch at the moment. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 08:46, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
