<p><a href="../../../w/e/b/User%7EWeb_kai2000_7a48.html" title="User:Web kai2000">User:Web kai2000</a> has been tagging (many, many) images with image license templates that he or she keeps in userspace.

I've been trying to get to the bottom of what exactly has been going on here over the last five days, but the unfortunate answer seems to be that we do not, in fact, have any reason to believe that these userspace image license templates are accurate, and do have <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/otrs/index.pl?Action=AgentTicketZoom&amp;TicketID=772671" class="external text" title="https://secure.wikimedia.org/otrs/index.pl?Action=AgentTicketZoom&amp;TicketID=772671" rel="nofollow">reason to believe</a> <small>(OTRS login needed)</small> that they are not.

<p>What exactly constitutes a death threat? Is it sufficient to state, "I hope you die", or does there actually have to be an active threat? That is, would the threat have to be along the lines of, "I will kill you" or "I will get someone to kill you"? Here, I'm talking in the context of abusive behaviour on the Wikipedia obviously, not in the press-charges-legally context. Also, would an emailed threat be sufficient or does it have to be posted on the Wikipedia? --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 17:48, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>"I hope you die" would not be a death threat, though it would likely violate <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> as it's not a very civil thing to say to someone. "I will kill you" or "I will get someone to kill you" would definitely be death threats. Emailed threats would be considered a violation of the rules as well if they could be positively traced to the person who allegedly sent them. ···<a href="../../../n/i/h/User%7ENihonjoe_c4ff.html" title="User:Nihonjoe"><font color="darkblue">日本穣</font></a><sup><a href="../../../j/a/p/Help%7EJapanese_d024.html" title="Help:Japanese">?</a> · <small><a href="../../../n/i/h/User_talk%7ENihonjoe_488b.html" title="User talk:Nihonjoe"><font color="blue">Talk</font></a> <font color="darkblue">to</font> <a href="../../../j/a/_/WP%7EJA_dc61.html" title="WP:JA">Nihon</a><a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS-JA_9394.html" title="WP:MOS-JA"><font color="darkgreen">joe</font></a></small></sup> 18:13, 26 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The second point first: I'd say an email carries as much weight as any other threat.
<p>As for what constitutes a threat, that is up to the individual to judge the perceived danger. Most threats are nothing, like a kid making a bomb scare to avoid a test. The ones that are serious should be recognized if they carry more gravity as to actual physical harm. <a href="../../../t/e/k/User%7ETeke_11ee.html" title="User:Teke"><font color="maroon">Teke</font></a> 18:15, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>A kid making a bomb threat to a school in order to get out of a test is not "nothing". It is a serious, legal matter, and needs to be treated as such. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli%27i_4322.html" title="User:Ali'i">Ali'i</a> 18:29, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>All actual death threats deserve an immediate indef block. It is not for me or anyone else to attempt to intuit whether the individual who issues it is a frivolous child or a violent felon. I will not be standing watch to guard the doorstep of the target's home at night so the only ethical alternative is to treat all such threats as serious. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></font></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charge!</a></i></sup> 02:11, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Well, it's supposed to just be a clarification of existing policy, AFAIK. (I actually went and asked Kat Walsh, so there you go.&#160;:-) ).

<li>Expect the same uproar we got when images about living personalities began to be deleted. I, for one, like Wikipedia to focus in freedom.

<li>Sadly enough, I actually think that the foundation position is more generous than that which certain of our contributors here seem to think we should be following. At least we now have a clear statement confirming that the foundation is not "on the verge of going German" as several users have claimed to me. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> <small><a href="../../../t/j/s/User_talk%7ETjstrf_3ddb.html" title="User talk:Tjstrf">talk</a></small> 05:14, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>It actually makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside that people think it is not strict enough. I am not about to stop anyone from taking a stricter interpretation of the policy than is required, and am likely to come in and support it! "You can't delete that, the policy doesn't say we <i>have</i> to" is a really terrible argument for keeping something; these are minimum standards beyond which the Foundation will step in and require that project policy be changed. Our goal is free content and the policy's intent is to keep use of non-free content as minimal as possible while still allowing it in those limited cases where alternatives are not reasonable to obtain. There are a few people on the project who hold a more extreme position here than I do. I don't necessarily advocate everything they are doing, but that is a community issue; you are more than welcome to go further than a strict reading requires. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindspillage_87a5.html" title="User:Mindspillage">Kat Walsh</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMindspillage_c644.html" title="User talk:Mindspillage">(spill your mind?)</a> 07:41, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So do our existing policies on fair use (which I think are too lax in some areas and too strict in others) constitute an 'Exemption Doctrine Policy' under this new board policy or is something else required? If existing policy covers it then this seems like no change for this project. We already require that 'non free' images provide a fair-use rationale for the page(s) they are used on and delete them if it doesn't meet standards. Someone <i>might</i> get industrious and perform a complete review of all images before March 23, 2008 to locate all problem images, but that's just a more determined effort at enforcing existing practice. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 10:38, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The number of dodgy fair-use images is huge. This will be a herculean amount of work. We currently have the policy of deleting those that have no explicit rationale (over and above the standard tags) - but I'm far from convinced this is really the best way to proceed. The number of images that are potentially legitimate but lack an explicit rationale is quite large, and so is the number of images that do have an explicit rationale but where the rationale is wrong. Cynically speaking: instead of deleting all the non-explicit ones we could probably just as well delete any random selection of, say, 50% of all claimed fair-use images; the number both of false negatives and false positives would be comparable. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 10:45, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>The resolution makes the distinction between <i>new</i> images, uploaded on or after <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a>-<a href="../../../m/a/r/March_27.html" title="March 27">03-27</a>, and <i>existing</i> images, uploaded before that date. The latter should go through a process of determining whether a (correct) fair use rationale exists. But we should immediately throw out any attempts to add to the backlog of such a process with <i>newly</i> uploaded images that lack fair use rationales. In other words: We have a year to sort out the corpus of fair use media without proper rationales that we currently have, but we don't make a rod for our own backs by letting any further additions be made to that corpus from this point onwards. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 12:14, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>For either task, we will need a much more efficient process than we have in place now, to determine that people really write these rationales, that they get reviewed by people who really understand them, and that deletions can then be performed without paperwork overhead. See the current CSD queues, it's not working. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 12:29, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>normally reverting vandals doesn't scare me; i just saw an organized group and expected the worst. not sure what magic bullet i thought admin's might have. but apparently the answer is, indeed, to suck it up, revert, and (from a quick glance at metros' talk page) revert talk page vandalism 3-4 times a day. thanks and good luck. --<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarneca_890e.html" title="User:Barneca">barneca</a> (<a href="../../../b/a/r/User_talk%7EBarneca_4061.html" title="User talk:Barneca">talk</a>) 03:34, 27 March 2007 (UTC) p.s. what's a shift key?

<p>I've seen a bunch of cases recently of administrators editing fully protected pages without first getting consensus on the Talk page. I don't want to start naming names yet and making people defensive, but this has to stop. (To be clear, this has been happening on multiple, unrelated pages.) Is it not obvious that editng a protected page without consensus is a use of admin powers to gain advantage in a content dispute? <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClayoquot_bbe3.html" title="User:Clayoquot">Kla'quot</a> 16:48, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks AnonEMouse. I'm not asking non-guilty admins to be taking action against the guilty. I just want the guilty admins to read this, feel guilty, and stop the offending behaviour.

<p>I've seen a bunch of cases recently of users doing things I don't like without first taking the steps I feel are necessary. I don't want to start naming names yet and making people defensive, but this has to stop. (To be clear, this has happened many times, although I'm not specifying how many.) Is it not obvious that doing this is not appropriate and disruptive? - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 22:48, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>You might want to re-phrase that, because it currently reads as your saying that other editors doing things that you yourself don't like is not appropriate, disruptive, and has to stop. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:27, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Just a question: Would you consider administrators making non-controversial edits on protected articles inappropriate? In this hypothetical world we can assume a non-controversial edit can be clearly defined and everyone agrees on the standard. --<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDeskana_5f27.html" title="User:Deskana">Deskana</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDeskana_208e.html" title="User talk:Deskana"><small>(talk)</small></a> 22:50, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Call me a process wonk, but I personally think admins should use {{<a href="../../../e/d/i/Template%7EEditprotected_d7e4.html" title="Template:Editprotected">editprotected</a>}} just like everyone else (We're not talking about <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> or any other urgent stuff here, right?). It's always possible that the editing admin might perceive something as totally non-controversial, but that doesn't mean it actually is. Having another pair of eyes to look at the proposed edit reduces the risk of making potentially controversial edits greatly. --<a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConti_fae9.html" title="User:Conti">Conti</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConti_c57c.html" title="User talk:Conti">✉</a> 01:50, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Administrators are trusted by the community to receive those extra tools, right? Then they, just like everyone else, should be entitled to <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">be bold when editing pages</a>, even protected pages. If someone legitimately complains, then they should also seek discussion and form <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECON_c65b.html" title="WP:CON">consensus</a> about the issue.

<dd>Sure. I wouldn't say that using {{<a href="../../../e/d/i/Template%7EEditprotected_d7e4.html" title="Template:Editprotected">editprotected</a>}} should be a hard rule or anything, being bold is encouraged, of course. I just consider it to be an act of courtesy to go to the talk page and ask for consensus before making any kind of non-minor edit to a protected page. I don't think they should do that for process's sake, they should do it because when it comes to editing articles, admins are normal editors just like everyone else. They don't have any kind of special authority there, and every step we take away from that is a step in the wrong direction, IMHO. --<a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConti_fae9.html" title="User:Conti">Conti</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConti_c57c.html" title="User talk:Conti">✉</a> 02:13, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well thats an error. Admins should not be editing pages that have been protected for reasons other than profile unless such edits are required by BLP.

<p>This is something that i've recently been wondering about, after having a look at <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheism.html" title="Atheism">Atheism</a>, where an admin behaving in good faith seemed to annoy a regular non-admin editor a bit - there's not a huge problem here, but perhaps some kind of guideline might help. When seeing an admin make various edits to a protected page, its one of the only times i feel like a 'non-allowed' editor, and I suppose this is bad (don't worry - i'll get over it!) - particularly when the protection has been there for more than a couple of days, and was put there by another admin. I guess I'd say that if an admin wanted to make uncontroversial edits; why not unprotect, make them, and see if the article is ok for a few minutes? - cheers, <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetesmiles_8c9b.html" title="User:Petesmiles">Petesmiles</a> 23:03, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>This type of thread needs specific examples or else it's worse than a waste of time. Go ahead: name names and provide diffs. Specific problems ought to be identified and addressed. If there's an accident or a misunderstanding it ought to get explained and resolved.

<p>Yesterday, Princess56499 created Karina Garcia, a hoax bio copied from <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allyson_Swan_2423.html" title="Allyson Swan">Allyson Swan</a>. The user then vandalized Allyson Swan, as well as the related article <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miss_Idaho_USA_cc1f.html" title="Miss Idaho USA">Miss Idaho USA</a> to mislead and refer to information in the hoax article. Essentially, the effect of the vandalism was to replace one person with another.

At this point should the prod just be restored or should the article be deleted per G7, and should any other actions be taken explicitly, or just let the other prod take its course and keep an eye on the user for future activity? --<a href="../../../a/f/t/User%7EAfter_Midnight_e273.html" title="User:After Midnight">After Midnight</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../a/f/t/User_talk%7EAfter_Midnight_381d.html" title="User talk:After Midnight">0001</a></small></sup> 23:21, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have searched Wikipedia and this seems to be the best/only place for this message. I am in hopes someone in charge of Wikipedia will see this as I can not find a contact for any of the powers that be Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Vandalism is out of control. Most editors already know this. I have only been here for one year, one month and I have seen it multiply upwards drastically. So much so that one by one I have had to "abandon" articles because I can no longer, nor wish to, keep up with the vandals. I ask myself, Why work so hard fixing the problems created by vandals when Wikipedia invites vandals in freely. On some articles vandalism is an hourly event. I have even seen vandals invite others to make an article into a "chat" room. This cannot be ignored any longer. My daughter's high school history teacher announced to his class some time back that he would no longer accept Wikipedia as a reliable source on their reports. I learned of this while helping my daughter with homework and in conversation told her to always question all information found on Wikipedia. That is a reputation Wikipedia cannot afford to get. Vandalism plays a major role in this. The Wiki process of "warning" vandals is fair but useless as there must be literally millions of acts perpetrated daily, if not hourly.</p>
<p>One way to curtail the problem drastically is to allow only "logged-on" registered editors to edit an article. The extreme percentage of violators do not bother logging on. If they do, they learn quickly to log off before vandalizing. Wikipedia best act on this "easy fix" now as once the reputation goes sour you will never be able to repair it. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff_Soapy_Smith_5669.html" title="User:Jeff Soapy Smith">Soapy</a> 14:32, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>What a mistake. The current slow process of "warning" Vandals makes vandalism mathematically impossible to fix. I won't bother to take the time to read the reasons as to why Wikipedia rejects the solution as it won't help. I guess now is a good time to jump ship. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff_Soapy_Smith_5669.html" title="User:Jeff Soapy Smith">Soapy</a> 14:50, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>If we did not allow non-logged in editors we would not longer be Wikipedia, that is our thing. Also, vandalism is not out of control, we deal with it everyday just fine. <small><a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC"><sup>High</sup><sub>InBC</sub></a><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 14:52, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>As I have stated before several times. Vandalism can always be reverted. The vandals hopes of runing the encylopedia dashed when they realize with the click of a button all of there work is gone. On the other hand, a curious anon editor, who decides not to waste his time when he is required to sign up and leaves cannot be fixed with a quick "revert". <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">-- Chrislk02 (Chris Kreider)</a> 14:54, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I find the revert-and-warn system very effective if used promptly and correctly, as vandals soon realise that we don't and won't tolerate it and that their actions are quickly reverted, and if they don't, we block them. By shifting vandalism to accounts, the same process would still have to be gone through, plus it would be harder to spot. Many editors also start out as annons, then get hooked and sign up. We would loose this with no annon editing. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattbr_fea3.html" title="User:Mattbr">matt</a><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMattbr_0fa0.html" title="User talk:Mattbr">br</a> 15:10, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I edit and fix vandalism hourly so please don't tell me it is not a problem and is an easy fix. Go ahead and continue to believe all is fine, but when high school teachers tell their classes not to trust Wikipedia information then I would say Wiki has a declining reputation. I deal with authors everyday and in my conversations not one has had a good thing to say about Wiki. I used to defend Wikipedia with these people. But now being that I see Wikipedia refuses to fix the ever growing problem I am only left to drastically dropping the number of my watches. I can easily predict that I will continue to drop watches as the problem worsens. Don't be fooled into thinking it will improve itself. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff_Soapy_Smith_5669.html" title="User:Jeff Soapy Smith">Soapy</a> 15:17, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>No, no one should fully trust Wiki-info ever, nor that of any encyclopedia. That's not the job of encyclopedias: encyclopedias exist to provide quick, easy reference, not to be absolutely perfect. And it is in the nature of wikis that there will be errors/vandalism: per <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, wikis shouldn't be thought of as reliable sources, and this includes Wikipedia. Re vandalism, have you ever tried using rollback/warn/report scripts such as <a href="../../../t/w/i/WP%7ETWINKLE_df31.html" title="WP:TWINKLE">WP:TWINKLE</a>? Makes playing whack-the-vandal a lot quicker and lot less stressful. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoreschi_31bb.html" title="User:Moreschi">Moreschi</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_recordings_a333.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested recordings">Request a recording?</a></sup></li>
<li>No one should trust wikipedia to write a paper. If you do, it is your own fault for doing such. I used wikipedia to gather basic information, and often used it to develop an outline or a plan for papers, however the research came from books at the library and scholary documents. The fact is, even if wikipedias content could only be edited by registered users, or any other restrictions were imposed, it WOULD NOT make wikipedia a reliable source for papers. It is just not, and that is not what it is here for. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">-- Chrislk02 (Chris Kreider)</a> 15:26, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Exactly. Wikipedia is a great place to start and is a hugely valuable resource for that, but it isn't a scholarly journal, it isn't a book, and it isn't a reliable source. Wikipedia is not a publisher of original thought; instead of using Wikipedia as a source, why not use Wikipedia as a place that organizes other people's research and go from there? I am not surprised at all that your daughter's high school teacher said that it is no longer allowed as a source; I am, however, surprised that it was allowed in the first place. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrangerer_d331.html" title="User:Strangerer">Strangerer</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStrangerer_0525.html" title="User talk:Strangerer">Talk</a>)</small> 22:51, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Knowledge IS the job of an encyclopedia and most people assume that knowledge implies correct information. Quick and Easy AND CORRECT information is the job of any encyclopedia. Yes, there will always be mistakes and I agree that everyone SHOULD question everything they read but most don't. Yes Wikipedia would still have some vandalism with enforced registration editing but the problem would be far drastically reduced. As far as vandalism then being harder to detect, I say that most editors check BOTH registered logged-in edits as well as ones not signed in so mathematically fewer would get through. Under the current methods, each vandal you are able to deter, ten more join in. I see with my own eyes what is happening on the pages I use to watch and am currently watching so please don't tell me things are fine. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff_Soapy_Smith_5669.html" title="User:Jeff Soapy Smith">Soapy</a> 16:22, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Vandalism is going to happen. I have spent months on rc patrol and it is no problem to revert several hundered acts of vandalism per hour, especially with the sophistacted vandal fighting tools that we have. You can get them set up, but vandalism is not seriously worse than it was a month ago, or 3 months ago. It is the same juvenile pranks that can be INSTANTLY reverted. It is not hard to fix vandalism. It is like saying that a kid writing a chalk board is graffiti vandalism, when in fact with a simple swipe of an eraser, there well thought out, juvenile contributions, are gone. If you dont like vandal fighting dont do it, leave it to somebody else. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">-- Chrislk02 (Chris Kreider)</a> 16:28, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The stupidly juvenile vandalism is not the real problem - it's generally easily reverted, although I've run across occasions where it's escaped notice for weeks. The real, darker problem is subtle factual vandalism, especially of biographies of living persons. If it doesn't look like obvious vandalism, it generally gets overlooked... and if you're smart, you can make all sorts of horribly despicable things look like perfectly good article content. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 00:53, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>There is nothing arrogant or aggressive about the Brussels comment, and that was not an edit war, and if it was, it's one you started and one you but nobody else contributed to.</li>
<li>There might still be a dispute on the Kansai-ben article, but it's not over the factual accuracy, as the tag suggested. Again, this dispute is not with "multiple people" but me and two more editors disagreeing with you, and only you.</li>
<li>I "yelled" after having those tags removed several times without any explanation. See the talk page, the admin put the tags back. In the Kansai-ben article, other users removed your tags too.</li>
<li>The "Mister-Jones" talk page revert does in no way constitute a "threat".</li>

<dd>I have not "done this last week as well". The one who is trying to get into edit wars with somebody is you, with me. You ARE wikistalking me. Just H started posting on the Joji Obara talk page, after a content dispute we had on the <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansai-ben.html" title="Kansai-ben">Kansai-ben</a> article. On the Joji Obara page, he sided with the editor opposing me, which he is perfectly free to do, and had it been only this article I wouldn't have minded <b>at all</b>. What freaks me out is when he starts reverting edits I make to other, completely unrelated articles, as well. For example, <a href="../../../b/r/u/Brussels.html" title="Brussels">Brussels</a>, an article he has not previously edited. My edit: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brussels&amp;diff=118310802&amp;oldid=118230071" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brussels&amp;diff=118310802&amp;oldid=118230071" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> and Just H's revert <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brussels&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=118404412" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brussels&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=118404412" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. Also, the <a href="../../../j/a/f/Jafaican.html" title="Jafaican">Jafaican</a> article: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jafaican&amp;diff=117835145&amp;oldid=117794070" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jafaican&amp;diff=117835145&amp;oldid=117794070" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> and Just H's revert: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jafaican&amp;diff=118021132&amp;oldid=117839791" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jafaican&amp;diff=118021132&amp;oldid=117839791" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. Have I then done something inappropriate when I ask him to stop stalking me? <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan_e4e7.html" title="User:Mackan">Mackan</a> 18:50, 28 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>At a casual glance, the diffs of his reverts seem like reasonable edits. He's allowed to edit the same pages as you. Stalking would involve an intent to harass or annoy. Is there any evidence of such an intent? I certainly don't see it in the diffs provided. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 19:24, 28 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Of course he is allowed to edit any article he wants to, but doesn't the fact that he on all three articles either opposed me or reverted me say something about his intent? Also, how about the fact that he had never touched any of those articles before, but obviously found them by looking at my contributions list. Just H seems pissed off about the situation at <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansai-ben.html" title="Kansai-ben">Kansai-ben</a> and allows this anger to spill over to other articles. Petty revenge is the motive, if you ask me. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan_e4e7.html" title="User:Mackan">Mackan</a> 19:33, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Baptist women in ministry was nominated for deletion on 2007-03-01. Here is the discussion: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Baptist_women_in_ministry_1286.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Baptist women in ministry">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Baptist women in ministry</a>. The result seems to have been "merge any relevant information and then delete as non-notable organization." I stumbled on to the page today and saw the information hadn't been merged, so I just now merged the information about persecution of Baptist women into <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anabaptist.html" title="Anabaptist">Anabaptist</a>. The content in the article has expanded by a significant amount since the AfD closed, but no information about its notability has been added. Should I send this to AfD again or is it proper to delete it as the result of that AfD debate? --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrangerer_d331.html" title="User:Strangerer">Strangerer</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStrangerer_0525.html" title="User talk:Strangerer">Talk</a>)</small> 22:38, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

Moreover, sectarian persecutions of several centuries ago and a modern "equal rights" organization aren't either. A better merge destination would be <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptist.html" title="Baptist">Baptist</a>, since it's a Baptist-related organization. It certainly seems to be a much better article than when it was AfD'd. The notability would be that the group promotes women in ministry at a time when the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_Baptist_Convention_a9e3.html" title="Southern Baptist Convention">Southern Baptist Convention</a> has been trying to minimize their presence. <a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskari_Mark_f87e.html" title="User:Askari Mark">Askari Mark</a> <small><a href="../../../a/s/k/User_talk%7EAskari_Mark_1910.html" title="User talk:Askari Mark">(Talk)</a></small> 02:06, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>A strange closure result for an article that was AfD'd for being about an NN organization.

<p>I went to the user's user page, and found a conversation that looked like this</p>

<p>I read this as an obvious violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>, so I didn't bother attempting further discussion. I applied an indefinite block, and left the following message:</p>

<p>AFA has now left on my talk page a very long message analysing the situation with respect to our expressions of policy, arguing that his signature was not inappropriate, but my block was. Therefore I am bringing it here for review. Am I wrong in thinking that we shouldn't be letting people go around signing "Fuck you!" on talk pages?

<dd>I see no problem with blocking a user who adds an obviously offensive signature. There are borderline cases, but I don't think "Fuck you!" is borderline. It's more than a bit disruptive.

<dd>I fail to see how the signature is offensive. I believe that my response to the first request was civil (I changed my signature when it was pointed out it violated policy). It wasn't a personal attack (as I pointed out). Also, I fail to see how my response to that request has to do with my being blocked indefinitely. As Hesperian has said, I have explained in detail why I feel that my signature didn't violate policy.

<dd>I fail to see how it is offensive in this context (not directed at anyone). Also, even if it is offensive and violates policy, I still contend that the action taken also violates policy.

<dd>The block was appropriate and normal.

It's well established that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> does not apply to usernames and the same rationale operates for this signature: we defend the potentially offensive where encyclopedic value exists, but we don't endorse the gratuitous. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></font></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charge!</a></i></sup> 03:57, 30 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If the block was appropriate and normal, why does the policy not reflect this? I feel that the action taken was excessive, I've explained my position and backed up with references to policy. So, even if the signature was in violation of those policies (and I disagree obviously), I still think that a different cause of action (namely a note on the page) would have been sufficient. I was indefinitely blocked for a signature. Not for vandalism, or other such things, but for a signature. I think that is going a bit overboard, even if the signature is offensive to some people. I've explained elsewhere why I think that WP:NPA and WP:CIVIL don't apply. I don't think that WP:POINT applies either, and I'll explain why here. One, I didn't cause any disruption, my signature was short and was not thrown about excessively. Two, I wasn't making a point, I changed my signature to remove an external link when requested, which was all that was required. I didn't ask for this to come here, though I welcome external comment. I simply asked Hesperian to justify an action which I thought was unjustifiable according to my readings of the relevant polices. I think the best way for any further discussion to proceed would be in the manner of a debate. I.e. I've made my points, someone else now refutes them, and so on.

<dd>It appears to me that you were (and still are) directing the signature at those who have asked you to change it.

<dd>How the fuck is profanity disruptive? (And yes I know I made a WP:POINT, I don't care.) You say "may" offend, and you say it disrupts every time I post a comment. How does a signature that short disrupt the flow of conversation? Tell me, does my signature disrupt the conversation here? And, even if my signature is disruptive and offensive, how does that warrant an indefinite ban?

I will not respond again unless someone, with reference to policy, shows how my indefinite ban was justified.

<p>I'd like some clarification on an issue. An admin has protected the <b><a href="../../../q/x/z/User_talk%7EQxz_02c0.html" title="User talk:Qxz">User talk:Qxz</a></b> so that nobody can cantact that individual nor comment on that individual's recent conflict.</p>
<p>I couldn't find anything in policy that allows a talk page to be protected except in the case of vandalism, and then only as a last resort and only for as long as necessary to thwart such vandalism. Can a user request that his talk page be protected just so that he can't be contacted?</p>
<p>I haven't run into this before, and it seems counter to the nature of the Wikipedia project. Please unprotect the page so that the community, me included, can console the individual, who has had a wiki-stress blowout. He also left a message on my talk page, which I'd like to respond to on his talk page.</p>
<p>Or at least quote the specific policy or precedent on this issue.

<dd>Essjay was an extraordinary case, much like Gator1's, where his RFA page was deleted. Those are extreme cases. As a counterexample, I remember when someone invoked the right to vanish and tried to get his RFA page deleted, but another admin reverted it. Also, when Lucky 6.9 vanished, he locked his user talk page, but UninvitedCompany unprotected it and said that Lucky had to let other people post messages if they wanted to.

<dd>I really wish people would raise issues in one place only or at least make a note that they are also going to raise the matter on another noticeboard. I unprotected the talk page in response to the post at RFPP and before I was aware of this thread. I support the initial protection because it was the talk page of an a blocked editor who was being disruptive. I have unprotected it because the editor is no longer blocked.

<li>It seems to me that protecting a user talk page has little to nothing to do with "vanishing". In general, when people leave, other people put messages on their talk page asking them to come back.

<p>I'll clarify the current situation: Mike's sockpuppet category contains many sockpuppet accounts that have already been blocked. Now, it contains several more accounts that have had sockpuppet notices added, but in many cases the account adding the sockpuppet notice is <i>also</i> a sockpuppet.

<dd>I've thought about that. It's a tricky balancing act, and that throws the balance entirely the wrong way, I think. I'd like to deny him recognition, but he thrives on secrecy and misinformation almost as much as he thrives on recognition. He was exposed so quickly when he tried to libel and impersonate me on AutoAdmit partially <i>because</i> one of the people there found his sockpuppet page.</dd>
<dd>Something I've considered is redirecting the old Church-tracking pages to the category page, so that his presence on Wikipedia is nothing but a list of names.

It gives a pretty positive view of Wikipedia's anti-vandalism mechanisms and the people involved, focusing on Theresa's own contributions.

<p>My apologies if anyone thought I was directly attacking them. If you guys don't think there should be a Poll MfD the whole thing and stand up to Jimbo. I also have the right to stand up to El_C's abusive misrepresenation that I did something wrong. Up to when I posted, only an extreme minority complained in the way that people are now. I was only trying to help. If people were unhappy, why didn't they SAY so? Also, his assertation that I was keeping things out of the pre-poll was a flagrant lie meant to disparage me. I don't care if someone has 300 edits or 30,000. I have every right to defend myself if made to look bad with false statements... I never once remove a single thing that anyone added, and in fact INTEGRATED two other suggestions (Q4, Q5) that I said I didn't care for. Look at my history of editing--I go out of my way to not try to own stuff, and to add in suggestions that people give me since I've been here... if you took it as an attack on you, sorry, it certainly was't meant to be. El_C was 100% out of line in singleing me out and I wasn't going to let him make me a patsy for the problems some obviously have with Jimbo over this. - <a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDennyColt_8821.html" title="User talk:DennyColt">Denny</a> 13:17, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

The only consensus was that this would not start before 00:00 2 April, to avoid April Fool's Day; and three editors have started it on an hour's discussion.

<li>The reason I ask is that we treat biographies of living people much more rigorously than, say, an article about a superhero. Professional wrestlers fall somewhere in the middle, and the bulk of Wikipedia articles about them are plagued with unsupported, and in many cases unsupportable, material. Should these article be treated as any other "real life" biography, or are special considerations given to their largely fictitious personas? <a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurntsauce_6cba.html" title="User:Burntsauce">Burntsauce</a> 17:10, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The sourcing of the articles is very problematic.

<li>I think what's needed is a lead which is strictly factual, an in-universe warning on the body, and fact tags for anything not decently sourced, plus unreferenced tags for those which have no credible sourcing.

<p>Well I went through the Cs, and 47 out of 50 articles need sources/verifying.

<dd>I just want to make certain the other sysops are aware of possible background at this topic: JB196's <i>modus operandi</i> is to breed a large sockfarm, go on a notability/verifiability tagging spree of non-North American professional wrestling topics (often targeting older biographies from the pre-internet period), then initiate mass deletion nominations. Meanwhile he uses other socks to vandalize the non-North American professional wrestling articles that do have citations, deleting the references and then tag teaming with his other socks to pin (previously) verified but vandalized pages onto the deletion mat if the vandalism doesn't get reverted fast enough. He does this faster than a team of people could possibly add citations from vintage magazines and he's been at this game for a year. He just happens to think the only pro wrestling that matters happens in the United States and Canada, and he wants to manipulate the world's most popular reference site to reflect his bias. He got away with that for a long time too because (heck let's face it) professional wrestling doesn't get a whole lot of respect, but the more one thinks about it the more pernicious and exploitable that whole methodology looks. So to summarize, it's a wise idea to view all tagged articles on this subject as very possibly tagged in bad faith by a banned user (checkuser requests have confirmed well over 100 sockpuppets). <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></font></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charge!</a></i></sup> 02:06, 31 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Why is this interesting? If we are making unsourced, or poorly sourced claims about living people, it needs to be cleaned up. It can be cleaned up through careful editing, which is going to have the effect of removing any verifiability tags, or it can be removed by deletion, if the article doesn't fit our inclusion criteria, or if we cannot find enough reliable sources to write a proper one. Frankly, we should be a lot more concerned about unsourced claims about living people than we should about someone frivolously using {{<a href="../../../v/e/r/Template%7EVerify_1f97.html" title="Template:Verify">verify</a>}}.

<p>This discussion, which is past time for deletion/keep, is causing some issues, as anyone can look at my talk page and see. One user wishes to delete the categories, even while the discussion is open, in the name of IAR; I say they should stay. However, we both agree it's a bogus cat, and it would be much simpler if an admin could close the discussion right now, and the issue would no longer matter. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatstuart_7fbf.html" title="User:Patstuart">Patstuart</a><sup><a href="../../../p/a/t/User_talk%7EPatstuart_e8fd.html" title="User talk:Patstuart">talk</a>·<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Patstuart_a3f0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Patstuart">edits</a></sup> 03:11, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well I guess I'll explain my position here, even though I am having a difficult time understanding why this has become such a big deal. First of all, the vast majority of the people who voted on whether this category should be kept or removed went for the latter. The vote currently stands at 27-6 in favor of deletion. What I am requesting is that, in light of the vote and the time that we have spent arguing over this issue, including the fact that many arguments have not been addressed by those who wanted to keep the category, we should delete this category....basically <i>now</i>. I don't see any point in waiting any further. The category is wholly unencyclopedic and, as someone mentioned during the discussion, it will never survive almost any bureaucratic process that we put it through. It is virtually dead. Prolonging its existence can only cause the sort of rancor and discomfort that Pat and I have, unfortunately, experienced today.<a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUberCryxic_9903.html" title="User:UberCryxic">UberCryxic</a> 03:45, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've closed the discussion as the category was obviously POV and the overwhelming majority of participants agreed on that point. I also emptied the cat and deleted it. ···<a href="../../../n/i/h/User%7ENihonjoe_c4ff.html" title="User:Nihonjoe"><font color="darkblue">日本穣</font></a><sup><a href="../../../j/a/p/Help%7EJapanese_d024.html" title="Help:Japanese">?</a> · <small><a href="../../../n/i/h/User_talk%7ENihonjoe_488b.html" title="User talk:Nihonjoe"><font color="blue">Talk</font></a> <font color="darkblue">to</font> <a href="../../../j/a/_/WP%7EJA_dc61.html" title="WP:JA">Nihon</a><a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS-JA_9394.html" title="WP:MOS-JA"><font color="darkgreen">joe</font></a></small></sup> 05:27, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I have requested blacklisting of both sites to contain the problem, but if speakers of other languages could help out it would be appreciated.</p>

<li>Good call on the blacklisting request. I know that sometime in the past I was involved in a situation where some editor was going through pages and replacing one version of the URLs with the other, along with not so veiled legal threats.

Hope I don't get blocked! I have two questions: One — should I also remove them from discussion pages? Two — what should I do when they are not just given as external links, but given as a footnote to source a particular claim being made? <s>See, for example, Footnote 3 in <a href="../../../../de/z/w/a/Zwangsarbeitslager_Trawniki_592b.html" class="extiw" title="de:Zwangsarbeitslager_Trawniki">this article</a>.</s> I know that claims have to be sourced in Wikipedia articles, and my German isn't good enough to enable me to rewrite an article taking that bit out. It might leave a gap in the sense if I just removed the sentence that is sourced, and I wouldn't be able to explain myself on the talk page either. (In fact, I got my edit summary from a German Wikipedians who has edited some of the articles I was editing here.)

As a result of the whole bitter imbroglio, we removed all of the links from all articles on the English-language Wikipedia. They apparently didn't think that was enough and are now on OTRS complaining that links can be added back in / links can be added to other Wikimedia projects.

I don't really know (as I am not an OTRS member) and am unsure that I care the exact reasons of the respective domain owners for this particular battle. It is really a moot point and it should be taken off-wiki. I have my opinions but refrain from repeating them because, when I did elsewhere earlier, my intentions were bitterly and baselessly attacked and misrepresented by one of the domain owners.

<li>Thank for your analysis. Unfortunately, and I speak only for myself and have no authority in the matter, I do not care anymore which domain was established when and by whom. The prior discussion took up 37 kilobytes in less than 24 hours, people affiliated with the domains keep trying to import their bitter imbroglio onto Wikipedia, OTRS is (as I understand, I am not on the OTRS team) the next battlefield, and I personally have been rather viciously attacked elsewhere for expressing what I thought might be the motivation for this particular battle. I would prefer formally forbidding any links to either website permanently, or at least until this mix up is sorted out off wiki. --<a href="../../../i/a/m/User%7EIamunknown_d3ca.html" title="User:Iamunknown">Iamunknown</a> 21:36, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

I'm thoroughly unamused by this turn of events, as it seeks to personalise an administrative issue and avoids the correct forum (<a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a>). Furthermore, I was not notified of this "case" (I found it when looking at "what links here" for my user page), and the "advocates" dealing with it have responded to the "case" as though they are lawyers who have already judged me "guilty" (<a href="../../../j/a/l/User_talk%7EJalabi99_b72a.html" title="User talk:Jalabi99">User talk:Jalabi99</a>).</p>
<p>Whether or not my closure was proper or improper isn't the point (I have no problem with a DRV and always respect its outcome).

<p>Actually, the point of WP:AMA is to help people deal with policy, and consensus in general, so going to AMA first is actually a really good idea. The AMA people should then be able to explain what needs to be done next, and help folks do that.</p>
<p>The big problem that AMA (and several other projects just like it) faces these days is that they cannot recruit skilled people straight off of Requests for Adminship anymore. They have to train newbies from scratch, and this makes the quality of their work a bit variable at the moment. It's still better than nothing, but they could use a lot more help from experienced people!</p>

<dd>I'm happy to criticize AMA when it deserves it, but this seems like a basically good advocacy. The original user was frustrated by a deletion, and the advocates informed him/her of the options of (1) DRV; (2) getting the deleted content restored to a userpage for use off-wiki; or (3) letting it go. See the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssociation_of_Members%27_Advocates_Requests_March_2007_Jalabi99_df0c.html" title="Wikipedia:Association of Members' Advocates/Requests/March 2007/Jalabi99">mediation page</a>. I can see Kingboyk's frustration that he/she wasn't notified earlier, but the AMA seems to have accurately fullfilled the function of advising novice users of Wiki norms and procedures. It also looks like the AMA has resolved the issue.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKingboyk&amp;diff=118777003&amp;oldid=118768754" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKingboyk&amp;diff=118777003&amp;oldid=118768754" rel="nofollow">[35]</a> -- all in all, this looks like a positive result, if a little clumsy. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheronJ_75b8.html" title="User:TheronJ">TheronJ</a> 15:26, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Can someone provide me one example of the AMA actually doing something good? As far as I can see it's bad idea, period, because the trolls get a support network, and a walking disaster when it comes to Arbitration, and I think most of the Arbitrators would agree with me there. 90 per cent of the iniquitous wikilawyering we get around here comes from the AMA, most of the people at which haven't got much of a clue either. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoreschi_31bb.html" title="User:Moreschi">Moreschi</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_recordings_a333.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested recordings">Request a recording?</a></sup> 15:30, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree. All I ever hear of the AMA is a litany of complaints from hard-working administrators and abitrators and I know for a fact that some people I wouldn't trust to know their arse from their elbow act as Advocates. After that blunt message Raul654 issued them with they seem to have tried their hand at reform but it doesn't seem to have gone anywhere.

<dd>(EC)I really didn't see any evidence of trolling here, just that the user was frustrated and really didn't know what to do next. I had an advocate myself when I was new here and was involved for the first time on a content dispute, and the process was very helpful. The only reason I hadn't talked to Kingboyk sooner was that I hadn't determined for myself what was going on, in hindsight, it probably would've been a better idea to do so sooner. A lot of the time, though, newer users can become frustrated when they don't know the processes and policies as well as the experienced users they may be dealing with. In many cases, it can be helpful to have someone there to say "Hey, here's what your options are," and to provide some advice if they're not sure if something is acceptable or not. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../s/e/r/User_talk%7ESeraphimblade_c110.html" title="User talk:Seraphimblade">Talk to me</a></sup></small> 15:42, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(EC)Dev920, Moreschi, I actually think that this case is exactly what the AMA is best at. A novice user was frustrated by a deletion. AMA explained his options, and he cooled down and solved his problem. AMA is at its best when a frustrated user has someone "on his side" explain that the best way to solve his problem is to cool down, and explaining the Wiki policies and procedures that are in place. You might be able to achieve something similar with a <a href="../../../h/e/l/Wikipedia%7EHelp_desk_5342.html" title="Wikipedia:Help desk">Help desk</a>-style group question and answer session, but I think it would take more thought than MfD is likely to bring to the problem. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheronJ_75b8.html" title="User:TheronJ">TheronJ</a> 15:46, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It's something the help desk could have done, and in the end I was my own "advocate" really as I had to chase around to find out what the hell was going on. Not a particularly satisfying experience, even if <i>some</i> good came out of it :). (The "good" being I userfied a crappy list ;)). It would nonetheless be interesting to hear about any truly useful work this group have done (not a loaded request - surprise me!) --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 15:48, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Or we could look at fixing the system. Unlike Esperanza, AMA *does* potentially fulfill a useful role. I'm dreadfully overextended at the moment.

<dd>(EC) Well, I did another quite lengthy case with <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuturebird_4da8.html" title="User:Futurebird">User:Futurebird</a>, who was involved in the <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_and_intelligence.html" title="Race and intelligence">Race and intelligence</a> article and getting quite frustrated with a content dispute there. That's now cooled off by quite a few degrees and is in mediation. I already mentioned the case I was on the other end of, where I got quite a bit of help and good advice. In this case, yes, the request could've probably been handled just fine by the help desk, but some of them are a bit more complex, and a one-on-one discussion as the situation evolves is more helpful than repeated requests to the help desk where the person answering today may not have any idea what the situation was yesterday, or has to go look back through the whole thing. I think it also is helpful to develop a one-on-one relationship in such cases, so that if you tell someone "Look, that really would be a bad idea", they'll probably listen. I don't disagree that problems exist or reform is needed, but I think it certainly has the potential to be useful and helpful, and in many cases has been. (Remember also selection bias in reporting-it'll be the bad cases that tend to get reported, the ones that end well are likely to also end quietly.) And in reply to Moreschi, I've more than once set a user straight-that <i>should</i> be part of the process. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../s/e/r/User_talk%7ESeraphimblade_c110.html" title="User talk:Seraphimblade">Talk to me</a></sup></small> 15:56, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This statement: <i>Advocates are the closest thing to lawyers on Wikipedia...</i> is a little disturbing to me. Even though they make some effort to reduce editors coming to the page looking for wikilawyers it's all a little legal eagle for me. Seems like all this can be done via help desk and mediation, without the coordinators, deputy coordinators, filings and refilings. Seems a little Concordia/Esperanza-like to me...a self governed sub-group working within Wikipedia replicating functions already in place. And: <i>The AMA is an independent association and is not subject to any committees or other external controls</i>?? <a href="../../../r/x/_/User%7ERx_StrangeLove_2537.html" title="User:Rx StrangeLove">RxS</a> 15:57, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Indeed. Kim is right in that AMA has the potential to fulfil a need on Wikipedia that requires slightly more thought and attention than the Help desk, but it seems to be miring itself in it's own self-importance and a sense of wikilawyering, not to mention bureaucracy. Why, for example, does every request for assistance require a page and form to be filled out?

<dd>I don't think we actually have a problem with a morass of policies. The <a href="../../../f/i/v/Wikipedia%7EFive_pillars_e0d5.html" title="Wikipedia:Five pillars">five pillars</a> pretty much sum it all up, and anyone who can't grasp the importance of verifiability, neutrality, free content, civility and that Wikipedia is not a bureaucracy with a few minutes of reading shouldn't try to write an encyclopaedia. If there is a morass which requires experience to navigate, it's the numerous organisations and pages which have grown up around them. For example, Esperanza, Concordia, the personal attack intervention noticeboard, and, yes, the AMA itself. The AMA is part of the problem, and shutting it down, just as the three I just mentioned were shut down, is part of the solution. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 23:10, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I tend to keep away from MFD. If people were really being that silly, I might need to start patrolling. &lt;sigh&gt; I do know about the Esperanza MFDs. In the end the Esperanza people themselves pulled the trigger, so I couldn't do much about that one. But it's still silly, you can just freely apply historic and rejected without using an MFD. If you think AMA is dead, apply the relevant tags there now! :-) --<a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> 17:37, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That is indeed incorrect. MFD is for deleting pages. Systems like AMA have a very long history, and if discontinued, they should not be deleted, but rather marked as historical, as a matter of policy and expedience (this is not something you can vote for). The MFDs for esperanza were very flawed indeed, and in fact didn't lead to the outcomes most people desired, because they didn't understand this.</p>

<dd>I disagree on both points. An XFD that does not end in deletion doesn't need to run at all, because all other actions can be done by non-admins based on plain consensus.

<li>AMA is an admirable aim, atrociously badly implemented. And that really is no disrespect to the people who have tried hard to make it not suck, but in the end it's a place where disgruntled trolls, POV-pushers and other assorted ne'er-do-well's, along of course with the occasional bitten newbie, go to find allies. Every single time AMA has become involved in a case where I have had any kind of involvement at all, it has been an unmitigated disaster. The least problematic was the advocate who took the case and then did nothing for months, leaving the argument on slow burn on the AMA request until it was finally closed as a waste of time. Another case saw a troll given help and support in his trolling, to the point where a deleted article was restored to his userspace, to much crowing and glee, where it then sat untouched for months before being quietly deleted again as an end-run around deletion policy. ArbCom have commented that AMA have actively hindered people's attempts to get cases reviewed. I have seen users whose advocates were so obnoxious that the review was immediately closed and a ban not lifted or softened to an editing restriction, when that would almost certainly have been acceptable to all parties in the original dispute. AMA sucks. Well-meaning people have expended much effort to make it not suck, b ut still it sucks. My especial commiserations to Kim, who I hold in high regard, but really we need to think of a better idea than this. Too bureaucratic, too much inclined to encourage Wikilawyering, not least through its name, too little genuine oversight and input from others (that's us, by the way) because the users who end up there are almost always the people we would not consider much of a loss. Please, please expend some of our creative energies coming up with a better system for helping bitten newbies, people who come to OTRS, the webmaster of deathcamps.org and so many others whose first foray into Wikipedia quickly ends up with escalating blocks and bans. We need a system which would have helped Ilena avoid a ban. We need a system which would have actually <i>helped</i> Nobs01 rather than resulting in his band being extended by another year (not sure if that was AMA, but we need a system). Something different, lighter, clueful. Something Jeff Raymond can help out with. A place where we can be kind but firm in educating people who have not yet got the plot.

<dd>To be completely clear, I have no problem at all with any of the people who have given time, energy and thought to the AMA. I have said all along, it is an entirely worthy idea, it just... doesn't work, often through no fault of the AMA members.</dd>
<dd>Design a system? That will take many people a long time. Here are some of the features I think a good replacement would have:
<ul>
<li>The right name. The name should imply that it is a help function, there to help people resolve a problem or understand this confusing new place. A lot like adopt-a-member.</li>
<li>A bar to entry, and coaching / mentoring for new starts.</li>
<li>The right culture. A culture where CyclePat can actually <i>help</i> rather than charging around like a bull in a china shop making a bad situation worse. So: jobs for enthusiastic people to do, jobs for calm and thoughtful people to do, and a group of people imbued with the elusive Clue to match requests to skills.</li>
<li>The willingess to tell people that the problem is them, not The System. When an article has been deleted five times and reviewed to the far side of the galaxy and back, the very <i>last</i> thing we need is another venue for the terminally quixotic to get their hopes up.</li>
<li>A complete absence of people who are joining up in the hope of changing The System. Some projects attract malcontents looking to kick back. They have no part of the process of helping people with problems.</li>
<li>Plenty of peer-review. The admin noticeboard works well because people bring things here for review, even quite uncontroversial things. Problems happen when people work in isolation.</li>
</ul>

<dd>Please, no more bureaucracy. Our support network is big enough as it is to the point where we're finally managing to prune it down after several years where we had no real way of dealing with exponentially breeding process. We should be focused on getting rid of the excess mini-bureaucracies, and have the guts to realise that doing so is a success, instead of acting like being unable to replace them with a different bureaucracy is a failure. Users seeking help have the Help Desk, the Village Pump, here, and probably a few other relevant pages, and it comes down to the fact that there is only so much help you can give people before you realise that material added to the encyclopaedia should stand up on its own merits as verified and neutral - which means that an organisation which is designed to take the side of someone adding material which doesn't stand up is a Bad Idea(tm).

<dd>Personally, I think the best model would be to have a desk similar to the help desk but intended for more in-depth inquiries ("This admin has done this. Why has he done this and what can I do?" which seems to be the majority of valid work that AMA does). Maybe name it Complex Help desk or Requests for Investigation (Requests for Reflection?). It would present most users with the options they have and reduce any resemblance of lawyering, while in relaity performing the function most solicitors do.

<dd>True, but in practice I see two problems. First, WP:AN(/I) can be intimidating for the new editor. The name <i>sounds</i> intimidating. A novice may have no idea that non-admins are even allowed to post here. AN(/I) are huge, high traffic, rapid-turnover pages; novices probably even have some difficulty finding and following a threaded discussion. Also, a new editor who has gotten into some sort of trouble (run afoul of 3RR, been warned about a conflict of interest, or just got stuck in some sort of personality conflict) may be fresh off of a warning (or block) from an admin, and may not necessarily want to go looking for more admin attention—at least not directly.</dd>
<dd>The second problem is that a lot of new editors just don't know <i>how</i> to assemble what Sam (reasonably) describes as a good question. They've just been warned/blocked; they're hot under the collar; they don't know how to link to a diff; they may not even be able to figure out who blocked them; they may want to explain in minute detail all of the BLP/COI/POV/etc. issues surrounding the article they've just created/edited/fought over/seen deleted.</dd>
<dd>I don't know what the solution to these problems is. It almost seems like it could be an extension of the standard Help Desk. ("I have Problem X. What do I do?" "You need to post a polite request for Y at WP:Z. If you require assistance with that, please stay on the line...") <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 02:40, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Sorry for the section break, but Firefox is truncating text areas. Seraphimblade, thanks for starting the draft. I wonder, however, if the help desk could simply supersede the AMA.

<dd>I think, in a lot of cases, a referral to the help desk might be the exact way to go. Where I've seen AMA be effective, though, is where a user might need more than one-time help (content disputes, things like that), and someone working one-on-one with them who knows the situation in context and can develop a rapport can be more effective than a different person potentially answering every time (and flooding the help desk). If something could be worked into the help desk for longer-term one-on-one assistance, that may be a good solution. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../s/e/r/User_talk%7ESeraphimblade_c110.html" title="User talk:Seraphimblade">Talk to me</a></sup></small> 06:24, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>OK. So... I chose to notify the recently active members of the project that is up for deletion, so that they could be aware of a discussion directly affecting that project. That's a partisan audience. Who else should I notify? If I notify people not involved in AMA, that would be cross-posting. So basically... WP:CANVASS, which doesn't really seem to have <i>project</i> deletion in mind anyway, makes it disruptive for me to notify the members of the project that the project is up for deletion. Is that a positive situation? - <a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithTyler_1a57.html" title="User:KeithTyler">Keith D.

<li>Anyone? WP:CANVASS makes it impossible to notify members of a project that that project is up for deletion? Or does the fact that each member I contacted had recently edited <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssociation_of_Members%27_Advocates_Members_8a88.html" title="Wikipedia:Association of Members' Advocates/Members">the AMA members page</a> and have "Available" listed on their contact listing cover this action under the "friendly notice" section of WP:CANVASS? Or is it not fair to presume that active members of a project who declare their availability want to be notified about the project?

<li><a href="../../../r/b/i/WP%7ERBI_37b3.html" title="WP:RBI">WP:RBI</a>. Greg Kohs has only one agenda: his own personal gain. He is very <i>very</i> keen to use Wikipedia for this end, especially if he can "prove" that Jimbo was wrong to boot him in the first place. Problem is, he thinks Wikipedia is a failure as a business directory because we don't allow subjects to have editorial control. He also doesn't see a problem with conflict of interest. He also keeps coming back even though he is banned. Not just blocked, banned. If he wants back, he can go to ArbCom and get unbanned. Until that happens, he is a banned person. And yes I know that has uncomfortable overtones of Apartheid South Africa, and you know something? I don't care, not in this case. We have heard what Kohs has to say, he has said it at length many times, we have no need to allow him to evade his ban yet again in order to repeat it. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 21:19, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Under the circumstances, since he accuses me of defamation, I defer to uninvolved administrators to reach that decision and implement it. I wish to avoid any appearance of impropriety. BTW Jimbo unbanned him so he does have a right to edit unless someone decides his comments have crossed the line of indef blockable threats. Based on an e-mail I received a while back from Jimbo I think we can trust that this editor has actually been unbanned. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></font></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charge!</a></i></sup> 21:25, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Among the many people that get banned and keep trying to come back, some are ambiguous cases which may merit consideration as to whether they might be productive contributors if allowed back. Kohs/MyWikiBiz is not one of them. He really, really isn't. Kohs, in my opinion, would be unable to work with other Wikipedians even if he wasn't being paid to write articles. Kohs is welcome to take his story to the media, who will surely be only too glad to have something to run other than those deathly dull and unimportant pieces about the diplomatic crisis between Britain and Iran, the outbreak of peace in Northern Ireland, and the moider of a team coach during an international sporting championship, but if that happens it's above our heads anyway. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 22:47, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Same here. He just doesn't get it. That does not make him a bad person, not everybody has to get the Wikipedia religion, but anybody who wants to edit has to accept the policies and cultural mores of the project - which Kohs does not. Add to that a generous dose of block-evasion with sockpuppets, including promoting his own for-pay project to authors of soon-to-be-deleted articles, and you have a persistent abuser we can do without. I'm sure Kohs is a really nice guy and good to his mother, but he is an unmitigated nuisance on Wikipedia. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 08:42, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

Kohs seems to have edited his post on the Wikipedia Review so that instead of it saying "heterosexual spouses" it now says "lovely spouses". And, really, in reading his whole post, it's pretty clear he was just trying to make a joke that "Wikipedians are gay". Lame, yes. But, certainly not grounds for calling him a homophobe.

<p>I will try to keep this short an simple.</p>
<p>There has been a hot button topic concerning the use of an image on the <a href="../../../e/j/a/Ejaculation.html" title="Ejaculation">Ejaculation</a> article for some 3 months now. It has come down to nothing more than trolling on part of one user who will not concede that the consensus does not support his selection. The image has survived <a href="../../../i/f/d/WP%7EIFD_bb01.html" title="WP:IFD">WP:IFD</a> but the results of that issue have lead to the image being <a href="../../../p/u/i/WP%7EPUI_d69d.html" title="WP:PUI">WP:PUI</a>. The user periodically reverts the image with comments like "[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ejaculation&amp;diff=115912741&amp;oldid=115770465" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ejaculation&amp;diff=115912741&amp;oldid=115770465" rel="nofollow">Went back to consensus image to avoid controversy</a>]". The "controversy" finally died down and the user stopped reverting the image replacement for a period of weeks, during which time the user also ceased to participate in the discussions. During this time the replacement image remained in place without any major incidents. The user popped up a few days ago to started reverting again declaring things like "[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ejaculation&amp;diff=118078548&amp;oldid=118078244" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ejaculation&amp;diff=118078548&amp;oldid=118078244" rel="nofollow">Return consensus image - correct one</a>]" and "[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ejaculation&amp;diff=118397067&amp;oldid=118378721" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ejaculation&amp;diff=118397067&amp;oldid=118378721" rel="nofollow">Return image that was removed for some unknown reason.</a>]" I reverted this undiscussed changes the past two times, noting that this user did not hold the consensus, but he's not stopping. Please review the [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ejaculation&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ejaculation&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">History</a>] and <a href="../../../e/j/a/Talk%7EEjaculation_43be.html" title="Talk:Ejaculation">Talk:Ejaculation</a>.

These shenanigans have been going on way too long. I even left Wikipedia for a time from having to contend with this users contentious and disingenuous attitude.</p>
<p>I am not asking for a dispute resolution, I am asking for intervention with the revert war. It's wasting a lot of peoples time at this point, and <a href="../../../a/t/o/User%7EAtomaton_fe94.html" title="User:Atomaton">User:Atomaton</a> does not strike me that he has any intention to stop. -- <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoseph_S_Atkinson_b94d.html" title="User:Joseph S Atkinson">jsa</a> 16:10, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>From over here it looks like there's been a concerted effort to censor Wikipedia, and when XfDs fail to get consensus (or the consensus is "keep") then the proposed deletions are done anyway. I ran into the fringes of this when templates {{<a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENotcensored_5c46.html" title="Template:Notcensored">notcensored</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENotcensored2_396c.html" title="Template:Notcensored2">notcensored2</a>}} were TfD'd, did NOT get a consensus to delete, and the TfD's proponent simply went back later and blanked out the text from {{<a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENotcensored2_396c.html" title="Template:Notcensored2">notcensored2</a>}} that he'd objected to in the TfD.

<dd>These templates are still huge. For instance on <a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghanistan.html" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> the template occupies about a paragraph-worth of space. It would probably help if the box were removed, and the image. Then the template could read something like:</dd>

All the ones in there as of this post are used in at least one article (and a few *might* have some good Fair Use rationale, so I was light on the trigger with them).

<dd>For those seeking the removal of the automatic CSD-I3 notification licence selector, please note that a good proportion of the deleted images are immediately uploaded again, only this time with a preposterous free licence that requires slow deletion.</dd>
<dd>If the option was removed, I think about 90% of deletable images would simply be wrongly licensed instead - far harder to sort out as users will go to their deaths claiming they actually took that professional and watermarked picture of someone who died before they were born and <b>how dare we</b> suggest they are lying?!??!!? and so forth. Better that they volunteer to be slaughtered than be dragged into the abattoir.</dd>
<dd>By the way, for those shy of doing it, the deletion job is boring but easy - I do about 500 a day at the moment, just with tabbed browsing and a neat little "<a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_Your_image_30f2.html" title="User:Redvers/Your image">why this was deleted</a>" clickable edit summary for both the image and the removal from the article.

<p>I don't see what's the big idea about deleting invalid license images even if they aren't orphaned. Those redlinks will be cleaned up eventually. Better to get rid of the bad image now than keep it around longer. No harm can come from having red image links. Harm <i>can</i> come from continuing to post an image past when it's been identified as bad. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 00:55, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Before I could get on to reporting these two users, you probably should know who Danny Daniel is. Danny Daniel is a user who vandalized pages related My Gym Partner's a Monkey and Zatch Bell!. His confirmed sockpuppets like to create hoaxes and vandalise articles related to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Fairly_OddParents_90b9.html" title="The Fairly OddParents">The Fairly OddParents</a>, <a href="../../../m/y/_/My_Gym_Partner%27s_a_Monkey_1e4d.html" title="My Gym Partner's a Monkey">My Gym Partner's a Monkey</a>, <a href="../../../f/o/s/Foster%27s_Home_for_Imaginary_Friends_4c3c.html" title="Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends">Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/-/Re-Animated_5392.html" title="Re-Animated">Re-Animated</a> and anything related to anime. He created a hoax article called Monk (Cartoon Network). All of this would eventually get him blocked indefinitely for vandalism on December 21, 2006. See this <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_checkuser_Case_Danny_Daniel_17aa.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Danny Daniel">Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Danny Daniel</a> for more information about this vandal.</p>
<p>I already notified <a href="../../../p/e/r/User_talk%7EPersian_Poet_Gal_f352.html" title="User talk:Persian Poet Gal">User talk:Persian Poet Gal</a> about this, but she says that she can't log on right now, so I decided to report this here. Anyways, I found two possible sockpuppets of Danny Daniel. They are <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChoolabuuulba_96f1.html" title="User:Choolabuuulba">Choolabuuulba</a> (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Choolabuuulba_7cd8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Choolabuuulba">contribs</a>) and <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBooooomerang_0580.html" title="User:Booooomerang">Booooomerang</a> (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Booooomerang_3dc2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Booooomerang">contribs</a>). Both of these accounts have similar editing patterns to that indefinitely blocked user. In fact, Choolabuulba even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Astro_Jam&amp;diff=119131468&amp;oldid=118384000" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Astro_Jam&amp;diff=119131468&amp;oldid=118384000" rel="nofollow">edited</a> a page created by Booooomerang adding on to the hoax with more misinformation and lies.

Both seem to be vandal-only accounts. To top it all off, Boooomerang has created a hoax page called Jeanie Meanie Minnie Mo. Note how it seems to relate to the television shows <i>The Fairly OddParents</i>, <i>Ed, Edd n Eddy</i> (see the parts about Jib), and <i>Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends</i>. Danny Daniel's sockpuppets seem to "like" creating hoaxes like that.</p>

<p>A little over a year ago, the account <a href="../../../u/s/s/User%7EUSSTRATCOM_PAO_2235.html" title="User:USSTRATCOM PAO">USSTRATCOM PAO</a> (<a href="../../../u/s/s/User_talk%7EUSSTRATCOM_PAO_68c4.html" title="User talk:USSTRATCOM PAO">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_USSTRATCOM_PAO_1750.html" title="Special:Contributions/USSTRATCOM PAO">contribs</a>) joined us and claims to be a <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Role_account" class="extiw" title="m:Role_account">m:Role account</a> for the United States Military's public affairs office. Two months ago I asked the user to <a href="../../../u/s/s/User_talk%7EUSSTRATCOM_PAO_68c4.html#Role_Account" title="User talk:USSTRATCOM PAO">submit an OTRS ticket</a> to verify the account.

<dd>No, Illythr. I still remember the edit wars that drove me off Transnistria-related pages. Patronizing editors supporting one another, and all socks of Mauco, and accusing all opposing editors of uncivility, vandalism, a.s.o.. I know it's not even important from a WP POV, but I also have to mention the availability of Mauco and his puppets to POV-push on those pages. It is only just that such aggressive political operatives are drove off wikipedia. Some guy below talked about <a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBonaparte_0e16.html" title="User:Bonaparte">User:Bonaparte</a>, but Mauco is worse. For Bonaparte, the behavior started with clear conflicts which evolved into blocks and then sockpuppetry to evade the blocks. Here, it appears that Mauco started to use socks out of pure malice. Not even the necessity (for a wikipediholic) to evade a block. This is nasty.

Even as his opponent, surely, you would agree that Mauco is not stupid. Oh yeah, and I don't believe in malice. There always is a goal.

<dd>Are you saying that Mauco is innocent of <b>all</b> puppeteering? I agree someone impersonated Mauco after his block, which is plain dumb. But Mauco still is a puppet master. We are talking here of puppet masters blaming one another. What I am saying here is that Mauco is guilty.

<dd>I am a little surprised that this set-up has been taken so seriously. Mauco is too smart to create a sock based on his name to vandalize articles (as is the average ten-year-old). He had nothing to gain by edits made by these socks; however, due to his ability to compellingly defend his views (not an endorsement) and his extensive knowledge on a controversial subject (Transnistria), someone with little to lose (see below) saw an opportunity and took a shot. I hope it doesn't work.<br /></dd>

<dd>Although I have not been very active lately and cannot judge all of the recent events, I do not believe that <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaucoWilliamPernambuco_af02.html" title="User:MaucoWilliamPernambuco">User:MaucoWilliamPernambuco</a> is <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Mauco_97a3.html" title="User:William Mauco">User:William Mauco</a>. Having worked with Mauco for a little over seven months, I have a pretty good idea of his issues and his style. I created an article <a href="../../../p/r/i/Pridnestrovian_Moldavian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic_8cd7.html" title="Pridnestrovian Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic">Pridnestrovian Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic</a> which was vandalized by <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaucoWilliamPernambuco_af02.html" title="User:MaucoWilliamPernambuco">User:MaucoWilliamPernambuco</a> earlier today. Specifically, the sock changed the official languages from Moldovan/Ukranian/Russian to just Russian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pridnestrovian_Moldavian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic&amp;curid=8695654&amp;diff=119476025&amp;oldid=119475828" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pridnestrovian_Moldavian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic&amp;curid=8695654&amp;diff=119476025&amp;oldid=119475828" rel="nofollow">[68]</a>. This is not consistant with Mauco who attempts to frame the PMSSR and its "quasi-state" successor (Kolsto, 2006), the PMR, as a tolerant multinational (or "internationalist") counterpoint to the supposedly "nationalist" government in Moldova proper during the civil war. It <i>is</i> consistent, however, with banned puppet master <a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBonaparte_0e16.html" title="User:Bonaparte">User:Bonaparte</a>'s attacks on Mauco. Bonaparte and others attempt to paint Mauco as a Russian nationalist and FSB-paid apologist. While Mauco would not make <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pridnestrovian_Moldavian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic&amp;curid=8695654&amp;diff=119476025&amp;oldid=119475828" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pridnestrovian_Moldavian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic&amp;curid=8695654&amp;diff=119476025&amp;oldid=119475828" rel="nofollow">this</a> edit, this is exactly what Bonaparte impersonating Mauco would do. Unless there is some other overwhelming evidence of which I am not aware, I ask that this be taken into consideration with regard to the indefinite block of <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Mauco_97a3.html" title="User:William Mauco">User:William Mauco</a>.

<dd>If it is decided to ban him indefinitely for socks that are his, that is fair enough. However, I just want to be clear that some of these socks are <i>not</i> his. Specifically, it looks like he was banned indefinitely for the behavior of socks regarding which there is clearly some doubt. My post above explains my thoughts on at least one of the socks and the others have been found to be from different IPs.

<dd>Given doubts raised by <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">Khoikhoi</a> and the Checkuser, I've set the block back to 2 months. (Of course, that previous block for proven abusive sockpuppetry will still apply.) However, I've still got my doubts, and this had best not happen again. In any case, there's one easy way to keep from being thought of as an abusive sock puppet master-don't abusively use socks in the first place. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../s/e/r/User_talk%7ESeraphimblade_c110.html" title="User talk:Seraphimblade">Talk to me</a></sup></small> 18:32, 1 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I would also say that Mauco is not a simple vandal, and that he didn't use his sock puppets to vandalize, but to push his POV in some articles. Personally, I judge him much worse than I judge most vandals because he wasted more contributors’ time.

<dd>I have to second Dl.goe, especially as Mauco has a history of accusing individuals of sock-puppetry and meat-puppetry as soon as more than one person disagrees with his (blatant) POV pushing. (His behavior in this regard having driven away at least one reputable contributor.) There is a word one uses for people who accuse others of behavior they engage in themselves: <u>hypocrite</u>. This sort of POV-pushing cottage industry tactic must not be tolerated.<span style="font-size:9pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"> —  <a href="../../../v/e/c/User%7EVecrumba_0507.html" title="User:Vecrumba">Pēters J.

<dl>
<dd>And I should mention that Mauco is self-professed associated with the International Council for Democratic Institutions and State Sovereignty (ICDISS), having indicated to journalist Edward Lucas he attended their first conference. The ICDISS is a front for pro-PMR interests having nothing to do with "democracy." So he has been pushing a particular POV <u>for special interests</u> from day one. <a href="http://edwardlucas.blogspot.com/2006/08/gotcha-2.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://edwardlucas.blogspot.com/2006/08/gotcha-2.html" rel="nofollow">[69]</a></dd>
<dd>     I have always been prepared from day one to debate Mauco on the facts--along with the other obvious POV pushers, for example, Mark Street, editor of the "Tiraspol Times". One can only unmask propaganda by debating the facts. But this sort of intellectually insulting hypocrisy (Pernambuco, for months) crosses the line.<span style="font-size:9pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"> —  <a href="../../../v/e/c/User%7EVecrumba_0507.html" title="User:Vecrumba">Pēters J.

<dd>I think that provided the page you wish to move <i>to</i> exists only as a redirect to the page you're moving, it should be possible.

<dd>I have tried to revert such page moves, but the movers' contribution logs no longer have the links to undo such moves. For instance, Page A is moved to the previous non-existant title of Page B and Page A is not edited after it has automatically become a redirect. I cannot undo such a move. <a href="../../../c/f/v/User%7ECfvh_2f59.html" title="User:Cfvh">Charles</a> 21:27, 1 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Even if the page exists as a redirect, but has a page history, it won't let you move it.

<dd>I don't think that's the same case. For instance, I moved <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Maximillian_von_Horn_of_Hornes_bafb.html" title="Prince Maximillian von Horn of Hornes">Prince Maximillian von Horn of Hornes</a> to <a href="../../../m/a/x/Maximilian%2C_Prince_of_Hornes_4701.html" title="Maximilian, Prince of Hornes">Maximilian, Prince of Hornes</a>, the latter of which was previously non-existant. The title from which it was moved automatically became a redirect and has not subsequently been edited. I should be able to revert such a move (I wouldn't, but it only serves as an example), but I cannot (the function doesn't even appear there anymore). This is leading me to believe that there is an error of some sort. Have I possibly had my revert privileges revoked? <a href="../../../c/f/v/User%7ECfvh_2f59.html" title="User:Cfvh">Charles</a> 21:44, 1 April 2007 (UTC)

<p>I've been contacted by a user who's found themselves indefinitely blocked as a sockpuppet. The checkuser report is <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_checkuser_Case_Wiki_Raja_7b84.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Wiki Raja">here</a>. None of the three third-party responses made there seems to support a ban; instead, there is a query, a decline and an inconclusive. I'd appreciate any advice as to whether or not this indefinite block is unwarranted. Thanks, <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Kernow_9a2b.html" title="User:David Kernow">David Kernow</a> <span style="font-size:90%;"><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_Kernow_cdd2.html" title="User talk:David Kernow">(talk)</a></span> 00:43, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've not looked at the edits, but if someone familiar with the contributions notices similarities with the edits, the checkuser evidence shows they're all coming from the same IP address, so even an inconclusive CU report can make a suspected case stronger as it can show whether the accounts are editing from the same location at the same time etc. <span style="font-size:95%">-- <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_55c2.html" title="User:Nick"><font color="red"><b>Nick</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENick_00ef.html" title="User talk:Nick"><font color="blue"><b>t</b></font></a></sup></span> 00:54, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for your response, Nick. I think the crucial distinction in this case might be the "at the same time" requirement. The user looks to've had their <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrancroos_db6f.html" title="User:Indrancroos">first account</a> blocked for three months at the end of September last year, at which point they began editing under a <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWiki_Raja_d537.html" title="User:Wiki Raja">second account</a> and did not return to their first account once its three-month block had expired (at the end of December). So I'm not sure whether their current (second) account warrants the indefinite block it's just received...?

<p>I don't see the problem with April fools jokes so long as they stay out of the main namespace and are cleaned up by 2 April.  : ) Or are we only talking about the ones that occur in the main namespace? — <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmedblowfish_0e51.html" title="User:Armedblowfish">Armed Blowfish</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/m/User_talk%7EArmedblowfish_5587.html" title="User talk:Armedblowfish">talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Armedblowfish_d1c9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Armedblowfish">mail</a>) 21:40, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>1. Keep it out of the main namespace. 2. Keep it nice: no racist, sexist, etc. jokes. 3. If it has the potential to disrupt the wiki process if people take it seriously, include an invisible comment like this: &lt;!-- This is a joke. Please do not take it seriously.

<dd>MIght I point out that the relevant policy frowns on overly long sigs (not sure what he ones refactored were) and this page states at the stop that signatures with heavy coding may be refactored to help readability. <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViridae_a0d4.html" title="User:Viridae">Viridae</a><a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViridae_b84f.html" title="User talk:Viridae"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 13:17, 1 April 2007 (UTC)
