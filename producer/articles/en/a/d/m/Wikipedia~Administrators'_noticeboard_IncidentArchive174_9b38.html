<p>Look dude, what do you think readers will conclude? A user who slander an entire people in every given occasion and dump materials from a known racist website and use it as sole source in one side, and another user who slander that member in particular? Regardless of the policies here? As for personal attacks. Did you see me on this page slandering other Turks? I am even having good relations with Lutherian. Regarding Rauf Orbay, yes! I did not answer you, and for a simple reason, the guy was accused to destroy large junk of materials involving him in the massacres, his aubiography itself is full of praise of the Kemalistic regime and the accusations about him being a traitor have been cleaned up, including by the republic of Turkey. So him being a traitor and wanting to make up things allegedly said by Ataturk is your oppinion. You are not forced to believe him. But I fail to see why someone who was accused of destroying records of the destruction of the Armenians will make up thing to support a position which evidences bringing to it, he has destroyed? Comming back to neurobio? Someone who calls this article trash and hasn't any respect to the entire project which he calls in his namespace a made house, could only be here for a single reason, which he is so good at, that is, slinging here back and forth what he could use as immunition from the website tallarmeniantale. <i>Fad</i> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 01:45, 8 January 2007 (UTC) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Armenian_Genocide&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=99226734" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Armenian_Genocide&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=99226734" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<dd>First of all, I goofed in making this report (see strikethrough); for once -- just once -- this person added a legit link.

<p>I bet we could make a good case for spam blacklisting it. Thats less disruptive than blocking all those various ips or semiprotecting Jerky (food).

<dd>I have to agree with Zoel on this. The user name is not only offensive, but promotes an offensive POV. I don't think Wikipedia is the place for coded references to White Power.

<dd>Aryan may be a common name in India, but the user is behaving very intolerant and abusive of other people's ethnicities and heritage. Regardless of whether Dravidians and Ino-Aryans are from the same country or not, does not give one the right to put down the others ethnicity and harrass them. A combination of <a href="../../../a/r/y/User%7EARYAN818_b489.html" title="User:ARYAN818">user:ARYAN818</a>'s user name and his attitude is not helping either.

<p>I have asked for an explanation of the 818 portion of the name on the User's Talk page. If the explanation is not forthcoming, or is not believable, he will be blocked.

<dd>I have difficulty understanding the user's stance here. If someone told me that the combination of my name and my postcode could be interpreted as a racist remark, I'd ask a 'crat to change it straight away. It wouldn't matter that its my name and postcope and I meant no offense. I just wouldn't want to take then risk of people <i>thinking</i> I was trying to be offensive. There seems to be a view that objecting to a username is equivalent to violating <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, it isn't. The 'oh, it means something in another language' shouldn't be a valid response. If my name meant 'kill all ginger haired people' in another language, it would be inappropriate to use in an international project.

<p>I've already deleted twice an article I wrote. The bot has already undeleted it once. It's obvious that the bot can't tell when an author deletes his own work. The article is Analisis de imagenes=Imagery analysis. I made the mistake of writing the article in the wrong version of wikipedia, and have already started the process of translating and introducing the article into the spanish edition.<a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadical_man_7_4145.html" title="User:Radical man 7">Radical man 7</a> 20:45, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>That's not a flaw. It's quite deliberate. You did not delete the article, you just blanked it, which leaves an empty shell. We do not want empty, blank articles left lying around. The proper method for what you want to do is add a tag at the top of the article that says <b>{{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-author_8ff7.html" title="Template:Db-author">db-author</a>}}</b>. This is the code for "Author requests deletion" so an admin can actually delete the article properly. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 20:59, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Just a quick comment - this sort of thing would be far less frequent if the current definition of G7 on <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> were brought up to date. As it stands, it implies that an author only has to blank a page to request deletion. I feel that this needs to be changed to make it clear that authors <i>must</i> use {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-author_8ff7.html" title="Template:Db-author">db-author</a>}} to get an article G7'd. <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 21:14, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thats not always the way it is used though.

<li>IME pages are usually blanked by new editors with no knowledge whatsoever of deletion criteria, like the one above who thought blanking and deleting were the same. The wording at <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#G7" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD#G7</a> does primarily say the author should request deletion. The note at the end simply says we can interpret blanking as a deletion request. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 18:30, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Not quite.

I see you've already created a seperate article for <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indoor_American_Football_eb94.html" title="Indoor American Football">Indoor American Football</a> (note improper capitalization) as well.

<p>Someone from the IP address 129.33.49.251 repeatedly adds the following notice to <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patriarch_Alexius_II_6dbc.html" title="Patriarch Alexius II">Patriarch Alexius II</a> and doesn't provide references to his/her statements:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is necessary, however, to mention that both of these individuals are very politicized liberal figures in Russia (Gleb Yakunin being a defrocked priest in view of his political activity, forbidden for Orthodox clergy, and Evgenia Albats being a prominent critic of all things that are traditionally Russian.) Therefore, there is no credibility to their "reports" as they are not independent observers but in fact are quite strongly agitated ideologically against Russia and, unfortunately, the Orthodox Church.</p>
<p>Given these facts, it is safe to conclude that there is no credible evidence to back up this allegation.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> This is a gentle reminder to Wikipedia that this article in its present form contains material slanderous without any proof of a public and very respected persona.

<p>I'd better put this under a new section. Based on <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">Guy's</a> post above and the subsequent diffs, which do check out, I've left him an imminent block warning for incivility. It's the dead of night in his part of the world right now and he hasn't edited since, so I'll wait for him to log on and respond, but basically what I've said is that I'll block him for uncivil statements he's already posted unless he strikes through certain comments or pledges to clean up his language. I've never blocked an admin before - much less one I respect as much as him - but it would be a double standard if I overlooked this evidence. I welcome the feedback of other users regarding this decision.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:JzG&amp;diff=98568695&amp;oldid=98561491" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:JzG&amp;diff=98568695&amp;oldid=98561491" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> <font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charge</a></i></sup></font> 03:41, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I can't support such an action. While I am strongly opposed to editors (<i>especially</i> admins) making uncivil comments, I don't think that blocking is the right way to go about this; all it's going to do is create bad feelings. In this case, an apology from Guy would be suffice, provided he does not repeat his behavior. <i><a href="../../../y/u/s/User%7EYuser31415_e4ea.html" title="User:Yuser31415">Yuser31415</a></i> 03:58, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>(edit conflict)I don't see how a civility block would be anything other than punitive in Guy's case. Guy has had a sharp tongue as long as I've known him, and (1) he isn't particularly <i>more</i> likely to be uncivil in the next x hours than he is in the n hours after that, and (2) I seriously doubt that a block will cause him to change his manner of interaction.

<p>WTF? Someone has a bit of a meltdown from dealing with crap, and you threaten to block him? Instead of saying "what's going on, can I help", you threaten him? Instead of providing a support system for the people who end up having to deal with the flood of bullshit that comes their way, we use ultimatums? Sounds great - when someone is buckling under the strain, let's kick them? Durova, I must say, I am <i>deeply</i> disappointed in you.

<dd>Hi all. Not sure if I'm even allowed to post here but I found ANI to be a reasonable place so far. From the purely linguistic perspective - twit twat and twot are about the same in the context of heated discussion and certainly in common usage. But I learned English in Northumbria if you can call it English:) I do have to apologise for that in daily life quite often. Whether heated discussion or common usage are allowed from anyone on Wikipedia is still uncertain to me. I deal with it by trying to write really flat and boring in discussion. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlanBarnet_91d4.html" title="User:AlanBarnet">AlanBarnet</a> 04:43, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Guettarda has it right. I realise that it is now all the rage for admins to be the manners police, but while we're going through this phase, it would be nice to remember that blocking people who are not a threat to the project hasn't always been something we expected admins to do, and especially to do casually. I really do appreciate the fact that we're a lot quicker to block trolls and lunatics these days, but we do have a whole dispute resolution process designed for facilitating community input on the behaviour of valued contributors. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 04:55, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's more than that. Most of us don't spend much time dealing with troublesome editors. Dealing with them on the scale that Guy (and many others) do is very stressful. If someone has a few meltdowns over a couple months, then maybe it's a sign that we, as a community should be more supportive of them; seeing stuff like that the correct reaction is to say "what's wrong, how can we help" or maybe "take a break from that stuff and concentrate on what's fun". As long as our aim is to retain hardworking volunteers, the correct action is <i>never</i> to approach a good editor like a disruptive troll. If they are feeling the strain, all it does is say to them "your contribution isn't worth shit". It's most likely to exacerbate the problem. The <i>last</i> thing you want to do is come at someone with threats and ultimatums. It will almost certainly fail to produce the desired result. In addition, in general we cut trolls more slack than Durova cut Guy. Blocks are not meant to be punitive. The threats were totally out of line. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 05:13, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, he didn't. You violated AGF - maybe you should be blocked for that?? There are seven links provided above. The first one shows no incivility - he says to someone "<i>you have the brass neck to come here making demands? The short answer is: go away</i>". No one says we have to suffer fools. In the second case, there's nothing there that isn't calling a spade a spade. In the third he says "what the fuck"...oooh, my ears are burning, he used a swear word. Hmm - maybe I need to be threatened with a block for my "WFT" higher up the page. In the fourth case, he says to Fys "and I want you to fuck off". Fys has been behaving like an idiot ever since he played chicken with the arbcomm and got them to blink. He's saying "quit bugging me". Not incivil, and it's totally wrong to take it out of context. In the fifth case, again, he is using "fuck off", but seriously, calling that incivil is nothing but prudery about "the f-word". Did you miss the bit about Wikipedia not being censored for minors? And the sixth example isn't incivil, and it isn't aimed at anyone in particular so how can it be taken as anything serious? As for the word "twat" - that tempest in a teapot is nothing more than a collective failure to assume good faith. Maybe you should just block yourselves for violating AGF and be done with it. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 05:47, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(edit conflict) Guys and gals, we are not policing words (Wikipedia is not censored) we are policing personal attacks having significant venom to hurt people. For the Fuck's sake it is absolutely fuckingly acceptable to use the bloody old-English word <i>fuck</i> to emphasize an idea or an emotion. On the other hand it is absolutely unacceptable for an admin to engineer a phrase that would unnecessary hurt people even if the phrase has no colorful words and even if it does not formally violate the principle to comment on contributions not the contributors. I would dare say that in the phrase "useless twat" I am much more concerned with the word <i>useless</i> than with the word <i>twat</i>. Most of the Guy's replies here are examples of using colorful words but not personal attacks. Some might be (although I guess calling a person who delibeartely choose to behave as troll <i>useless</i> should not hurt his emotions. I guess we are better off by examining the situation more careful with Guy present rather than issuing blocks. I trust Durova to discuss it with Guy and to make a right decision. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">Alex Bakharev</a> 05:53, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Personal attacks are different from incivility. For instance, while dismissing all ideas someone comes up with saying "**** those ideas" is not a personal attack, it's certainly incivil. Similarly, I wouldn't quite say anything he did constitutes a personal attack, but it does constitute incivility. Enough to block? I don't know.

Wiki isn't a fucking haven for the fucking language Nazi's and this fucking inane proccupation with "so and so huwt my poow widdle feelings" just shows how utterly divorced from fucking reality Wiki is. Personally, I think Wiki could use a nice case of occassional whoop-ass rather than concern over whether a troll's feelings are hurt, and a nice case of reality when ideas are simply baltently fucking stupid. So, that being said, I suppose Durova will want to block me next for actually speaking my mind. Go for it, I really don't care. Wiki at its worst is simply a nattering bunch of officious, pietistic (Wiki as religion) people worried far less about the declining content of the encylopedia and worried far more about creating the equivalent of a Utopian dictatorship. Just remember, Utopia means "nowhere" and Wiki in many cases exists in a netherworld far removed from the real world. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FF2400">•Jim</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#F4C430">62</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">sch•</font></a> 14:31, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If admins are to have any authority in preventing the increasing coarseness of discourse here, we must begin with ourselves. However, as much as I respect Durova's opinion on nearly everything else, it's far too early to think about blocking. Some supportive conversation would be very nice, as would offering to shoulder some of Guy's burdens. I'd guess most admins become experts in recognizing and dealing with one or two particular trolls and/or disruptive editors (I have my share for sure). Eventually it wears you down, and I think Guy has taken on more than his share already, so maybe we should let Guy pass the baton on some of his least favorite. We should support him and lighten his load, as we should have done for MONGO months ago. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 06:13, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Nobody likes a smartass. As a matter of interest, I started an admin misconduct RFC a while ago over violations of block policy that resulted in the admin voluntarily desysopping himself after a wave of negative responses to his behavior. I'm perfectly willing to take strong action at the appropriate time. This is not yet the time for strong action. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 06:26, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Congrats to Durova for being bold, and for coming here for a san-check before acting. And agree with most of the above, blocks should be preventative, not punative. JDZ made a mistake.

<dd>Yes, well put. Where a user's only contributions are negative, a perma-block solves the problem and doesn't cost us anything. Where a user is mostly good with some bad, a perma-block solves the problem, at great cost. A temporary block applied to halt a rampage is a thing of beauty. But a punative block doesn't solve anything, and probably costs us dearly. In this case, I expect him to be sensible. If not, well, there are other options.

<p>Yes, I'm also one of the admins who puts myself on the front line in terms of dealing with difficult editors. I wouldn't retain much credibility in asking them to be civil if I were uncivil myself or if I countenanced obscene put-downs from another administrator. The strongest thing I have going for me when I handle a hard case isn't the sysop tools: it's integrity. The central question I asked myself is <i>If I saw exactly these words from an editor of equal value to the project who wasn't a sysop, what would I do?</i> It's a tough call - some of you may disagree with it - and I trust that when Guy logs on he will quickly demonstrate through his inherent good sense that most of our worries are needless. And I have to add that the accusation I've acted punitively is a bit of an <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">AGF</a> foul. I thought people knew me better than that. <font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charge</a></i></sup></font> 06:44, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am loving the argument that it's not really rude to tell someone to fuck off. I'll remember that next time someone gets on my nerves. And by the way, Guy is southern English, as I am, and we don't really use "twat" for "vulva" much. It would translate into American as a slightly milder "asshole", I suppose. It wouldn't be <i>very</i> offensive. It has more of a flavour of silliness.</p>
<p>Durova should though be supported here (although no surprises that there is practically a queue forming not to). It's <i>not</i> acceptable for admins to display behaviour that others would be blocked for. They're not above the law. And if you can't deal with twats without telling them to fuck off, maybe giving up dealing with twats would be the best approach. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 06:56, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Are punative blocks a useful way to deal with past incivility by anyone, admin or otherwise? I suspect it's like rubbing a puppies nose in 'it', useful if you can do it at the time but harmful if you do it long after the event. The message we want to send is "what you did was not acceptable." A bonus block doesn't help get that message through, IMHO, it distracts.

<dd>Exactly what in my edit was slinging mud? Do you really think that we need to discuss this three times? Would it be fair for a start? There are plenty of dispute resolution options available if Guy doesn't heed the request to cool the language down. But a block hours after the event when he isn't even logged in? Will that really help? I doubt it and I don't think that it would calm the situation down. Quite the opposite - we would have carnage if we went down that route without trying our very best to discuss the situation.

<dd>The diffs date as far back as December 1 and happened mostly within the last week or so. Most of them either use the word <i>fuck</i> or call some specific editor an idiot. If anyone other than an administrator had posted the statements it would be uncontroversial to characterize this as an escalating pattern of incivility. Normally in such cases I <i>would</i> block shortly after verifying the evidence. I have not done so in this instance, nor is it appropriate to introduce wheel warring to this very hypothetical discussion. <s>Your participation in this thread and at my user page has demonstrated very persistent bad faith against me and mischaracterized my actions to the extent that yes I do think it amounts to mudslinging. <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> does not mean that my motives and methods are bad until proven legitimate.</s> I made a tough call tonight regarding a sysop I admire and like, couched it in the most respectful terms I could muster, and disclosed the situation here immediately. <font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charge</a></i></sup></font> 08:04, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I have never posted on your talk page as far as I can remember and its not on my watchlist. Since you are throwing TLAs at me can I ask you where you have AGF with me? Making unfounded allegations of persistant bad faith against you by an editor is far more of a personal attack than what you charactarise as my mudslinging. Please review your post and check you have the right editor. You are completely overeacting to a comment that I don't think is wholly out of line with a significant pov posted in this thread. Blocking anyone without discussing the problem with them is inappropriate in pretty much every circumstance. If you asked Guy to tone it down and he told you fuck off then fair enough but not this so far. I think you are taking this far too personally.

<dd>You bring up an interesting point about past disputes.

<p>I would, in fact, be perfectly happy to accept an apology for bad behaviour and a promise not to do it again. I have no vendetta against JzG, and he does do fine work, but he needs to know when to back off and go have a cup of tea. If you're worked up into a state where you're using foul language and ranting, you need to put down the keyboard. Unfortunately, comments to such were ignored, and my only recourse left was to file it on <a href="../../../p/a/i/WP%7EPAIN_2701.html" title="WP:PAIN">WP:PAIN</a> and bring it to general attention.</p>
<p>I'm upset that he (And some others) seems to have decided I'm his enemy, I'm not. I was trying to get him to stop attacking people and escalating issues that could be resolved calmly. I'm sure he can so, and just needs to find that admin zen again.</p>
<p>I'm sure that it's all been impressed on JzG now, and if we can settle this with a simple agreement not to use foul language against editors, it's something we can all drop and walk away from.

<dd>Thatcher131 nails it. This is MONGO all over again. The clear message is: take the crap, deal with the trolls and cranks, and if you ever, ever, speak out bluntly or profanely at the shit being shoveled, someone will scream "foul" and either block you or threaten to do so as a punitive measure - or in the case of MONGO, desysop you as a reward for having done so much, so long for Wikipedia that you are at the breaking point. Here's the bottom line: I call a troll a troll. I call a POV pusher a POV pusher. Accuracy is not incivility. Incredibly hard working admins who fight these idiots (Yes, I said idiots, I stand by that) who (the admins, not the idiots) occasionally slip under the strain should have a weighted response. If they have a ratio of 2,000 edits and actions which are civil and helpful to the encyclopedia, and 1 or 2 which are uncivil, to people who are of no or extremely little value to the encyclopedia, then reacting to that as though it were some kind of horror movie scene is Undue Weight. Hear me clearly: between the Giano situation, which is a case of one of the best writers here being driven to what appears to be a defensive running battle, by ADMINS no less - and the MONGO and now JzG situations, where admins have been driven to minor incivility by the sheer volume of crap they have to fight, and the response of a large portion of the community to respond with torches and stakes to the people who are <b>driven to that point</b> not the <b>people who drove them there</b>, I am beginning to doubt the basic common sense of some of the general Wikipedia population. What are you people thinking? Oh My God, someone said a BAD WORD to a vandal, troll, or POV pusher. Well, fuck, I guess we'll all have to go to Time Out and not get cookies. Apparently it is more important to Be Civil at all times than to work your ass off completely uncompensated and have the random moment where it gets to you. Focus, anyone? Perspective? I am not here to promote "Wiki-Love". I am not here to get my narrow, judgmental mind in a tizzy because someone used a Naughty Word. I am here to help with the enormous, challanging, exceptionally special group effort of creating the most amazing knowledge resouce since the Library of Alexandria.

The current uncompromising text of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> does not allow for exceptions, but that doesn't reflect the reality - which is that a casual editor would be indef blocked for habitual incivility, whereas valued contributors are given a pass. Note: I am not arguing for or against the practice here, only that the practice is in conflict with the stated policy. If the consensus is that there are exceptions to these policies, then those exceptions should be documented somewhere. <a href="../../../a/t/r/User%7EATren_6e1d.html" title="User:ATren">ATren</a> 16:39, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I actually find very little reference to blocking on either page. NPA refers to blocking for legal/death threats, and "in extreme cases" it is "controversial" for users to be blocked for disruption. CIV lists a few suggestions to prevent incivility, several of which are widely impractical and several of which involve blocking (now reworded). I'm not sure where the idea comes from that incivility/personal attacks must in all or most cases be dealt with by blocking, because neither page says so. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 16:47, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't like your way of thinking because it seems to presume that Guy and MONGO are somehow incapable of self-restraint. Granted they do a lot of good work dealing with editors who frustrate and annoy and attack them. Why does this cause them to use pointlessly inflammatory language like "fuck off" and "useless twat"? If you've ever worked retail then you've stood at a similar "firehose of crap" and probably not told anyone to "fuck off" (which would get you fired). In my view any normal person is capable of this sort of self-restraint. And it would be nice to see everyone use it. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 20:07, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just a minor point here to all the people getting upset about "idiots" and "trolls". Why let "idiots" and "trolls" upset you so much? They are, as you say, idiots and trolls. Trolls will be pleased that you are getting upset, and idiots will, well, not really care or understand. <b>Pity</b> the idiots and trolls and dispassionately and calmly block them, rather than <b>ranting and raving</b> at them. POV pushers are another matter, and, in my opinion, a greater threat to Wikipedia, but they are being serious, so treat them seriously and civilly and defend <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">balanced, well-written articles</a>. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 16:55, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Disruption is disruption and is just as detrimental to writing an encyclopedia as POV pushers are. Everyone should remain civil as much as possible but we are only human, and if someone is being trolled to death, Wikipedia then becomes just a battleground for them. I am not aware of all JzG has been dealing with, but no doubt, it is not very difficult to understand how disruptive editors can make almost anyone become a bit off center in their remarks. If one doesn't experience it firsthand, they don't really know how crappy this place can be, but the only way to defeat it without laying down the law and sometimes being rude, is to walk away...and that is what the trolls want. I don't condone incivility, but in examining <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/MONGO#Solidarity" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/MONGO#Solidarity" rel="nofollow">it should be noted that</a>, <i>Wikipedia users, especially administrators, will not permit a user under attack to be isolated, but will support them.

<p>I just have to say something here (speaking in general and not in direct response to this thread), I don't see what place swearing at someone has in a serious effort to write and maintain an encyclopedia. Swearing at someone (even someone whose sole purpose is to troll) just enflames the person and gives at least some onlookers the impression that that's an acceptable way to interact with people. It's unproductive all the way around. Blockable? No, but admins have all the tools they need to deal with disruptive editors, how is being aggressively hostile to a disruptive editor going to make them less disruptive? And in the meantime, borderline editors and newcomers will see that there's a place for hostile incivility here, which is a message I don't think we want to send. <a href="../../../r/x/_/User%7ERx_StrangeLove_2537.html" title="User:Rx StrangeLove">Rx StrangeLove</a> 18:01, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I said it as a reviewer on PAIN, and I'll say it here: JzG's conduct was unacceptable for a sysop, and he needs to be reminded to maintain the decorum expected of the Wikipedia administration. If he cannot conduct himself appropriately, he is negatively affecting the environment here on Wikipedia, and should surrender his status. If he can, well then all's well that ends well.

<li>Try to decrease the "temperature" of a situation - not increase it.

<p>I want to respond to Chihuahua. If an editor, any editor, is taking shit from another, there are means to deal with it. There is always a cavalry. You don't have to feel you are fighting a lone battle against a "twat". Someone else can come along and knock some sense into them, or help you conclude that said "twat" and sense can never be on speaking terms. No one gets "driven" to it. You don't <i>have to</i> fight a crusade against people who don't get it. You have the machinery to deal with it.</p>
<p>And yes, sorry, if there are punitive blocks for ordinary users who feel put upon by admins and snap, there are punitive blocks for admins who feel put upon by ordinary users and snap. It's better to have the rule of law than the law of the jungle. It's better in my view not to block punitively unless it is a matter of giving someone a bit of thinking space to correct how they see things though. If Guy thinks that the pressure is so much that he needs to abuse other people, maybe a day off to think about it wouldn't hurt. Maybe Guy needs some time away from areas in which he feels pressured. A bit of low-grade typochasing might help him get back on an even keel (I almost wrote "evil kin", which is a worry). He doesn't need blocking to give himself a bit of chilling-out time though. He just needs to figure out that he's let things get on top of him a bit, which I think he's probably well aware of.</p>
<p>And I think Peter also has it right. It doesn't actually resolve the problem with "twats" if you yell at them to fuck off! A bit of fuckoffery could probably be more readily forgiven if it didn't seem to be the first line of defence against editors who upset you but yes, I think we do need stakes and torches for those who aren't willing to try other methods of managing conflicts than simply escalating them. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 02:33, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>First there was "Pity the idiots and trolls", now there's the Spanish Inquisition with its stakes and torches. Bah. Like Guy, I have a very limited capacity for suffering fools, and like KC I believe in accuracy. A troll is a troll, an idiot is an idiot, a POV pusher is a POV pusher. Period. In fact this motley collection of trolls, idiots and POV pushers that so many are defending in the guise of "civility" are hurting Wikipedia's reputation. Several of my wife's friends have contacted me asking if there wasn't something that could be done about the banal and inane objections raised by the trolls, idiots and POV pushers, as reading their comments on the discussion pages has turned them against using Wikipedia as a reliable source. None of them, however, had any gripes about trolls, idiots and POV pushers being treated in an uncivil manner, in fact they noted that these clowns are tolerated far more than they should be. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FF2400">•Jim</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#F4C430">62</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">sch•</font></a> 11:21, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Regarding Atren</span></h3>
<p>So, as I read this thread, it seems there is consensus that a certain amount of incivility is permitted as long as (a) you have a lot of edits to your credit and (b) you were provoked. Can we make it more clear in policy that incivility is permitted under these circumstances? Because the policy pages seem very clear that it is not permitted under <i>any</i> circumstances, and the reality seems to be not so clear cut. All I'm saying is when an editor visits <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> and sees these idealistic, uncompromising statements about personal attacks and civility, they get the impression that these are inviolable rules that can never be broken, when it's clear that <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> applies to civility. I think we should qualify those policies to soften the stance somewhat (especially WP:NPA which is especially uncompromising) to reflect the <i>reality</i> not promote the <i>false ideal</i>. <a href="../../../a/t/r/User%7EATren_6e1d.html" title="User:ATren">ATren</a> 21:18, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And now I've made comments that the policy is at odds with consensus here. Policy is unswerving in condemning incivility, but consensus is obviously not so clear.

<p>If your history consists mostly of vandalism or disruption, then calling someone a "twat" or telling them to "fuck off" should earn a well-deserved block.

<dd>For the record, Durova was right to speak up about incivility here. All the people 'jumping to the defense of JzG' have it exactly backwards... Durova was the one <i>helping</i> JzG. The stuff about, 'we do not block for occasional incivility', is half right... we generally don't block admins and other 'high profile' users for such. Regular users, on the other hand, sometimes get blocked for saying a single word out of line. The philosophy that 'we look at the whole picture' inherently means that longstanding and/or popular users are held to <i>lower</i> standards of behaviour... which we have seen become a self-defeating trap over and over and over again. That 'occaisional incivility' adds up, and when people see users being incivil and getting away with it they respond in kind. If they then are then blocked/strongly warned for it while the other person isn't they get pissed off at the imbalance and the spiral of deterioration continues. It is <i>obviously</i> bad for Wikipedia and if it isn't stopped sooner or later it <i>always</i> catches up to people. There was a time when Karmafist was well loved and his 'occaisional incivility' let pass... until it got to be too much. There was a time when Kelly Martin was well loved and her 'occaisional incivility' not a big deal... until it alienated too many people. You want to 'protect' good users? <b>Stop them</b> from being uncivil, don't violate policies yourself and attack those who are pointing out problems, and do what you can to take on some of their burdens... kinda like Durova was doing. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 10:59, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>CBD, I've been ignoring this thread because as far as I'm concerned the whole thing was over as soon as it began, having been solved by the simple expedient of going to bed, but the above is factually wrong. I did not block Yrgh. Quite the opposite, I went and invited him to repost his complaint in terms that would allow it to be taken seriously. I also spent some time investigating the complaint despite its tone. And <i>then</i> it turned out he was wasting everyone's time, at which point he was indef-blocked by Cyde, who posted the block for review. At that point I endorsed blocking, referring to the former (now indef-blocked) user as a twat, based on the evidence presented by Cyde. Twat is a not a strong insult in England. Not that I'm especially proud of using invective, but I wasted quite a bit of time trying to follow up what looked as if it might have been a substantive complaint, only to find that it was a case of the very ancient iron pot calling the shiny new stainless steel kettle black. It was a very trivial incident, but amply demonstrated, to my mind, the inherent problems with the PAIN noticeboard. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 10:34, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, CBD. I'll be clear here. Guy was out-of-line; and I don't think he'd do it again. He is one of the most hard-working administrators on Wikipedia and exercises good judgment most of the times. But do you realise there are users who assume bad faith with everyone and are regularly uncivil and disruptive themselves; Guy was provoked here, and he did not react nicely. Do you realise the user who posted the civility warning on JzG's talk was being uncivil and disruptive himself? Strings and threads of warnings on <a href="../../../b/a/r/User_talk%7EBarberio_ff1a.html" title="User talk:Barberio">his talk page</a>. The same user posts a {{<a href="../../../n/p/a/Template%7ENpa_f59d.html" title="Template:Npa">npa</a>}} template on Guy's talk; and when Guy reverts him he takes it to <a href="../../../p/a/i/WP%7EPAIN_2701.html" title="WP:PAIN">WP:PAIN</a>, citing the words "fuck off" again and again and again, despite being uncivil, assuming bad faith – disregarding comments with regard to policies and guidelines with an holier than thou approach. That is "sanctimonious bullshit". I know where you are coming from, and you have the best intentions for Guy and Wikipedia as a whole, however a block warning by another administrator is frankly, out-of-line in itself. Would it help the situation get better? Definitely not. So, instead of giving more leverage to the arguments of such ... uh... over-assertive users, and rapping the knuckles of established administrators, we can all get back to editing articles. — <a href="../../../s/i/r/User_talk%7ESir_Nicholas_de_Mimsy-Porpington_ae26.html" title="User talk:Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington"><font color="black"><b>Nearly Headless Nick</b></font></a> 15:11, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The way to 'avoid giving more leverage' is to not violate the behaviour standards in the first place and not 'turn a blind eye' when it happens.

<dd>I'd like to see the approach covered by "I happen to believe in <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_adminship_is_not_3fae.html#Adminship_is_not_diplomatic_immunity" title="Wikipedia:What adminship is not">Wikipedia:What_adminship_is_not#Adminship_is_not_diplomatic_immunity</a> and I walk the walk." tempered by an eye for context. I wish the first question that went through an administrator's mind before intervention would be: what effect does this infraction have on the encyclopedia? The next questions could be: is there a hurry? and: will this cause a debate-fest, with the inevitable escalation that produces? And I'd like to suggest some slack be cut for administrators letting their guard down in non-article space like this page. The atmosphere gets a bit newsgroupy, so I'm saddened to see what is said offhandedly by good, hard-working users being policed just because they happen to say it in a room full of police, or to see one user's opportunistic stirrring being given the time of day: let complaints go through procedure, giving everyone time to think.</dd>

<dd>Despite dissimilarities with the Giano situation, I do notice one similarity. In both cases, a relatively harmless discussion on this page got out of control when diffs were suddenly bandied about and chased up. It seems to me that nothing administrators say here should lead to disciplinary procedures in the absence of a formal complaint (say to diff conjurors something like: "if you are bothered, make a formal complaint with a new heading, preferably after giving it a day or two's thought"). From what I can see, this started with one chap saying something a bit sharp, followed by someone telling him to tone it down: that should have been the end of it. In my opinion, another user pulled the triangle trap which I've seen on <i>Supernanny</i>, and I wish one of our best and most diligent administrators hadn't walked into it in all good faith. I'd also like to see administrators asking themselves whether speed is required for any particular block: in this case the various diffs, which were not fresh, could have been mulled over for a day or two (during which it would have been found that a certain word was relatively innocuous), because the only urgent reason to block someone, in my opinion, is to stop them damaging Wikipedia: in this case, that didn't apply.<a href="../../../q/p/1/User%7EQp10qp_d299.html" title="User:Qp10qp">qp10qp</a> 19:08, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

My philosophy is summed up at <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_Philosophy_ad4c.html" title="User:Carcharoth/Philosophy">User:Carcharoth/Philosophy</a>. This can be a hard thing to stick to, but no-one said this was going to be easy. In the long-term, breeding incivility is a very bad thing. I see too much of people seeing themselves as aggressive defenders of the project, and being attackers of trolls, and being firemen (and women) dealing with huge amounts of crap. I don't dispute that there are huge amounts of crap being added, but bringing yourself down to that level doesn't actually help. Constantly try to rise above it. Help others involved in this. If they are getting dragged down to the breaking point, point this out to them.

<dd>Yeah, I don't really get the whole 'wasted time' bit. Yrgh complained that TAnthony had made personal attacks on him. TAnthony HAD made personal attacks on him. I haven't reviewed it in detail, but I saw that in just a cursory review. If Guy didn't see that and blew it off that's probably what led to Yrgh's complete meltdown... which sadly WAS extreme and worthy of a serious block. As he hasn't made any effort at communication since (that I know of) it is difficult to see if there would be any way to get him to calm down. -<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 08:41, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Guy calling someone a twat was definately not ok. He apologized for that too. What should have happened at that point was that someone should have said to Guy "Look, you are getting too worked up now. Take a break, Wikipedia won't collapse if you are not here. Go watch some TV or something." Instead what happened was that everyone who felt a need to get even with Guy came running and started to fuel the fire hoping that they could get Guy blocked because he finally got too stressed and made a mistake. This is what upsets me greatly because Guy wasn't on at the time so the only people left to defend him were his friends who, granted, were equally eager to get even with those who fueled the fire to begin with. At that point all hell broke loose and I don't think any of us are proud of that. Hopefully what we have learned from this is that these situations are much better resolved by giving the stressed out editor (in this case Guy) a friendly "warning" telling him that he needs to take a break for a few hours or so and let others deal with spammers and the <a href="../../../n/e/w/Special%7ENewpages_26cd.html" title="Special:Newpages">firehose of crap</a>. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 08:51, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>May I humbly point out a remarkable coincidence about this episode, considering that it's JzG who's involved. The case, where a casual remark which is almost a jovial term of endearment in the UK comes across as a deadly and unforgivable insult in another time zone, parallels the <a href="../../../r/a/c/Races_and_species_in_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy_041f.html#G.27Gugvuntts_and_Vl.27hurgs" title="Races and species in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy">G'Gugvuntts and Vl'hurgs</a> case. From what I've read all have been acting with the best of intentions, and while Guy will no doubt have washed his mouth out with soap, it's worth remembering that Zaphod's ship is <i>The Heart of Gold</i>. And in all cases, not just with admins, I'd hope that previous good behaviour is always taken into account when handing down sentences.

<dd>After reading through all this, I think brenneman said it the best. To paraphrase him, we don't accept bad behaviour from established contributors, we just handle it differently. In my view, having an admin flag should be totally irrelevant. Setting up an "admins don't block admins" guideline will just give ammunition to those who suggest admins are too tightly knit. Also, <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> shouldn't be used as an excuse to sidestep this question. Obviously, when dealing with other admins, an admin will take a different approach than when dealing with a known vandal. But at the end of the day, either an admin has the authority to block another admin or they don't - and this needs to be in writing somewhere.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Of course, someone who is an admin is <b>much</b> more likely to be contributing to the community than a random user, and those contributions should be taken into account. In this case, JzG is a clearly established contributor, who has done a lot of good work on Wikipedia (including use of his admin tools). So he earns a warning and a "please apologize", when a new user would have been blocked for posting the exact same things he did. But it's because of his contribution history, not just because he's an admin. It's a subtle difference, but I feel it's important to make the distinction.</dd>

<dd>On the swearing issue - Wikipedia isn't censored. However, that doesn't give people a licence to swear whenever they want. When writing an article about a CEO who was fired for having an affair with a secretary, there's no need to use a phrase like, "He got sacked for grabbing his hot-to-trot secretary and fucking her brains out". Swearing can be used, but when appropriate - both in main-space, and in talk-space. Can swearing be used in a conversation to make a point? Fuck, yeah! But it loses its point-making impact if every other post is an f-bomb. I'm particularly disturbed by the suggestion that "Fuck you" is a personal attack, but "Fuck off" and "Leave me alone" are both perfectly fine, and identical to each other. "Fuck off" can mean lots of different things when saying it to someone's face - but things are different on the net.</dd>

<dd>If an admin is frazzled and boiling mad, it is best to do tag team sysopping and ask an uninvolved admin to take a look at the situation. Some editor (or troll) may have succeeded at pushing the bottons of the admin he is dealing with, so the normally mild mannered admin now is too agitated to do this best work or to meet the requirements of civility for which he should be an example. This allows the facts of the matter to be judged by fresh eyes, objectively, and any warnings or blocks to come from an admion who has no history of escalating angry exchanges with the problem editor. But by the same token, if an admin loses it and tells an editor he is a useless twat and should fuck off, he should not warn or block another editor for the same words. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 17:41, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Article created by sockpuppet?</span></h2>
<p>What should I do with an article (Charles C. Poindexter) created by a sockpuppet of an indef-blocked user (<a href="../../../m/y/k/User%7EMykungfu_b210.html" title="User:Mykungfu">User:Mykungfu</a>)? I had sent it to AfD, primarily because I didn't think the subject met <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, but after seeing the debate (including comments by Mykungfu), I don't believe that is the case. He is notable, so the article's other issues (such as it being a POV fork from <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alpha_Phi_Alpha_482f.html" title="Alpha Phi Alpha">Alpha Phi Alpha</a>) should be dealt with elsewhere. My question is whether an article created and almost solely edited by a blocked user should simply be deleted on that basis. I'm also hesitant to overstep my bounds here, as I was also the admin who blocked the last two MKF socks. | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">Mr. Darcy</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a></small> 16:36, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As far as I know, Articles created by Banned/InDef blocked folks should be speedied without prejudice to recreation under CSD C5 (Sock of blocked/banned user). If the article is notable, it will be remade. A ban/block is exactly that.

<dd>Personally I would keep the article but reduce it to a stub - thereby losing the content added by the banned user and allowing a new article to grow.

<p>This appears to be a repost of an article that was deleted from the German Wikipedia. I'm not a sysop over there (und mein Deutsch ist ein bisschen schwach), so I can't attest to the circumstances. According to the author, Kai bohrmann (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kai_bohrmann_d245.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kai bohrmann">contribs</a>), the public reason was for being an "agitation article." This article is now sitting in Kai bohrmann's userspace, still in German, either to be translated or sent back to de. Either way, I'm not very happy about the present situation, but as the speedy deletion is contested, I'm coming here for a second opinion.

<p>The constant removal of a thread by an assorted variety of IPs is bordering on disruption on this board. I was wondering if there was precedence in semi-protecting this board.

<dd>Chacor, if you were me, struggling to control the vandalism to this page because two totally independent dynamic IP vandals were vandalising this page, what would you do? There was little way to get a word in edgeways, since the page was going back and forth between revisions from both the vandals. Notice I customised the sprotection notice to apologise to all the anons? The fact remains that sprotected, the board can be used by almost everyone, but were it to be unsprotected at present, it would be filled with vandalism, and nobody would be able to add notices due to constant reversions. Unfortunately, the fact remains that not many anons use <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a>, and I really am sorry that that user is shut out. But right now, it is totally necessary. --<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDeskana_5f27.html" title="User:Deskana">Deskana</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDeskana_208e.html" title="User talk:Deskana"><small>(For Great Justice!)</small></a> 01:11, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I think it's a pity we have to shut anons out of the conversation, but we are, as Deskana said, doing it out of necessity. Anyone who needs help can go to some signed-up user and ask them to post on their behalf; we can't continually let this noticeboard waste users' time and bandwidth by letting the whole page get filled with vandalism. This is only a short compromise until these socks/vandalbots/etc. are shot down.

<dd>If Jimbo Wales were just some random user or even low-profile admin, then using the nickname Jimbo wouldn't be a problem. However, when he's the guy who runs the whole show, it's highly confusing and disruptive. EaglesFanInTampa should recognize that using a name that <i>will</i> be attributed by any experienced editor to another person is unacceptable. We're not trying to gang up on him here, we're trying to save mass confusion and accusations of imitating "The True Jimbo" later on. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> <small><a href="../../../t/j/s/User_talk%7ETjstrf_3ddb.html" title="User talk:Tjstrf">talk</a></small> 02:54, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>I don't get what the problem is... so what if he uses the name "Jimbo"? Should other users be making blind assumptions based on the text in someone's signature? The chance of confusion is low, especially among experienced users. If someone thinks that it might be the real Jimbo, they should first check where the link in the signature goes to. In this case, that will instantly resolve any confusion. This situation reminds me of my days on the gamefaqs boards when users would be banned for having "CJ" in their names, even when there is clearly no chance of real confusion. --- <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockMFR_f871.html" title="User:RockMFR">RockMFR</a> 04:24, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The problem I had was that I initially thought someone was counterfeiting Jimbo's signature. That meant I spent time looking into the matter that I could have spent more productively.

<dd>I think the whole idea is messed up. I happen to know a <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Bohannon_0ef9.html" title="Jim Bohannon">person who has gone by the name Jimbo</a> for almost 40 years.

I understand the username policy is to prevent impersonation, but using the example of a bunch of letters like tjstrf's signature is comparing apples to oranges. When you start beating up on good editors simply because of their signature, rather than their edits or actions, you aren't helping the Encyclopedia, you're enforcing policy for the sake of policy. --<font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a4a9.html" title="User:Elaragirl"><font color="SteelBlue">Elar</font></a><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a_7dff.html" title="User:Elaragirl/a"><font color="orange"><b>a</b></font></a><font color="SteelBlue">girl</font><small><sup><a href="../../../e/l/a/User_talk%7EElaragirl_228e.html" title="User talk:Elaragirl">Talk</a>|Count</sup></small></font> 04:58, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Quite frankly, I really don't see a problem with a user signing with "Jimbo", as long as it is clear that the user is not Jimbo Wales. This should be pretty clear, not only because of the link to his user page (perhaps a note could be posted on there to clear any confusion?), but because of the fact that "Wales" is not mentioned anywhere in the signature. It's a popular first name and it's not unique; simply because Jimbo Wales has such a first name should not preclude anyone else from using their own name.

<p>The article <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game_rip_%28audio%29.html" title="Game rip (audio)">Game rip (audio)</a> has been frequently vandalized by an anonymous user with a dynamic IP since its creation, as you can see from the history <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Game_rip_%28audio%29&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Game_rip_%28audio%29&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>. Recently, their vandalism attempts have involved the repeated insertion of a link to an apparently virus-infected file, which they are trying to pass off as a legitimate program. Since their IP is different every time they edit the page, there isn't anything I can do besides just reverting their edits.

<dd>You are definitely right. <s>After the reverts, I only notified one admin so that he can take a look, but I didn't go to ANI by claiming that "new user" was doing this or that. If possible, I would still like clarification on if he can revert 3RR warnings by saying that "I can remove anything that I want from my talk page". He posted msgs to 14 users practically inviting them for edit-warring. However, I didn't think that ANI was the right place for this in the first place.</s> Cheers! <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 04:08, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

(Warning:The font he used is huge, so you might wanna view it with popups instead of clicking.) His second and third edits have been petty vandalism. I've been debating whether to welcome him (which may be useless - this is probably not his first interaction with Wikipedia, based on his knowledge of formatting and site layout), add him at <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>, or add a section here. I recall users being blocked indef at their request, one blocked indef at their request and then unblocked involuntarily, and at least one completely ignored. Any other opinions on the situation?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Vandalism of <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fann_Wong_03e9.html" title="Fann Wong">Fann Wong</a> by sockpuppets</span></h2>
<p>When checking on <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fann_Wong_03e9.html" title="Fann Wong">Fann Wong</a>, I noticed that Wenfangs (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wenfangs_04f9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wenfangs">contribs</a>) added nonsensical tags to <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fann_Wong_03e9.html" title="Fann Wong">Fann Wong</a> (such as sprotected, unreferenced and inappropriate tone tags) when the article is completely referenced and has recently obtained GA status. I've warned the user on his/her talk page but the user has accused me of vandalising another article, <a href="../../../z/o/e/Zoe_Tay_e8ae.html" title="Zoe Tay">Zoe Tay</a>. When I checked <a href="../../../z/o/e/Zoe_Tay_e8ae.html" title="Zoe Tay">Zoe Tay</a>, I noticed that a user with a similar nickname Wenfangfan (<a href="../../../w/e/n/User_talk%7EWenfangfan_b57d.html" title="User talk:Wenfangfan">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wenfangfan_a499.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wenfangfan">contribs</a>) was blocked for being a returning vandal. The tumultous edit war in <a href="../../../z/o/e/Zoe_Tay_e8ae.html" title="Zoe Tay">Zoe Tay</a> by sockpuppets resulted in it being sprotected. It seems that both Wenfangs (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wenfangs_04f9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wenfangs">contribs</a>) and Wenfangfan (<a href="../../../w/e/n/User_talk%7EWenfangfan_b57d.html" title="User talk:Wenfangfan">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wenfangfan_a499.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wenfangfan">contribs</a>) are sockpuppets engaging in vandalism on both the <a href="../../../z/o/e/Zoe_Tay_e8ae.html" title="Zoe Tay">Zoe Tay</a> and <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fann_Wong_03e9.html" title="Fann Wong">Fann Wong</a> articles. In any case, these usernames should be blocked for violating Wikipedia's naming policy (celebrity names - <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fann_Wong_03e9.html" title="Fann Wong">Fann Wong</a>'s Chinese name is Wenfang, which probably explains the choice of nickname). <a href="../../../v/o/d/User%7EVoda_voda_7cbe.html" title="User:Voda voda">Voda voda</a> 04:57, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

This matter was also raised on my talk page by someone who believes this user is the most recent sock of someone Zoe blocked. <s>Can you clarify why you feel Wenfangfan is also a username violation, doesn't the "fan" part make it different enough?

<dd><a href="../../../f/a/n/Fann_Wong_03e9.html" title="Fann Wong">Fann Wong</a>'s full Chinese name is <i>Fan Wenfang</i>, and Wenfangfan can be taken as too similar to her Chinese name for comfort, even if the first name here (Wenfang) precedes the last name (Fan) - as compared to Chinese custom where the last name (Fan) precedes the first name (Wenfang). Alternatively, you could see Wenfangfan as a username coined in spite; for despite calling himself/herself a fan of <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fann_Wong_03e9.html" title="Fann Wong">Fann Wong</a>, (ie. 'fan' refers to supporter and not the last name of the actress), the user has merely tagged on nonsensical tags to the article instead of improving it. I've just examined the <a href="../../../z/o/e/Zoe_Tay_e8ae.html" title="Zoe Tay">Zoe Tay</a> edit conflict and <tt class="userlinks" style="1.3em">Wenfangs</tt> (<span class="plainlinks">talk <b>·</b> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wenfangs_04f9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wenfangs">contribs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">logs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../b/l/o/Special%7EBlockip_Wenfangs_6aad.html" title="Special:Blockip/Wenfangs">block user</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">block log</a></span>)'s talk page and I think it's quite obvious that it's definitely the same person stirring up nonsense in <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fann_Wong_03e9.html" title="Fann Wong">Fann Wong</a>. <a href="../../../v/o/d/User%7EVoda_voda_7cbe.html" title="User:Voda voda">Voda voda</a> 05:41, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
