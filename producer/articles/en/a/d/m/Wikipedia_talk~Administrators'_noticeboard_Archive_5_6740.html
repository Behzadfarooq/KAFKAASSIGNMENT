<h2><span class="mw-headline">ANI archive size</span></h2>
<p>Currently, ANI is archived by Essjaybot such that the archive is "filled" until the archive exceeds 300KB. The result of this is that the archive can get up to 350 or 400KB. The consequence of this is that there is a delay in loading even on newer computers with fast connections, and an even greater delay on older machines or slower connections or when opening several archives at once to find discussions from a particular time period. The typical archive size for article talk page is more around 130KB, and the typical size for administrative noticeboard archives—when the switching of their archives was not ignored—was more around 200KB and less. The reason given for having such large archives is to reduce the number of archives. This provides no great advantage—we have no shortage of numbers—but there is a practical disadvantage for having large single archives. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 11:48, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agreed, the size should be reduced. I don't know exactly how the bot works, but it should be an easy thing to change. Maybe reduce the 300k to 100k? --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> 13:22, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Template for reporting offensive usernames?</span></h2>
<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>I'm not sure if this is the right place for this but I think it is. Please gently point it out to me if it's not.</p>
<p>At times, I am running through the <a href="../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_newusers_2b1e.html" title="Special:Log/newusers">new user log</a> and I find an offensive username. Rather than put them on <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> or <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>, I would prefer it if I could just put a template, like {{Offensive username}}, on the offending user's page. If this template added the usernames to a category, like 'Category:Offensive usernames', then admins could just run through the list and block these users indef. If this was approved I could change all the sections in policies and guidelines saying to put the template on instead of reporting the users on <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> or <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>.</p>
<p>Cheers and thanks for considering this,</p>

<dl>
<dd>I think that reporting them is better, especially reporting them to AIV because it is meant for that sort of thing and it is wiped clean rather than archived, because it is better to not create user pages or talk pages for offensive names. The user or talk page could be deleted afterwards, but it would be more work and admins might neglect to delete them. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 13:01, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Except .... admins already leave a message on the user's talk page, don't they?

<dd>Hmmm, it would help, but I think it would be more hassle than needed. However, when a thread gets large, I think it is a good idea to move it to it's own subpage and provide a link under the original heading here. After all, it is 1 out of 7 threads that take up most of the space on this board. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 03:09, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I like the idea to do it only for long discussions, although that means we can't have the bulleted list. I created a table with statistic<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Administrators%27_noticeboard&amp;oldid=94248976" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Administrators%27_noticeboard&amp;oldid=94248976" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, which shows that there are indeed about 7 threads that are longer than a screenful (5000 chars on my computer, YMMV). That's about 12 paragraphs + headline. <small>(Excluding headlines, there were 462 pars and 185679 chars w spaces. Thus, the average paragraph was 400 characters.)</small> So a guideline like this would make sense:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a topic reaches 12 paragraphs then its discussion will be moved to another page and it will be replaced by a short summary and a link to that page. When the discussion reaches a point that requires everybody's attention, someone will add that to the summary.</p>

<p><a name="More_subpages" id="More_subpages"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">More subpages</span></h3>
<p>How about two new subpages, "Complaints about admins" and "Complaints about non-admins"? If you are specifically complaining about someone, you make a subpage (the name of the user being complained about, similar to ArbCom, probably) and transclude it on to the appropriate page. I'm suggesting 2 pages, as complaints about admins usually requires multiple admins to respond so we can develop a concensus, whereas a complaint about a non-admin can often be dealt with by a single admin. Once a complaint has been dealt with, it is removed from the page (perhaps archived somewhere, in any case, the subpage can hang around for eternity). This should work quite well, as complaints are generally resolved at a certain point and it's clear when it should be removed. With more general discussions there often isn't a clear end, it just gradually goes inactive. This is moving towards creating a Court of Administrators, which some people might not be happy with - personally, I have no problem with it.</p>
<p>The only major problem I can see with this idea is that it might end up with almost everything happening on these subpages, which defeats the object of trying to separate things. Someone with more time might want to go through the history of AN and see how much of it is complaints and how much general discussion and requests. AN/I would probably cease to exist, as almost all of that is complaints, by its very nature. The non-complaints things that are considered incidents can move to the main noticeboard. So it boils down to having one more subpage than we have now, but having them slightly more structured. --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> 12:38, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

If an issue is closed, rather than tagging it with whatever version of {{<a href="../../../a/t/_/Template%7EAt_c972.html" title="Template:At">at</a>}} is used here, just manually archive it and leave only a link to the archived version.

<dd>Question for Essjay about this - does archiving the section reset the timer? In other words, are you going off of edit dates or signature dates? <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 20:14, 22 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I can answer this--the bot looks for the most recent standard signature timestamp. (You may see from time to time an old unsigned post that the bot has missed for this reason.) At this point, if the last sig is more than 24 hours old when the bot runs, it will archive the section. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 22:05, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To whom exactly is this statement “anything” referring to? Are we considered as "things" now? Is this in regards to the name ‘’Dravidian’’, or the indigenous people of Southern India? OK, let us set aside the word ‘’Dravidian’’ and not think of that now. Logically speaking, who are we? Yes, as a nationality we can say ‘’Indians’’, but I am not talking about nationality. I understand what nationality is. However, on the other hand linguistically speaking, it is more than obvious that the languages and language scripts of North and South India are totally different like night and day so we do not need to get into that. Now, on the lines of ethnicity, who are we? Are the Tamils, Telugus, Malayalees, and the Kannadigas Aryan? If we are not Aryan, then to what ethnic family do we belong? What is our heritage? Do we not have our own heritage? Why do I keep mentioning about the word ‘’Indian’’ even though the term is not being disputed? Well, the reason is because that too is not an indigenous word, just like ‘’Dravidian’’ is not an indigenous word. Therefore, both terms ‘’Indian’’ and ‘’Dravidian’’ fall in the same category of being named from non indigenous or outside sources. For some odd reason, the fact that the word ‘’India’’ itself is not an indigenous name is blatantly avoided. On the other hand, the term ‘’Dravida’’ gets attacked at every given moment. Furthermore, the term ‘’Dravida’’ is mentioned in Sanskrit sources like the Vedas, while the term ‘’India’’ is not mentioned in any South Asian literature (be it Sanskrit, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Punjabi,etc.). The people who should be concerned or, if so, upset about the term ‘’Davidian’’ are the people who are categorized as ‘’Dravidians’’ themselves.</p>

<p>I cannot believe that someone would post something like this on Wikipedia. First your statement <i>"the term Dravidian is a racist term made up by Europeans..."</i> is an accusation against the Europeans and calling them racist. <i>"Dont u people get it by now!..."</i> is posted. Just what on earth is that supposed to mean? "u people"? Is this statement directed towards us, or the ethnic groups in Southern India? And then the message is ended with, <i>"Brrrrrrrruah Punjab India!"</i>? Correct me if I am wrong, but am I sensing some kind of superiority aura here?</p>

<p>What exactly does "in the bigger picture" supposed to mean? I'm sorry, not everybody thinks the same, or can read other peoples minds, but please be more descriptive. The more we discuss into detail about the ethnic cultures of India, the weirder and eerie it gets. Now, I am not talking about the name <a href="../../../a/r/y/User%7EARYAN818_b489.html" title="User:ARYAN818">ARYAN818</a>. In the first place nothing crossed my mind about that particular user name since I understand that it stands for Indo-Arya. There is already a disclaimer message in bold face cap letters on your site. It is not the user name that is offending people, it is this discourteous attitude of intolerance towards other people’s cultures and heritage, and I am not talking about nationality. The above statement posted on my user talk page sends me the message that the indigenous people of Southern India in general do not exist, and should not exist.</p>

Since the critiques of <a href="../../../p/a/i/WP%7EPAIN_2701.html" title="WP:PAIN">WP:PAIN</a> were based on claims that the continued operation of <a href="../../../p/a/i/WP%7EPAIN_2701.html" title="WP:PAIN">WP:PAIN</a> was counterproductive, and did not assert a justification for deleting every comment made on <a href="../../../p/a/i/WP%7EPAIN_2701.html" title="WP:PAIN">WP:PAIN</a> from the page history and from users' edit histories, I saw no consensus to administratively delete the page. Redirecting the page to <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> (and protecting the redirect if necessary) is quite sufficient to ensure that the operation of <a href="../../../p/a/i/WP%7EPAIN_2701.html" title="WP:PAIN">WP:PAIN</a> is discontinued.

<dd>(1) That severe personal attacks, of such a nature as to warrant prompt administrative action, would be handled in a more timely and effective manner if reported on <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> or <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a>, both of which receive far more administrative attention than <a href="../../../p/a/i/WP%7EPAIN_2701.html" title="WP:PAIN">WP:PAIN</a></dd>
<dd>(2) That <a href="../../../p/a/i/WP%7EPAIN_2701.html" title="WP:PAIN">WP:PAIN</a> encouraged editors to report borderline personal attacks and relatively mild incivility by users with whom they were involved in content disputes, where such situations did <i>not</i> merit prompt administrative responses, and might have been better dealt with through the <a href="../../../r/e/s/Wikipedia%7EResolving_disputes_9a93.html" title="Wikipedia:Resolving disputes">dispute resolution process</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn254_98f8.html" title="User:John254">John254</a> 00:05, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>1) Closing an MfD after 26 hours seems highly unusual. (I've no objections to early closings, but there's no pressing need to do it that early). 2) Given the high-profile nature, probably best done by an experienced admin 3) Most people are saying DELETE. Whist there's no reason not to redirect somewhere after deletion, there is no pressing reason (or even argument being made) to retain a record of general nastiness. Best leave it to the closing admin to decide that. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 00:15, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If the outcome of the MfD discussion is in favor of deletion, I suggest that implementation of the actual deletion should be held off until (1) pending issues on the page are resolved, and (2) text can be written advising users with personal-attack-related issues what steps they should take. Simply making the page a redirect to any one particular place is not a good solution. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 00:11, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Reference - Oversight</span></h2>
<p>A question: is there a reason that requests for oversight aren't listed as a link in the "Are you sure that this is the page you are looking for?" section? I realize that they aren't all too common, and when brought up as a post usually get taken care of with a good amount of speed. However, something simple that would circumvent some public postings references to "there is personal information here" (particularly with minors or any other sensitive information) might be worth the line that they'd take up, no? <a href="../../../b/i/t/User%7EBitnine_cb95.html" title="User:Bitnine">Bitnine</a> 19:29, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You shall see that often, it is not that we have too little admins responding. It's that there are too many frivolous reports that aren't worth responding. Not every incident report ANI receives needs a detailed explanation or requires admin intervention. If your report has been continuously ignored, perhaps you should ask yourself why it was ignored, not rain upon us recycled complaints. --<sup><a href="../../../p/h/y/User_talk%7EPhysicq210_4b59.html" title="User talk:Physicq210"><font color="#000000">210</font></a></sup><b><a href="../../../p/h/y/User%7EPhysicq210_ccba.html" title="User:Physicq210"><font color="#0000C0" face="Comic Sans MS">physicq</font></a></b> (<i><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Physicq210_25e9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Physicq210"><font color="#0000C0">c</font></a></i>) 02:08, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Too many frivolous reports? Are all reports being red? If they are, it's not hard to write "no&#160;:::::action required". It'd take 5 seconds. If no response has been given, I'm just assuming that noone bothered to read. And if I "rain upon" you "recycled complaints", perhaps you should really consider the possibility that AN/I is ineffective. <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukas19_cfbd.html" title="User:Lukas19">Lukas19</a> 02:19, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again, if there is a complaint, people shouldnt be persuaded into looking at it. Adminship is a responsibility, not something in which people only look at complaints they are interested in. If you do not have time, ask for more admins. I'm sure there are many candidates. If there are enough admins but some of them only look into problems they are interested in, sack them and make other people who can do this job admins. <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukas19_cfbd.html" title="User:Lukas19">Lukas19</a> 02:27, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I'm not sure why your complaint was ignored, maybe because it was too long. However, you tend to edit in contentious areas, so maybe no-one wanted to buy into what could turn into a nasty fight. I've had a quick look at your edit history and I don't see anything I definetly object to, though I do see some comments about white and sort of whites and so on that make me think that properly exploring your claims would be a lot of trying to understand what seem to be complicated issues, and looking at possible counter claims against you, and I suspect it would all turn into a big and possibly unrewarding exercise real fast. I suspect that plenty of admins have done much the same thing I did, had a look and said - hard. So that's my guess at why you didn't get any satisfaction but also why people didn't say action isn't required. It might be time for an RFC. I'm tempted to suggest that this section belongs on the project page. While it started as a discussion of the noticeboard, I think you're more interested in your particular post being ignored than in the issue of posts in general not being actioned.

<li>AN and ANI are somewhat overloaded and rather overly broad.

<dd>They were being abused. As for repsonding with 'no action required', it would be presumptuous for one admin to label an item that way when another admin might come along later and think it is worth action.

<dd>My rationale for admins writing no action required with a bried summary was to make sure all of the reports get read. Currently, I think this isnt the case. Many reports get archived without being noticed. I find the excuse "no need to respond to crap" crap itself. People desperately need a reality check if they think this board responds to all "non-crap" reports. Ideally, all reports should be read and responded to without taking too much admin time. If this isnt the case, it may be due to a) not enough admins b)lazy admins c)ineffective system d)a combination of these and/or some other reason.</dd>
<dd>If there arent enough admins here, giving "nominate yourself" or "nominate others" are simplistic answers, or rather non-answers. Wikipedia must have something to influence rate of new admins. You have lots of RfA's in which people can steer the direction according to the need for new admins. A concrete example is the recent RfC about Trodel. If Wikipedia need more admins, "new users shouldnt nominate admins" is not a mindset that should be preserved. I will not comment on b , but on c Radiant! makes good points. In all cases the stupidity and ineffectiveness of your current system is exampled by the fact that people can get away by making personal attacks right at AN/I. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109184020" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109184020" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></dd>

<p>Can a user be banned from editing a single page? Does our software allow this? - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeregrine_Fisher_e4db.html" title="User:Peregrine Fisher">Peregrine Fisher</a> 00:15, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As far as I know, no. Blocks have to be used to enforce violations of page bans. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 00:21, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>As a policy matter it can be done by the Arbitration Committee, by the community after a discussion on the noticeboard (note that this is relatively new and sometimes controversial), or by agreement as a condition of an unblock. However, the software can't be programmed to enforce it at this time. I believe there was once a suggestion to implement that but I don't know if it's been pursued. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 00:28, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>AFAIK, the database backend is there, only that no one has bothered to code the interface. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito<span style="color:#008000;">xd</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a> - <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">cool stuff</a>)</sup> 02:33, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Users can be banned (different from blocked) from editing a specific page, or pages on a specific topic, or anything else the community or the arbcomm decides. Enforcement of such bans is done by humans, not by software.

<p>I have a javascript solution I'm working on that users can possibly voluntarily install to prevent editing on specific pages. --<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERandom832_8f73.html" title="User talk:Random832">Random832</a> 20:04, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>May I suggest as possibly helpful: add userchecks below the headers of sections on problematic users, because this gives a one-line linklist to available subpages -- and where there are no such subpages, to the reporting and/or summary pages. Format: &lt;p&#160;align=center&gt;<b>{{usercheck|1=</b><i>username</i><b>}}</b>&lt;/p&gt;   -- <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_7cee.html" title="User:Ben"><span title="Formerly ''Benedict the Moor''"><i><b>Ben</b></i></span></a> <small><sup><a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_22f7.html" title="User talk:Ben"><b>TALK</b></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ben_81a3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ben"><b>HIST</b></a></sub></small> 01:06, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
