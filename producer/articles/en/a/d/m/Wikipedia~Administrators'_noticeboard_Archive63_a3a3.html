<p>Hello all, apologies if this seems a little inappropriate for the AN board. Figured that I started this noticeboard off, might as well be one of the many to misuse it&#160;:-)</p>
<p>Anyway, this is just a short note to let everyone know I will be getting married in Sydney, Australia on the 2nd December! Email me through the email this user toolbar URL for details if you want to come to watch the big event and I vaguely know you&#160;:-) <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 08:42, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>SlimVirgin: Yes, you've only got to 2 December. However, if you lose the latter part of your name to Ta bu shi da yu before 2 December, there might be a serious problem with Nick's head becoming unattached and suddenly being Radiant and appearing in Ta bu shi da yu's fiance's brain during her dreams about clowns causing her not to sleep.

<dd>The score was only intended as a bit of harmless fun in keeping with the spirit of the original page. I've removed it.

<p>A proposal has been made <a href="../../../s/o/u/Wikipedia%7ESource_grading_ca0a.html" title="Wikipedia:Source grading">here</a> to mark sources in (eventually, all) articles with 'A', 'B' or 'C' depending on their quality. Since no objective definition of these three has been given, some people fear that this may cause revert wars. Others say the idea is good but the execution is not. The author of the proposal now basically calls for a test run; I believe it would be useful of some more people gave feedback on whether or not this is a good idea.

<li>An interesting idea, but I think that the definitions need to be solidified more. What makes an A, B, or C grade source?

<ul>
<li>If it is to be done, it should be done on the talk page, not the articles, to avoid cluttering the categories. And, more importantly, it really shouldn't have begun (not even a pilot) without gaining community consensus on both a) the idea itself, and b) what objective criteria to determine whether sources are A/B/C grade. I note on <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compass_rose.html" title="Compass rose">compass rose</a> that two new (red) categories have just been dumped on the article, with no clue as to what they mean, no references to them on the talk page of the article, nothing.

<dd>Ack, what a bad idea. The road to hell is paved with good intentions and all. Invites lame meta-edit wars over how to grade sources in places where edit wars are already ongoing over which sources to use, and provides yet another large-scale tagging project for people to rack up thousands of edits doing, essentially, nothing at all. Given the ongoing citation-creep problem, looking in my crystal ball tells me that FAC will contain comments like "oppose, whole paragraphs without A-class sources". As Tango and other point out, this is entirely a matter of subjective interpretation and inherently violates <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, foggy everything-is-subjective metaphysical speculation on the talk page left aside. <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 20:47, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Whereas I applaud the boldness of the user, this really is a non-starter. For one, it looks crap, it's presenting data that should be on the talk page to the reader, and secondly it's another needless layer of bureaucracy.

<dd>The grading categories certainly shouldn't appear on the article itself. The purpose of categories is to allow navigation between related articles. I can't imagine readers wishing to see other "C-sourced" articles, even if they know what that meant.

<p><small>(I am saying this because I honestly feel that Wikipedia needs to wake up and improve, this is not meant to be a blanket finger-pointing but rather pointing out problems that <i>need</i> to be fixed.)</small> Hello, for those of you who don't know me I was an administrator here until recently. I have long observed and cringed at the way many good faith contributors were treated by some admins, driving them to burst out in anger, which in turn leads to their indefinite blocks. There is no environment here to cope with people's mistakes, the only thing people do is chase away some of the better contributors, even if they are brand new. And I am thinking more of the actual article contributors rather than skilless janitorial work (that I sadly admit make up most of my contributions). I have seen good faith contributors be blocked indefinitely just because they did not quite understand how things are done and lost their temper in response to pushy admins, while regular contributors are often allowed to go around treating people harshly and calling good faith editors trolls with no consequences. I have seen admins swear at new users in big capital letters during content disputes, tell me, who would want to stick around after being yelled at?</p>
<p>I have seen many people argue against <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizendium.html" title="Citizendium">Citizendium</a> - saying that it will not succeed or is structured wrongly. You might be right on that, though I have already long started contributing there instead of here because I can do so in a calm atmosphere. I tell you right now that even without any major drive for contributions it has attracted several hundreds of contributors, over 100 of them holding PhDs, and several hundred articles have been improved from the state they were at Wikipedia (a lot of these changes are quite major too, in some cases re-written from scratch). So look at this, and think how has this Citizendium pilot, which is only in its early days and not even open to public, has managed to get to this stage and is much more active than Wikipedia was when it first started? Why do these people (many of whom are busy Professors and the like) even feel the need to give their real names, give the real life credentials and link to a CV when they could have just come here and contribute with a click of an "edit" button on the much more well known Wikipedia? Admit it, Wikipedia has huge problems, and they need fixing.</p>
<p>Now no doubt some people responding to this will jump at me and refer to the ridiculous Arbitration case against me, where one of the active arbitrators is the blocking admin, and another kindly proposes to ban me for a year. (I have no intention of obeying any such bans, although if I will want to contribute something to Wikipedia I <i>will</i> come back and I <i>will</i> improve Wikipedia even if it is against the desire of the ArbCom). This is <i><b>not</b></i> what I am referring to, I am referring to the general state of Wikipedia, and the spirit of the ArbCom is only barely related to that. The Community of regular contributors is at fault, even more specifically I think it is the contributors who do a lot of maintenence work rather than article writing.</p>
<p>As for me, I have long given up my +sysop and do not intend to return to Wikipedia any time soon (I am only here because of the Arb case, but due to the fresh air of toxicity introduced by Fred Bauder, I think it is time for me to drop even that).

<dd>Wikipedia has some issues, but doesn't every Internet or real life community have its problems? We're not a utopian society, and neither is any of the other societies that exist (including <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizendium.html" title="Citizendium">Citizendium</a>). Ideally we want to make changes and fix problems, but we must look at reality. Reality was meant to be in sharp contrast to ideality, and we must accept our current predicaments and expect corrections of problems are not bound to happen. <b><a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENishkid64_5481.html" title="User:Nishkid64"><span style="background:#009;color:#7FFF00">Nish</span><span style="background:cyan;color:#009">kid</span></a><a href="../../../n/i/s/User_talk%7ENishkid64_b4d4.html" title="User talk:Nishkid64"><span style="background:orange;color:navy blue">64</span></a></b> 02:07, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I can't imagine too many people willing to give their real names at Citizendium. You're hanging yourself with that one.

<dd>I know very well about that as well, which is why I was cynical about it myself. I won't try to argue that this is irrelavent, because I am myself not completely convinced on the naming issue, but what I admire about the project is that it acknoledges that there is a problem and tries to fix it. I don't think Citizendium is any harm to Wikipedia either, even if Citizendium has some initial success and then flops (though I hope it doesn't), there is no doubt that there will be at least something produced out of the experience that will be useful to Wikipedia (even if it is just the mainspace contributions that can be transferred here, but I am thinking more of the community structure). But what I am saying that the concerns raised by Larry Sanger and a bunch of other people are legitimate concerns that Wikipedia should try to address rather than ignore.--<a href="../../../k/o/n/User%7EKonstable_8474.html" title="User:Konstable">Konst.able</a><sup><a href="../../../k/o/n/User_talk%7EKonstable_e0b7.html" title="User talk:Konstable">Talk</a></sup> 02:26, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As a rule, I tend to disapprove of places that require loyalty oaths, uses weasel terms like "compendium of knowledge", and a focus on bullshit terms like "family friendly". Not to mention the idea that things like notability or NPOV is based on "the preponderance of opinion in the English-speaking world". Spare me. The concerns raised by Larry Sanger are there to attempt to criticize Wikipedia and benefit from the publicity, while not acknowledging their own ideals are likely to piss people off in huge groups. Insulting the contributors who do the maintenance work here only reinforces for me the idea that the ArbCom came to the right decision concerning you.

<dd>A bit confused by your statement. I think if you look through my contribs you will find that <i>most</i> of them are maintenance work and probably only several hundred are actual non-maintenance article contributions. I would never insult anyone doing maintenance work as that would make me a hypocrite wouldn't it? I am just saying actual article contributions are more valuable. And it is quite skilless, I mean to write a wonderful article such, as say <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demosthenes.html" title="Demosthenes">Demosthenes</a>, and pressing a block button on vandals doesn't really compare in skill levels does it? That does not mean in any way that people should not do maintenance work, or that they are idiots or that they are wasting their time.

<dd>Responding to Newyorkbrad: that is indeed a general principle that John holds. One that I agree with. No-one should feel, especially for short blocks, that it is something worth wheel-warring over if the blocked user himself doesn't feel that way. Much better to suggest the blocking admin reconsiders and undoes the block himself. So if anyone does feel the block is unwarranted, please do say so. And ditto for the protection of the talk page, though that is probably a separate issue. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 18:34, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In general though, shouldn't there be a way to disable the ability of a blocked user to edit their talk page, rather than completely protect the talk page? That leaves non-admins unable to leave messages, when the aim seems to be rather to prevent the blocked user from using the talk page to carry out personal attacks on the blocking admin (which wasn't the case here, in my opinion). ie. have two blocking options: (1) Ordinary block (everything except user's talk page); (2) Full block (including user's talk page). Protecting a user's talk page must be covered in the guidelines somewhere, surely. Anyone have a link? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 18:34, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was about to unprotect the talk page myself and leave it as such so long as John doesn't continue acting abusively. John's been acting very aggressive, trying to seize control of the discussion and make everyone talk about things on *his* terms. While this certainly constitutes being a jerk, I felt further discussion was the best avenue until he began repeatedly using deceptive edit summaries. This is a tactic I've run into before (<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECopperchair_c839.html" title="User:Copperchair">User:Copperchair</a>), and my understanding is that deceptive edit summaries are considered completely inappropriate by the community. While I do think that not blocking people one is in a dispute with is a good rule, it's a difficult one to apply with individuals who simply create disputes with everyone around them. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Philwelch</a> 05:34, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the explanation, Phil. I've posted a note on your talk page asking for diffs showing these deceptive edit summaries. I'd be grateful if you could provide them.

Do you know what's happening there? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 06:34, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It has become increasingly common practice for some admins to protect the talk pages of blocked users (or even in one recent case a 'warned' user)... especially when the admin themself placed the block or was otherwise involved in the dispute. This, along with things like forcing users to keep warnings displayed on their talk pages and blocks for 'disruption' that consists primarily of edit warring with the admin, are a depressing trend that needs to be stopped. More and more admin abilities are used to enforce the views of individual admins... rather than to uphold consensus as intended. John Reid <i>was</i> being disruptive, but Phil wasn't a model of civility either and nobody's benefit is served by this. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 14:15, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It could be argued that Phil's actions were disruptive as well. What I'm more concerned about is that, as Dionysus pointed out above, this isn't the first time Phil has acted like this. How many warnings do admins get before something is done, or do admins have more freedom to push the boundaries than non-admins? I know blocks are not punitive, but they <i>are</i> a permanent record on a user's block log, as opposed to digging up diffs several months later. Is there any point in a 1-second block to record something in the block log, or does that just inflame the situation? Where should the balance lie? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 21:01, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It seems to me as if the game in question is <i>no longer</i> vaporware. The <a href="http://www.stalker-game.com/index_eng.html" class="external text" title="http://www.stalker-game.com/index_eng.html" rel="nofollow">dev website</a> gives a release date "officially fixed as Q1 2007". The IGN review is dated 11 April 06, and the Cnet site is undated; the dev website news release is dated June '06. From the information provided, the IP seems to be correct in that S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is no longer vaporware; rather, it is actually going to be released. Since the release date (Q1 07) is perfectly sensible, and there is no other information to the contrary that the game <i>won't</i> be released, it no longer appears to fall under the category of vaporware. That is, unless there are press releases/other sources that say anything to the contrary. <a href="../../../o/u/r/User%7EOurai_fde2.html" title="User:Ourai"><font color="darkblue"><b>Ourai</b></font></a> <sup><span><a href="../../../o/u/r/User_talk%7EOurai_765c.html" title="User talk:Ourai">т</a></span></sup> <sub><span style="position: relative; left: -9px; margin-right: -45px;"><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ourai_9e11.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ourai">с</a></span></sub> 21:25, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As explained to the IP, this game has had release dates *numerous* times before, people has been invited to play it before. But then the release date closes and suddenly it's pushed to next year. Essencially, what you're describing here has happent several times in the past already. It is _because of this_ that people and notable sources which was listed claim it's vaporware. Based on this exact same thing happening several times already, it's highly probable that the game won't be released in 2007 Q1. In my opinion, based in this history, the game should be listed as vaporware like Duke Nukem Forever untill it's actually released. <a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDebolaz_4c1d.html" title="User:Debolaz">Debolaz</a> 21:48, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The sources listed there were published before the developer announced the newest release date. From what I can see, the most recent information says that it is going to be published, same as any other game. If anything else, the fact that they have playable versions of it going through testing indicates that significant work was put into the product; if there's already a working build out, cutting the entire project at such a late point in development seems especially silly. The dev says it's going gold in Q1 2007; unless there is a newer source than it (July) that contradicts, it appears to be a legitimate game, and not vaporware. <a href="../../../o/u/r/User%7EOurai_fde2.html" title="User:Ourai"><font color="darkblue"><b>Ourai</b></font></a> <sup><span><a href="../../../o/u/r/User_talk%7EOurai_765c.html" title="User talk:Ourai">т</a></span></sup> <sub><span style="position: relative; left: -9px; margin-right: -45px;"><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ourai_9e11.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ourai">с</a></span></sub> 01:03, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As I said, this is just a repeat of history. Thing is, nothing ever happens despite of marketing and release dates. Say we keep it off for now, are we going to have the same discussion when the release date is pushed back again, and they publish a new release date again or can we keep it on then? Yes, my question assumes it will be pushed back but that is with a very good reason. <a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDebolaz_4c1d.html" title="User:Debolaz">Debolaz</a> 01:56, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Perhaps you could split the difference: have a section of the article for "Past nominees" (or whatever). You could list this game there, with information about previously announced releases that didn't come to pass. The reader can then decide if he/she thinks the 2007 release will happen or not. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Broughton_26e4.html" title="User talk:John Broughton">Talk</a> 13:27, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Okay, I'll be the one to post a somewhat naive question here - and I'm neither supporting nor opposing the decision to block these ranges, just asking a question. How much of a problem have bad edits from these ranges been in reality? I don't mean bad edits from AOL anons in general, I know that's a problem - but are problematic edits from the now-blocked ranges more common than those from any other AOL range? I thought the reason open proxies are blocked is because there's no way to trace edits for purposes such as blocking vandals ... but I thought we were resigned to that situation in the case of AOL anyhow. Is there reason to fear the situation here would be worse than usual? I assume this is a bit of a naive question, as I said, and that the answer is yes or this wouldn't have been done, and I claim no technical expertise, but I'm interested in a little more of the thinking here, if only because I was once an AOL anon and if I hadn't been able to edit for a little while from there I probably wouldn't be here now. Thanks to whoever can clarify a bit. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 03:34, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>First, AOL only rather recently began to provide this completely free service. Before, someone would get a free CD in the mail, use slow dial-up and would then consume their free hours. Now it can be simply downloaded, used on high-speed, fast-loading connections, and used limitlessly.</dd>
<dd>I don't know why only these addresses were blocked, there are other AOL proxy addresses that would seem to warrant blocking under the same reason. This is almost all of them, though. Note that AOL client IPs are much less of a problem. Whereas with the proxy IPs every single page request may go to a different proxy, if the person is not using the AOL web browser he is confined to one client IP until he disconnects and re-dials. With the proxy IPs someone can download the AOL software for free, or hook into it with some vandalbot software and their edits will jump around across the range. This happened even when the service was not so free. This does happen, and just like other open proxies are used to circumvent blocks, the same will be done with the free AOL download.</dd>
<dd>Anyone using AOL is still able to edit Wikipedia by using Internet Explorer or Firefox, not the AOL browser, as those will use the relatively unchanging AOL client IPs, or they can use the SSL connection or change their proxy settings. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 07:06, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I would just like to say that open proxy software is not inherently "abusive". It is a tool that can be used for various purposes - some abusive, others not. Open proxy software can protect privacy. Even though Wikipedia will not disclose your IP address without good reason, assuming you register for an account, the communications between you and Wikipedia can still be eavesdropped upon. However, since open proxies can also be used for negative purposes, it is reasonable to expect users intentionally using them for privacy reasons to register an account and deal with the autoblocks. As for users unintentionally using them, I don't think I'm part of the majority opinion.... <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmedblowfish_0e51.html" title="User:Armedblowfish">Armedblowfish</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/m/User_talk%7EArmedblowfish_5587.html" title="User talk:Armedblowfish">talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Armedblowfish_d1c9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Armedblowfish">mail</a>) 04:30, 20 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Point taken, and well said. I should say instead that, in general, not all HTTP software is the same or should be treated equally. Some of them are begging to be abused (AOL's browser, open proxies), and some don't lend themselves especially to abuse (Firefox et. al.). They're all tools that have good uses and which can be abused. When we can tell what tools are being abused and what aren't, it's reasonable to act on that. Equality of access is an issue, but one that has to be weighed against the harm it can do. We don't give everyone admin tools after all. — <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">✎</a> 06:38, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I must agree; it's easy to say "your solution stinks", but it's hard to say "here's a better one." As a vandal-fighter, I can tell you that many countless hours are wasted zapping vandals using public IPs that could be much better spent doing things like contributing to an encyclopedia. Do you have a better solution (an honest question)? -<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatstuart_7fbf.html" title="User:Patstuart">Patstuart</a><sup><a href="../../../p/a/t/User_talk%7EPatstuart_e8fd.html" title="User talk:Patstuart">(talk)</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Patstuart_a3f0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Patstuart">(contribs)</a></sup> 22:20, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I did in fact say "your solution stinks." As an editor and contributor (my feelings on vandal fighting are well known) it isn't my job to come up with a better idea. I think the proposed (or indeed implemented) solution is a bad one, and it would be less harmful to remove the blocks and counter vandalism on a case-by-case basis, rather than block users wholesale. Secondly, as a professional programmer, network admin, and so on, I can tell you that such better solutions do exist. Consider, if you will, the myriad vandal fighting scripts sulking around this project. If those scripts are capable of tagging vandalism for a fingers-and-eyes review, or indeed reversing it (as I see occasionally on my watchlist), then we need only to apply such a solution to these ranges. If we block four class B's, that's over a quarter of a million IP addresses. Solutions therefore exist, and this solution, as I said, is one of abject laziness and/or hostility towards users of the much maligned AOL service.</dd>
<dd>Continuing, has anyone produced metrics determining how much vandalism is being <i>prevented</i>, and how many positive edits are being prevented? Ironically, during my time at AOL, one of my responsibilities was divining metrics from vast heaps of data. In this case, such vast heaps of data exist (or checkuser would not work), and nobody is putting the data to use by mining it for metrics. Imagine, if you will, AOL making a decision that it would only support users on DSL or faster connections. At the outset, this seems like a good decision. However, with something crucial on the line, such as a revenue stream (or constructive edits from a quarter million IP addresses), it would be foolhardy to unilaterally act without having a firm understanding of what the downstream effects are.</dd>
<dd>I don't have any personal vendetta against the proponents of this decision, but again, I must call it what it is: abject laziness. If people spent as much time coming up with a solution as they do playing cops-and-robbers, we would <i>have</i> a solution already. Consider the <a href="../../../j/i/g/Jig_borer.html" title="Jig borer">jig</a>. When one discovers a problem that will require repeated, consistent results, one does not simply sigh and resolve to complete the task ad infinitum. Rather, the intelligent person will analyze the problem, find its common points, and build a mechanism for doing the work for them. This way, you wind up watching many automatons doing your work for you, and your bandwidth available for accomplishing said tasks is remarkably improved. For those of you taking notes, it is possible to distill this down to one common adage: <i>work smarter, not harder.</i> Instrumenting such large blocks is quite the opposite: it is not working (as in trevail rather than sufficient) at all. <b>...&#160;</b><span style="background-color: #11cbc4;width:52px;height:16px;font-size:12px;p{text-align:center}"><a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvriette_f119.html" title="User:Avriette">aa</a>:<a href="../../../a/v/r/User_talk%7EAvriette_2538.html" title="User talk:Avriette">talk</a></span> 17:31, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Which is why we should not only block anonymous editing, but also block account creation on the AOL proxies, as we would for any other open proxies. Existing users could continue to edit Wikipedia through the proxies; new users could bypass the proxies, and edit from their own IP addresses, by using an external web browser instead of the browser in the AOL software. We certainly wouldn't be preventing anyone using AOL from editing.

<dd>Okay, a new (hypothetical) situation. Somebody from AOL wants to start editing Wikipedia. They can't edit under the blocked IP from AOL. So they go to create an account.

<li>No, they didn't. And if they did, it's not effective for the ranges I blocked. I originally was going to block account-creation, but decided against it after some discussion on IRC. Feel free to reblock with account creation disabled if this would be better. I personally would support blocking account creation. Potential editors can use the SSL service to create an account (provided there isn't a problem server-side with an increase of traffic there) or use a public library or a friend's computer.

<li>About account creation enabling/blocking - you could compromise and block account creation on some percent of them. This will allow a persistent person trying to register to do so if they are patient enough to wait for their exit proxy to change to one with account creation enabled, but make it harder on anyone who wants to register a large number of accounts.

<p>I've directed Jimbo to this discussion. I think that AOL forced our hand on this one so to speak. This isn't just an example of a set of open proxies now but a set of user-friendly open proxies.

<dd>Agreed with Pilotguy. 98% of computers with AOL have another browser (question: if the user can't figure out how to open the other browser, can they figure out how to edit Wikicode properly?); and what's more, they're <i>not blocked from editing</i> - they can register a user account.

<p><b>Indefinite blocks?@#!@?#@????</b> I regularly edit (logged out) using AOL - and prefer the anonymity for sevearl reasons. In the last couple weeks; however, I have found fewer and fewer pages available to edit as the blocks are now being placed indefinately. <b>This is bad for Wikipedia.</b></p>
<ol>
<li>AOL attracts mainstream (i.e. non-computer geek) internet users. Forcing them to create a username to edit is just one more roadblock and goes against what I feel is a fundamental value of Wikipedia - allowing anyone to edit (who does so in good faith)</li>
<li>What may seem like a simple task of creating a username is not one. I (being a known computer-geek) am often asked by those over 50 (which I see regularly in my vocation) if people on the internet can track you - if I tell them my name can they com find me - if I give an email address what can they do to me. And although I reassure them it isn't that scary and give them guidelines. Forcing these users to register means we will lose many of them - and the valuable contributions their age and experience can bring to the project</li>
<li>Occasional editors (like me) who value the anonymity that AOL brings (through the use of an open proxy) - where 1) every edit I make has to stand on its own - my edits are subject to increased scrutiny because of the IP address, 2) I can edit where I want without being harrassed on my talk page (note I know that this can be a bad thing because of vandals) - and can make edits without the baggage of a "reputation" or a POV - I can ask hard questions to positions I may even support without risking my reputation, etc. These editors make substantial contributions to Wikipedia.</li>

<dd>As far as I'm aware, this change shouldn't affect you at all. If anything it might make things better. Also, if this does cause problems for you, your only real option is to ask AOL to either use a different proxy for their subscribers, allow you to not use a proxy, or go back to the pre-open proxy days. If my ISP in NZ or a friends one in MY forced me to use a proxy which also happened to be an open proxy, I am pretty sure that I would have had no luck in convincing people to unban the open proxy so I don't get why we should make an exception for AOL.

<li>May I remind the mob that these are not open proxies, but rather the original poster has said they are <i>effectively</i> open proxies. Any proxy on the internet is "effectively" an open proxy if people are able to use it, as they are in this case. Why the distinction between "i have to enter said proxy into my browser's configs", or "i have to be added to an ackle" and this situation? In any of the above cases, it's a trivial effort to make use of the proxy. By that logic, I could say that any keyboard can be utilized to vandalize the wikipedia, all you have to do is go to BBUY and attach it to your machine. Yes, I am aware of <i>reductio ad absurdium</i>, but indulge me. <b>...&#160;</b><span style="background-color: #11cbc4;width:52px;height:16px;font-size:12px;p{text-align:center}"><a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvriette_f119.html" title="User:Avriette">aa</a>:<a href="../../../a/v/r/User_talk%7EAvriette_2538.html" title="User talk:Avriette">talk</a></span> 22:33, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Do you realize that this change was precipitated by AOL making their client software free so that anyone can now use (or abuse) their proxy network at no cost? That makes their network an <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_proxy.html" title="Open proxy">open proxy</a>, i.e. an internet proxy that effectively anyone can use for free. AOL's proxy network was always problematic for us, but it didn't get blocked until they decided to make it open.

<li>But most normal open proxies have legitimate users (why would you create a proxy if you weren't intending to serve users) who may be forced to use said proxies by the ISPs. The issue here is no assuming anything. People who edit using normal open proxies, even if they are not legitimate users of said proxy may not be doing it because they want to vandalise. They may be doing it because they want anonymity, because they are banned from wikipedia at their school/work/whatever etc. <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 12:56, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm not sure what my feelings are on this. Is this proposal to ban ALL AOL users from using Wikipedia unless they register an account? (And I should note from personal experience that registering an account does NOT make one immune from IP blocks, having been knocked offline a dozen times over the last few years). While I can understand the rationale, I think if you're going to block one particular ISP's ranges, then we might as well once again restart the debate over banning non-registered users from editing Wikipedia, period, an idea I personally support. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 19:35, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is not about blocking one particular ISPs ranges, as noted above AOL users who use FireFox etc. get allocated a semistatic IP outside of the ranges of these proxies and can edit without issue.

<p>I continue to be disappointed that a change such as this would a) be implemented without discussion, b) refuses to acknowledge there are non-geeks trying to use wikipedia, c) disrespects our heratage that anyone can edit, d) does not assume good faith, e) shows no coordination with the wikimedia foundation in the use of XFF headers.</p>
<p><b>WHAT IS GOING ON!!!</b> Spending just a few minutes researching this and guess what - this has been an issue for sometime and a technical solution is in the works with AOL. Are you admins here that cluless about how to sign-up for mailing lists, and yet expect AOL users (usually less computer savy than most) to figure out 1) that they need to use another browser (what is that they will ask, etc.) and 2) be able to find it and then 3) be able to navigate to the same page they were on before.</p>

<dd>Spend a few minutes researching this (or just read the start of this thread), and guess what the situation has changed since July in that AOL have opened up their network to anyone not just direct subscribers. This is what has prompted the change. We don't expect people to figure out the stuff about changing browsers etc. We have a page dedicate to it prominantly listed in the block message, do we expect contributors to be able to read? Yes. As for (3) that isn't about being "tech savvy" that's about being able to navigate wikipedia, if they can't do that either we've got bigger problems to worry about (the site being unnavigable to the non tech-savvy) or there is a good change they aren't going to be able to edit coherrently. As for the XFF header stuff, yes we all know about that and it isn't supported by wikipedia yet, but when that is fixed the IP they appear to come from won't be the proxies, so blocking the proxies will have no effect. Blocking the proxies for anon accounts is the right thing to do, it resolves a short term problem and is rendered moot when the XFF changes gets implemented in mediawiki. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 10:03, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would strongly disagree with the idea of giving one-second blocks. If people have not done something to warrant a block, they have a right not to have their block log tainted.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=Carnildo&amp;page=User%3AGordonWatts" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=Carnildo&amp;page=User%3AGordonWatts" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> The Wr template was often used to harass; indeed I saw more use of it for that purpose than for any legitimate purpose. If the editor who is being warned is editing from an IP, we have no way of knowing if the person behind the computer today is the same person as the one who replaced the entire George W. Bush article with the word "poop" last Thursday. There are some IPs that show good edits followed by a day of vandalism, followed by more good edits, etc. That's why, before reporting at <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>, users should ensure that the IP has been warned <i>for this bout of vandalism</i>, unless it's clearly the same person. (Sometimes you can tell becuase they target the same articles with the same kind of vandalism.) As Yandman points out, a good way of making it easy to review past messages is to put "Test2 warning", "Bv warning", "Test4 warning" in the edit summary. But it does seem unnecessary to insist that a particular IP keep a previous vandalism warning from last month on display.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>With regard to logged-on users, if it's a vandalism-only account, it will usually be blocked indefinitely, pretty quickly. It can be reported at <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> as a vandalism-only account. That's less timeconsuming for the reporter than edit warring on the vandal's talk page. Such accounts generally don't last long. It's unusual for a regular editor to vandalize. Sometimes they vandalize user pages of users they're in dispute with. Again, there's no need to force them to keep warnings on their pages. Administrators should <i><b>never</b></i> block based solely on the existence of vandalism warnings, since some trolls send vandalism warnings to good-faith editors and admins who remove spam links.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Of course, <i>altering</i> a warning rather than simply removing it is another matter. But do we really need a template for it? How long does it take to type one line telling someone s/he's not allowed to alter warnings? And is it really worth blocking for? Blocks are to prevent harm to the encyclopaedia? Does it really do terrible harm to the encyclopaedia to have "Please do not vandalize" changed to "Please do vandalize" on someone's talk page, which will never be read by people coming to Wikipedia to look something up? If a blocked user is doing this, just revert, and if necessary, protect the page. If the user doing this has not been blocked, then isn't it better to have him messing around with his talk page than messing around with Pope Benedict XVI?</dd>

<dd>(Ed. conf.) Only rare exceptions for user talk pages, since they contain information about the user's past activities. I think blanking the user talk page for leaving members is the best thing to do.

<dd>From <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUser_page_1e96.html" title="Wikipedia:User page">Wikipedia:User page</a>: "As a matter of practice User talk pages are generally not deleted, barring legal threats or other grievous violations that have to be removed for legal reasons; however, exceptions to this can be and are made <i><b>occasionally</b></i> (see also m:Right to vanish)." Emphasis mine. It has very little support within the community except for OFFICE matters. – <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChacor_c07b.html" title="User:Chacor">Ch</a><a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChacor_1f31.html" title="User talk:Chacor">acor</a> 07:24, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The guideline, as well as <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Right_to_vanish" class="extiw" title="m:Right_to_vanish">m:Right to vanish</a> (in addition to Jimbo's comment when this recently came up!) all seem to indicate that it is perfectly valid. I understand it isn't done often. So if I have to ask for just such an "exception", then consider this my request. The user in question left Wikipedia after a very stressful time dealing with bitter AfDs. He specifically requested that his user page and talk page be deleted. Right-to-vanish guarantees a user such rights. We should honour the user's request. --<a href="../../../s/_/c/User%7ES_charette_cc35.html" title="User:S charette">Stéphane Charette</a> 07:29, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And he can request that. And he can easily have his user page deleted. But user talk pages are very specifically NOT deleted under most circumstances, as Chacor said, generally for OFFICE matters. The fact that several admins have chosen NOT to delete the talk page further reinforces this: it's just not done. You can blank it and move on. If you want to vanish, leave: if you're not planning on coming back you shouldn't care what your user talk page says. If he really cared, he could request a bureaucrat change his user name. But in essence you've already made the request and it's been denied by several admins.

<dd>I'm certainly not "shopping". I am curious to know why the page had been deleted when the user in question left Wikipedia, and now more than a month later the page suddenly re-appeared. People blanked the page and the request for deletion. I reverted it to get back the explanation and the user's request to delete. You're not going to all of a sudden claim that I'm in violation of 3R while we blatently ignore the the right-to-vanish rule that specifically allows talk pages to be deleted, are we? <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Right_to_vanish" class="extiw" title="m:Right_to_vanish">m:Right to vanish</a> specifically states:

<p>There's a lot of inconsistency in all of this. Talk pages of vandals are deleted all the time.

If not, I usually grant their request and indefinitely block them as well so that an admin has a chance to undelete their talk page should they return as I've previously discussed at <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Archive57_9d82.html#Blocking_on_meta:Right_to_vanish" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Archive57">Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/Archive57#Blocking_on_meta:Right_to_vanish</a>. -- <small><span style="border: 1px solid"><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetsnipe_10c5.html" title="User:Netsnipe"><b><span style="background-color:White; color:#003333">&#160;Netsnipe&#160;</span></b></a><a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetsnipe_6c35.html" title="User talk:Netsnipe"><span style="background-color:#003333; color:White">&#160;►&#160;</span></a></span></small> 11:48, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The only reason stated for <b>not</b> deleting user talk pages as specified by 'right to vanish' is the hypothetical need to access past information about the person written there by them and others. As that information would be readily available to be viewed or restored from the history of the deleted page I don't see much validity to that argument. The reasons for deletion are clearly spelled out on the 'right to vanish' page itself... most notably the fact that it is detrimental to Wikipedia to needlessly antagonize people by insisting on maintaining a record of them they do not want. Why do we always go to such lengths to humiliate and infuriate people for no appreciable gain? --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 14:29, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I used to argue that user pages could be deleted but talk pages should not, but I am coming around to the idea of deleting both. Assuming a person wants to make a clean break, there is very little in the talk page that would be of current use, and if the editor comes back under a new name and begins acting up, the talk page can always be undeleted. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 20:14, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Certainly I recently came accross someone who after being caught in some misconduct had their acounts "vanished" - It turned out that the person in question was already at least on their sixth account trying to hide checkuser and sockpuppetchecks. A blanked talkpage is as good as vanished, as searchengines don't pick them up. But having the history available when a similar pattern of conduct appears is worth keeping it. P.S. The case under discussion here had moved the talkpage elsewhere anyway <a href="../../../a/g/a/User%7EAgathoclea_2154.html" title="User:Agathoclea">Agathoclea</a> 20:37, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This should be handled on a case-by-case basis, but in general I don't see what is the objection to deleting the userpage of a user who is truly disappearing. We should be particularly lenient in allowing deletion of talkpages belonging to users who were editing under their real names or easily identifiable usernames, made mistakes, and don't want the mistakes following them around on every Google search for the rest of their lives. It is unfortunately when an editor becomes so alienated from the project that he or she not only no longer wants to contribute, but feels a need to sever the connection that formerly existed. However, when that occurs, it is submitted that the (former) user's feelings should generally be respected unless there is some overpowering reason not to. As noted, admins can still review deleted pages and that should be good enough to access information that might be needed for any legitimate Wikipedia-related purpose. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 20:50, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've seen some admins block after an IPs first edit (I won't mention names but this person blocked over 250 people in one night when I found that example). Really, what is the point of watching someone say "poop" and "penis", etc., etc. four times before blocking? By now, several of them know they get four shots so they keep going to test4 and then stop. What is the real risk? How many times have you seen a vandal say "poop" and "penis", get a warning of some kind, and suddenly reverse himself and start making meaningful edits? If that happened, I would be more worried - but it doesn't. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 20:31, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Even if we get someone who "gets his four shots and stops", the purpose of warning them is for them to stop. Blocking is used when they don't stop. If warnings make the vandal stop, then we've accomplished our purpose. As for the original question: it depends. If a vandal is making the same type of vandalism that he was [almost] blocked before, then feel free to block without further warning.

<p>I can't think of any IP vandals that have turned into good editors, but I know plenty of vandals that have stopped after being warned. (Who can say if they would have stopped without the warning, but nevertheless, a block wasn't required.) Remember, you don't have to go through the test templates one at a time - you can jump straight to the "This is the only warning you'll get" template (which I can't remember the name of - I normally give test2 and then test4 in bad cases) if it's blatant vandalism and couldn't possibly be mistaken for experimentation. Regarding the case discussed above, I'm not how conclusive repeating the final letter of "fuck" is for determining that it's the same person. Especially when the edit on the 15th was a single edit with weeks of nothing either side and only got a warning from a bot. The extra effort of adding a warning template and seeing if the stop before blocking them is tiny, and it can save unnecessary blocks. We have no idea how often anon users try and make a useful edit, discover their address is blocked because of someone else and just leave - I doubt it's that unusual. --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> 21:45, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The closest we can get to deleting your account is deleting your user page (which doesn't exist anyway) and user talk page. Any more than that would leave gaps in the edit histories of any articles you've edited, which would cause licensing problems (we have to be careful to credit people correctly). I can't remember the exact policy on when user talk pages are deleted, but I can't see it being a problem in your case.

<p>The funny thing about the IP address is that IP addresses can't create articles anymore, so I was wondering if that 4.*.*.* was going to go through with his promise of recreating the article every single time it was deleted.

<dd>Yet more bollocks from this bunch of spammers. I have also had a threatening email, stating that unless we excise all mention of Ecopave's spamming then the "truth" about our appalling abuse of Ecopave (read: reversion of their spamming campaign and good-faith attempts to get their employees to contribute productively) will be published on the Ecopave Australia website. Only it was written EC0PAVE AUSTRAL1A, an obscurantism for ECOPAVE AUSTRALIA, despite the fact that (as a private email) it stands no chance of being placed on the web where it can damage Ecopave's Google results. I'd say that Fact Finder (and the associated Ecopave spam accounts) shows evidence of ridiculous levels of obsession and we need to be on the lookout for more of this nonsense. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 21:28, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Okay, here's the scoop: <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> came to me requesting help regarding edits made by <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a>. He made allegations that the user was reverting other people's edits for no good reason, and that he was violating <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">3RR</a> by using a sockpuppet (<a href="../../../e/d/g/User%7EEdgecution_0280.html" title="User:Edgecution">Edgecution</a>). This was proven by <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> at <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFCU_026f.html#TJ_Spyke" title="WP:RFCU">WP:RFCU#TJ Spyke</a> and despite this verification, Spyke stated that it was his brother who was on the other account. I find this hard to believe as they appeared to be defending the same edits in the article <a href="../../../w/w/e/WWE_New_Year%27s_Revolution_07f9.html" title="WWE New Year's Revolution">WWE New Year's Revolution</a>. A CheckUser clerk, Daniel.Bryant, also pointed this out stating that he couldn't believe that these two accounts were being used by different people. Judging from the article history of <a href="../../../w/w/e/WWE_New_Year%27s_Revolution_07f9.html" title="WWE New Year's Revolution">WWE New Year's Revolution</a>, it does appear that TJ Spyke has been reverting many user's edits to the page without discussing or contacting the users he reverted. Anyway, as per the RFCU, Essjay requested the admin body to overview the decision and do whatever they please. I'm personally involved in this matter, so I am refraining from doing anything in this matter. I'd also like to point out that TJ Spyke has violated <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">3RR</a> on multiple occasions, and I speculated he was using the sockpuppet to avoid a block. <b><a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENishkid64_5481.html" title="User:Nishkid64"><span style="background:#009;color:#7FFF00">Nish</span><span style="background:cyan;color:#009">kid</span></a><a href="../../../n/i/s/User_talk%7ENishkid64_b4d4.html" title="User talk:Nishkid64"><span style="background:orange;color:navy blue">64</span></a></b> 22:52, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>TJ tends to control articles, in my opinion. New Year's Revolution is just the most recent one. I remember at <a href="../../../w/w/e/WWE_Cyber_Sunday_9c74.html" title="WWE Cyber Sunday">WWE Cyber Sunday</a>, he would remove the official name of a match. After many reverts and a discussion at the talk page, it was finally left alone by TJ. How exactly can others help on wrestling articles, if edits just get reverted with little to no explanation? Wikipedia articles are for everyone to edit, not for one user to control an article and revert anything he sees fit with no good reasons. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 23:30, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

Sometimes we <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">WP:PROD</a> these or slap notability tags on them, but a tag referencing <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> may be more precise.

<p>I think this is too specific of a tag. If it's a speedy candidate, the creator of the page is not supposed to remove the tag. Anybody can remove a PROD tag.

<p>An admin, <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetacommand_e660.html" title="User:Betacommand">User:Betacommand</a>, today deleted several hundred fair use images, including many that were marked with the {{Replaceable fair use disputed}} tag.

<dd>I had an image that I had contested the delete of image deleted by Betacommand without comment in this recent set. I have been involved in the discussions about the use of promotional tagged images at some length in the last two days. I resposted another image to the same page, and it was immediately marked by <a href="../../../a/b/u/User%7EAbu_badali_cd78.html" title="User:Abu badali">User:Abu_badali</a> for deletion. The same user then has attacked dozens of images uploaded with a promotional tag in only a few minutes, using the argument that any image marked with a promotional tag should be deleted because it could hypothetically be subsititued with a free image as long as the person is living - in this case many of the images marked were provided by the artists to me directly, inclusing some because no free or even promotional image existed. <a href="../../../a/b/u/User%7EAbu_badali_cd78.html" title="User:Abu badali">User:Abu_badali</a> then began marking other images such as CD covers I have posted with the so-called rationale they should be deleted because few pages linked to them, which would delete 99% of the album cover images on Wikipedia, as well as likely 98% of all images. This is an obvious personal attack, and yet another example of editors gone wild, which I am now expected to spend hours contesting every one of these CSD's or have someone destroy hours and hours of legitmate work and Wikipedia page layouts to match. I ask for admin assistance on this issue, please, this type of stuff is getting insane on here. A review of <a href="../../../a/b/u/User_talk%7EAbu_badali_00c9.html" title="User talk:Abu badali">User_talk:Abu_badali</a>, and now comments being posted on my page, indicate this user engages in this kind of behavior on a repeated basis. I have never asked for an Rfc before, but there is certainly a need for one here, in addition to a block. The timing of the original issue might also suggest a sockpuppet relationship between Betacommand and Abu badali. And as a Wikipedia user and professional journalist, is it just me, or is there a motto on Wikipedia that for every person engaging in this kind of attack behavior there are a dozen apologists? <a href="../../../t/v/c/User%7ETvccs_eb8b.html" title="User:Tvccs">Tvccs</a> 11:20, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay admins and apologists - if there was any question about intent, harassment, legitimacy, use of a CSD bot, etc. regarding <a href="../../../a/b/u/User%7EAbu_badali_cd78.html" title="User:Abu badali">User:Abu badali</a> - in the middle of his dozens of CSD requets in a few minute span of my images was an image he deleted from the <a href="../../../c/a/d/Cadillac_Catera_8e34.html" title="Cadillac Catera">Cadillac Catera</a> page. This was not an image I'd created, it was a free image from another user and marked as such, it was simply one I'd replaced with a promtionally tagged image at one point, which was then reverted, and which I'd subsequently left alone. Abu badali removed a completely free image from a page, the same type of image used to illustrate hundreds of cars on Wikipedia, using the rationale "23:04, November 27, 2006 Abu badali (Talk | contribs) m (rm purely illustrative use of unfree image per WP:FUC#8)". I am completely sick of this stuff, and of the people that apologize for the type of behavior exhibited by this and similar users.

<dd>And now I get to offer a clarification/correction - it appears the image that was removed from <a href="../../../c/a/d/Cadillac_Catera_8e34.html" title="Cadillac Catera">Cadillac Catera</a> was the one referenced below - not the free image at the top of the page, which I thought was the case as in checking the top image tag, it indicated it was no longer linked to any page, and I thought I was seeing a cached page version which still had the image after deletion. Everything else I stated stands, and that was hopefully the only image I've uploaded without a totally clear source.

<dd>And I've deleted that image under CSD I6, since you didn't provide a detailed fair use rationale.

<p>I would like to hear what Betacommand has to say about this accusation, although I'll admit it looks pretty serious. He was only recently granted adminship, so if he is misusing it, perhaps those powers should be revoked. A bot with admin powers would be strictly regulated and unlikely to be approved and he would know that. He is also a member of <a href="../../../b/a/g/WP%7EBAG_f4b6.html" title="WP:BAG">BAG</a> so I think this probably has implications for that as well. His talk page has a <a href="../../../b/e/t/User_talk%7EBetacommand_bfb0.html#Blocking_proxies" title="User talk:Betacommand">concern about blocking misuse</a> as well. Apparently he blocked an ISP proxy calling it an open proxy.

<p>Interiot once clocked me doing image deletions at 7.3 seconds, but I'd already checked each one and opened a billion tabs. That's not sustainable, of course, because you have to go through and get another batch ready. This has to have been bot-assisted in some fashion, if he kept up that rate for two <b>hours</b>. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 13:09, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well at 5 seconds per edit, that isn't so fast as to <i>necessarily</i> require bot approval. And if it was manual-assisted bot, then it doesn't strictly need bot approval either. The issue here was that a bot was possibly used with a) administrator access and b) that the actions performed were not correct. The latter action perhaps requires a hand slapping and a warning, but running a bot with administrator access performing an administrator function, even if assisted, is questionable at best. Nevertheless, we wouldn't even be having this discussion if nothing went wrong. Still, at minimum the block was justified. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 13:18, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Let's think about this logically then. Clearly he wasn't dealing with challenges, as is well evidenced. So if one were to simply be misusing admin tools, you could easily maintain a fast deletion rate without the use of a bot. Perhaps that is the case here? We're making the assumption that a fast edit rate is not possible without the support of a bot, but that's assuming <i>proper</i> deletions, which clearly did not happen here. It would seem then that a bot may not have been used, but only a misuse of administrator tools. Still a serious problem of course. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 13:45, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>no you can't mentain a deletion rate that high for any length of time (I just deleted 30 images in under a minute but only because I spent the previous few minutes doing setup) and physicaly it will start to hurnt after a while (blisters pain in joints whatever). For long term sustained rates you do less preloading which slows the deletion rate. If it posible to delete once every 5 seconds without prep that is right on the edge of what is posible (I'll run some tests shortly) which means there is no way you could keep it up.<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 13:55, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I admit that I assumed that since the Images in question were in the category, and that it was backloged I assumed that the disputes for wether or not the image should be deleted had been resolved. I modified my version of firefox, for a short time to allow for clearing this backlog. I set it up so that if I middle clicked a link it would open up the deletion page with the Image and the preset summary. I also had it set to autosave, and close the tab. That is how I mananaged to get the speed. Looking back of the Incident that was not a smart idea. The reason that I set that up was because of the massive backlog.

<dd><i>Out of the ~1500 images that I deleted how many did i miss delete?</i> -- Well, if you didn't look at the disputes going on on any of the image talk pages, then, technically, 1500. I'm not sure why we're supposed to do your job of going back and looking at all 1500 images, and finding the ones that were inappropriately deleted, when this should have been done the first time. They <b>all</b> need to be looked at, and for more than an average of five seconds. Look, I don't mean this to be snippy, but it is very frustrating to play by the rules, learn about all the image tags, upload some images that do make articles better for Wikipedia users, work with admins to get the image tagging and licensing issues all settled... then have the whole thing blow up because a few Wikipedians decide to change the policy on promophotos. Very, very disheartening, and like I said, I don't mean to be a downer about this, but today, Wikipedia is NOT as good as it was before the promophoto jihad began. Also -- NONE of the images I uploaded, that you deleted, have been restored, even though I am one of the editors who left a message on your talk page.

Does anyone think there needs to be an improvement in the dispute procedure? Currently most of the disputes are just 2 people arguing back and forth until an admin deletes, at which time no one is informed of the decision. This has to be balanced with the fact that any additional steps will only increase the already high backlog on this section. - <b><a href="../../../c/o/h/User%7ECohesion_07b5.html" title="User:Cohesion">cohesion</a></b> 18:17, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Just to add to the fun, now, I've noticed at least one of the <a href="../../../m/i/k/Image_talk%7EMikko_eloranta.jpg_5f4e.html" title="Image talk:Mikko eloranta.jpg">orphaned image talk pages</a> -- wherein the case for keeping the image was made -- has been deleted by another admin, because, you know, it's a talk page with no "article." Which is, of course, frustrating, but not entirely unexpected. Sigh... So can we be bring back these ~1500 images, and their associated talk pages?

<p>Hkelkar, who is an advanced student of physics, has requested a continuance extending from November 24 to December 19 during finals. He has agreed to not edit outside his user pages during this period. While a continuance and continued evidence are arguably futile, see <a href="../../../s/n/o/Wikipedia%7ESnowball_clause_239c.html" title="Wikipedia:Snowball clause">Wikipedia:Snowball clause</a>, as the suggested remedy is a one year ban, a continuance is granted suspending further action until December 19.</p>

<p>I can't stand by any longer. At first I thought I would just quietly alert your advocates in email (which I did), but this is beyond the pale and beyond what even I can stomach. Since no one else seems to either notice or care, I will say it myself. I am furious that you would have the unmitigated gall to stand before the committee in your own arbitration pleading "finals" while simultaneously, contstantly, vigorously, and <i>practically up to this very minute</i> disregard <b>your own word</b>.</p>
<p>In addition, I assert that any admin who has communicated with you during this time is complicit in what you are doing. I find it hard to believe that the admins in question have no awareness of your pledge.</p>
<p>Since I've let the cat out the bag, I'll let another cat out as well. I've looked at the evidence suggesting that you are sockpuppet of user SubhashBose (or whatever). It is my belief that not only are you his sockpuppet, you are impersonating <i>an actual person named Kelkar</i>, who is indeed in his "advanced physic finals", but far from you. I also believe his English is faulty, that he's a friend or aquaintance of yours, and that he gave you permission to do this. <i>He</i> is the one speaking in the IRC chat that Aksi cites, not <i>you</i>.</p>
<p>I can't describe how personally <i>odious</i> I find all of your actions to be. I'm not one to whine to authority figures about another person's behaviour, but believe me, I will whine like a stuck pig if you add a single coma outside of this page.</p>

<dd>I've contacted Hkelkar about this. I have the <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">feeling</a> that he just got the datesmixed up, as he has declared in email to his advocates (myself and <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheronJ_75b8.html" title="User:TheronJ">User:TheronJ</a>) that he is on a wikibreak until 19 December from today. I'd therefore request that <b>if</b> any action is to be taken, we leave it until tomorrow (UTC), and if Hkekar is still editing, he should be warned before any other action is taken. I think the allegations of Hkelkar <b>not</b> actually taking his finals are a bit out of order, as I have no doubt that he is, and we need to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> in any case.

<dd>There is no administrative action to take as the motion for a continuance has not been voted out yet, therefore it is not in effect. However, continued editing may indicate that the request was not made in good faith. I have called Arbitrator Fred Bauder's attention to the matter. In the mean time, if you believe Hkelkar is impersonating someone else, you may wish to add evidence to the evidence page. However, the real life identity of the editor doesn't really have bearing on any possible sanctions or remedies in the case. (It may, however, be related to the method he used to "prove" his innocence of sockpuppetry charges. If you believe this is not sufficiently addressed in the case, please add evidence to the evidence page or a proposed finding of fact to the workshop page.) <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 20:06, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This kind of thing crops up from time to time. Galleries and libraries who own paintings may mistakenly claim they hold copyright to any images of the works of art or claim that they must give permission for those images to be used. However, many countries uphold the idea that photographic reproductions of public domain two-dimensional works of art are public domain themselves. Aside from trying to educate them (which likely won't go over well), there's not much we can do other than remove these notices. <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShell_Kinney_fd26.html" title="User:Shell Kinney">Shell</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7EShell_Kinney_fbce.html" title="User talk:Shell Kinney">babelfish</a></sup> 17:32, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Many museums (at least in the U.S.) <i>do</i> own the copyright on images of their objects. They limit photography, let individuals use the photos for their stated project (book or whatever) and retain copyright over any use beyond that. I am not familiar with UK law at all, but the gallery's website states the following: "We also exert strict controls on all photography in the Gallery, which is allowed only on the understanding that copyright rests with the us and that any further reproduction deriving from the resulting photographic materials is subject to our written permission." <a href="http://www.npg.org.uk/live/copyrite.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.npg.org.uk/live/copyrite.asp" rel="nofollow">link to relevant page</a> I'm not saying this person <i>is</i> right about these photos, but they certainly could be.

In the case of artwork that is public domain, images that merely reproduce the artwork can not be copyrighted because copyright protects creativity and there is nothing creative about making a reproduction. The purpose of limiting reproduction is to maintain the market for their own reproductions, of course, but while reproducing an image might violate the museum's agreement with whomever made the original photograph, its not a copyright violation on our part to host the image.

<p>It seems to me that a blocked or banned user has very limited means at their disposal to appeal the block or ban. If they want to go to ArbCom to appeal it, they will have to use a tedious mechanism of edits-by-proxy via email. The vast majority of bans are entirely uncontroversial, unambiguous trolls or other abusers of the project, but there are some users who get caught up in disputes which perhaps escalate beyond the point of no return, to the regret of all. I have now had two or three users email me about this kind of thing, and there is a discussion on WikiEN-L at the moment as well.</p>
<p>It seems to me that we have three ways of dealing with this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Unblock the account on the strict understanding that it is used solely for the purpose of appealing the ban</li>
<li>Allow the person to edit anonymously or (for privacy) through an openly declared alternate account, again solely for the purposes of appealing the ban</li>
<li>Do nothing.</li>
</ol>
<p>Or maybe some other option I haven't thought of (quite likely). I have to say that option 2 looks a bit contrived, but I also think that simply unblocking indef-blocked accounts is likely to be perceived as asking for trouble. If an account is restricted to <a href="../../../a/m/a/WP%7EAMA_ced1.html" title="WP:AMA">WP:AMA</a> and <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAR_b522.html" title="WP:RFAR">WP:RFAR</a>, for example, I don't see it matters much either way whether it's a role account or the main one. That said, a carefully-worded exception to the ban evasion clause of <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a> would not, in my view, expose the project to much risk, as the mechanism for dismissing frivolous cases at ArbCom appears to be reasonably effective.</p>
<p>Clearly this is not intended for the unambiguous cases, but for those where there is a decent history of productive edits with perhaps one spectacular piece of foolishness which is regretted in hindsight. <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobs01_a89e.html" title="User:Nobs01">nobs01</a> (<a href="../../../n/o/b/User_talk%7ENobs01_e59c.html" title="User talk:Nobs01">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_nobs01_5af4.html" title="Special:Contributions/nobs01">contribs</a>) is an example: I believe he has a sincere desire to contribute to the project (and yes, he could always wait a month), but has discussed the issue in perfectly civil terms on WikiEN-l; it may be that a request to ArbCom would convert the ban to a topical ban or parole. Or I could just be falling prey to Mary Poppinsism again, who knows. Anyway, I thought I'd start a debate because it seems to me that we ought at least to think about it. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 19:59, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't have any examples offhand, but I thought historically this was handled by unblocking the account and limiting their participation like you suggested. I would think they could easily be blocked again if they didn't keep to the arbitration and advocate pages (or perhaps there talk page also) or if they continued whatever foolishness got them to this point in the first place.

<dd>I would go with #1 or with #4, they post their arguments on their user talk page and ask another editor to post them here. This would only apply to community bans; arbcom bans must be appealed to arbcom. And regarding nobs specifically, his one year block expires on Christmas Eve eve (or Boxing Day minus 3, depending on your continent), which is way sooner than any arb proceeding is likely to take. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 20:13, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My understanding is similar to that of Shell. The blocked editor can request arbitration through (ideally) an arbitrator or (if absolutely necessary) through some other trusted proxy individual. They can either request at the same time that they be unblocked for the purposes of participating in the arbitration (usually the Arbs are amenable to considering such requests, and I've seen Arbs make specific conditional unblock recommendations in their case acceptance statements) or request an injunction to that effect as soon as the arbitration case is opened (I've never seen such a request denied without very strong grounds).</dd>
<dd>In cases where an editor would like to have the length of his ban reduced, I would think that emailing an Arb requesting that a Motion in a Prior Case be filed would be sufficient; there's not necessarily a need for an entirely new Arb case. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 21:23, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>This needs to be handled on a case-by-case basis. Some banned editors have made it clear that they are not interested in participating in the dispute resolution process in any way except disruption. Others, yes, need ways to appeal, but those can usually be arranged either through their talk page or through e-mail. I do <i>not</i> see this as a major problem. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChick_Bowen_2101.html" title="User:Chick Bowen">Chick Bowen</a> 21:59, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are personal attack/assuming bad faith issues separate from any threats about complaining. Regarding complaints, he was threatening to raise all hell upon me over the matter. He had already stated in a previous comment that he would bring the matter up with other administrators if need be; the subsequent comment is above and beyond that, specifically in order to intimidate me into doing what he wanted (restore it or else).

<dd>I agree with you, Centrx, Stbalbach's behaviour was "unequivocally wrong", but blocking him for it is also unquestionably not in line with policy. WP:BLOCK allows blocks for those who enagage in "personal attacks which place users in danger" or engage in "<i>persistent</i> personal attacks" [emphasis added]. Stbalbach didn't place you in danger, nor did he persist in violating NPA after being warned. Ergo he should be unblocked. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkerpikker_c3cf.html" title="User:Mikkerpikker">Mi<font color="darkred">kk</font>er</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkerpikker_77de.html" title="User talk:Mikkerpikker"><sup>(...)</sup></a> 00:28, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The blocking policy is to prevent damage or disruption to Wikipedia and contains specific examples for that purpose. These are personal attacks and disruption, conduct that is "inconsistent with a civil, collegial atmosphere and interferes with the process of editors working together harmoniously to create an encyclopedia". A block does serve the purpose of preventing such infractions temporarily and discouraging them in the future. The question of whether a block is warranted is whether that same purpose could have been served as well or better by a simple warning. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 00:49, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It isn't behaviour that merits a block. Neither you nor Tariq-7-day-block-abjotu appear to be displaying much sense of proportion. Stbalbach has contributed since 2004 without being blocked, including on controversial articles like <a href="../../../m/o/v/Movement_to_impeach_George_W._Bush_9b23.html" title="Movement to impeach George W. Bush">Movement to impeach George W. Bush</a>, so snide asides like "though this sort of behavior may or may not be common in interactions with others" are quite unnecessary, and more than likely entirely mistaken. They certainly are in my limited experience of the editor in question. Your own behaviour, making non-trivial edits to a protected template, and then ignoring the complaints from mere editors, is not such as to get any sympathy from me. Edit summaries like "Not appropriate for an encyclopedia as opposed to a children's television program" aren't best designed to avoid conflict either. There's a depressingly familiar air about the whole thing. Certainly no editor would have been blocked had the recipient of the comments complained of not been an admin, of that I am certain. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 01:19, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>These two accounts are apparently operated by the same user. Dermo69 edits while the user and talk pages are redirected to Dermo which makes checking contributions more difficult and seems a little out of step with <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSERNAME_bbd4.html" title="WP:USERNAME">WP:USERNAME</a>. I've noticed several of Dermo69's recent edits that have raised eyebrows, e.g. an undiscussed move of <a href="../../../n/i/r/Nirvana_%28band%29.html" title="Nirvana (band)">Nirvana (band)</a> and insisting on the inclusion of unsourced material on <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scanger.html" title="Scanger">Scanger</a>. I've dropped him a note about editing under one account, but am not entirely sure of precedent / exact procedure on this.

<p>Well, I will continue to post this here until someone decides to check the page out&#160;:-P I just need a quick answer: if the information about the artist's husband name and daughter is public (as in, already published in a reliable site, check <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20051020/ai_n15706508" class="external text" title="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20051020/ai_n15706508" rel="nofollow">here</a>), can the information be reproduced in Wikipedia? As I am involved in the reverting process (I do think it is correct to include such information, as it has no birth date), I can't semi protect the page. And since I just gave him a 3RR warning (which looks pretty much like any of the warnings he has received this month), he cannot be blocked due 3RR (although he reverted the article 9 times in the last two days). Advice? And yes, I have already reported this to <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia%7EBiographies_of_living_persons_Noticeboard_e3c5.html" title="Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons/Noticeboard">Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons/Noticeboard</a>, but I don't have any hopes of getting help from there as they are backlogged as no other noticeboard. Tried to get him to discuss, but he apparently is not interested. Reporting this to <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_page_protection_b2ec.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for page protection">Wikipedia:Requests for page protection</a> would not help because he is not interested in discussing.</p>
<p>Unluckily, with no real solution, I would leave the article war edit for a couple of weeks and then full protect it to force him sit down and discuss. And in case you haven't heard from my previous posts here, the article has been in edit war for 7 months by now under different users, with this ip this month. -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 02:38, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just because it's done on another site doesn't mean it's appropriate. The primary point is: does it serve the article? My belief is that it doesn't. Furthermore, it could encourage stalking - or at least gawking - by people who go to school with the girl, etc. That information may sorta be public now, but not as public as it would be on Wikipedia.</dd>

<dd><s>On a side note, Jimbo has some very pointed statements about this on the talk page of the article about him. He makes general statements about this information being actually a form of original research. He's just another editor and his opinion doesn't have any more weight than any other, but I found this statement to be pretty insightful.</s>NinaEliza 03:38, 30 November 2006 (UTC)PS - I'm not an admin, so take my statements with a grain of salt:).NinaEliza 03:38, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>There's nothing wrong with including the names. I'd be more careful with information about where they live. I have this information for the person I created an article on, but I am not including it on purpose because it could encourage stalkers and other troublemakers to seek them out. I'm actually surprised my source gave the information. If it's a large city like <a href="../../../k/y/o/Kyoto.html" title="Kyoto">Kyoto</a>, it's okay. I'd avoid the small villages. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 13:08, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Ah, the unintended consequences of spamming Wikipedia. Ironically, the sooner it's caught, the better for a spammer's reputation, since Wikipedia's high Google ranking means that spam notices, AFD discussions, and talk page warnings bubble up to the top of Google hits. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 00:55, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I found this article in the Wikipedia deleted articles archives and being an investigative journalist and a reporter for a major newspaper, I thought that its only fair to show the other side of this story to this article titled Ecopave Australia nonsense, For what I can gather after reading the Wikipedia guidelines, is that the above administrator <b>Guy</b> may also be taking part in <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flaming_%28internet%29.html" title="Flaming (internet)">Flaming (internet)</a> against Ecopave. It also appears that this article is in response to the evidence that was presented by a Wikipedia user (Fact Finder) who was later permanently blocked and their user talk pages deleted by Mr Chapman.

<dd>Fact Finder has been making semi-literate rants, frivolous legal threats, and personal attacks for a while, and showed no sign of participating in the creation of an encyclopedia. At one point when I was engaging him in discussion, he noticed somewhere in my user page or personal website that I'm a member of <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Mensa_0d13.html" title="American Mensa">Mensa</a>, and started insinuating that I was lying about this. He's also accused an administrator of abuse for having more than one IP address from which he logs in (as most people do, if they participate from both home and work, for instance), and even alleged that Wikipedians were sending computer viruses to his company. He has the preposterous idea that simply mentioning his company/product name, Ecopave, without obfuscating it in <a href="../../../s/c/r/Script_Kiddie_def3.html" title="Script Kiddie">SCR1PT K1DDI3</a> manner, is somehow a trademark violation. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan T.*</a> 00:34, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

This has been a pattern of behavior with not the least sign of slowing; even after multiple warnings, and even several <b>last</b> warnings, no censoring statements have been given the least bit of respect, and I believe that stronger and more long-term measures are necessary for the integrity and peace of this internet community. <a href="../../../z/a/h/User%7EZahakiel_17aa.html" title="User:Zahakiel">Zahakiel</a> 17:20, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This user has been told several times to change his username, due to the non-Latin characters that exist in it. However, he has repeatedly refused to do so, noting in September 2006 that "Thank you for your concern, but this is my name and I have no intentions of changing it." About two weeks ago, <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMets501_2e06.html" title="User:Mets501">Mets501</a> apparently offered up a compromise (which he presumably accepted) whereby the user would register <a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamaguchi_6853.html" title="User:Yamaguchi">User:Yamaguchi</a> and just redirect that to his page. However, I'm unsure whether that solves the issue; the non-Latin characters still appear in the article histories, among other places. So, is that compromise sufficient, or must Yamaguchi change his/her username? -- <b><a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETariqabjotu_f37f.html" title="User:Tariqabjotu"><font color="black">tariq</font><font color="gray">abjotu</font></a></b> 03:31, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That seems to only be a redirect, no real user exists by "Yamaguchi".

<dd>Hi Yamaguchi,</dd>
<dd>I'm a black girl in the ole' US of A, so please believe me when I say I understand the concept of Eurocentric bias. However, I don't think that's the case here. For one thing, no-one can read your non-latin additions - or at least I can't, I just see two little boxes. The second thing is that your signature could be totally non-latin, if you wished it (I've seen that, at least). I don't know what the policy is exactly, but I'm sure the admins could weigh in. Just please consider it - I hope you don't leave Wikipedia over this (or anything else).NinaEliza 04:01, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Though the reason for the policy may be technical, the technical limitation itself represents a bias. It's one thing to ask new users to change their username, but longstanding users should not be required to do so. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChick_Bowen_2101.html" title="User:Chick Bowen">Chick Bowen</a> 04:05, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(edit conflict) We should probably consider deprecating this portion of policy, as it runs contrary to <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Single_login_specifications" class="extiw" title="meta:Single_login_specifications">meta:Single login specifications</a> (SUL) and does not address the grandfathering of accounts registered prior to March 15, 2006 when this policy change was made. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AUsername&amp;diff=43879592&amp;oldid=43878407" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AUsername&amp;diff=43879592&amp;oldid=43878407" rel="nofollow">[35]</a> <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECan%27t_sleep%2C_clown_will_eat_me_7058.html" title="User:Can't sleep, clown will eat me">Can't sleep, clown will eat me</a> 04:08, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_feeb.html#Username_with_non-Latin_characters" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard">This section above</a> is the perfect reason why the policy should exist. How the heck are we supposed to differentiate between two people with different Japanese characters? Forgive me (and my English, euro-centered thinking, honestly), but I have <i>no</i> Japanese experience, and honestly, I don't think I should need it, seeing as this is the English Wikipedia. -<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatstuart_7fbf.html" title="User:Patstuart">Patstuart</a><sup><a href="../../../p/a/t/User_talk%7EPatstuart_e8fd.html" title="User talk:Patstuart">(talk)</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Patstuart_a3f0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Patstuart">(contribs)</a></sup> 04:14, 30 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Right. If we ignore the "bias" here, and the SUL issue, there <i>is</i> good reason for having this rule for the English Wikipedia (and for most Wikipedias). If I'm engaging in discussion with Patstuart, I'll just say his name, or maybe Pat. But with an all-Japanese, all-Korean, all-Arabic, etc. username, that's not so easy. It would be nice if some sort of transliteration could be associated with usernames under SUL to make things easier for those Wikipedias unlikely to have many users with keyboards that can handle non-Latin characters. -- <b><a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETariqabjotu_f37f.html" title="User:Tariqabjotu"><font color="black">tariq</font><font color="gray">abjotu</font></a></b> 04:20, 30 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There's a really easy and friendly solution to this; instead of asking for roman characters in the user's name and then telling them they can use non-roman in their signatures, why not the other way around? Ask users with non-roman usernames to use roman (or romanesque lol) signatures, for ease of communication with other editors. <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnchoress_3b7f.html" title="User:Anchoress">Anchoress</a> 04:24, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Dammit, edit conflicted with Anchoress and he said close to what I was going to say: While I'd prefer the rule for convenience at least in its current form it is going to run afoul of the SUL when that's implemented. I strongly suggest we at least for now drop the policy and discuss a better one. Possibly we can add a policy encouraging such users to have signatures which include a transliteration of their usernames? <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 04:27, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The idea of using roman-alphabet signatures when an editor has a non-roman-alphabet username works for talk pages and places where people sign their signature. It doesn't work when you are looking at a history page or recent changes, as those pages show the username, not what appears in the signature. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 10:43, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think people will be throwing hints at racism in a few minutes. <i>This bit is about the English Wikipedia and not about any euro-centric biases</i> or anything. I live in India, and I do not have any kind of Hindi/Urdu symbol in my username. Why? I understand it causes difficulties, to users and administrators; and that is the reason why we have the <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSERNAME_bbd4.html" title="WP:USERNAME">WP:USERNAME</a> policy. We are here to make an encyclopedia, and not to fulfill our fantasies. It is a project where we don't derieve anything but self-satisfaction. Arguing that this policy did not exist when the user joined the project is lame and ludicrous. I honestly don't want this user to go, I think she's a fabulous user; but in no way I will accept this policy and possibly give an upper hand to vandals and problem users who will exploit this loophole to vandalise / troll a minute or more further. — <a href="../../../s/i/r/User_talk%7ESir_Nicholas_de_Mimsy-Porpington_ae26.html" title="User talk:Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington"><font color="black">Nearly Headless Nick</font></a> <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Sir+Nicholas+de+Mimsy-Porpington" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Sir+Nicholas+de+Mimsy-Porpington" rel="nofollow"><font color="black" title="Admin actions"><sup><b>{L}</b></sup></font></a></span> 11:49, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

Sure, some usernames are impossible to get at, and impossibly to refer to, and if the user wasn't an active constructive editor, I wouldn't mind. But when you get absolutely stupid needless blocks such as for User:° based on this stupid application of twatty rules, something is wrong, the pencil pushers have taken over. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 01:01, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The rationale is given on the <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSERNAME_bbd4.html" title="WP:USERNAME">WP:USERNAME</a> page. For many people those character don't render (me included) coming out as little boxes or question marks (i.e. each character is indistinguishable), look at an article history and see the list of authors as indistinguishable, not too useful. That is why there is no issue with these in signatures where it is little more than an incovenience if it doesn't render, since you can still see the underlying username by "hovering" over the link. "based on this stupid application of twatty rules" - the kind of quality argument I would hope most people gave up years ago, this is the school playground argument every rule I disagree with it "twatty". We are a project to build an encyclopedia, we put all sorts of practical restrictions in place to meet that goal, this is no different, if you want a place to show off your artistic ability or cleverness in picking a username there are plenty of other sites which exist to let you do that. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 10:31, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I envisaged that anyone reading my previous statement would have a sense of humour or some sense of imagination. Maybe pedantic would have been a better word, or turning a blind eye a better phrase. But I fail to see how indef-blocking a constructive user such as User:° is of benefit to the encyclopedia. I know we all love bureaucracy and doing things by the book, but some discretion really wouldn't hurt. If your browser cannot display the degree symbol, then something is wrong with your browser. Sure, it might be a little harder to navigate to their user page, but was that even a big problem? - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 17:14, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My sense of humour is fine thanks, though maybe I should get that checked since I can't see anything vaguely humorous in your comment, nor do I see where imagination comes into it. Your point here is far nearer my own view on the subject, apply some common sense if someone has made numerous good edits then jumping in and blocking is foolish as is the start of this "they have been told" (again perhaps to the playground, the prefects have told you...). Hopefully we are all trying to reach the same goal and some reasonable discussion will resolve the position or we have <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">RFCs</a> specifically for username issues. As above I agree with the policy and for the issue it would be better if the software stopped those names being entered or we block them at creation, the reasoning being as above and for the other <a href="../../../b/e/a/WP%7EBEANS_2a59.html" title="WP:BEANS">WP:BEANS</a> reason. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 21:30, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Gang, I seriously am sorry for putting this on the noticeboard, but I did not see any other place for it. I really have to say that this deletion notice is turning into what appears to be a heavily biased, unfair group of people who want this article deleted simply becuase they dont like it. The entire nomination was started by someone who was upset that Warrant Officer (Star Trek) had been undeleted and stated that "this had prompted him" to nominte the "parent article" for deletion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2006_November_30&amp;diff=91132585&amp;oldid=91129856" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2006_November_30&amp;diff=91132585&amp;oldid=91129856" rel="nofollow">[36]</a>. The nominator and voters to date are saying "its original research", "its not sourced", "it doesnt belong on Wikipedia". The article could use a cleanup, BUT- it is <i>extremely</i> well referenced and has been written and worked on for over a year. It contains very valid sources and references to live action productions and other estalished, referenced material. I simply do not understand why this many people would come out of the woodwork <i>this quickly</i> (I count at least 7 or 8 in the past hour) to try thier damnest to delete this article. SO- what am I asking? <b>If it is possible</b>- lets put a stop to this VfD. The comments on the page are biased and unfair and are dismissing the work and research into this article. I would say, what for deletion review, bu the same people will visit that page and express thier views there as well. <b>This is a well referenced article that doesnt deserve to simply be wiped off Wikipedia</b>. Someone put a stop to this, before its too late. Thank you. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 12:24, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I see the problem. This appears to be a debate about the reliability of the sources. At first glance I can't see anything wrong with them, so if I remember I'll take a further look (MacGyverMagic - too lazy to login) = 131.211.210.16 12:52, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>I would delete this post if I weren't the AFD nominator Husnock is complaining about, as AN is really, really not the place for such a discussion. There is an AFD on the article, and discussions should take place there.

<p>This has nothing to do with spamming boards. I looked for an appropriate board to post this at but couldn't find one. Where does one go when there appears to be an unfair VfD in progress? And this does seems to be an unfair VfD based on conflicting motivations, especially with the admission that the undeletion of the Warrant Officer rank article is the primary reason that its parent article was nominated for deletion. I am asking admins look into this, since te group voting appears to be completely dismissing the sources of the article and I'm trying to stop the deletion of a heavily researched and well referenced article. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 13:13, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So everyone except you is wrong and has a hidden, possibly evil, agenda? &#160;:) In all seriousness, the AFD (nb, not VFD) really is the place for these discussions. If the closing administrator believes any nominations or AFD contributions are in bad faith, or biased, they can - and do - discount those peoples' arguments. The process to discuss an AFD if you believe there were procedural errors <i>after it has run its course</i> is <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">Wikipedia:Deletion review</a>. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">type</span></a></small> 13:27, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Nope, I'm wrong alot too. I'm just saying there should be <i>some</i> path for those who feel an article has been unfairly nominated. I mean, when you get right down it, whats to stop a group of college kids in a dorm deleting half the articles on Wikipedia as a prank one Saturday night? I recall <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus_Christ_21ac.html" title="Jesus Christ">Jesus Christ</a> was almost nominated for deletion once. This article will probably be killed, sadly, but it deserves better. I am going to try and rebuild it into a much better article. A cleanup notice would have been nicer that a deletion tag, especially with the work that has gone into this article. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 13:36, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>whats to stop a group of college kids in a dorm deleting half the articles on Wikipedia as a prank one Saturday night?</i> Well, for one thing, AfDs run for 5 days. For another, AfDs are NOT decided by majority vote. For a third, if there is evidence of mass collusion that involves vandalism (as is certainly the case were a BUNCH of good articles to be proposed for deletion by a GROUP of novice editors), then administrators would certainly step in, and this might be a good place - hypothetically - to bring such a situation to administrator attention.</dd>
<dd>More constructively: it's perfectly okay to improve an article in the middle of an AfD, even if it's just putting up a few more links, and to mention that in the AfD process.</dd>
<dd>The system for deleting articles isn't perfect, but it's absolutely necessary, and it generally works well - and that system includes deletion review, as noted above, so an incorrect AfD decision can be reversed. And as you note, the article can always be revised/rewritten to a better version and reposted; but do make sure it's REALLY much better before it goes back up. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Broughton_26e4.html" title="User talk:John Broughton">Talk</a> 13:44, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Furthermore, by posting here an in the tone that you have, Husnock, you basically are claiming that the nominator and anyone voting delete on the article is acting in bad faith. You claim the AfD is "unfair". And how, exactly, did you determine that? If an article is nominated for AfD, then it should be judged on the merits of the article. If the article can be cleaned up, it's contengent upon those who wish to keep it to clean it up, source it, etc. If the consensus is to delete, then it's deleted, otherwise it's kept. If there are 500 baseless delete votes based on "Ihateit" and 2 keep votes with solid policy backing them, the article should be kept. By bringing this to AN you are suggesting that this article (and by extension anything <i>you</i> feel should not be deleted) should be exempted from the normal way of handling business on WP. Contemptible. --<font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a4a9.html" title="User:Elaragirl"><font color="SteelBlue">Elar</font></a><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a_7dff.html" title="User:Elaragirl/a"><font color="orange"><b>a</b></font></a><font color="SteelBlue">girl</font><small><sup><a href="../../../e/l/a/User_talk%7EElaragirl_228e.html" title="User talk:Elaragirl">Talk</a>|Count</sup></small></font> 13:58, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My main intent here was to discover what one could do <i>while the vote is going on</i> to stop an unfair AfD. My judgement of unfair was that the article was totally sourced with references and was marked for deletion by others anyway. I even posted to the talk page of the AfD page so those voting could come here and respond to this to be fair to them. I have my answer now, though, and its sad. The article will die but I will try and rebuilt it later. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 14:12, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Elara hit the nail on the head- "contemptible." Husnock, if your RfA was right now instead of many months ago, I would have written something along the lines of "strongest possible oppose." This AfD- like 99.9% of AfDs- has nothing to do with "fairness". There's no vast conspiracy, there are no editors going behind your back to get rid of your work, and you should be ashamed for 1) claiming ownership of an article and 2) claiming other editors are acting in bad faith without any support for that claim (besides disagreeing with them). -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 15:10, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Don't know anything about an RfA coming up, mine was over a year ago, and I never claimed ownership of the article. I was just fighting to defend it and, as explained many times, I posted here becuase I didn't know where else to go and was wondering what recourse one had if an article was unfairly nominated for deletion. I also never abused my admin powers and didnt block voters and won't recreate the article. I did put some of it on my user page to save the images and will try and rebuild it into a better article.

<dd>Husnock, I suspect by now that you realise you have made a bit of a fool of yourself. That's no big deal, I don't think I've done that for - oh, at least several hours. I suspect, too, that you now see that your action was quite likely counter-productive, since a number of us who went to the AfD from here have read the article and find it - problematic, to say the least. Fancruft is another term which, I think, expresses precisely how a number of us feel about conjectural articles on minor facets of fictional subjects which are essentially undocumented outside of the fan community. I thought there was a Star Trek wiki somewhere for this kind of stuff? It certainly does not fit within our policies, and the purported basis for bringing it here is, to my reading, misguided at best. Not that I blame you for working to keep an article you've put effort into, but you really should be more willing to accept the actions of others at face value rather than trying to read something into it, and comparing this article to <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus_Christ_21ac.html" title="Jesus Christ">Jesus Christ</a>, as you appear to do in the AfD, is absurd to say the least. I'm sorry this thread got resurrected, I deleted it because I thought it was going to end up with you digging your own hole deeper, and I believe that is exactly what happened. Not an edifying debate. And now, friends, I suggest we walk away and leave our comrade to ponder the law of unintended consequences. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 16:01, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No I dont think I made a fool of myself. I defended an article to the best of my ability and will write a better one that will be able to withstand a VfD. As for the Jesus Christ reference, I never compared my article to Christ, I said that there had once been a nomination for deletion on Jesus Christ and I was asking what course was there to have the validity of an AfD reviewed while the vote was still going on.

<li>I concur: this is not a speedy keep (and I'm not sure that anything needs to be a speedy keep in the first place). If a bad faith nomination were to occur, it would mean that a person did <i>not</i> believe that an article violated the deletion guidelines but nominated anyway, simply to harm another user. <b>If</b> that were to occur, the "voters" wouldn't go along with it. Removing nominations is shady business.

<dd>Unless you are running a proxy scanner, which is the best way, one of the quickest ways to determine if it is an open proxy is to google the IP.

<dd>I expect that Disney et al will <i>claim</i> that photographing inside their indoor rides (Pirates of the Caribbean etc.) violates their copyright on the artistic depictions inside. This may be true, but then (particularly for an encyclopedia article about that ride) there's a moderate fair-use claim to be made. Even for rollercoasters there's (in theory) an issue, as <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Freedom_of_panorama" class="extiw" title="commons:Commons:Freedom_of_panorama">Freedom of panorama</a> probably doesn't apply, as the photos are taken from inside the park and inside the rollercoaster car (private property both). At least for rollercoasters this seems like copyright paranoia. -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinlay_McWalter_466b.html" title="User:Finlay McWalter">Finlay McWalter</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/n/User_talk%7EFinlay_McWalter_a93f.html" title="User talk:Finlay McWalter">Talk</a> 19:39, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I seem to recall that this is one of those weird areas in US law, where even though taking the photos might be a crime in some jurisdictions (e.g. trespass) if they have signs and the like saying no photography, that nonetheless distributing photos that you took is not generally a crime (absent some more specific copyright or false light issue). However, I'm not entirely sure about that. I know there are detailed discussions of this online. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 20:02, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You can't use a picture of a person without a <a href="../../../m/o/d/Model_release.html" title="Model release">model release</a>, except in some situations (usually "editorial use", which probably doesn't apply to an encyclopedia). Ditto for physical stuff like an amusement ride or a museum: one needs to obtain a property release in these cases. See <a href="http://www.asmp.org/commerce/legal/releases/" class="external free" title="http://www.asmp.org/commerce/legal/releases/" rel="nofollow">http://www.asmp.org/commerce/legal/releases/</a> and others.

<dd>A) In the US, model releases are generally not needed in noncommercial contexts (i.e. Wikipedia). B) As your own reference acknowledges, there has never been a case where the failure to have a property release resulted in any legal liability. They are a feel good measure to insure against the possible but uncertain risk that such liability could exist. C) Any releases would be the responsibility of the photographer. I don't see it as realistic for Wikipedia to ask every site we link to for documented release forms (that may not even be necessary) before choosing to link to that site. Contributory infringment in copyright law only attaches if we know (or a reasonable person should have known) that the linked to material was a violation. There may be some gray here, but I note that major sites devoted to rollercoasters include these sorts of user submitted videos, and absent some more definitive resolution I would assume it is okay for us to link to them as well. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 00:58, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Model releases are not required for <b>editorial use</b> -- last I checked, most newspapers, magazines, etc, are intensely commercial enterprises, and regularly use non-released images of people and things under this rubric. Would Wikipedia qualify? Maybe, maybe not: I have no idea. And if Wikipedia is willing to entertain the risk of using an image without a "property release" in hand, what can I say? It's your risk, not mine. And finally, while the responsibility of collecting the releases is on the photographer, virtually all users of images today <i>demand these releases from the photographer</i> because they know there can be no valid license to use the image without a valid release. Whether or not it is "realistic" for Wikipedia to do this is completely beside the point: this is how the Real World works at this time. Looking at all of this, I'd focus more on the editorial use stuff. Is an encyclopedia similar enough to (say) a newspaper? Does Britannica obtain releases for identifiable people/property in images they use? <a href="../../../m/d/f/User%7EMdf_6f2c.html" title="User:Mdf">mdf</a> 13:23, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I suppose that it is possible that someone could claim that a photograph, or video, of an amusement park ride is a <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Derivative_works" class="extiw" title="commons:Derivative_works">derivative work</a>, and maybe someone already has, but, frankly, I think this outside the scope of our unwillingness to promote sites that infringe on copyright (and, incidentally, our ability to reasonably police). We also don't need to worry about property releases, which are the responsibility of the photographer to acquire, usually as a defence against some future claim of wrongdoing on their part in order to have gotten the shot. As Zoe said, if you find some site that is infringing on copyright, remove the link, but it isn't obvious what is special about amusement park rides or how what the original poster appears to be discussing is "extremely illegal". <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 00:37, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Uh I am guessing you have the wrong meaning of POV. It doesn't mean biased, it means actually from the point of view of someone on the roller coaster, like a first-person shooter (FPS) is from the point of view of the shooter.

<dd>He used the abbreviation POV, I would assume that referred to the Wikipedia policy or at least points of view in the philosophical rather than physical sense.

<p>As a new admin I have a couple of technical questions. They may be covered elsewhere - if so, tell me where and I'll read that.</p>
<ol>
<li>Can we view deleted images - I was looking at DRV and there are a couple of images there that have been deleted (they may of course have been uploaded before the time images could be restored) and when I clicked on the image link it took me to the upload page.
<ul>
<li>Yes, but only directly.

<dd>Thanks for your fast work. I don't see any reason for the capitalization either. Looking at the infobox, I think <a href="../../../t/e/k/Tekken_1.html" title="Tekken 1">Tekken 1</a> could make sense, but I guess the game was just called Tekken since nobody knew at the time that there would be a second one. So really, either Tekken (video game) or Tekken 1 is fine as far as I can see. There's a <a href="../../../t/e/k/Tekken_2.html" title="Tekken 2">Tekken 2</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/k/Tekken_3.html" title="Tekken 3">Tekken 3</a>, etc. I have no real preference in the matter, though - I only noticed it because I looked at the user's contribution when reverting unrelated page move vandalism. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 20:22, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

I am not a sockpuppet, but I have a different opinion over one article, and Dionyseus has reverted every single thing I ever wrote, along with his good buddy, <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkinny_McGee_2caa.html" title="User:Skinny McGee">User:Skinny_McGee</a> a proven sockpuppet who has 3 additional names.

The template he keeps putting on my page says "Libel." I think that's a really harsh thing for a stupid edit war. Can you please get Dionyseus off my back. And also, you should block Skinny McGee for being a sockpuppet. I got blocked and he did not because Dionyseus made reverts for him and then claimed that Skinny did nothing wrong. Also, Skinny is strongly believed to be, Edward Douglas, a subject of the article itself, and every single edit he's made to date is a HUGE self-promo. Also, I have never made any vandalization or misuse, and that template is for abusive socks.

<p>Could I ask someone to take a look at this article and consider the repeated changes that have been made to it in the last day or so? Someone has been pasting a massive, unencyclopedic and unsourced chunk of text in over the sourced article; I bagged it on RC patrol last night a couple of times and left a message for the anon, and other editors have been reverting it as well, but a new user has started on it now, and I'm at three reverts and don't want to break it. The anon and the new user appear to be working on trying to provide a glowing view of the subject with their changes, including changing the labeling of the image in the article, from a look at the user's contribs. Much appreciate the assistance. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Fox_1932.html" title="User talk:Tony Fox">(arf!)</a></small> 03:01, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I stand corrected; the new editor worked on the article a week ago as well, making changes to remove discussion of controversy regarding the subject before being reverted. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Fox_1932.html" title="User talk:Tony Fox">(arf!)</a></small> 03:03, 2 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>This is probably a dumb question but is there a way to root out sleeper socks? Someone is obsessed with the <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Clark_c22b.html" title="Jim Clark">Jim Clark</a> article. (Apparently someone named <a href="../../../p/f/l/User%7EPflanzgarten_268f.html" title="User:Pflanzgarten">Pflanzgarten</a>). I got involved when I undid full protection but the repeated IP vandalism was so frequent that I sprotected. Now he's just using sleeper socks to continue. Is there a way to root out the rest of the sleeper socks before we have to go back into full protection? Maybe <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFCU_026f.html" title="WP:RFCU">WP:RFCU</a> folks can determine which accounts were created by the IPs that are attacking the article?

<li>How do I extend his block to the talk page? Do I protect it or is there another way? <a href="../../../b/p/_/WP%7EBP_c8aa.html" title="WP:BP">WP:BP</a> doesn't tell.</li>

<dd>If he's been warned and banned several times, and has shown no interest in improving the encyclopedia, its time to kill the account. <a href="../../../e/v/u/User%7EEVula_5373.html" title="User:EVula">EVula</a> <span style="color: #999;">// <a href="../../../e/v/u/User_talk%7EEVula_6eaa.html" title="User talk:EVula">talk</a> // <a href="../../../e/v/u/User%7EEVula_admin_63be.html" title="User:EVula/admin"><span style="color: #366;">☯</span></a> //</span> 06:22, 2 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well... I'll leave the account-killing to someone else, if one feels that's necessary. I just protected the page and added {{<a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUsertalk-vprotect_27a4.html" title="Template:Usertalk-vprotect">usertalk-vprotect</a>}} to the top of it.

<dd>I concur. In other cases it would be appropriate to protect his talk page, providing he has had good time to lodge an unblock request. Once that is denied, then there is no reason why it shouldnt be protected. for the duration of the block when they are causing so much disruption (in my opinion anyway). <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViridae_a0d4.html" title="User:Viridae">Viridae</a><a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViridae_b84f.html" title="User talk:Viridae"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 06:28, 2 December 2006 (UTC)
