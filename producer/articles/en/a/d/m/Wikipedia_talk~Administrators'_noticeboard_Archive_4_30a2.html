<h2><span class="mw-headline">Superhorse</span></h2>
<p>I would like to request that this article not be placed under "Protected" articles for vandalism. It was not my intention to vandalize Wikipedia as I am a frequent user. The reasons for requesting it are:</p>
<p>1. I am not a member of the band. I am only a fan. In time the band's publicist will request to re-write the article and provide more supporting evidence. It is completely unfair to the band that they be punished for something they didn't do. I can provide you with all my personal information and you will see that I am indeed not a member of the band.</p>
<p>2. I had only added a title as I was unware of the appropriate procedure to contest the result of the discussion.</p>
<p>I use Wikipedia almost daily not as a contributor, but I rather use it as a tool for my job. I am not sure if you can track my usage of Wikipedia, but if you can you will see that I have no history whatsoever of "vandalizing", misusing, or even editing any articles on Wikipedia. Please get back to me and let me know the outcome of your decision. This article writing process was very taxing on me emotionally and to at the end be labeled as a vandal is a little bit more than I can handle.</p>

<p>As I said in one other spot it seems to me that El C [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:El_C" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:El_C" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>] appears to be trying to impose his political views on all material in ==Cuba== [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba#Healthcare" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba#Healthcare" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>]. One notes that the use of the massive Che Guevara at his site in a forum where many, as I have friends executed by Guevara (my friend was a fellow rebel) would appear to be quite provocative. El C's actions appear to follow a pattern, do an outrageous thing (in this case remove a painstakingly gathered bibliography of material in print, and substitute a list of web sites almost all of which are expressions of approval of the present Castro government, or actual Castro-government web sites) then play victim, take the matter to arbitration and then after presenting fabricated charges, have those who object banned.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">administrator's noticeboard too much like RFC</span></h2>
<p>We all know the problem now. I'm not sure if this has been proposed already, as its too much to dig through (I guess sometimes we need to compile a list of notable things, rather than just routine "sockpuppet suspected" etc. incidents) but anyway, this is all about the blockiness, messiness and general horror of reading <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_feeb.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard">WP:AN</a>, especially <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Incidents_947b.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents">WP:ANI</a>.</p>
<p>What is the problem? To me, AN and ANI is becoming too much like an <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_dbd4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment">RFC</a>. We should remember, AN and ANI is really only for "what can administrators do to intervene or assist in a complex or delicate problem?", nor engage in debates. When a discussion gets bogged down, such as user conduct, it should be moved to an RFC, with an attention for administrators to notice this, perhaps with a short summary (if there are arbitration clerks, perhaps there should be clerks for this purpose).</p>
<p>I'm not sure if I should create/merge this proposal myself, into some other page. When I put this on my watchlist, I might want to peer review administrator actions, just to make sure there aren't mistakes, ie. when blocking someone and it is meant to be reported. I might or might not want to get involved in a heated discussion about blocking a recent controversial user. If I do, perhaps it will be better off in an RFC. People complain too much that RFC's are non-enforcable. Well, with or without the proposed enforcement system, basically what is happening that most of the bite is occurring at AN and ANI.</p>
<p>Long discussions should at least be summarised and have most of the detail moved to a subpage. At the very least, the RFC format should be changed to allow for a long discussion which is clearly (self-evidently) eligible for RFC discussion, as it is now obvious that more community input is required, just with more administrator focus, and not merely an adverserial "I am bringing up a complaint against so and so user". Thus, this is not a problem with AN or ANI alone. That would not mean it would be brought up for frivolous or trivial issues (which would stay at AN or ANI). This way, we can bring the discussion to the RFC, and have the administrator enforcement at AN or ANI (ie. while discussion concludes at an RFC, we can update the summary for administrators to post their intentions, ie. "this looks confirmed, I will block sth and sth for disruption", citing the RFC (or perhaps another kind of RFC).</p>
<p>This kills a lot of birds with one stone, IMO, and is a better alternative to the proposed enforcement I have heard of so far. Anyway, my thoughts. Our metapages under the Wikipedia namespace should be as convenient as reading articles, ie. using the principe of <a href="../../../s/u/m/Wikipedia%7ESummary_263c.html" title="Wikipedia:Summary">Wikipedia:Summary</a>. It will also be more convenient to know what issues are going on, and will increase the efficiency of the project. That way, there will be a lot of postings still, perhaps just as much as before, but we can at least <i>read all of them</i>, choosing to read the more complex part of the issues later on.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Devolution</span></h2>
<p>This page is a mess. It is full of content disputes, bitter arguments, and other things best discussed elsewhere. In short, it is not a noticeboard for administrators.

<p>Copyright 2000 Entertainment Law Reporter Publishing Company Entertainment Law Reporter November, 2000 SECTION: RECENT CASES; Vol. 22, No. 6</p>
<p>LENGTH: 867 words</p>
<p>HEADLINE: Best-selling author Patricia Cornwell wins preliminary injunction barring unknown author from creating bogus "scandal" to promote his book "Virginia Ghost Mysteries" by falsely claiming that Cornwell had plagiarized from it</p>
<p>BODY: In a bizarre tale which reads more like a bad novel than an actual legal opinion, a federal District Court in Virginia recently granted author Patricia Cornwell's request for preliminary injunctive relief to prevent a fellow author, Leslie Raymond Sachs, from using Ms. Cornwell's name or making false statements about her in conjunction with the sale of Mr. Sachs' book.</p>
<p>The sordid tale begins when Mr. Sachs, an unknown author of a book entitled The Virginia Ghost Mysteries, decided to concoct a "scandal" involving Ms. Cornwell so that he could use this "scandal" in the promotion of his book. Mr. Sachs' plan was very comprehensive. Although Ms. Cornwell's upcoming book, The Last Precinct of Publisher's Weekly, had not yet been released, and in fact, had apparently not even been written, Mr. Sachs started a letter writing campaign in which he alleged that The Last Precinct was based upon his novel. Mr. Sachs' letters got progressively more hostile over time, and in some of his later letters, he indicated that he would be able to use Ms. Cornwell's refusal to admit to plagiarism in the promotion of his own book.</p>
<p>Mr. Sachs' plan did not end there, however. Mr. Sachs created a new cover for his book which prominently displayed Ms. Cornwell's name in type larger than his own. The text on the new cover stated: "The MUST-READ gothic mystery that preceded PATRICIA CORNWELL'S newest bestseller." Mr. Sachs sent his proposed new book cover to Ms. Cornwell's representatives and told them that their "silence" would indicate their acceptance of the new cover. Thus began a series of letters between Mr. Sachs and Ms. Cornwell's attorneys.</p>
<p>When Mr. Sachs refused to back down, Ms. Cornwell's attorney demanded, among other things, that Mr. Sachs "destroy all copies of [his] book and advertising relating to [the] book that imply that . . . illicit copying occurred." In response to this letter, Mr. Sachs intensified his campaign against Ms. Cornwell, accusing her of threatening to burn his book. Mr. Sachs began to refer to Ms. Cornwell as a "book burning Nazi" and even started a web site where he outlined and embellished even further his falsified accusations.</p>
<p>In keeping with his "book burning Nazi" theme, Mr. Sachs decided to affix stickers to his book which read: "The book that famous PATRICIA CORNWELL threatened to destroy." Mr. Sachs, in furtherance of his plan, also created a press release full of false information that accused Ms. Cornwell of being involved in a "conspiracy" to silence him.</p>
<p>Finally, Ms. Cornwell filed suit against Mr. Sachs alleging defamation and violations of the Lanham Act and Virginia's privacy statute. Ms. Cornwell sought a preliminary injunction which requested both prohibitive and mandatory relief, namely, Ms. Cornwell wanted Mr. Sachs to not only cease his activities but also to take affirmative steps to remove any false and misleading information which he had disseminated to the public. The court granted Ms. Cornwell's request.</p>
<p>The court recognized that a party seeking mandatory injunctive relief must make an extremely strong showing of "irreparable injury" and must demonstrate "compelling circumstances" for the granting of such relief. In this case, the court easily found that Ms. Cornwell had met the standards for the grant of a mandatory injunction.</p>
<p>The court analyzed each of Mr. Sachs' public statements regarding Ms. Cornwell and found each to be false and misleading. Mr. Sachs even admitted as much in his testimony. Because of the heinous nature of the accusations - plagiarism, the worst act of which an author can be accused, and extortion, a felony - the court found that Ms. Cornwell's injuries absent the grant of the injunction would truly be irreparable and could not be determined monetarily nor fully compensated through damages alone.</p>
<p>The court was aided in its decision as well by the fact that Mr. Sachs had repeatedly outlined his byzantine plan in his letters. Mr. Sachs informed Ms. Cornwell's representatives in writing on many occasions that he intended to use the "scandal" to promote the sales of his own book.</p>
<p>The court was unpersuaded by Mr. Sachs' First Amendment defense. The First Amendment does not protect against false and misleading speech, and the court outlined many cases wherein it was found that "an injunction that restrains only false or misleading commercial speech 'is consistent with the First Amendment.'"</p>
<p>In defending against Ms. Cornwell's claim of violation of Virginia's privacy statute, Mr. Sachs attempted to invoke New York's "public interest/newsworthiness" exception to such claims. The court found this defense "completely lacking in merit" noting that the defense did not apply since Mr. Sachs was not reporting legitimate news; rather he fabricated a "scandal" out of whole cloth for the explicit purpose of selling his book. The court also recognized that, in Virginia, "there is no constitutional protection for even a truthful use of a celebrity's name for the purpose of advertising a product."</p>

<dd>The block is well past, but there is an interesting issue I'd like to clarify (so if I was in the wrong I know not to repeat my mistake). As I (and even Number 6) pointed out in the 3RR discussion, the '4th revert' is not as clear cut, as there are significant differences between the version I reveret to on 15th April and the three newer reverts on the 16th April (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Red_Army&amp;diff=48710415&amp;oldid=48663469" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Red_Army&amp;diff=48710415&amp;oldid=48663469" rel="nofollow">compare differences</a>). As you can see there are rather significant changes (especially in the lower sections). But undeniably all reverts had other similarities. I considered the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Red_Army&amp;oldid=48668306" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Red_Army&amp;oldid=48668306" rel="nofollow">Irpen's version from the 16th</a> a reasonable compromise and a new version, and so I thought I was later reverting to this new version, not to my old one, therefore I did not break the 3RR even through I did more then 3 reverts on that article in 24h. Was this a migguided assumption on my part?--<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font color="green">Talk</font></a></sup> 21:06, 19 April 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Could we have some more admins watching <a href="../../../a/e/_/WP%7EAE_df73.html" title="WP:AE">WP:AE</a>?</span></h2>
<p>I've been watching <a href="../../../a/e/_/WP%7EAE_df73.html" title="WP:AE">WP:AE</a> lately since there is an ArbCom ruling in which I was involved that needs enforcement, and I've noticed that in the requests listed there (both mine and most of the others) there is little discussion from actual admins. Most of the time, WP:AE discussions seem to just be more bickering between parties in the arbcom cases, rather than enforcement of the decisions. Could more admins please watch that page and help out with enforcing the rulings? WP:AE cases probably need to result in blocks more than the average case in AN/I or AN/3RR; but if people post violations to <a href="../../../a/e/_/WP%7EAE_df73.html" title="WP:AE">WP:AE</a>, it looks like the ArbCom rulings aren't getting enforced well. Some of the WP:AE cases that have been enforced were not enforced until several days after the fact (for example, RJIII was blocked 4 days after his violation was posted there), which tells me that we're not giving that page high enough priority.

<p>I apologize to the admins here for this repeat. There will not be another. I'm putting in an all-nighter on this. I've decided to fight. I've posted on the header article. I've also written to Tony Sidaway that he should recuse himself on this case, because, quite frankly, I'm afraid of him. It is unseemly for admins to have edit-revert-block wars with other admins.</p>
<p>As for my case, I have to snoop through everyone's edit list and mail to find evidence of political bias. The issue is about those edits done by Republican Capitol Hill staffers to wikipedia articles, and my deplorable response to what I thought was a Republican-cabal edit-war, Republicans avoiding the 3r rule.</p>
<p>And tonight, perhaps inappropriately, I address all admins to nominate <a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarry_V_35de.html" title="User:Larry V">User:Larry_V</a> for admin. He has done so much work in the trenches on the NYC subway project. He needs the power. He's far better than me.</p>

<p>I think these edits by Malber explain things <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AMalber&amp;diff=47302686&amp;oldid=47298399" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AMalber&amp;diff=47302686&amp;oldid=47298399" rel="nofollow">personal attack</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Malber&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=47396875" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Malber&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=47396875" rel="nofollow">two</a>.

<p>So can I report him here? I ask first because I feel the wikipedia bureaucracy is corrupt. Malber is probably a sock puppet of some admin who hates Daniel Brandt's website about wikipedia and complaining about admins is a bannable offense so I don't want to complain about him unless I hear back from people here. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDyslexicEditor_aec8.html" title="User:DyslexicEditor">DyslexicEditor</a> 21:04, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>How do you reconcile your sense that the Cyde discussion was inappropriate for AN/I with the <i>open informal complaint</i> prescription? To be sure, one doesn't want general discussion to clog a board to which many users otherwise unfamiliar with WP come to report disruptions with which administrators ought to deal; where one wants to solicit opinions apropos of the conduct of an admin, though, it would seem that a noticeboard frequented by other admins, who are likely well able to adjudge whether one would be wholly off-base to question a given action, would be a fine place for the discussion. The point is to solicit the views of the community writ large (especially of admins, who are likely to have experienced situations similar to that about which a complaint is made); an RfC, of course, effects the same result, but we are to look with disfavor upon formalistic and quasi-adversarial proceedings here wherever we can. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 03:40, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agreed. As I said in my earlier post (which was removed when Tony moved the original post), I do think some of the complaints against cyde have been unjustified or plain trolling, but the fact that so <i>many</i> have been made, some of which seem possibly legitimate, suggest that this issue should be investigated. And since this a recurring complaint, not just a one-time disagreement, I think this should be discussed openly and not on some obscure user's talkpage. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force">The Ungovernable Force</a> 05:38, 21 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>I see no reason to object to Tony's actions. PHDrillSergeant was calling for Cyde to be desysoped, which is not something admins (or even bureaucrats) can do. (A key requirement for ANI listings is that they require admin intervention. The only actionable portion of the diatribe was the part pertaining to an alleged sockpuppet of Cyde (whose evidence was not convincing; a checkuser conducted by two different users has confirmed that Cyde and Fake User are not related). People who want an open discussion on an admin's actions ought to open an <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">RFC</a>, not make their diatribes on a noticeboard for actions requiring admin intervention. ANI is not a part of our dispute resolution process. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 11:27, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Oh, and re the "If you want to make an open informal complaint over the behaviour of an admin, you can do so here" clause at the introduction of ANI, the complaint was not informal. It was calling for Cyde to be desysoped, something which (rightly) is not and cannot be done informally. An RfC or RfAr should have been filed; if all that was wanted was community comment, RfCs will do the job. Having two RfCs open at the same time on the same user would be a bit unprecedented, but not wrong in any sense. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 11:30, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think it's probably time to reconsider the "informal complaint about an admin" clause. We're getting some ridiculously petty complaints and they and their associated trolling are beginning to dwarf and severely degrade this page.</p>
<p>Even so, the existence of the clause does not mean that <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> is the most appropriate place. One section I moved was simply a complaint about TFDs of userboxes.

<dd>I'd say that that clause if working just fine. The completely trivial are mostly ignored, the complaints about proper actions usually get appropiate feedback that the admins is doing a fine job.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Article Christopher Stalford</span></h2>
<p>This article has been subject to a spate of vandalism over the past few days. In every case the vandal inserts the words "far right" into the opening sentence <i>Christopher Stalford (b. 17 January 1983) is a <b>far right</b>Northern Ireland politician</i>. This is a POV. Additional the editor states that Christopher Stalford graduated with a 2:2 degree. This is factually inaccurate since he did in fact recieve a 2:1. (rather petty minded vandalism) The IP used for the most recent attack 143.117.143.42 seems to have been involved in other vandalism and has recieved several warnings on there usertalk page. The page has been changed and reverted 5 times in recent days. Does this qualify for IP blocking?</p>
<p><br />
I've done a bit of research, this IP belongs to Queens University Belfast. i.e. anyone of the computers from the computer rooms, 100's potentially. Blocking the IP would, therefore, seem like a bad idea. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarkstorm_9d41.html" title="User:Quarkstorm">Quarkstorm</a> 09:30, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>AE, I'm not saying anything about the substance of your edits, just that I share Pecher's view of what is a revert. My understanding is that a revert for 3rr does not have to be a complete restoration of an earlier version. Any undoing of another's work is a revert, and the page is pretty clear about that. If that's not our consensus understanding, we need to change what the 3rr page says. When I report 3rr that't the standard I use. When I block for it, I don't apply the standards legalistically; I block if I see disruptive edit warring, regardless of how many technical 'reverts' there are. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 19:33, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was under the impression that that is what ANI is for. Unfortunately, AN's scope seems to have expanded to include dispute resolution and policy discussion, when that has always been under the pump's purview. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 20:03, 10 June 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>It's not a "move". It's reminding people what ANI is for. I should be asking people who treat ANI as a forum the same question. ANI is a noticeboard for admins to react to certain issues, or for notification of important admin actions. It's not for discussion on policies or dispute resolution. If you want to quarrel with that definition, then I suggest you get consensus to redefine the scope of ANI, because that is all ANI is for: notifying people of a specific incident that is important, and perhaps having some discussion confined to that issue. Anything more and the village pump, people's talk pages, or dispute resolution is thataway. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 21:08, 10 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The point is that AN/I is not the appropriate place for a 5,000 word discussion of signature policy. The appropriate place for that is the Villiage Pump or the talk page of <a href="../../../s/i/g/WP%7ESIG_e615.html" title="WP:SIG">WP:SIG</a>. The appropriate place for an extended discussion about a user's conduct is their talk page, RFC or Mediation.

However nothing will get solved here, so take the discussion to the appropriate place. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 21:34, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What I am concerned about is that if this forum is barred for Users, then we do not have any place to formally discuss policy with the Management (Admins). Likened to the Workplace, the Managers have their discussions at Steering Committees and Conferences. The Admins have similar forums. The Workers (Users) and Managers have discussions at Town Hall Meetings and Team Meetings. There is now no equivalent for this. The Village Pump is like the Staff Canteen, for the Workers only. For anything official, it is probably ignored anyway. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWallie_96b2.html" title="User:Wallie">Wallie</a> 22:06, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wallie, I think you are misunderstanding the ways that different roles work here. Admins are not analogous to Managers. The "workers-management-corporate officers" hierarchy does not map well onto Wikipedia. Moreover, nobody is saying "non-admins can't post here." (That would be silly, because one of the big reasons to post here is to ask for the kind of help that admins can provide.) We're asking everyone, admins and non-admins, to be more focused in their use of this forum. In fact, this very conversation should probably go to <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia_talk%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Incidents_f3ce.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents">Wikipedia talk:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents</a>. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreplySpang_a627.html" title="User talk:FreplySpang">FreplySpang</a> 00:45, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Arguably it should be done more often, and a bot sounds like a good idea. Anything more than 3 days old is stale, and people should *not* be discussing them on the 3RR page - they should do that on talk here.

<p>Dear Tbeatty:</p>
<p>You raise a very good point; we are being constrained by language. However, we are fated to write in English here, as it happens - and there is also a good reason why there is a single word for what sometimes seems to be separate concepts.</p>
<p>The issue is that, according to some religions, one can be a member of a religion by virtue of one's birth or bloodlines. (In others, one's status may be determined shortly after birth, and changes may be very difficult; thus, for example, somebody baptized as a Roman Catholic would be seen as such by the Roman Catholic church even if he declared himself an atheist, or were to be excommunicated.) Many religions also state that membership in a religion is not simply a matter of belief, but also a matter of belonging to a clearly defined social body.</p>
<p>There are secular Jewish nationalists nowadays - especially in Israel - who adhere strongly to the belief in a Jewish nation, with criteria of membership identical to those for the "holy people" defined by religion. An Israeli acquaintance of mine states matters in the following way: "Judaism is my religion, but I do not believe in it".</p>
<p>Ethnicity is a different and much vaguer matter. Some inmigrants to the United States in the early twentieth century shared certain ill-defined cultural traits that persisted for a time even after some abandoned the religion. (Nowadays, many of the cultural traits have disappeared even among practitioners of the religion; thus, for example, very few people outside some very specific groupings speak Yiddish.) It sometimes makes sense to speak of a culture; however, if one is truly thinking of a culture, and not of something else, then it becomes very difficult to speak of membership; one can be a carrier of a culture to a greater or less extent, but it is not a binary issue.</p>
<p>Part of the problem here is that people are projecting onto a living individual categories that may be descriptive elsewhere or at some other time, but not necessarily there and now. One hundred and fifty years ago, practitioners of Judaism in Eastern Europe did indeed speak Yiddish and live separately from their neighbours. This is no longer the case. When categories lose their descriptive value, they become a way to classify human beings in absolute ways that may be severely misleading as to their actual (and private!) backgrounds. The point is not that Perelman is a non-Jew, whatever that means; the issue is whether or not it is proper for an encyclopaedia - in particular, this one - to classify living individuals by blood, in ways that, furthermore, impose on them some particular religion.</p>
<p>I would agree that, say, Marc Chagall had a Yiddish background (as much as that involves some radical simplifications; one could just as well say that he came from a small-town Belorussian background). As one moves to the present, reality becomes vaguer, and firm categories sometimes become acts of violence against the individual and against reality. Mind you, I, for one, have no objection to private persons' belief in such categories; rather, the question is whether such categories should form part of the general discourse.</p>
<p>Perhaps we should all talk about the matter in the village pump? There seems very little here that is specific to Grigori Perelman. As far as I can see, he is simply a person who does mathematics, lives in Russia, and happens to have a typically Russian first name and a last name often found among descendants of Russian Jews. Some people in the press jump to conclusions from this last fact. So what? <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBellbird_c267.html" title="User:Bellbird">Bellbird</a> 16:04, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I see from above that there was discussion of archiving; if desired, I can set EssayBot II to do it (see below about ANI) and put it on whatever schedule is desired. The bot works from latest timestamp in section, so it'll take off whatever is older than [specified whole number of days].

<h2><span class="mw-headline">EssjayBot II</span></h2>
<p>Per the discussion at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Bots/Requests_for_approvals&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66664108" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Bots/Requests_for_approvals&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66664108" rel="nofollow">BRFA</a>, EssjayBot II is taking over the archiving of ANI; the short version is that Werdnabot is both currently unsupervised and having difficulty with sections that have === subsections. EssjayBot II will archive the page each day at 0:05 UTC (a lot of other bots run on the hour, so this will be nice and offset), and will archive any thread where the latest timestamp is more than 24 hours old. It looks at sections as a whole, so sections with === subsections won't be separated, and == sections will stay on the page until the === sections grow old enough for archival. For those who are concerned, the feeling was that 24 hours was long enough, as the one-archiving-per-day would prevent most from being archived at exactly 24 hours since the last comment. Additionally, the archive number will be automatically increased each Sunday and Wednesday, to keep archive sizes at bay; if this needs to be adjusted, it can be.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Essjaybot II</span></h3>
<p>Werdnabot archives AN but it seems to glitch on AN/I. Essjaybot II was archiving AN/I with a minimum 24 hour delay, but it has been down since the toolserver move. All archiving the last month or more has been manual, mostly me, I think, although I think Freakofnuture is responsible for the last batch, and I'm sure it was an accident if he deleted an active conversation.</p>
<p>Anyway, Essjay is back (yay!) and has got Essjaybot II working again, but he wants to make sure there's consensus to put it back to work on AN/I. I suggested a 2 day lag this time, since (with the exception of the Homey and SPUI business) the noticeboard has been slower than over the summer and I think that a 2 day lag will still keep the page under 250 KB. However even with a one day lag some threads won't get archived for up to 48 hours after the last post since the bot only runs once a day. Anyway, asking consensus to bring Essjaybot II back and whether to set a one day (makes the page significantly larger) or two day lag. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 04:36, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">I found this article in the Wikipedia deleted articles archives</span></h2>
<p>Being an investigative journalist and a reporter for a major newspaper, I thought that its only fair to show the other side of this story to the article titled Ecopave Australia nonsense, It appears that this article is not being given a fair right to respond to allegations raised by a Wikipedia administrator mr Guy Chapman <a href="../../../s/u/s/User%7ESusanfg_cc28.html" title="User:Susanfg">Susanfg</a> 00:05, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
<b>Accusations that Ecopave Australia has spammed in Wikipedia are incorrect and false</b></p>
<p>Why am I responding to these accusations? because this could also happen to any one wanting to contribute into Wikipedia, I have raised some serious issues that if left un-addressed, could potentially cause serious harm to someones professional or academic reputation as a result.</p>
<p>My understanding after what I have been told by Ecopave, is that their people wanted to contribute into Wikipedia "in good faith" by adding articles about their company and products in the same way as many other companies have done in the past like for example <a href="../../../e/c/o/Eco-cement.html" title="Eco-cement">Eco-cement</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eco-cement" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eco-cement" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eco-cement</a>. These users also added positive information articles about other eco-concious companies like Cereplast in an effort to demonstrate that there are viable non-petroleum plastic alternatives already available on the market that will help make the transition to renewables less painful for our society. In regards to the accusations that these same users were also deleting "competitor" information is also absolutely false and misleading because Ecopave Australia does not view anyone as a competiror in the renewables arena, but considers them allies who are helping to bring products to the market place that ultimately help our society in the battle against climate change, pollution and poverty. These users also made referrence to article bias and raised issues about the Wikipedia administrators and their behaviour and conduct, specific examples were also raised in the right context in the course of these discussions and examples were also made to illustrate a point. The gray area between advertising and knowledge based information was also debated.</p>
<p>There was apparently some initial confusion concerning the Wikipedia guidelines and rules regarding editing and new article contributions and user access which may have led to some administrators deliberately jumping to the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sockpuppet.html" title="Sockpuppet">sockpuppet</a> (spam) accusations and conclusions. What I understand is that because large amount of the readable information about these guideline subject matters is spread over a vast area and is not easy to find in Wikipedia to date, has caused these users to continue to edit and add information about Ecopave and its products and other useful articles without realising that their actions may or may not have been mis-interpreted. This matter may have been made worse by the fact that there were <b>3 admins</b> looking into this at the same time and one admin actually requested Ecopave to give (send) copyright (<a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyrights_92c4.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyrights">Wikipedia:Copyrights</a>) authorisations for all the article insertions after which he placed a permanent block against the Ecopave users. The interesting thing about this maneuver was that all the Ecopave article contributions were now high-jacked and linked (spread) to other websites without any author acknowledgements. "Prior" to this incident, Ecopave made the conclusion that the articles were in fact ok and they were going to be accepted without any problems. <b>Instead of these 3 Administrators giving a helping hand</b> and giving guidance, they resorted to attacks and smear campaigns against Ecopave and its users. The above accusations by Guy Chapman that the company was deliberately running a spamming campaign in Wikipedia is totally incorrect and false and therefore misleading, also to turn insult to injury, some Wikipedia administrators and or users were sending Ecopave malicious email viruses (<a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_virus.html" title="Computer virus">Computer virus</a>) to try to further prevent Ecopave from giving a proper response in defence. The real irony here is that Guy Chapman who is a Wikipedia administrator, appears to be running he's own spamming and PR campaign (see his contribs) in Wikipedia by <b>using 3 seperate IP addresses</b> which are clearly designed to assist in bringing consensus into arguments against users who's article (ideology) is not in par with his. See this transcript of the discussion that took place with Guy on my talk page on 17-10-06 which was later discretely deleted by Guy, this also raises an interesting question, how many other Wikipedia Administrators are using multiple IP addresses so as to help achieve consensus in a debate? Fact Finder 05:57, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Fact Finder said, "It is totally unfair to accuse users without proof or proper cause, show me one thing that I have done something that is spam? Right, there is none because I am not a spammer, get your facts straight mister before you accuse people. Im a new user so there is a LEARNING CURVE here also and people make mistakes too, I believe that you are showing total disregard towards this aspect here NETSNIPE, your user name is already indicative of your intentions here, you appear to be hell bent on a SNIPE!!. For you to be a proper representative of Wikipedia policies you should show a little understanding towards new users instead of jumping to automatic negative conclusions. Iam seriously considering not contributing to Wikipedia if this is the treatment that people get in here maby this was a mistake or maby that's what you realy want which would begg the question "what is your vested interest maby Eco-cement??". I seriously hope that common sence and a bit of understanding and good will, will prevail here if given half the chance. I am more than happy to give this a go with assurances that I am not a spammer or a user with any malicious intent, are you?. In the name of peace and harmony I am willing to go as far as to say that, Netsipe you pick what name you would be happy for me to use in Wikipedia just so that we can get along here OK!. And the last but not least matter regarding IP addresses! In this day and age of spam and viruses one would be totally insane to use a fixed IP address and be vulnerable for attacks, many companies refresh and reload their servers every day to erase spam and other rubbish that is accumulated during the day therefore the IP address has no real meaning to measure or validate users intentions and is not a REAL indication of a persons intent as a <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sockpuppet.html" title="Sockpuppet">sockpuppet</a> which refers that an individual is malicuious. The ONLY method that has any merit is to LOOK AT THEIR WORK and ACTIONS ONLY!" Fact Finder 60.230.51.158. 06:37, 17 October 2006 (UTC)| <b>"This is not about the username and it's not about other users, it's about you and your behaviour. If you want to edit Wikipedia you need to go back to one of your other accounts, request unblocking, and indicate acceptance of policy and undertake not to spam again. Mind you, I'm obviously insane as I use not one but three fixed IP addresses". Guy 18:41, 17 October 2006 (UTC)}}</b><br /></p>
<p><b>People can make up their own minds by further reading the frustrating experience the Eco-cement inventor and CEO John Harrison went through getting the environmentally friendly cement accepted into Wikipedia and protecting the facts from being turned into fiction here in the Eco-cement discussion page,</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Eco-cement" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Eco-cement" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Eco-cement</a>,</p>
<p>No one contributing into Wikipedia should have to endure this kind of treatment especially from admins that lack expert knowledge, common courtesy and good-will, Fact Finder 138.217.64.209 05:10, 26 November 2006 (UTC)<br />
I must admit and say that I am a little reluctant to commence to contribute with articles into Wikipedia when this kind of rampant Admin generated abuse is going on. The spare time that I have available that I could use constructively by creating articles, makes me believe that it would all be in vain because they would un-doubtetly be attacked and shredded by these administrators which in effect could make me look very silly indeed, especially in my fields of expertise. <b>I would like to make a very important</b> <b>observation which I have made while being in here</b>, <b>and that is the Wikipedia "open editing format" and admin abuse towards users. The fact that "some" current administrators are able to willy nilly enforce article edits without in-depth specialised knowledge, ( see the Eco-cement story ) has the potential to not only harm other administrators, but also peoples (article contributors) professional reputations in their fields of expertise and effectively turning cutting edge scientists</b> <b>into apparent morons overnight</b>.<br /></p>
<p>I have also been forced to recreate a new user (Fact Finder) profile and page because I was once again attacked and blocked from Wikipedia buy Guy Chapman who deleted all my talk page content and evidence that pointed to his antics, this administrator appears to be way out of control, (shakes head), <a href="../../../f/a/c/User%7EFact_Finder2_9164.html" title="User:Fact Finder2">Fact Finder2</a> 05:52, 26 November 2006 (UTC)<br />
Anyone interested in having a look at what's going on here may want to also check this link to my previous Fact Finder user talk page which concerns accusations by Guy Chapman that I am supposedly a spammer which is a false accusation. Just because I have been evaluating whether I should start contributing in Wikipedia or not, does not make me a spammer. All I have done is to try "replace" factual information which I have written that was deleted and hence turned into fiction without any discussion, in an effort by this and "other" admins to give a totally distorted view of events concerning Ecopave. The page links which require removal from Wikipedia as I have highlighted in these following links,</p>

</ul>
<p>serve no other purpose except for Guy Chapman to increase his own notoriety and link exposure on the net at the expense of Wikipedia and the "dilution" of Ecopave Australia and GE032o Trademarks.<br />
Last but not least, there appears also to be this obvious overwhelming importance on the Wikipedia page,link and Google rank which is constantly expedited by some administrators who make it seem like this is the only important thing that matters at all in Wikipedia. We all know that these admins like Guy Chapman are benefitting from driving this link farm mentality and it only serves their own interests at the expense of the Wikipedia Encyclopedia. <b>Recommendation</b>, <b>Any Wikipedia administrator who copies article contents to other Wikipedia pages for no other reason than to make someone look bad, or deletes text by turning facts into fiction and therefore out of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Context.html" title="Context">context</a> to try to achieve the same thing, or link to pages or content that would make the user look bad, should be automatically stripped of their Wikipedia administrator status</b>, <b>because by doing these things the admin would be in breach of "<a href="../../../g/o/o/Good_Will_4520.html" title="Good Will">Good Will</a>" conduct and quite clearly only interested in exersising</b> "Bad-Will". Also if The administrators emphasis is more in creating web and page links above article content or user help and guidance, the same removal of admin privelages should be made to apply, <a href="../../../f/a/c/User%7EFact_Finder2_9164.html" title="User:Fact Finder2">Fact Finder2</a> 10:53, 26 November 2006 (UTC) Fact Finder2 08:27, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
