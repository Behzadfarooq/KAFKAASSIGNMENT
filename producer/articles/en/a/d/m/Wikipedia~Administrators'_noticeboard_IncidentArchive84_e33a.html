<dd>The problem isn't that AOL subscribers are inherently worse netizens than individuals who use other ISPs. The problem is the proxy server system that AOL uses, where a single individual in a single session will appear to come from a new AOL IP address with each successive edit. This makes it extraordinarily inconvenient to deal with a vandal from AOL, because we cannot block them effectively without blocking all of AOL. In contrast, editors through most other ISPs will tend to have at least a semi-static IP address which makes it possible to block troublemakers without causing collateral damage to other editors.</dd>
<dd>Additionally, the rapidly changing (apparent) IP of each editor probably makes it very difficult for AOL (if they wanted to) to associate specific edits with a specific real-world individual. This in turn hampers one of our last-resort options in dealing with vandals—contacting an ISP to get them disconnected. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 02:59, 17 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>True, but it's great for file sharing, AOL couldn't associate a client with any specific ip, even if a court told them to, lawsuits are virtually impossible! oh wait, that has nothing to do with this--64.12.116.65 03:34, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>At eBay in the early days, there was a similar problem with AOL, not just because of the IPs, but because AOL not only allows but encourages members to have multiple accounts -- and the promiscuous way in which AOL hands out accounts (how many AOL CDs can one person use?) compounded the problem. This was the source of a lot of the rules eBay had to develop on the fly -- for example, a list of domains from which eBay membership required further identification in the form of a credit card. This became onerous enough for AOL users that it was likely part of the reason AOL and eBay started collaborating on various levels, in particular user validation; my guess is that AOL based eBay users were numerous enough that their complaints to both companies caught AOL management's attention (eBay was aware of the problem almost from the very start.) Unfortunately, the only way this maps onto Wikipedia is to require registration <i>with a validated email address</i> from editors from AOL. Which isn't a bad idea; yes, it's making special rules for AOL users, but so what? AOL's overly trusting IP usage policy makes it necessary. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 16:15, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This has happened to me a few times. Usually it's after dealing with vandalism. In retribution, the vandals try to get my password. However, all clicking that "E-mail new password" button will do is send you a message alerting you to the attempt, <i>and</i> of course it includes the IP address of the person responsible. Thus the messages you received. I guess it's technically an attempt to hack into your account, but it's a <i>very</i> amateurish one. –<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdashiel_6d8c.html" title="User:Adashiel">Abe Dashiell</a> <sup><b>(<a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdashiel_664f.html" title="User talk:Adashiel">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adashiel_fbb5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adashiel">c</a>)</b></sup> 05:38, 22 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Evaluation: Colin McLaughlin has contributed for about two weeks and <i>has</i> made some valid edits to athletics articles. The edit summary you warned him for was definitely over the line, and his response to the warning even more so. His continuation to use abusive edit summaries on the Ken Livingstone article definitely warrants a block. I would perhaps have made the block shorter for a first time offense, a week perhaps, but I don't think that a month is unreasonable either.

<dd>Yes, it seems harsh given that multiply blocked serial vandals like SPUI have admins wheel warring over reducing a one week block for edit warring over the insertion of nosnense to an article. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 12:48, 22 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I would not have blocked such a new user for a month, although I agree his conduct was very poor and definitely warranted a block. However, given his reaction to your block, I don't think he's at all willing to change, and the result would've been the same, whether the block was one day, one week, one month or indefinite. I wouldn't have done it, but I can't see that you done wrong, either. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 14:19, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the comments. I worked out the block length by starting at one week given the nature of the comments, then considering as aggravating factors his refusal to apologise and general statements of disconnectedness from Wikipedia (which is particularly serious, because it so easily leads into major vandalism). A slight mitigating factor was that his worst remarks were in edit summaries rather than in articles. That all ended up with the one month. Naturally if he apologises or asks to make constructive edits again, it will be commuted to time served, and I may reduce to one week anyway if it would encourage him to be helpful. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 14:46, 22 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Blocks by the bot are routinely removed unless the page moves are vandalism. It's part of the tacit agreement that allows the bot to run. While SPUI's moves may not be a good idea, they are not vandalism and as such it is inappropriate to leave the block from the bot in place. If someone else should wish to block him on other grounds, that would be quite another matter.

<dd>Exactly.

<dd>Again as I said... getting us nowhere really. There is a majority for California State Route XX but it's not at the 60-70% level. I'm open to suggestions.

Because he never fulfilled those requirements he has been blocked, though he seems to be making some effort at meeting them, even while claiming he was never guilty of the allegations and has already completed the requirements.

<p>Tonight I reverted an edit from <a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EEleemosynary_7f4c.html" title="User:Eleemosynary">Eleemosynary</a> (<a href="../../../e/l/e/User_talk%7EEleemosynary_df06.html" title="User talk:Eleemosynary">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Eleemosynary_0b38.html" title="Special:Contributions/Eleemosynary">contribs</a>) on <a href="../../../s/n/a/Snakes_on_a_Plane_6177.html" title="Snakes on a Plane">Snakes on a Plane</a> as unsourced and unverifiable. It was an edit claiming the entire movie was a hoax, sourced by a blog article. As blogs are generally not considered acceptable sources, I removed the disputed section. I noted that it had already been removed by another user once before. In my edit sumamry I explained my actions. Eleemosynary reverted back, claiming my blanking was vandalism. I removed the material once again, and brought it to the users talk page, asking that they kindly don't refer to my edits as vandalism (assuming good faith), and explained why I did what I did. The user then came onto my talk page with a condescending and rude, uncivil tone. Here are some quality excerpts:</p>
<p>"Your unilateral blanking of the section is very close to vandalism. Apparently, you need reminding of it."<br />
I then asked them not to come back to my talk page with an uncivil tone. I was greeted with this:<br />
"I'll come "here" in any tone I choose. Your blanking without explaining why on the talk page was a moronic move, and you've been called on it. Deal with it. I'll get my source, restore what you blanked, and you'll still be a... hey, you might want to check WP:DICK too."<br />
I asked again for them not to come back to my talk page with an uncivil tone. I received<br />
"I give as good as I get."<br />
I then added the {{subst:Civil1}} tag to their talk. Note this entire time I've maintained a civil tone and explained all of my actions, and been greeted with nothing but hostility. The user then goes and copies the same civility warning to MY talk page. Now I can't delete it, as that would be vandalism in itself, so I <s>struck</s> it and added a comment about it.</p>
<p>Eleemosynary is obviously trying to make a point over their reverted edit. This is disruptive behavior, and I'm requesting some action be taken, whether its a warning from an admin, or anything beyond that (I think a warning would be appropriate). <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">⇒</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Iceland.svg_bd47.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/ce/Flag_of_Iceland.svg/18px-Flag_of_Iceland.svg.png" alt="" width="18" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Iceland.svg_bd47.html" /></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Swatjester_088b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Swatjester"><small><sup>Ready</sup></small></a> <a href="../../../r/s/t/RSTA_5dcc.html" title="RSTA"><small>Aim</small></a> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_United_States_Armed_Forces_74b7.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject United States Armed Forces"><small><sub>Fire!</sub></small></a> 09:16, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

I wasn't refering to that, I was referring to the {{Civil1}}, as I mentioned on your talk.

<dd>You stated "they just blanked their warnings." More disingenuousness. You sent me one official warning, which I have retained. I have also retained Pathoschild's advice, though it was not an official warning. You seem to want to buttress your case by suggesting that it was. This all got off to a bad start when you unilaterally blanked my entry on the <a href="../../../s/n/a/Snakes_On_A_Plane_08c8.html" title="Snakes On A Plane">Snakes On A Plane</a> page without giving a reason why in the edit summary or the Talk Page, then went into high dudgeon when I reminded you that this could be construed as vandalism.

<dd>Freak, you admonished me to not to blank my Talk Page. Funny thing is, I didn't blank it. I blanked some comments on it, and some warnings, which you reverted. Then, I blanked the comments (but left the warnings). Yet, you still reverted it. I left you a message on your Talk Page, which I assume you have not seen.

I feel it shold also be pointed out that Eleemosynary's harassment, stalking and attacks on users have been found on other pages as well. Specifically the Mark Levin page, plus a number of other pages for conservative broadcasters, where he has been pushing his POV. He is uncivil, demeaning of other users, and not conducive to the community that you are trying to build. He has been warned by administrators for this on several occasions. <a href="../../../8/8/2E/User%7E88.108.195.104.html" title="User:88.108.195.104">88.108.195.104</a> 18:12, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have blocked user:207.229.174.14 for 24 hrs. He/it has made hundreds of edits in the last couple of days, many simply substituting "anabolic steroid" for any use of the word steroid in all kinds of articles, including medical. Most of the changes are inappropriate, many are flat wrong as different steroids are being referred to. There is no user page. Is he using some kind of bot or is he on a one man mission of stupid vandalism? I have reversed dozens of the edits but suspect there are many more.

<dd>Then your bet will be wasted. I am not out to violate anything, that is not honorable and I do not do things knowingly to violate wikipedia rules. Please do not insinuate that I would. I do have a right to expect others will act in good faith and not revert without discussion, which is what Jersey Devil had done among others. I worked with Slimvirgin to ferret out the edit by HK to address people's concerns (namely 172, Rd232) and such said editors continued to complain, coming up with a definition of privatization that has no clear source or reference and looks like 'original research.' There is no consensus there, if so it would be to keep HK edit after it was cleaned up by myself and Slimvirgin (with further citations I submitted to talk prior to the protection)...Samspade would most likely agree to this as well. --<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthmeister_77ef.html" title="User:Northmeister">Northmeister</a> 01:59, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>I did notice.

<dd>Sanity check being exactly what is required in this situation. I have no problem with your protection, I just felt that something so obviously inappropriate, and with such unhelpful debate about it, should not be in the public version whilst lengthy and unproductive debate about it continues. I know PP doesn't <i>endorse</i> a page version, but it nonetheless shows one to the public rather than another. Since we are here to build an encyclopedia, we cannot entirely ignore this. As for insulting you, where do you get that idea?? We're here to build an encyclopedia, ego has no place in it. It's not like I reversed an action of yours - unlike you.

<dd>Rd, admins are not allowed to edit protected pages, except in very limited circumstances (to correct a typo, for example). The section may be inappropriate, but not to the point where it must absolutely be removed as an emergency regardless of page protection. All we're waiting for, I believe, is for Northmeister to produce sources showing that outsourcing is regarded as a form of privatization. There's nothing so scandalous in that that an admin has to violate page protection because of it. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 05:11, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry, but I disagree. Sourcing on that issue is irrelevant as to whether the section belongs in the article - see my comments (muchly ignored by everyone else while they get bogged down in irrelevant definitional issues) on the Talk page. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/d/2/User_talk%7ERd232_56da.html" title="User talk:Rd232">talk</a></sup> 05:57, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Concur with SlimVirgin. Rd232, you're sitting too close to the screen, as it were, if you think leaving that para in for a little while poses any threat to the encyclopedia.

<dd>It follows a vandalism pattern over the past couple days of both the Large Numbers vandal, and the Wheels vandal, which is why I reported it. Regardless, Science3456 was created as a sock of the prior blocks and should be kept blocked for evasion anyway. The names that they were putting the sockpuppet tags on, while having weird usernames, had made absolutely no posts. If there's no posts, how can they be a sock for sure? Thus Science and his socks such as froogle, were committing vandalism. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">⇒</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Iceland.svg_bd47.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/ce/Flag_of_Iceland.svg/18px-Flag_of_Iceland.svg.png" alt="" width="18" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Iceland.svg_bd47.html" /></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Swatjester_088b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Swatjester"><small><sup>Ready</sup></small></a> <a href="../../../r/s/t/RSTA_5dcc.html" title="RSTA"><small>Aim</small></a> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_United_States_Armed_Forces_74b7.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject United States Armed Forces"><small><sub>Fire!</sub></small></a> 02:30, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A revert war on naming conventions is currently going on on several ROC related articles. An anon is disputing the previous consensus where introductory references to the ROC are appended with the common short form "<a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_China_4cac.html" title="Republic of China">Republic of China</a> (Taiwan)" (see <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28Chinese%29_8f6a.html#Political_NPOV" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (Chinese)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (Chinese)#Political NPOV</a>. The anon has appeared to have used several sockpuppets so far and has refused to acknowledge or discuss the previous consensus when efforts were made at contact. Affected articles include:</p>

<dd>Apologies: E-Z Vauxhall Driver</dd>
<dd>Secretary: Thousand Sons</dd>
<dd>1. Beatdown productivity down by 12% on last month. Madd Hamsta to look into. Suggested this may be a temporary blip resulting from the recent shift of focus from 'critical' to 'lyrical' beatdowns.</dd>
<dd>2. Ice Dogg complained that CaPiTaL lEtTa AlTeRnAtA had owed the crack kitty $2.67 for two months. AlTeRnAtA replied that Dogg could "stuff it up his ass in pennies". A full and frank exchange of views was held.</dd>
<dd>3. Full and frank exchange of views aborted due to running out of bullets.</dd>
<dd>4. Mad Hamsta to order more bullets.</dd>
<dd>5. <b>Any other business</b>: Masta Bater questioned the long-standing constitutional policy of "Bros before hos". Argued that this was unrealistic, and that particularly fine hos should surely take precedence over some particularly fronting bros. Agreed to form a sub-committee to research how fine a ho needs to be. Members and budget to be decided later.</dd>

It meets several criteria for blocking. First of all, it disrupts the editing process. It basically spams Wikipedians who then must go back and (re-)tag images. True, these Wikipedians were responsible in the first place for not following image-tagging rules, but we must decide what we want this project to be. Are we going to let the rules fill talk-pages and make Wikipedian morale suffer? The way I see it, OrphanBot is a horrible thing that invariably acts in *bad faith*. I saw one case where a user left due to OrphanBot’s incessant spamming of him and ultimate deletion of his content, which could have been very important content.</p>
<p>OrphanBot is also inefficient inasmuch as many users will simply appease it by placing the wrong tag, just to save their important images and to get the obnoxious OrphanBot to leave them alone. It would be much better to simply have Wikipedians looking out for image-policy violations, since Wikipedians are able to follow-up. OrphanBot is easily fooled and I have to wonder how many great images it’s caused us to lose for no reason other than to stroke its creator’s ego.</p>

<dd>I agree with you 100% that copyright should not be taken a joke, but like I said OrphanBot is not efficient. People get so annoyed with it that they'll just stick any old tag on their image (&amp; I know because I've done it) and then not learn their lesson. In addition, the bot makes mistakes and will continue harassing you sometimes even after you've put everything on the page that logically needs to be there (i.e. the times when you actually put the right tag on instead of just trying to shut the damn thing up.) A peer-to-peer system is much better since the templates would not pile up on talk pages so much (I have about 5 on mine right now) and it would decrease aggravation. Remember, Wikipedia could survive without the bot.

<dd>The problem is the image taggers. OrphanBot merely carries the image tags out. Some people continue to tag an image as "no source" despite it being self-evident that the user created it. For example, I have uploaded an image with the summary, "by me" and it was still tagged as no source because I used the GFDL template rather than GFDL-self. I later found out it was deleted. This infuriated me quite a bit. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Elle <small><sub><font color="#CC9920">vécut heureuse</font></sub></small> <small><font color="blue"><sup>à jamais</sup></font></small></a> (<a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENatalinasmpf_9405.html" title="User talk:Natalinasmpf">Be eudaimonic!</a>) 15:32, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The way I look at it is simply that Orphanbot is far better than having nothing (ie, hoping some wikipedians decide to sort through the then-massive backlog of untagged images). Sure, some people may find it annoying, but think of it this way: Once you learn how to properly tag images, you never hear from it again. Sure, incorrect tagging is a big problem, but not one that should be blamed on Orphanbot. I have a feeling that users that mistag images would do the same thing if told by another person that their image was untagged. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 17:23, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yep. I think OrphanBot's doing a great service with image tagging; the actual humans doing the tagging and deleting are the ones who occasionally screw up, and would do so, bot or no. This is a really humongous problem, to the point where it would be impossible for a human to tackle without automated assistance, and from what I've seen of OrphanBot it does its task quite well. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindspillage_87a5.html" title="User:Mindspillage">Mindspillage</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMindspillage_c644.html" title="User talk:Mindspillage">(spill yours?)</a> 01:23, 26 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think the functions that OrphanBot are undertaking are good ones, but I think it should be taken down a notch. It is behaving a bit over-zealously. I am particularly concerned about the occasional user that visits less frequently than once a week, who may not see the tag and find their contributions deleted. I was working with someone trying to track down a source and a picture got deleted. Here are some possible modifications to its behavior:
<ol>
<li>Extend the time period to longer than a week. I'd vote for a month. I've seen several images deleted from users that do not visit frequently, and thus are unaware that their images were deleted. I'm afraid to go on vacation.</li>
<li>Many images were uploaded before there were tags or rules. Assume good faith on any old images by putting them in a category to be reviewed by a human who can make sense of an edit history that says "by me".</li>
<li>Create an easy way for people to remove the image from the destructive powers of the bot. Perhaps a template for images that are being researched. Also have instructions with the bot's warning about how to add such a tag.</li>
<li>Create some standard templates for adding source material that is independent of the language of the Wikipedia version an image is uploaded to. I've copied many images from Japanese Wikipedia and it is very difficult to determine who the creator of the image is without being able to read Japanese. An iconic format would make it possible to get the information no matter what the language. Create new fields in the image upload page that must get completed (date of copyright, photographer, etc..), with options to say "unknown". These would be automatically inserted into the iconic image-information-template.</li>

<li>The seven-day limit is official policy, decreed by Jimbo Wales. If you want it changed, bring it up with him. (And before R.D.H starts shouting <a href="../../../n/u/r/Nuremberg_Defense_092c.html" title="Nuremberg Defense">Nuremberg Defense</a> again, it's a policy I agree with)</li>
<li>Image tagging has only been a policy for a little over two years now. Any image that hasn't been tagged or sourced despite extensive warnings, two major tagging drives, and plenty of notice probably won't ever be. If the upload history says "by me", then presumably the person who tagged the image and the person who deleted it had good reason to ignore it.</li>
<li>You've got seven days from the day the tag is put on. If that's not long enough, save the image to your hard drive and re-upload it once you've found the answer.</li>
<li>A good idea, if you can come up with something. In the mean time, there's <a href="../../../b/a/b/WP%7EBABEL_9c8a.html" title="WP:BABEL">WP:BABEL</a>.</li>

<dd>It's difficult to respond, because many of the premises of the argument are factually incorrect. Orphanbot doesn't make any decision with regards to any image, it doesn't <i>decide</i> something is not sourced or licensed, human editors do. It also doesn't delete image, human administrators do. Orphanbot's main roles are informing uploaders that the image might be deleted (a service not at all required by policy) and delinking the image from articles, which is a way to notify people who may be interesting in the articles that something is wrong, and help the admins when we are deleting images that are at least 7 days old (almost always longer since we are very backlogged). Assuming your only complaint is that you are notified about images that might be deleted (since all other aspects of your argument are substantively false) I don't know what would be more helpful. I agree that if you are a new user uploading, say, 15 unsourced images the amount of messages and general response might be overwhelming, but you are, in fact, creating a lot of work for people. I think the message the bot leaves is fairly helpful, but you also seem to think no one will read it, so that might be moot. If the bot didn't help at all the messages usually used are {{<a href="../../../i/m/a/Template%7EImage_source_e42f.html" title="Template:Image source">image source</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../i/m/a/Template%7EImage_copyright_7b96.html" title="Template:Image copyright">image copyright</a>}}, which, to me, seem pretty similar in tone and content to what orphanbot does. We have also recently created <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_legality_questions_60d2.html" title="Wikipedia:Image legality questions">Wikipedia:Image legality questions</a> for people to get help with images they have been notified about, and links to that page are included in the two templates listed above as well as orphanbot's message.</dd>

<dd>I guess my question is, I understand your frustration with having to tag images and say where the source was, and with the general copyright law of the US, but what would be the solution? It sounds like maybe you would prefer us to not worry about it? Also, remember that hundreds of images are uploaded everyday with incomplete information, so any solution needs to take that into account. As people have said above, if there is a mistake it's some human editor's mistake, we all make them, but remember for every mistake that an image tagger makes there are probably 1000 images they have tagged correctly and saved from being deleted. That's the ultimate goal, to save images we can, and lessen the legal liability of Wikipedia by removing the ones we can't. There are tens of thousands of untagged images, and as of now we just don't have enough people to not use any automation - <a href="../../../c/o/h/User%7ECohesion_07b5.html" title="User:Cohesion"><font style="color:#137300;"><b>cohesion</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/h/User_talk%7ECohesion_c433.html" title="User talk:Cohesion"><font style="color:#f98c0d;"><b>t</b></font></a></sup> 06:28, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I would feel better if the seven days began to tick when the uploader was notified or when the image was removed from articles (thus notifying the articles' community). Often the person doing the tagging does neither, and since OrphanBot typically doesn't visit until the fifth day, both the uploader and article's editors sometimes only discover two days in advance that the picture is in danger. Many nonwikipediaholics will miss that window entirely, and the burden of trying to research and save the image falls to the admin on day 8. I propose that either OrphanBot visit tagged images earlier in the week, or that it postdate the NL/NS tags to 7 days after its visit. <i><b>×</b></i><a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeegs_1f3c.html" title="User:Meegs">Meegs</a> 12:45, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The user notification is almost immediatly after tagging from my experience, the delinking from the article happens later though.

<dd>True, but I think the image removal is often the more important of the two notifications, since the unloaders of long-standing images have often left Wikipedia. OrphanBot's detractors don't realize that the image removal is, in large part, an attempt to help save the image; I don't see any reason why it shouldn't be done at the earliest possible time. <i><b>×</b></i><a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeegs_1f3c.html" title="User:Meegs">Meegs</a> 18:16, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, removing the link a week before deleting the picture would help with my frustration. I work on scores of articles in which I did not contribute the picture. I am trying to source some of these images, and the tagging by the bot has inspired me to do this (along with Carnildo's prompting). But almost every day I find out that an image on an article I watch has been deleted and there is nothing I can do at that point to save them, other than try and get the original contributor to upload them again with proper tags. -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuelWantman_9090.html" title="User:SamuelWantman">Samuel Wantman</a> 22:14, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nonono. First, you (Latinus) already have a conflicting bias in this situation: you have been notified (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Latinus&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=45344415" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Latinus&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=45344415" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Latinus&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=45344415</a>) via talk page, and have voted keep. It's not your fault, but you can already be considered tainted. Second: the following people who have been contacted have voted on the AFD:
<ul>
<li>DuncanBCS - keep</li>
<li>Hectorian - keep</li>
<li>Mukadderat - keep</li>
<li>Latinus - Strong keep</li>
<li>Nikosilver - Keep</li>
<li>Scranchuse - Keep</li>
<li>Choalbaton - Keep</li>
<li>Bhoeble - Keep</li>
<li>Moby Dick - Strong Keep</li>
<li>Tazmaniacs - Keep</li>
<li>Mais oui! - Keep</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Three of the editors that were contacted did not participate in the AFD: Green Giant, Staffelde, and KillerChihuahua. You state that you think it would be assuming bad faith to assume that Bertil notified only users who he believed would vote keep... there's a difference between assuming good faith and being dense. Of <i>course</i> he only notified people that would agree with him; why would he notify people who would disagree with him? I mean, come on. Whatever your take on the issue is, it's blatantly obvious what has happened here. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinuxbeak_c86a.html" title="User:Linuxbeak">Linuxbeak</a> (drop me a <a href="../../../l/i/n/User_talk%7ELinuxbeak_c40b.html" title="User talk:Linuxbeak">line</a>) 00:14, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just got aware of this post. Cool Cat, when you posted a complaint about me I believe it would have been decent if you informed me about it.</p>
<p>The debate on the AfD became quite unpleasant, so I dont find it fruitful to advance my case there. Retrospectively, I can see that my spread of the word about the AfD could seem abusive. However, I want to underline that on purpose I sent it to people who I believe are open for arguments, and I didnt expect a common outcome. Furthermore I avoided to send it to people personally involved in the issue (didn't sent it to people I know as Kurdish or Turkish users). I also noticed that the message was passed on to the Turkish and Iranian users, who I would expect to support deletion - in most cases with the argument that voters should be gathered to get majority for deletion. In that situation I believed that a broad range of users with different backgrounds should have the possibility to voice their views on the issue.</p>
<p>In a short time, there have been several proposals for deletion of categories, stubs and articles related to Kurds - which has become rather trite, and probably created an atmosphere of irritation with lots of inappropriate comments (including personal attacks, semi racist and anti-Turkish comments). May I suggest that we from now on concentrate our efforts on improving Wikipedia, and consider our different approaches as an advantagde in order to write NPOV and balanced articles. <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBertilvidet_529b.html" title="User:Bertilvidet">Bertilvidet</a> 10:32, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As the accused part I am eager to get comments, including criticism if I did anything wrong. I do however demand my exculpation. 1) Taking into account that the AfD is controversial I believe that the <i>request for deletion should be widely known</i>. It is not satisfying that only one part is informed - and I believe outsiders with interest in the subject, but not personally involved, should be invited to weigh in. The side in favour of deletion cannot have the monoply on deciding who should be infromed. 2) I consider Wikipedia as a global site, and thus I believe in <i>a broad inclusion of people taking decisions</i>. Is it only up to Turks and Kurds to determine whether there should be an article on <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_Kurdistan_fac6.html" title="Turkish Kurdistan">Turkish Kurdistan</a>? I sincerely dont think so. 3) The policy that I am charged for, and plead not guilty, violating is only <i>proposed, not passed nor implemented</i>.</dd>

<dd>(Despite this debate I recently made another AfD, please tell me if I violated anything by posting <a href="../../../d/a/n/Wikipedia_talk%7EDanish_Wikipedians%27_notice_board_2081.html#Proposed_deletion" title="Wikipedia talk:Danish Wikipedians' notice board">this</a>).<a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBertilvidet_529b.html" title="User:Bertilvidet">Bertilvidet</a> 09:32, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You dont gather "artificial concensus" bu just adveritising people you know will vote as you do. If you have to advertise you generaly ask one or two people who would write a rationale to make up a case either supporting ot opposing the deletion rather than gathering plain keep/delete votes.</dd>
<dd>The vote is advertised on AfD page to everyone, Turk/Kurd or not. If you didn't mass advertised the result would be similar to <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syrian_Kurdistan_c5f3.html" title="Syrian Kurdistan">Syrian Kurdistan</a>.</dd>
<dd>Gathering tens of votes agreeing with you is NOT good practice. Do you really think it is aproporate to collect one sided votes?</dd>

<p>1) By insisting on claiming that I knew how people would vote, despite my refusal of this, is a breach of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. 2) I do not agree that a vote is more fair the fewer that participate in the debate. 3) It is still a proposed policy.

These anon accounts have been pouring oceans of email textdumps into <a href="../../../j/a/c/Talk%7EJack_Sarfatti_b981.html" title="Talk:Jack Sarfatti">Talk:Jack Sarfatti</a> lately, and there were legal threats against me there as well, but only when he brought it to my userpage did I think to ban. I haven't been an admin long, and this was my first ban (exciting! now I'm drunk with power!), so I'm not really sure how these things work. At the very least, maybe I'll start keeping track of all the IPs that do textdumps into the talk page.</p>
<p>By the way, not that this matters as far as our policy and response goes, but as for this name business, I never added anything about him changing his name to his article, I think he just hasn't gotten the hang of how Wikipedia works, and who is writing what. Furthermore, by his own admission with these vandalisms, he did in fact get his name legally changed, so the information that he's complaining about is not wrong (though perhaps a little misleading). -<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_sig_226e.html" title="User:Lethe/sig">lethe</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_sig_fced.html" title="User talk:Lethe/sig">talk</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" rel="nofollow">+</a></sup> 01:32, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

Sarfatti came after me just for replacing the birthdate once in the article after he'd deleted it (it's a well-known date that he has often mentioned in his Usenet postings due to a mystical importance of some kind). He declared me his political enemy and followed up with off-Wikipedia threats.

<dd>I have been reverting most of <a href="../../../m/p/e/User%7EMperel_b699.html" title="User:Mperel">Mperel's</a> efforts. She is of the opinion that Sarfatti is a "brilliant physicist", and wants the article to be much more in line with that thinking. On the other hand, I think Sarfatti is a crackpot of the purest breed, and do not want a Wikipedia article that makes him look like a scientist. Therefore I don't think Mperel will have much success with her efforts. I suppose this is the ultimate reason why Sarfatti wants to get me, claims about his last name notwithstanding. -<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_sig_226e.html" title="User:Lethe/sig">lethe</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_sig_fced.html" title="User talk:Lethe/sig">talk</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" rel="nofollow">+</a></sup> 17:21, 27 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"Brilliant:" and "crackpot" are sometimes difficult to distinguish. My impression was that Mperel is trying to write a article that Sarfatti would approve of enough to stop interfering.

<dd>MPerel does seem to have good intentions, though I don't agree with her goals (in particular, I think an accurate portrayal of Sarfatti is necessarily negative, and so he wouldn't be satisfied with it), and don't really appreciate the way she insinuates that I have ulterior motives. -<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_sig_226e.html" title="User:Lethe/sig">lethe</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_sig_fced.html" title="User talk:Lethe/sig">talk</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" rel="nofollow">+</a></sup> 21:47, 27 March 2006 (UTC)

Rather simple explanation: I am a member of the Star Trek wikiproject, and was poking around those topics for a day or so before joining. As for the Turkish Kurdistan vote, I saw the link on his talk page while we were discussing the star trek page (look it up on his talk page) and a former girlfriend/summer fling of mine went to Turkey on Exchange. Minor interest. And I regularly participate in VfD's... over a hundred votes, actually. With a user at around 750 edits, thats a bunch. The RfC was last fricken year. Theres no way thats relevent. If I were truly wikistalking I'd have continued to vote on more current RfC's that you're involved in. Or I would've voted against one of your RfA's. This is purly coincidence from a shared wikiproject and reading your talkpage. -<b><a href="../../../a/k/m/User%7EAKMask_da48.html" title="User:AKMask"><font color="#990011">M</font></a></b><sup><a href="../../../a/k/m/User_talk%7EAKMask_4b56.html" title="User talk:AKMask"><font color="#990011">ask</font></a></sup> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Alaska.svg_3df9.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/e/e6/Flag_of_Alaska.svg/20px-Flag_of_Alaska.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="14" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Alaska.svg_3df9.html" /></a> 19:00, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As a disinterested party who has interacted regularly neither with AKMask nor with Latinus, and after readily conceding that we oughtn't perhaps to clutter the noticeboard with this discussion, I think it is eminently clear that what Mask is doing is not wikistalking, and, more importantly, in no way proves deletrious vis-à-vis the project. One observes <a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/contribution_tree?namespace=4&amp;user=AKMask&amp;dbname=enwiki_p" class="external text" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/contribution_tree?namespace=4&amp;user=AKMask&amp;dbname=enwiki_p" rel="nofollow">many AfD, FAC, and RfA votes</a> by Mask; notwithstanding questions about whether Mask is Davenbelle, toward the proving of which proposition Cool Cat adduces Mask's having failed to make many edits prior to the departure of Davenbelle, surely Mask's voting on a few Wikipedia questions with which Cool Cat was involved does not wikistalking make. Finally, assuming arguendo that Mask has voted on sundry Wikipedia questions in order to express disagreement with Cool Cat, wikistalking would be demonstrated, in my mind, only to the extent that it was plain that his sole purpose for voting was to express disagreement; I can imagine, for example, that if Mask thought Cool Cat to have exercised bad judgment in voting in the past (and I surely don't impute malign motive or bad judgment to Cool Cat, about whom I know nothing), he might frequent pages at which he/she voted in order to express contrary viewpoints in such cases as Mask found Cool Cat's votes to be poorly supported. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 19:11, 27 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I did, because of copyright issues. It would be silly to support something that would get us sued. I then listed my problems, fixed them, and changed to support. As for you feeling whether my vote on the Turkish AfD was in good faith, that is of absolutly no concern to me. It was, it will be counted, and thats it. Your feelings on my vote are fluff.

<dd>I have not acted like a dick anywhere, and have not done anything out of the ordinary to annoy you or anyone else. If you get annoyed by my general presence, well, I'm afraid I can't help that. As to it not working... what wont work? I hardly think I'm going to end up blocked because you don't agree with me. It happens. Sometimes you'll win, sometimes my side will. But thats just how it goes. The wikibreak is something I'd suggest to anyone who says they're <i>way</i> beyond frustrated. Do you support someone who is under a lot of stress continuing to place themselves in a situation where more can be added? I hate seeing posts where users blow up and declare they quit or leave in a huff. I don't like seeing that happen to anyone. My remarks were intended for nothing beyond the statement that it appears obvious that Turkish Kurdistan is going to be no consensus, hence keep, and you can't really change that.

<dd>Yes I reopened the thread, do not close threads like that. Stalking requires administrative action, at the very least a warning.</dd>
<dd>I am sick and tired of people annoying me and being told to go to RfC. I do so and it is just ignored. No one even cares to review it. If I commit or suggest to commit remotely similar behaviour people are quick to block me or threaten to block me. Why cant we have one solid standard?

<dd>There is also the minor point that in most legal systems, certainly including the English one, you can't defame someone who is dead (and the "defamatory" stuff is taken from the <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Telegraph_dc47.html" title="Daily Telegraph">Daily Telegraph</a>, a Tory newspaper not noted for its disrespectful attitude to the aristocracy). So far, it's bluster from someone with a strong POV who hasn't yet learned that he can't insist that articles must reflect his views or exclude facts he finds distasteful. If it goes beyond bluster, there seem to be a few of us keeping an eye on him now. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 17:51, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>These two users have been waging a back and forth revert war on DMorpheus' talk page. Both are well over 3RR. I've blocked Phillipsbourg for the 3RR, but am uncertain as to whether DMorpheus deserves a similar block. It <b>is</b> DMorpheus' own talk page, after all, and these are not administrative warnings that are being fought over, so part of me says DMorpheus has the right to remove them from his page.

<p>Hello there.</p>
<p>I don't know if this is the right place to ask...</p>
<p>I wonder if it is tolerated to have a direct link to a racist message from a user page? I refer to <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarl_Meier_d697.html" title="User:Karl Meier">User:Karl_Meier</a> who links to a page with the message "<i>And so....from all Danes to the entire Muslim world,we just wanna say; FUCK YOU!!</i>" Luckily, only a very small minority of Danes takes so radical rancourous positions - I am personally very disgusted by such statements, and hope some administrators will have a look at the case. <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBertilvidet_529b.html" title="User:Bertilvidet">Bertilvidet</a> 09:26, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>this is hardly a "racist" link, and while I'm concerned with taunts on userpages, "Project SIIEG" and other borderline on-site behaviour, I don't think a link to a site by outraged Danes is racist or illegitimate, or even "rancourous". Just let him have his link and avoid fanning this any further. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 09:33, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, while I quite liberal on userpages, this is too much. It is obviously inflammetory trolling and likely to bring wikipedia into disrepute. Declaring POV on a userpage is perhaps beneficial to the project, but saying 'Fuck You' to the muslim world is not. I'd support an enforced removal of this link. But I'll wait for a consensus here. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><small><sup>ask?</sup></small></a> 09:54, 29 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>maybe. we lack a clear userpage external link policy. It's not a link I'd host on my userpage, but it's not one of the worse hatemongeing islamophobic sites I've seen; it seems to be a good-faith site by Danes outraged about the cartoon hubbub, not a site by Nazis or confused fundamentalists. The question is, does it matter? What sort of links do we allow on userpages? Whatever you do, be sure to be evenhanded. We might need "userpage guidelines" where such precedents can be recorded. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 10:05, 29 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>'Be evenhanded' is normally an excuse to do nothing without creating some complicated process, and taking on an impossible task of clearing up all the idiocy on the site at once.

<dd>hey, I'm not saying that you should deal with all cases at once. I am all for unbureaucratic clamping down in blatant cases. I am not too sure about the blatancy of this one, but go ahead and deal with it, with common sense. I am just saying that we need to keep a record of such cases and how they were dealt with for the orientation of admins in future cases, so they have a possibility to estimate what was considered "fair" in the past. I would do nothing here, but if you think the user should be forced to remove the link, I will not object since I agree the link is in poor taste. I am also all against instruction creep, but userpage policies are clearly a desideratum, just look at the resources wasted over the userbox wars and what not. We all have a vague idea of what is acceptable on userpages and what isn't. All we need to do is make the limits a little clearer so newbies will have an easier time finding out about these unwritten things. I can understand that editors seeing all these fancy userpages with lots of personal and political stuff will try to make one that is even 'better'; the obvious result of this process will be that wikipedia becomes a host for personal homepages. We need clear guidelines to discourage that and draw lines. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 11:48, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, I've asked him nicely to remove the link <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Karl_Meier&amp;curid=2260796&amp;diff=46018990&amp;oldid=45974146" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Karl_Meier&amp;curid=2260796&amp;diff=46018990&amp;oldid=45974146" rel="nofollow">[44]</a>, or at least indicate it in a less trolling manner. This is really the equivalent of putting a link to a Nazi site on a userpage with the instruction 'Jews click here'. It is really not acceptable.

<dd>Userpages are Userpages and should <i>somehow</i> serve to provide information usefull to wikipedia such as the users interests. By reading the userpage one can thell about a persons interests and maybe seek assitance. I however prefer my userpage not to be infuriating and instead welcoming.

<p>As a disinterested 3rd who regularly reads here, I'd support forcible removal in this case, for two reasons: it's aimed at "the entire Muslim world", which constitutes many millions of people in virtually every country on Earth, and it purports to come "from all Danes", which the author cannot begin to back up. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadioKirk_a5db.html" title="User:RadioKirk"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; color: #161;">Radio</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RadioKirk_8f39.html" title="Special:Contributions/RadioKirk"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; color: #161;">Kirk</span></a> <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadioKirk_dc7c.html" title="User talk:RadioKirk"><span style="font-size: 10px; color: #161;">talk to me</span></a> 18:52, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
