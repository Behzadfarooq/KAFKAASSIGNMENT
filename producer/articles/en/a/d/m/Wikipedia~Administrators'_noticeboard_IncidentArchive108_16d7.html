<p>I've received emails regarding his block, rather that I had violated policy by blocking him. In his first email, he threatened arbitration at me for the single reason I had reverted a disputed tag on <a href="../../../l/a/u/Laura_Ingraham_e1e0.html" title="Laura Ingraham">Laura Ingraham</a>, which disupted the subject's official website, and protected and blocked him for civility and warring.</p>
<p>He then attacked my nationality of being British, and suggested I added another 24 hours on his block (which I did).</p>
<p>His third email was about <a href="../../../p/p/_/WP%7EPP_1ffd.html" title="WP:PP">the protection policy</a>, and why I had not enforced it properly, ending in the words "you failed. you failed. you failed.". The email took a jab at my age as well.</p>
<p>The fourth email was short, but accused me of being a fascist and abusive.</p>
<p>Per this, he's been blocked indefinitely.

<dd>To be honest i am uncomfortable with this. If a user sends abusive emails to you just killfile them. If they complain that you have not followed proper procedures then put yourself up for review here to see what other admins think.

<dd>If I am out of line posting here, please accept my apologies and remove my comments. I would like to say that I did not directly call Sceptre a fascist, rather, I called actions taken against me (both verbal and administrative) fascistic. That is not a personal attack, it is my harmless opinion. I admit to citing Sceptre's nationality and age, and although I'm not saying it was the right thing to do, it <b>was</b> a direct result of the frustation caused by administrative actions that I thought were against policy and POV. The following is a part of an email sent to Sceptre that received and overbearing response (IMO). I first cite Wikipedia policy, then I explain how I believe this policy was ignored:</dd>

<dd>For this, and saying that he failed (IMO) I was blocked indefinitely; it is admitted above. I don't care if the block was lowered, I feel the application of an indefinite block for that almost entirely cogent email is highly irresponsible especially because it made it very difficult to argue my case. It's like all of a sudden going to DEFCON 1, then going back to DEFCON 4 and acting as if "no blood no foul, right?".</dd>

<dd>Although a warning or 24 hour ban would have been preferable, the situation escalated because, in my opinion, Sandover was for the most part refusing to acknowledge the points I was making on the Talk page. I was also frustrated by the fact that my very small additions/omissions were being <i>completely</i> reverted while I allowed his entire section to remain essentially intact. On top of that, the POV tag that I inserted (for both the anti-gay blurb and Sandover's edits) was being removed again and again without dialog. This was especially annoying because the tag was also intended for content that Sandover had nothing to do with. Even though I initially added the POV tag and <i>explained</i> it, I was in part banned for a 3RR, again, even though <i>no one</i> bothered to explain why it shouldn't be there. At that point, I was pretty comfortable calling the whole incident "fascistic" simply because the editors/Admins were moving along without me while silencing me by force. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaizum_0a13.html" title="User:Haizum">Haizum</a> 02:15, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Woah there, I never said I shouldn't have been blocked, in fact, I said I should have and that it was wrong. The issue presented here is the use of an indefinite block.

<dd>Threat of Arbitration: Simply not represented fairly. Based on several complaints and my own personal experience with this Administrator (that I felt was contra the role of the Admin), I said "You're on your way to arbitration." Inflamatory? Perhaps, but this comment was made in private via Wiki email. It is not, "I'm going to get you arbitrated," and it is not worthy of an indefinite ban. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaizum_0a13.html" title="User:Haizum">Haizum</a> 03:13, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The name is an anagram of "Merecat TWS", or <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerecat_31d8.html" title="User:Merecat">Merecat</a> (who Thewolfstar considered a friend) and TWS, or <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThewolfstar_d89c.html" title="User:Thewolfstar">Thewolfstar</a>.</dd>
<dd>But I wouldn't advocate blocking that account - give them the opportunity to try to do something right, and maybe they will realize that Wikipedia is quite welcoming to people who want to work on the encyclopedia.</dd>
<dd>The IP in question appears to be a RoadRunner account in Herndon, Virginia. It doesn't appear to be a proxy of any sort. I don't see a compelling reason to block; it only plays into this person's apparent persecution complex. <i><a href="../../../k/w/h/User_talk%7EKwh_7c75.html" title="User talk:Kwh">KWH</a></i> 04:51, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It was indeed Metrocat, who is indeed Thewolfstar, and it looks like he's only been on it the last few days (since the 5th); his IP appears to shift every three days or so. It's a dynamic RoadRunner IP, so I'd say a week will probably be sufficient, though he'll likely just force reconnect to get a new one.</dd>

I've blocked it for 24 hours; feel free to unblock if legit collateral damage shows up (make sure it's an established user, not a new account, and let me know about it so I can look for any tie-ins), or to reblock if it continues past the 24 hours.

<dd>You seem to be grasping for excuses. Edit summaries for original, non-revert edits are not mandatory; especially since I made various other changes within the same edit, it wasn't very practical for me to explain all in an edit summary. However, I did subsequently discuss one of the points of my edit on the talk page, when there were objections. Unfortunately Rebecca didn't take part of the discussion, and I still don't know what her objection is.

<dd>Nice diversion. My original edit to Psephos was not a revert, and as I said above, it seemed neither practical nor particularly necessary to leave an edit summary; I didn't expect it to be controversial. When it turned out to be, I discussed it on the talk page, as I do with any other article where there's a dispute. How is that a "battering-ram approach"? Am I supposed to just let people revert my edits without explanation and be done with it? If they revert and refuse to explain themselves, I can't do much else than revert myself. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMargana_b7b1.html" title="User:Margana">Margana</a> 20:35, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm afraid that just because you start a thread on AN/I you don't get to force everyone to stick within your definition of 'on topic'. You brought up Rebecca's behaviour during a revert war; that makes your behaviour also on topic, and not a 'diversion'. Since it turns out that you are also reverting without edit summaries, and making changes to articles without an edit summary, it seems that you're behaving similarly yourself - this makes your complaining about her behaviour sheer hypocrisy. As Tom Harrison says below: using rollback on non-vandalism isn't frowned upon because it's an admin function, but because it breaks our standards of civility by not explaining the reason for the revert. If you behave better than those you're complaining about, maybe I'd take you more seriously.</dd>

<dd>My comments about your confrontational approach to Wikipedia stem from looking at your recent contributions and finding you engaged in multiple, simultaneous edit and revert wars. Every Wiki-warrior claims the other guy started it and all they're doing is following suit: "I can't do much else than revert myself", to quote your own words back at you. Well ... there IS much else you can do. Starting with discussion, with using edit summaries that don't leave people feeling that you're trying to sneak in changes without anyone noticing, with trying to find compromise and an accurate statement that everyone can agree with. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorven_1e3d.html" title="User:Morven">Matthew Brown (Morven)</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorven_2a5f.html" title="User talk:Morven">T</a>:<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Morven_de06.html" title="Special:Contributions/Morven">C</a>) 20:52, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>When I revert without an edit summary, it's because I explained myself in a previous summary or on the talk page. I do not revert without explanation. I don't care what "every Wiki-warrior claims", in my case it is evidently true that I didn't start reverting, and you can't show otherwise. And the fact that you did (and still do) try to find fault with me, without losing one word on Rebecca, shows that you <i>are</i> just trying to defend her by means of diversion. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMargana_b7b1.html" title="User:Margana">Margana</a> 21:12, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>This user is trolling, and should know better, being an admin.</p>
<ul>
<li>first, he deletes a DRV i put up re <a href="../../../u/s/e/Userbox.html" title="Userbox">Userbox</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=57131741" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=57131741" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. That has now been recreated and received some good intelligent discussion, leading to a resolution of the issue which could not have happened if tony had his way.</li>
<li>I put a comment on his talk page asking him to talk about it, and he deletes the comment. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ATony_Sidaway&amp;diff=57308251&amp;oldid=57306627" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ATony_Sidaway&amp;diff=57308251&amp;oldid=57306627" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></li>
<li>And again... i continue to try and get him to address the real issue, but he keeps deleting my edits <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ATony_Sidaway&amp;diff=57380167&amp;oldid=57379452" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ATony_Sidaway&amp;diff=57380167&amp;oldid=57379452" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></li>
<li>I find on his talk page that i'm not the only one disturbed by his behaviour. You'll have to check the history, he keeps deleting any posts which are not favourable to him.</li>
<li>He creates a sockpuppet, <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.132.163.178.html" title="User:64.132.163.178">User:64.132.163.178</a>, and blows his own trumpet on his userpage, about him being a good boy and everything, before deleting the discussion because he realised that he got totally <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ATony_Sidaway&amp;diff=57563026&amp;oldid=57562012" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ATony_Sidaway&amp;diff=57563026&amp;oldid=57562012" rel="nofollow">owned</a>.</li>
<li>I think an admin or someone with a bit of power ought to knock him down a few bars. Being an admin doesn't make you a god, as most admins would be happy to admit, because they can have intelligent discussions and accept criticism, unlike tony.</li>
<li>Best outcome = deadmin, most likely = severe talking to by another admin, a 'please explain', most dangerous = he just continues on his vandalism rampage and deletes this post, in which case i will refer the matter to another admin via their talk page.</li>

<dd>To preface this comment, in the past me and Tony haven't exactly agreed...on anything =D. However in this case I believe Tony to be in the %100 right. Although I usually don't like people removing other people's comments from their talk page, I think your comments are there just to cause trouble and I know I wouldn't blame anyone for removing them. There IS a reason that Userbox doesn't have a redirect, <b>I even tried to get it unprotected so I could put a redirect but I widthdrew my nomination because I actually took the time to listen</b>. Perhaps you should try this thing called "listening".

<p><a href="../../../a/l/k/User%7EAlkivar_1b76.html" title="User:Alkivar">Alkivar</a> uses profanity in his edit summaries and practices incivility. Here are just a few examples. Check his user contributions, and you'll find regular use of "shit" and "fuck". Check out his talk page in which he routinely removes comments that are not vandalism (also notice the number of complaints he receives on his talk page). Only administrators can do this, but notice his inappropriate use of deleting histories. Check out the brassiere page where he tried to add some awful picture to it that everyone hated, and then he insulted everyone (except one user) who complained about the picture. He also seems to be in the habit of provoking vandals by making his feuds with them personal. Why hasn't Alkivar ever been blocked for this kind of behavior or been removed from his position as an administrator? This is a travesty. <a href="../../../d/u/c/User%7EDuckdid_0b2f.html" title="User:Duckdid">Duckdid</a> 05:56, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I haven't any opinion with respect to most of the points you raise, as I've only a passing familiarity with Alkivar and am disinclined to spend time reading through his talk page. Apropos of his <i>profane</i> edit summaries, though, one finds that his profanity isn't directed in specific at other users (as would perhaps be in contravention of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> and would, in any event, be disruptive), save for those linkspammers whom we block straightaway. To suggest that his edit summaries are in bad form, then, one would have to argue that profanity is disruptive per se, irrespective of context, and I suspect that many users, like I, aren't willing to make such an argument. As to the history deletion, the last <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=&amp;user=Alkivar&amp;page=&amp;limit=250&amp;offset=0" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=&amp;user=Alkivar&amp;page=&amp;limit=250&amp;offset=0" rel="nofollow">two months</a> of his admin activity seem to have comprised no deletions of specific versions of a page/image (i.e., "history deletions") save for those in which an image was compromised (viz., either by an unencyclopedic image's being uploaded in its place or by a non-fair use picture's being uploaded). Now, I've seen several complaints here and elsewhere about Alkivar, and I think perhaps his style sometimes could be more decorous; I don't think, though, that any Wikipedian can say that he/she has never phrased something in a fashion he/she later regretted. Alkivar doesn't appear to be disrupting the community and appears to use the admin tools properly and constructively (if sometimes with terse explanation), so I can see no reason for which Alkivar ought to be desysopped. Of course, per <a href="../../../r/f/d/WP%7ERfDA_50ab.html" title="WP:RfDA">WP:RfDA</a>, one may always construct an <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_ADMIN_c29e.html" title="WP:RFC/ADMIN">RfC</a>, which will surely bear out any actual malfeasance (even as I suspect none has occurred). <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 06:25, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Here is an example of some comments I found in his edit summaries and other places by searching just for a minute or so: "jesus fuck learn grammar you tards", "why do idiots insist on adding images without reading the HELP documentation first?", "All i've gotten is shit over this picture ... fuck you all its deleted", "Fuck You." Yes, Alkivar breaks incivility and he uses profanity to further that goal. Please, don't try to ignore this obvious fact. Doing a search on Wikipedia, I also found a reference to Alkivar deliberately trying to lure a guy he was feuding with into a 3RR block. <a href="../../../d/u/c/User%7EDuckdid_0b2f.html" title="User:Duckdid">Duckdid</a> 06:43, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It doesn't look like you've talked to him about this, which should be the first step rather than taking it here. Talk to him first, try to work it out, and if that doesn't work bring it here.

<p>Talking to him is a great idea, but it's not a terrible idea for a fellow admin to do the talking. As it stands, he appears to be an ongoing embarassment to less potty-mouthed admins.</p>

<dd>No, no, no, no. He made what may or may not be a mistake, and going "Ohnoes, sysop abuse!" is absurd (as per "why hasn't Alkivar ever been blocked for this kind of behavior or been removed from his position as an administrator?").

<p>Wait, are you saying we have <b>TWO</b> standards? Because when I once made a single edit comment that could be taken as an insult, I was blocked for a week. This guy is cursing out people repeatedly, but since he's an admin, all you suggest is that someone speak to him politely about it? With all due respect, there is clearly at least the appearance of disparity here. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus"><font color="darkcyan">Al</font></a> 07:46, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't know your situation, but I reckon that you should've been talked to first as well. If you'd already been talked with or warned or whatever, then I'd understand it. No one's brought up the subject with Alkivar. In fact, no one who brought this topic up appears to even have had the decency to let him know that he's being talked about on this noticeboard. Talk to him, take it to RfC. That's the dispute resolution process. The whole way this wiki works is <i>through communucation</i>. A lot of people seem to be under the misapprehension that when they don't like something, the best thing to do is shout over here, Abuse! Abuse! and then not bother to tell the "abusing" person anything about it or do any leg work themselves. If you'd mentioned the issue and then he'd said Fuck off, this post would be far more reasonable. But then that hasn't happened. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnoutwood_5c9e.html" title="User:Snoutwood">Snoutwood</a> <a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnoutwood_5ab6.html" title="User talk:Snoutwood">(talk)</a> 16:08, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't understand. If a user is uncivil, why are we <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shooting_the_messenger.html" title="Shooting the messenger">shooting the messenger</a> rather than dealing with the problem. Fine, if Duckdid is a banned user, ban him again. But don't just assume that because a banned user brings something up, the complaint is <i><a href="../../../i/p/s/Ipso_facto.html" title="Ipso facto">ipso facto</a></i> invalid. Alkivar's edit summaries DO contain problems, regardless of whether someone haas talked to him about it yet (and maybe no one has talked to him about it because of the perception that it will do no good, <i>vis</i> double-standards?). -- <a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae'blis</a> <i><sub><a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">(talk)</a></sub></i> 17:44, 5 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm not shooting the messenger, nor do I think that the complaint is invalid. I'm saying that the messenger is taking the wrong steps. If I have a problem with a user, I talk to him about it. That I've assumed that he'll respond poorly is no reason to not talk to him about it (I may be wrong, he may say, "Oh, feck, right, sorry about that," and the problem's solved. I've seen it happen). If he responds poorly, then that's a good reason to bring it here. It's just plain rude to post a message here before first even going over the problem with the person you have a problem with. Talking to them first is indeed the first step in our dispute resolution process, a long-standing policy. Try it, and you may get good results. If that's done, then come here with the problem and we'll do our best. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnoutwood_5c9e.html" title="User:Snoutwood">Snoutwood</a> <a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnoutwood_5ab6.html" title="User talk:Snoutwood">(talk)</a> 18:41, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You guys have to realize the near impossibility of not being an “insider” and trying to get things done. I’ve been told that I shouldn’t have posted this concern here, even though the directions at the top of the page say this is where to do it. I’ve been told to talk to Alkivar, which is impossible since he has removed my comments from his talk page in the past. I’ve been told that I should appeal to a committee instead of creating a sockpuppet if I’m blocked, but how do I do such things if I’m blocked to begin with? And what about Snoutwood, who appears (though this could be wrong) to be interpreting everything in the light most favorable to Alkivar? Snoutwood claimed no one had the decency to tell Alkivar that he’s being talked about, and that’s a non-issue. Alkivar tried to have me blocked about thirty minutes after I posted here. He knew about it. He just didn’t want to say anything here.</dd>

<dd>No one has looked at this from my perspective. Administrators go around making binding decisions with blocks and deletions and so forth. I just make a few edits and create a few articles here and there. When people talk about needing to do a WP:RfA because the WP:NPA and WP:CIVIL were violated when there was a WP:3RR or whatever, I don’t know what any of that means. I have to sit here for an hour clicking on the links to figure out what those acronyms mean and what the substance of those policies are. So, I’m stuck hindered by an overly bureaucratic process that I don’t understand (and several in this conversation have interpreted differently) while groupthink and the good ol’ boys network run amok.

<dd>As I've said, I don't have a stand in regards to Alkivar, and if it's in the interest of the encyclopedia for him to be desysopped or whatever else than I would wholeheartedly support it. I think that there's very much an isue that needs to be addressed here, and I think that you're going about this the wrong way. However, that doesn't have anything to do with what I've been saying. What I've been saying is that he needed to be talked to first.

I have been attacked rather than the substantitive issue of Alkivar's bad behavior being dealt with. Even though people here claimed they would help with this, Alkivar has already removed the comments from his talk page regarding his unacceptable attitutde.</dd>

<dd>I've tried to talk to him before under just my IP address before I had an account, and he just removed my comment. His explanation was that he doesn't respond to anonymous users. Later, someone made a similar complaint under a real account, so I thought that would settle it, but he just deleted that one also. I also realize this next comment will likely result in getting me blocked indefinitely, but the Beisnj account was my account. An admin blocked that account indefinitely, however, please note that none of my edits were vandalism, I never harassed anybody, etc. Under this account, I have continued to make appropriate edits as well. I could have easily hidden that the Beisnj account was mine simply by not adding to my user page the list of articles I've created. I just want to edit on Wikipedia from time to time and be left alone while I do it. The only people I've ever complained about was one guy who tried to overtake an article about French military history, and Alkivar because of his string of abuses. Two mure notes: (1)As an added note, I see that his RfA was approved by a 28-21 vote. Now, I don't know much about the inner-workings of Wikipedia, nor have I ever attempted to be an "insider", but that doesn't seem like a very solid vote. Most of the "oppose" votes voiced the same concerns I have voiced here. (2) This entire conversation is hypocritical. I'm being asked to go talk to Alkivar about it, but he hasn't attempted to talk to me about this. His immediate response was to petition to <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> to have me permentantly blocked. Notice in Alkivar's complaint that he doesn't have an argument of substance against me, he just saw a previous block and is hoping for the easy way out. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if he uses my "self-incrimination" above to permanantly block me himself. <a href="../../../d/u/c/User%7EDuckdid_0b2f.html" title="User:Duckdid">Duckdid</a> 08:02, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have blocked <a href="../../../d/u/c/User%7EDuckdid_0b2f.html" title="User:Duckdid">User:Duckdid</a> indefinitely as a self-confessed sockpuppet of a banned user. Sockpuppetry to evade bans is not acceptable, no matter how well the sock contributes. Inicidentally, the RfA Duckdid refers to failed. Alkivar's <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Alkivar_3_992b.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Alkivar 3">third RfA</a> was the one that got him promoted, by 69/20/8. The allegations of incivility are disturbing, but an RfC sounds like the proper venue for this, with evidence that people have tried and failed to resolve this with Alkivar, and allowing Alkivar a response. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 08:46, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Although i have no personal insight into, or interest in, either editor's behaviour, i have to say that reading this section hardly instils confidence in our administration system. I reads very much like Admins covering each other's back, selectively quoting policy to justify awfully poor behaviour, and a warning to any non admin who dares to point out that some one may be abusing their tools. Per <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, i'll accept that is not the motivation of the admins here, but its hard to deny that is what it looks like. Irrespective of where or whether a complaint has been made, in light of the evidence quoted above would it not make sense of one of you to say youl will have a quiet word in Alkivar's ear and point out that such language and behaviour is unbecoming on an admin? Instead we say to the person making the complaint: "talk to him/her about it" then immediately we block them. Result? The problem goes away. Until next time. <b><a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockpocket_2e94.html" title="User:Rockpocket"><font color="green">Rockpock</font></a><font color="blue">e</font><a href="../../../r/o/c/User_talk%7ERockpocket_62af.html" title="User talk:Rockpocket"><font color="green">t</font></a></b> 18:10, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you're worried that Alkivar will block you for criticising him, which I think is highly unlikely, I will personally supervise the exchange and make sure that it doesn't happen. O.K.? I'm not "covering" Alkivar, I've no particular attachment to him or admins as some sort of cabal. If an admin came here without discussion with the person they're having trouble with, I'd say the same thing. Discusison with the user is first and foremost, that's all.

<dd>My point was more that of <a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae'blis'</a>. Irrespective of the situation, an editor had pointed out out what appears to be a very valid concern. That user not cannot resolve the situation him or herself (as soon as they self identify they will be blocked again, moreover he tried to talk anonymously and was ignored or the comment removed). So the situation goes unresolved and Alkivar will continue to edit in a frankly, occasionally offensive manner. Although it has nothing to do with me whatsoever, i'll happily ask Alkivar if he would mind toning down his language and improve his behaviour, seeing as <a href="../../../d/u/c/User%7EDuckdid_0b2f.html" title="User:Duckdid">User:Duckdid</a> no longer can and no administrator appears willing to. I'm not concerned about being blocked for that. But its unfortunate that one of the admins here doesn't see that as the commonsense way forward, instead of telling him to resolve it by talking then banning him. <b><a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockpocket_2e94.html" title="User:Rockpocket"><font color="green">Rockpock</font></a><font color="blue">e</font><a href="../../../r/o/c/User_talk%7ERockpocket_62af.html" title="User talk:Rockpocket"><font color="green">t</font></a></b> 20:04, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

Rocket, since you've got a problem with this issue, why don't you just go and deal with it rather than saying that it's an admin problem, or that we're covering each other's backs? I don't understand why you don't just go and talk to him (still not done by anyone who is involved in the dispute). I don't understand why you don't see talking to him as being the commonsense way forwards.</dd>

<dd>(1) Yes, Alkivar knew about this comment on the ANI, and his response was to attempt to get me blocked. I posted here at 05:56, 5 June 2006. At 06:28, 5 June 2006, Alkivar requested from Jayjg that he run checkuser on me and block me. Alkivar hadn’t even posted on Wikipedia in three days, but he responded to that comment in roughly 30 minutes by trying to get me blocked. (Note also that Jayjg did, in fact, run Checkuser on me. As far as I can tell under these circumstances, that was not an acceptable use of Checkuser privileges.)</dd>

He went on a roll deleting comments critical of him with such edit summaries as “poof” and “wipe away useless post.” On December 6th, 2005, he deleted a comment from his talk page asking him to be civil, and Alkivar’s edit summary was “rv vandalism.”</dd>

I listed the unblock template on my talk page, and people basically told me that wasn’t the right way to handle it (which seems to be a common response to attempts to follow the bureaucratic process).

<dl>
<dd>1. I see. Yes, you're right about that, and that he didn't respond to the issues listed is a problem. Note that I don't see you being blocked as necessarily being a problem, as the way things work around here is, if you're blocked, you don't create sockpuppets to get around the block, like you've done. You e-mail the blocking admin with your main account and talk to them about the issue (which it sounds like you did, but I don't know the story). In case you didn't see, I've already asked Alkivar to contribute to the discussion, and we'll see what comes of that.</dd>

The block template just don't work well, unfortunately, e-mail is best (people don't notice the template). Now that you have shown that Alkivar didn't bother to deal with the issue although he was aware of it, then your position makes more sense. It appears to me that his civility is certainly an issue that he needs to address, and much as I don't want to get more involved in this I've posted a message to his talk page. It's important that he respond to criticism. Note that while I say this I don't expect anything to happen while you refuse to directly talk to him about your trouble with his behavior. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnoutwood_5c9e.html" title="User:Snoutwood">Snoutwood</a> <a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnoutwood_5ab6.html" title="User talk:Snoutwood">(talk)</a> 06:57, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Snoutwood, when an admin deletes good-faith complaints and requests, I don't see what options are left other than ANI and RFC. Whatever the details, it's <i>still</i> clear that this admin made <i>many</i> uncivil edit comments and has not been warned, much less blocked, for it. It's also clear that the person who made this complaint has been banned. The end result is that justice is not served and it looks a whole lot like admins sticking up for each other. However untrue this may be, this is genuinely how it appears, and this appearance itself causes harm.</p>
<p>I suggest that we put aside all this endless debate and solve the problem: an admin who violates the very rules he is charged to enforce and gets alway with it. Ask him to stop. Block him if he doesn't. That would be productive. Telling people to go talk to him is clearly not. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus"><font color="darkcyan">Al</font></a> 07:08, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Snoutwood has kindly requested Alkivar respond to these allegations. I think he deserves the opportunity to have his say. However, should he decline the offer to explain his contested edits or fail to justify them (admittedly, i can't imagine any valid justification for leaving an edit summary "jesus fuck learn grammar you tards" when an editor had used "An" instead of "The" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Warez&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=49092462" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Warez&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=49092462" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>) then i would also suggest that a process be initiated in the same way as it would if a non admin showed this pattern of behaviour. I concur with Al in how it "looks". That is unfortunate, as i don't believe there is any conspiracy here, but as he suggests, appearance itself can cause harm. Neverthless, i don't believe this is necessarily Snoutwood's problem and, at this stage, either of us could as easily engage Alkivar in a discussion about this since we are concerned. <b><a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockpocket_2e94.html" title="User:Rockpocket"><font color="green">Rockpock</font></a><font color="blue">e</font><a href="../../../r/o/c/User_talk%7ERockpocket_62af.html" title="User talk:Rockpocket"><font color="green">t</font></a></b> 07:33, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've just talked to Alkivar on IRC, which I know isn't a substitute for onwiki comment, but it just sort of fell together and I seized the opportunity. Since no-one's bothered to show the "good faith" efforts to deal with the situation, I'll show the two edits shown to me by Alkivar as being the most likely to have been the "criticism" from Beisnj, seeing as they edited the same pages as Beisnj and he said that he posted anonymously: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Alkivar&amp;diff=30265465&amp;oldid=30242778" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Alkivar&amp;diff=30265465&amp;oldid=30242778" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Oklahoma_Christian_University&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=30432039" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Oklahoma_Christian_University&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=30432039" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. Jusge for yourself; those strike me as defiantly trolling posts and as such I refute Duckdid/Beisnj's opinion of himself as being the bearer of good-faith criticism, pending further information. As for the incivility and cursing, he said that he'd already begun to tone down on that and would continue to do so (there have been a few recent bits of cursing in summaries, but as the edits weren't inicivil or in any way attacking I don't really see a problem). Seeing the situation in that light, I'm inclined to agree with the block of Duckdid and Alkivar's opinion that he shouldn't respond to a post from a troll, which is what this appears to be. As for the incivility, if it continues, which hopefully it won't, we can deal with it then; I don't believe any further action is necessary. Course, if you're inclined you can still talk to him about it, but I think it superfluous. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnoutwood_5c9e.html" title="User:Snoutwood">Snoutwood</a> <a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnoutwood_5ab6.html" title="User talk:Snoutwood">(talk)</a> 08:17, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay, Snoutwood, you'll see above that Alkivar took three RfAs to gain the mop; part of that was likely his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Alkivar_3&amp;diff=27023095&amp;oldid=27022899" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Alkivar_3&amp;diff=27023095&amp;oldid=27022899" rel="nofollow">promise</a> in that 3rd RfA to be civil and polite in his intereactions with others. So all arguments that he is "unaware of the problem" should be null and void; like any other user, <b>he had been warned, repeatedly!</b> Then above it's stated that his incivility lies in the past, citing diffs from as long ago as December 2005. This ignores the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Glowsticking&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=56434872" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Glowsticking&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=56434872" rel="nofollow">why do idiots</a> comment from June 1, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Colditz_Castle&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=54635749" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Colditz_Castle&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=54635749" rel="nofollow">SHOUTING IN ALL CAPS</a> on May 22nd, and the gratuitous usage of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tadeusz_B%C3%B3r-Komorowski&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=56432852" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tadeusz_B%C3%B3r-Komorowski&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=56432852" rel="nofollow">fuck</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Filipino_hip_hop&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=55885698" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Filipino_hip_hop&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=55885698" rel="nofollow">fucking</a> in edit summaries from June 1 and May 30 respectively.

<dd>Since I believe you to be an honest, good-faith user, I'm going to say this one more time and then be gone from this thread (barring further information, of course): I have no interest in solving your problems for you, with no help. If you have a problem with Alkivar, talk to him. If you're worried about being blocked, I personally swear that if Alkivar blocks you for politely criticising him I will unblock (course, this isn't actually going to happen, since Alkivar isn't stupid). And, since I'm an idiot and can't help myself, a parting note: I see little wrong with any of your diffs, they're hardly admin abuse (not even admin related). None of them really attack anybody, and although they could certainly be better I think that he'll respond if you just try and talk to him about it. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnoutwood_5c9e.html" title="User:Snoutwood">Snoutwood</a> <a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnoutwood_5ab6.html" title="User talk:Snoutwood">(talk)</a> 20:25, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As far as i'm concerned, Snoutwood has taken this as far as he should, and i'd like to go on record in thanking him for that. Its clear that Dizzied was less than frank about his "good-faith criticism". Similarly Alkivar has been less than civil in the past, and while he recent summaries as still not what i would expect of an admin, they are not quite as blatantly offensive as some older examples. He has said he is working on it and now Snoutwood has expressed further concern, Alkivar will realise that this problem is not going to go away unless he pulls up his socks. Should he continue to be uncivil then this exchange can be used as evidence of his lack of progress in that area. Thats my opinion anyway. <b><a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockpocket_2e94.html" title="User:Rockpocket"><font color="green">Rockpock</font></a><font color="blue">e</font><a href="../../../r/o/c/User_talk%7ERockpocket_62af.html" title="User talk:Rockpocket"><font color="green">t</font></a></b> 05:35, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So you are saying these were not your communiques with him: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Alkivar&amp;diff=30265465&amp;oldid=30242778" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Alkivar&amp;diff=30265465&amp;oldid=30242778" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Oklahoma_Christian_University&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=30432039" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Oklahoma_Christian_University&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=30432039" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>? You lack of denial at the time suggested to me that were. If not, perhaps you could provide the diffs that illustrate the "good faith criticisms" from you that he deleted then. Note, however, that i immediately criticised Alkivar's behaviour on the evidence provided also.

<dd>Two points. First, while it is possible I may have used the term “good faith criticisms”, I fail to recall this ever happening. Secondly, I was deliberately cryptic about the two criticisms in question because I was protecting a privacy concern. I don’t want to say anything more than that I agree largely with the wording and intent of those two posts and that the IP address was apparently not blocked or warned for those comments.</dd>

<dd>So, what does that tell us? It shows that no arguments of substance have yet to be made in support of Alkivar. Every argument in his defense has really been an ad hominem against me. And then consider that even if every single accusation was true (except the CapnCrack vandalism), if I did make the two edits in question, if I never attempted to talk to Alkivar personally, and whatever else has been stewed up, none of that compares to the poor behavior of Alkivar (note that I haven’t even brought up Alkivar’s possible sockpuppetry). Yet I’ve been permanently blocked, and he is an administrator with not even a warning. Dizzied 08:22, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Beisnj, contrary to your claims, I did not run a CheckUser on your <a href="../../../d/u/c/User%7EDuckdid_0b2f.html" title="User:Duckdid">User:Duckdid</a> account, and I did explain quite clearly why your User:Beisnj account was blocked. The "CapnCrack" vandalism coming from your computer for months now has been quite disturbing, and your claims that although you found it amusing, it wasn't you, just relatives and friends of yours, were hardly re-assuring. I conferred with the rest of the CheckUser group regarding your block, and they concurred that it was justified. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 22:36, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Interestingly, I got blocked, but the CapnCrack vandalism has continued. Never let reality stand in the way of bias. Amazingly, as well, the precious CheckUser was unable to show that the Beisnj and Duckdid accounts originate from the same computer and same IP address. No doubt, I am probably an imposter of Beisnj and not the real Beisnj. But rest assured, I am, in fact, a real vandal, CapnCrack, a sockpuppet, JFK's assassin, and the person who shot JR. Dizzied 05:16, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This blatant and obvious smear campaign continues.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For example, you claim, “Beisnj, contrary to your claims, I did not run a CheckUser on your User:Duckdid account…” First note that I never specifically stated that you ran a CheckUser on the Duckdid account; I simply said you ran it on me. And my comment about user CheckUser use is a reasonable interpretation of your statement to Alkivar, “CheckUser is inconclusive at this point, so you'd have to block based on other grounds (e.g. being an obvious sockpuppet).” To act like I just made that up out of thin air is just bad faith on your part.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>“…your claims that although you found it [CapnCrack’s vandalism] amusing…” An obvious distortion of the facts. I might as well say that every administrator who banters with a blocked user in the blocking edit summary must find vandalism to be amusing and is encouraging continued vandalism with the humorous edit summaries.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But, please, don’t stay on subject. Don’t talk about Alkivar’s profane outbursts, deleting of comments, incivility, bad edit summaries, attempt to add a bizarre picture to the brassiere page, or documented history of bad behavior in his three RfA.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It’s a lot easier to plop down on the drumhead and stir up the lynch mob.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>PS: Speaking of Alkivar’s bad edit summaries, notice in the block log that the reason given for CapnCrack’s infinite block is “bad edit summaries.” Interesting how irony works, isn’t it? Dizzied 05:56, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Preventing off-wiki intimidation takes precedence over everything else." Samuel, I agree that ought to be the case, but unfortunately it isn't. I also agree that editors can't be expected to collaborate with threats going on. All I know about this article is that it has a long and troubled history. It's a bio of a living person and so it has to be written in strict accordance with the content policies, and it currently isn't, so whoever is complaining about it is almost certainly right to do so. <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> and the ArbCom both urge admins to handle complaints about living bios with sensitivity, so blocking the complainant may not be the best way to proceed, although I agree that he should offer constructive suggestions and not threats — but then again, this situation has been going on for a very long time. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 20:13, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

As for the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act: BLP says we should be sensitive to requests from subjects of bios to remove material that isn't relevant to their notability. I don't know how notable Lauder-Frost is, or exactly what he's notable for. I haven't heard of him apart from on Wikipedia and there doesn't seem to be a huge amount published. I'd therefore say that any minor convictions from a long time ago probably shouldn't be in the article. I don't know how others feel about that. I prefer to err on the side of caution where living people are concerned. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 22:25, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As I just commented on the article's talk page, I fail to be convinced by Lightbringer/Sussexman's arguments that mentioning his conviction is illegal in the UK, since they bring no evidence to the table to support it (and in any case, these legal arguments are irrelevant to Wikipedia itself or to non-UK editors). However, I also remain to be convinced that mention of the conviction is necessary.</dd>

<p>I think they are right as to UK law, but in the Robert I arbitration case we decided it didn't apply. I wonder though if the information is relevant. Gregory Lauder-Frost is mainly known for his political associations and views. It is hard to see how his legal difficulties are relevant or notable. If the point is to embarrass him, well done, but if the idea to record the history of his political life, it is a distraction. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> 01:19, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Is this the current standing of Wikipedia policy that military operation names are not permitted on any article space? Or is this over zealous editing.

<p>Just to add this user moved <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Just_Cause_7955.html" title="Operation Just Cause">Operation Just Cause</a> citing its a propaganda name, from what I see without any talk page disucssion except her own comment <a href="../../../o/p/e/Talk%7EOperation_Just_Cause_d4f7.html#Propaganda_title" title="Talk:Operation Just Cause">Talk:Operation_Just_Cause#Propaganda_title</a>, to <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_invasion_of_Panama_bfb0.html" title="US invasion of Panama">US invasion of Panama</a> then started renaming all examples of Operation Just Cause from articles that contain the term.

<p>When a colloquial name exists it should be used in preference to the military propaganda name. For example: "Gulf War" instead of "Operation Desert Storm", "Iraq War" instead of "Operation Iraqi Freedom", "World War II" or "Second World War" instead of "The Emergency", etc. I think this user is being overzealous though: obviously the propaganda names are notable and need to be discussed, but they shouldn't be the primary name we use to refer to events. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><span style="color:#ff66ff;cursor:w-resize;"><b>Cyde↔Weys</b></span></a> 16:16, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The user has attempted to remove the term from every article, sometimes causing it to be reffered to as both in the same article. Breaking the uniform of the article itself. For instance some state the places the person served by operation, then state in the article now, the non operation term. It seems to me its also sloppy editing as enough thought was not put into its effects. Considering all were made today in the span of 2 hours or so. Are operation names allows in the body of articles? I understand possibly redirecting titles, but there is no policy regarding article bodies I would assume. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_ecbe.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults"><i><font color="blue"><sup>|sockpuppets|</sup></font></i></a> 16:22, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not going to argue over names, but I would be reluctant to call an operational name a "propaganda name." Operational names may be chosen for propaganda purposes, but I think it is more NPOV to refer to an operational name.

Now there reason have even changed from propaganda terms do not belong on wikipedia, to I was doing it to prevent redirects.

<dd>Can we stop the hyperbole and strawman arguments PLEASE?

The operation names as chosen by the U.S. government are specficially chosen for propaganda reasons. Additionally, we are writing a worldwide encyclopedia, and very few people from other countries are going to know U.S. military names for certain invasions, but all of them are going to know "Iraq War".

<dd>Regardless of whether the edits themselves are legitimate, I believe edit summaries such as 'No propaganda terms, please' cast unwarranted aspersions on previous editors' motives.

<dd>Operational names are often used when there is no generally accepted name otherwise, or if the operational name itself is the commonly used term to describe the battle that occured. Other times one side or another names the battle a name, such as <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Battle_of_Bull_Run_8962.html" title="First Battle of Bull Run">First Battle of Bull Run</a>. As with this, the US name not accepted by the Confederates, and they had their own name for it, <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Battle_of_Manassas_b761.html" title="First Battle of Manassas">First Battle of Manassas</a>, which redirects to the previous page. Names are rarely universal in war. Calling every operation in any country an invasion isnt correct, for instance was <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Desert_Fox_876d.html" title="Operation Desert Fox">Operation Desert Fox</a> an invasion of Iraq? When referring to the event, most do not call it "Bombardment of Iraq" but instead Operation Desert Fox. When most people refer to <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Rolling_Thunder_756a.html" title="Operation Rolling Thunder">Operation Rolling Thunder</a>, they call it this rather than "Bombardment of North Vietnam." It does not violate NPOV to call them these code names or government chosen battle names if these battle names or operation names have entered the vocabulary of the public. When most people think of the Iraq War, they call it this, not Operation Iraqi Freedom (which was only the US operation that took place in the invasion). Thus <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq_War_58f4.html" title="Iraq War">Iraq War</a> is aptly named, not because it is totally neutral, for instance the insurgents might call it the American War like Vietnam called their war, or perhaps they have a different name entirely. But to us english speaking public, Iraq War is the standard. If most people called World War Two "The Crisis" then that would be what we call it, but as they do not we call it what is the most common name, World War Two.</dd>
<dd>So to reiterate, we name wars, operations, and battles not because they were chosen neutrally, by a third party, or by the involved parties, but instead because they have entered society and become the accepted name for the respective event. Anoranzo has consistently ignored this and consistently edited likewise, and it has been detrimental to the articles, giving false impressions both of the conflicts the articles are about, and of Wikipedia's policy on neutrality. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERangeley_3f20.html" title="User:Rangeley">Rangeley</a> 21:31, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The user is once again up to removing all mentioning of Operation Iraqi Freedom from Wikipedia stating "an encyclopedia should not use propaganda terms".<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Norman_Schwarzkopf,_Jr.&amp;diff=57608999&amp;oldid=prev" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Norman_Schwarzkopf,_Jr.&amp;diff=57608999&amp;oldid=prev" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> Its not just the removal of Operation names reagrding the US only. The user is also creating articles where sometimes they use operation names and sometimes they do not, further more they are not taking into account that wars are split into multiple operations and some soldiers and officials only serve during certain parts, therefore removing all mention of the operations with the larger war is not as specific as referencing it by operation name. The worst part is they are creating situations where the userbox states the person served in OIF but OIF isnt mentioned in the article anymore like in the case of<a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeffrey_Chessani_e25d.html" title="Jeffrey Chessani">Jeffrey_Chessani</a>. Lastly the edits are sloppy, they are removing the term then telling other editors to clean up the rest of the article with edits summaries like this "revert as propaganda terms are inappropriate. If you find more, please remove them, too" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Objective_Individual_Combat_Weapon_program&amp;diff=57610913&amp;oldid=prev" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Objective_Individual_Combat_Weapon_program&amp;diff=57610913&amp;oldid=prev" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>, its not other editors job to clean up articles that other editors are knowingly creating problems in. Its even more proof as the last edit shows another operation name right before the one she is constantly attempting to remove, impossible to miss if this user was reading the articles before editing them and not blanket editing with no concern for structure and consistency.</p>

<dd>You were complaining here about a case where removing the propaganda term even avoided a redirect.

<dd>We will let an admin decide on your wholesale removal of every mention you can find of Operation Iraqi Freedom, including in Michael Jordans article and a comic strip. I am done arguing with you and your double talk.

He's Thewolfstar's 18-year-old son, living at home, sharing a LAN network with her. I have spoken with Macai and believe we should assume good faith here. For one thing, I saw Thewolfstar referring to him several times <i>before</i> she was in any trouble or could have had any reason to lie about it. Also Macai has never edited abusively. In fact, now he doesn't edit at all, being hit by his mother's blocks — compare mine and Demi's conversation with him on his talkpage. Is it possible to do anything about this? At a minimum, it would be nice to raise some awareness about this young editor, so he doesn't keep getting labelled a vandal sock. I realize it's difficult to let him edit as long as he shares a unique IP with a community-banned family member. Incidentally, Essjay has endorsed my description of Macai's situation as likely, in this conversation on the CheckUser page: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser&amp;diff=54345520&amp;oldid=54345415" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser&amp;diff=54345520&amp;oldid=54345415" rel="nofollow">[27]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser&amp;diff=54347672&amp;oldid=54345520" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser&amp;diff=54347672&amp;oldid=54345520" rel="nofollow">[28]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser&amp;diff=54348302&amp;oldid=54347672" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser&amp;diff=54348302&amp;oldid=54347672" rel="nofollow">[29]</a> <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 10:05, 9 June 2006 (UTC).</p>

<p>Um, if you check the history of the article you'll see it was created near the end of the AFD on <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid_wall.html" title="Apartheid wall">Apartheid wall</a> - an AFD that had a consensus of mergeto <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_West_Bank_barrier_e188.html" title="Israeli West Bank barrier">Israeli West Bank barrier</a>. I created the subpage as a percursor to the merge in case the reviewing admin deleted or redirected the article without implementing the merge himself. So for heavens sake, relax. Homey 23:57, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Posted on User:Timothy Usher: You should have just asked me.</p>
<p>It wasn't recreated. On June 3, the day before the Apartheid wall article AFD ended and in anticipation of the finding of a consensus to merge I copied the article to a subpage of Israeli West Bank barrier so I could undertake the merge once the AFD was complete. I anticipated that the reviwing admin might blank and redirect the page without merging it. S/he did so on June 4 and once that happened I copied the contents of the subpage and pasted it into the main article thus executing the merge. Jayjg then made some adjustments.

<p>More importantly, re article: Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn (Rosicrucian Order of A+O)</p>
<p>User 999 is revising the content making it non factual. It should be noted that a compromise was reached in developing the description of modern Golden Dawn groups by Wikipedia mediator T.

<p>User 999 is repeatedly and maliciously violating this rule and trying to give our order, the Rosicrucian Order of A+O a description which is inaccurate and politically motivated.</p>

<dd>Removed remark began, "I have just found out from my Watchlist that there appears to be some sort concerted action against Star Trek Fan Films" and was on fan film talkpage. Removal of remark followed same methodology employed last night uncontroverrsially from BigDT. Note that complainant is a Trek fan film director, BTW, according to his talk page. User who posted original removed remark (Kirok) has made all sorts of sinister implications on his talk page based on my use of the afd_helper code. He's done wikistalking (investigating my monobook.js), personal attacks, bad faith assumptions, and incivility -- which I did not bring here per the way MikeW...'s similar incident was handled here last night, but instead merely asked him <i>politely</i> to cut it out (see talk page). Merely asked user to stop being incivil/stop the personal attacks/etc. Complainant above restored vote-stuffing query from original user, thus restoring the canvassing for votes -- if the canvassing warning isn't policy (despite ArbCom rulings?), then why is it even on the warning page? — <b><a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike">WCityMike</a></b> <sup>(<a href="../../../w/c/i/User_talk%7EWCityMike_fb24.html" title="User talk:WCityMike">T</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WCityMike_e8da.html" title="Special:Contributions/WCityMike">C</a>)</sup> <span style="color:black; background-color:#FFFFCC">&#160;<small><b>↓</b> plz reply <u>HERE</u> &#160;(<a href="../../../t/a/l/Wikipedia%7ETalk_page_a6d3.html#How_to_keep_a_two-way_conversation_readable" title="Wikipedia:Talk page">why?</a>)&#160;<b>↓</b></small>&#160;</span> 15:33, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

In actuality, I did not. Were you to see my bookshelves at home, you'd see I'm not precisely a detractor of Star Trek. However, it is simply that the extreme proliferation of fan-film-related articles, including each and every one I cited, has led to a large collection of non-notable articles that I felt merited exposure to a AfD vote. Nomination does not equal deletion. Nomination states, "This user feels that the community should come to a consensus about whether this article deserves to be on Wikipedia." I don't think that that opinion is out of line, but evidently by expressing that opinion, I've given license to many hordes of Trek Wikipedians to engage in personal attacks and indignant outrage. It's a shame people (in general, not just in this incident) sem to have lost the ability to respectfully disagree. Those who can still pull it off usually come across as class acts. — <b><a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike">WCityMike</a></b> <sup>(<a href="../../../w/c/i/User_talk%7EWCityMike_fb24.html" title="User talk:WCityMike">T</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WCityMike_e8da.html" title="Special:Contributions/WCityMike">C</a>)</sup> <span style="color:black; background-color:#FFFFCC">&#160;<small><b>↓</b> plz reply <u>HERE</u> &#160;(<a href="../../../t/a/l/Wikipedia%7ETalk_page_a6d3.html#How_to_keep_a_two-way_conversation_readable" title="Wikipedia:Talk page">why?</a>)&#160;<b>↓</b></small>&#160;</span> 15:38, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I could suggest moving this conversation off to a talk page again, but you're clearly looking for an administrator to act as a mediator or referee in this dispute. There's no blatant vandalism, attacks, or activity by blocked or banned users here. Again, you're looking for someone with <i>administrative powers</i> to simply witness and/or referee your content dispute.

<li>This editor has now moved onto <i>Lost</i>-related articles. As he has stated above, he is on a mass AfD campaign ("<i>the extreme proliferation of fan-film-related articles has led to a large collection of non-notable articles that I felt merited exposure to a AfD vote.</i>), which appears to be contrary to <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. Rather than constructively aiming to develop consensus (or WP-policy improvements), he has chosen to list numerous fiction articles under the pretense of calling them "fancruft". I'm as against cruftiness as the next editor-- in fact, I have a back-burner <a href="../../../l/e/f/User_talk%7ELeflyman_Not_a_Fansite_9ee8.html" title="User talk:Leflyman/Not a Fansite">proposal about the topic</a>-- but disrupting WP/antagonising other editors is not the appropriate way to demonstrate the rightness of that belief. I would suggest that WCityMike should refrain from mass AfD nominations, and if he continues, to face appropriate sanctions. --<font face="Verdana,San-Serif" size="-2"><strong><a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">Leflyman</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/f/User_talk%7ELeflyman_3737.html" title="User talk:Leflyman">Talk</a></sup></strong></font> 00:04, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Agreed. It doesn't appear he's nominated anything in the last few hours, but I do think a block may be neccisary should he begin again. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 03:19, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I take respectful issue with InShaneee's comments. I have done my best to demonstrate good faith throughout the rather large outpouring of angry editors who have repeatedly taken issue with my nomination of articles that I felt did not meet Wikipedia's criterion for inclusion.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>For example, I engaged in extremely long dialogues with NickC and Kirok on Kirok's <a href="../../../k/i/r/User_talk%7EKirok_41d5.html" title="User talk:Kirok">talk page</a> (dialogues which were time-consuming) to address their concerns and in an attempt to make peace with them, despite Kirot (as a new editor) posting rather egregious diatribes about the AFD Helper code and making incivil remarks all over the votes. And, indeed, with each of these individuals, I left the issue having made peace with them, as you can read for yourself.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The largest majority of other editors who have attempted to speak with me personally (including the two individuals bringing complaints in this section) have not demonstrated assumption of good faith or civility. But certainly, <i><b>administrators</b></i> should uphold these policies in their official actions as administrators. I have asked every single person who has accused me of bad faith in my nominations of articles to provide proof that I have acted sinisterly or with malicious intent. None have responded with same.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I respectfully posit that it would be a poor choice for an administrator to issue a block — which, from my understanding, is a preventative measure ("blocks are preventative, not punitive," I've heard several admins say) — to attempt to cease measures which are done in good faith.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Prior to reading this remark, and prior to posting this remark, I had nominated a handful of articles to AfD this morning. I emphasize that this was done <i><b>prior</b></i> to reading this comment, so it was not a retaliatory action to InShaneee's comments. However, it can now be argued I have "begun again." In these nominations, I did my best to offer more precise, reasoned criteria as to why I believed the article merited deletion, avoiding the seemingly inflammatory "fancruft" phrase, and I think it would be extremely difficult for anyone to argue that these nominations were made in bad faith and deserve blocking. (Indeed, no one has decided they need to take me to task on my talk page, as they had been doing yesterday.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I am writing here not to prolong the issue in your eyes — as you can see above, I have attempted to make peace without administrator invention, once it was suggested that this issue was better handled without administrator intervention (see <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html#Request_that_Admin_Ask_Fellow_User_to_Cease_Personal_Attacks" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI#Request that Admin Ask Fellow User to Cease Personal Attacks</a> above).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But I did monitor this complaint when first brought against me, and I find it quite disturbing that an administrator is now seemingly ready to levy a block based on popular sentiment with no proof of the various accusations of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">disruption</a> and <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">malicious intent</a> that have been tossed about by the people here and elsewhere. Thus, I'd respectfully suggest that said administrator reconsider their readiness to do same.</dd>

<dd>I am not currently following the Afd discussions, but if (for example) the articles you nominated yesterday are generating strong keep consensus, it probably doesn't make sense to nominate more in the same class. If the consensus is mixed, with some going each way, I would proceed with a small number per day. Having fanfic based articles for a few extra days is worth fostering an environment of calmness and deliberation that focuses on the article content and not the nominator. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 18:42, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To answer your query, Thatcher131, without grabbing all the votes and calculating percentages to give you a precise answer, it's roughly a mixed bag. A very good portion of them are generating a <i>delete</i> consensus, a few are no-consensus, and I believe one or two are definitely leaning towards <i>keep</i>s (<i>Star Trek: New Voyages</i>, for example). —&#160;<span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 96%; font-weight: bold"><a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike">Mike</a></span>&#160;•&#160; 19:12, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It looks like on June 6 you nominated about 35 articles (Trek and Lost, mostly). I'd say that a high rate of deletions demonstrates good faith, and that somewhere there is a number (less than 35, obviously) that will let people focus on the article rather than you. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 19:32, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Not to keep rehasing this matter, but this editor appears to be once again nominating AfDs. What seems to raise eyebrows is that two days after his <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_WCityMike_251a.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/WCityMike">self-nominated request for adminship failed</a> -- which pointed out his limited understanding of WP policies, the first "oppose" suggesting greater participation in AfD-- this editor put forth dozens of deletion noms simultaneously. When criticised for this mass campaign by a number of other editors, he responded with claims of "assuming bad faith" and "incivility" -- at one point, engaging in an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Oceanic_Airlines&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Oceanic_Airlines&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">extensive revert war with one anon editor</a> on two AfDs. (Note the repeated deletion of non-personal comments under the claim of <a href="../../../r/p/a/WP%7ERPA_efd5.html" title="WP:RPA">WP:RPA</a>, a stridently disputed <i>guideline</i>). This editor still fails to acknowledge that his mass AfD campaign has been disruptive, and in the case of the <i>Lost</i> articles he's listed-- <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_DHARMA_Initiative_stations_bd9a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/DHARMA Initiative stations">DHARMA Initiative Stations</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Oceanic_Airlines_209a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Oceanic Airlines">Oceanic Airlines</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_songs_featured_on_Lost_3887.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of songs featured on Lost">List of songs featured on Lost</a> -- fruitless and time-wasting.</li>

There may be more going on here than meets the eye - <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZigzogger_32d7.html" title="User:Zigzogger">user:Zigzogger</a> was temp blocked by <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrokenSegue_79a9.html" title="User:BrokenSegue">BrokenSegue</a> for "harassment, abuse, and reposting of an AfD'd article", and then permanently blocked later in the day. I have to say I can't see any evidence of the first two from <i>that</i> account, but <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZigz0gger_3edb.html" title="User:Zigz0gger">user:Zigz0gger</a> (created the same day as Zigzogger's blocking, but prior to the temp block) was undoubtedly abusive and harassing.

<dd>It appears that at the time the two accounts were blocked (May 21) there was no discussion on AN/I and no Checkuser request made.

<dd>Just a note, not necessarily relevant to this case, but to make sure it's said: Obvious sockpuppets may be blocked without checkuser. Checkuser is just a tool to confirm what is already known, and if it doesn't appear to need confirmation, there is no need to checkuser. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <font color="#7B68EE">(<small><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">Talk</font></a> • <font color="#7B68EE">Connect</font></small>)</font></span> 00:41, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sure, but if Zigz0gger does a bad thing, IMO the chance that Zigz0gger is impersonating Zigzogger is at least as good, if not marginally better than, Zigz0gger being a sockpuppet of Zigzogger.

<dd>What I don't like is the fact that zigzogger was <i>indefinately</i> blocked due to impersonating sockpuppet. But use of a sockpuppet like zigzogger did to 'evade' a ban now with Kitteneatkitten means that ban/block counters should be reset. <i>Opinion and suggestion:</i> So zigzogger gets a 48+ hr ban (maybe more, since the sock puppet violated 3RR). And then, maybe some more for incivility by zigzogger because he/she kept spouting off on their talk page throwing accusations(which weren't known to be definitively correct at the time) at Big.P after being indef blocked. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Breitenstein_8775.html" title="User:Kevin Breitenstein">Kevin_b_er</a> 00:55, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think this needs more discussion.

I consider <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZigzogger_32d7.html" title="User:Zigzogger">User:Zigzoggerthe</a> sock. Second, you may have miss stated the case. <a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKitteneatkitten_415d.html" title="User:Kitteneatkitten">User:Kitteneatkitten</a>, did not edit any article since May 19. Blocks are not suppose to be punitive.

<dd>I wasn't really here beyond to try to get the indef block recinded after I saw the checkuser. I made a case above that it could be resolved by going and removing the indef block, then doing that reset the block counter(which was at 48 hrs before being extended to indef) which is in some policy I can't find at the moment. If someone was really irate about it, longer than 48, but not indef. That was a suggestion. The fact that kitteneatkitten is older than zigzogger makes things <i>complicated</i>, but... <b>I'm not an administrator</b>. I've notified <a href="../../../r/a/s/User%7ERasputinAXP_290b.html" title="User:RasputinAXP">RasputinAXP</a>, however, as he made extensive modifications to the blocking structure of this incident.

<dd>I already left an apology on Zigzogger's talk. I saw the messages Big P left on their user page. I feel terrible that Big P tried to cause me to have bad feeling toward Zig. As far as I'm concerned there should be no further block. I thought you were trying to cause a block to continue for 48 more hours. I think the user should be able to choose between Kitteneatkitten or Zigzogger. I left a message on the talk page asking Zig about this.

<dd>I'm not again Zig reverting to Kitteneatkitten and having User:Zigzogger locked out as a sock. I felt very bad for Zig, as Kevin said above it was a Very Bad Thing that Big.P did, and I've blocked him for a month, and that's only because other than this incident and a bout of incivility he's been something of a contributing member of the community. I still feel he needs a longer time-out, but in the end the month may be enough.

<dd>FWIW my general impression is that the crawl revisits every week or two. Generally, the cached versions you find of pages tend to be within the last ten days. This was picked up on the 7th, so it should be gone by mid-month.

<dd>I'm not sure that would be best. My issues with this (beyond the abuse of the Wikipedia servers) is that some or all of the participants might not be the teenagers they claim to be, and that some of the acts described are illegal (an adult having sex with a minor). <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanderson7_df2b.html" title="User:Canderson7">Canderson7</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECanderson7_595d.html" title="User talk:Canderson7">talk</a>)</sup> 23:09, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It would not be a misuse of Wikipedia's resources. I think some sort of "oversight" privileges were added recently? This place is an encyclopedia, and having that material still accessible (even only to administrators) is distracting, to say this euphemistically. These sorts of things do not happen on a regular basis, so it is not to say we are setting a precedent by cleaning up nicely. --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> 23:13, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't know if non-administrators are allowed to chip in; I just stumbled across this thread. If any of these parties are located in the U.S. (where Wikipedia is based), the Foundation may have a legal responsibility to report (but not necessarily investigate) this affair. Presumably the Wikipedia has legal counsel -- it may want to run this by that person. Also, in my own personal opinion, the kid needs help and the others, if adults, need watching by the authorities in their respective jurisdictions as potential predators. Inititiating that process should be something the U.S. authorities are (hopefully) equipped set in motion with their peers elsewhere once they receive a report.</dd>

<dd>I did not mean to sound American-centric or to propose the FBI as the "world police". Regardless of where the user is, I suggested the Foundation officially contact the FBI since that is where the Foundation is. Even if the FBI doesn't have the lead on this investigation (for instance if the parties are all in other countries), they will still be asked by the other authorities to work with the Foundation on server logs, etc. on the other countries' behalf. Also, the FBI will know better who to contact for this sort of matter in other countries than Wikipedia would just calling the switchboard number for the police in Hong Kong (or New Zealand or wherever). These Internet sex-abuse investigations routinely involve a lot of international police cooperation.

<dd>This thread is very active. For my own peace of mind, I'm going to contact one of those people with the oversight flag, and let them decide what would be appropriate to do. The issue isn't whether we have reduced the accessibility of those posts to a small fraction of the population. The issue is that we need to take responsibility for this as far as our technical abilities as volunteers on this project allow. This will become more important as this site becomes more publically visible. This is just one example where there needs to be some sense of resolved accountability. Once I've left a post on say, one of the 17 people with that flag, I'll be happy. --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> 23:39, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I absolutely do not understand the inclinations others have to get the <i>authorities</i> involved (assuming arguendo, of course, that there's no legal requirement that someone so act, of the absence of which requirement I'm certain); where individuals disrupt Wikipedia, we block them. Where they use Wikipedia for unencyclopedic purposes, as a webhost or a chatting service, for example, we block them. But once they are no longer involved in Wikipedia, we absolutely ought not to consider the extra-Wiki consequences of their on-Wiki dealings; just as we only contact schools or IPs in order that they should know about severe disruption coming from users to whom they provide Internet access, so too ought we only to contact law enforcement, for example, where we require intervention to prevent disruption of the encyclopedia (the relevant instances would be rather rare). We, for what it's worth, are an encyclopedia and are, or ought to be, concerned primarily about the content of the work of those who contribute. If we had a valuable contributor who had occasion to note, in passing, on a user talk page that he/she had recently murdered someone or was planning to murder someone (where such discourse neither is intended to disrupt nor actually disrupts and where collaboration is not significantly impaired), I can't imagine that we'd ever suggest that anything be done; we don't care, or oughtn't to care, about what people do off-Wiki. Now, where they use Wikipedia to facilitate unencyclopedic activities (whether child sex or fantasy baseball), we ought to direct users to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and, if necessary, implement blocks, but <b>only to prevent disruption of the project</b>. I'm certain that Brad Patrick will conclude that we've no legal obligation to report, and we ought to stop our inquiry there. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 03:23, 10 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>For myself, as a <i>human being</i> I sure hope someone would take notice if an editor seriously discussed murdering someone. I mean, come on, that's taking writing an encyclopedia a bit too seriously if it's more important than a human life. I agree that we shouldn't go about as a little vigilante squad, but counsel should check what the legal obligation is to report it, and do so. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a> <a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a> 03:52, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>"I'm certain that Brad Patrick will conclude that we've no legal obligation to report, and we ought to stop our inquiry there." That's <i>his job</i>; let him do it. He gets paid to protect the Foundation from liability; there is question here of whether this situation places the Foundation in a position of liability, and it's Brad's job to decide what to do to protect the Foundation. The solution to a question is not to assume you know the answer and hope it doesn't come back to bite the Foundation; the solution is to ask, which is exactly what we've done. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <font color="#7B68EE">(<small><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">Talk</font></a> • <font color="#7B68EE">Connect</font></small>)</font></span> 17:56, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Heh, can you spell BJAODN? Seriously, though I wouldn't be surprised if this is somebody's calculated way of trolling us into another moral panic. I agree though, delete the text, block the users, maybe even block the IP addresses if they are static, but I think the supposed moral benefit of reporting this crap to the authorities would be outweighed by (a) shortage of evidence, and (b) an avenue for further negative publicitity, media feeding frenzy, Jimbo on CNN again.

She asked Col Hauler to look at a certain website. (Incidentally, Col Hauler has recently been trolling in support of banned users.)

<li>In the previous case, I blocked indefinitely as an open proxy, on the advice of someone more tech-y than me.

<dd>A genuine newbie starts by finding a Wikipedia article (perhaps through Google), reading it, clicking on the edit box, and making some change, only later finding discussion pages, and much later still finding Project pages like <a href="../../../r/f/p/WP%7ERFPP_fba0.html" title="WP:RFPP">WP:RFPP</a>. This account was clearly created for one purpose — which was <i>not</i> editing an encyclopaedia. Also the addition of \\\ all over the page was surely vandalism. I see no reason not to block indefinitely as a vandalizing puppet. Not sure why anyone thinks it's open proxy. It could be, of course, but without check user we have no way of knowing the IP, so is there any particular reason to think it's open proxy? <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 09:10, 11 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Because of the \\\, actually. If it's what I think it is <s>(haven't checked)</s> (and it is), then that part is not deliberate vandalism (ironically enough); it's a bug that only occurs when someone edits through an open proxy. The \\\ business before every apostrophe is a dead giveaway. --<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshenai_4e13.html" title="User:Ashenai">Ashenai</a> 09:13, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The reason I believed it to be an open proxy was the insertion of "\\\" all over the place, which is not typically intentional vandalism, but something that goes screwy when editing through an op. It would also make sense if this is Thewolfstar's puppet trying to get by IP blocks by using an open proxy. But anyway, even after blocking the account (which I'm going to go do right now), it still seems that a CheckUser (if allowed for this reason) may be advantageous so that the proxy cannot be abused again. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 09:16, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've joined this section to the one above which I started yesterday, because I see a link. I saw something signed Bishonen a few days ago, and knew it wasn't. Bishonen said it was Thewolfstar. Then I saw some edits from an anon signed Thewolfstar, which posted a link to personal information about an admin who was the victim of very serious harassment. I blocked the account for a week, posted here about it, and deleted the edits. One of them was to <a href="../../../c/o/l/User_talk%7ECol._Hauler_2f8c.html" title="User talk:Col.

<p>It was unsigned, but was followed by a link to the same website as the one that yesterday's message linked to.</p>

<p>I've deleted it from the history, but it can still be seen in the deleted edits.</p>
<p>I blocked the IP (72.232.212.134) for a week, but if it's an open proxy, perhaps someone should change it to indefinite.

<dd>I wouldn't consider him an established user eventhough his edit count is fairly good for being here for a short time. After looking at his edit history, I agree that rehab would be more appropriate but I think there should be a probationary period with this user where his edits are watched. I don't know if that's possible or not though. But why 36hrs as opposed to 48? He seems to have quite a few moments in his activities on talk pages where he becomes hot if he doesn't get his way. I'm surprised no issues of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECivil_1ef2.html" title="WP:Civil">WP:Civil</a> have come up before with him. That's just my two cents though.

<p>To be fair, due to the recent events that have taken place, I will request that someone else either a) unblock the user, or b) re-instate the block on their own account.

<p>As was stated before, I was unfairly blocked - some weeks ago - under the user name <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArt_Dominique_8658.html" title="User:Art Dominique">Art Dominique</a>. Due to this ill-fated block, I was unable to enter any Wikipedia's site. I was not even able to place a complaint on this administrators' site, before I created another user account under the name of Wiki Digi. I made sure to explain on this administrators' page why the new user account had to be created. So, this was not a case of sockpuppetry, not in an ordinary sence anyway.</p>
<p>Since then, the only reason for me to sign in as Wiki Digi has been the above problem, which was already dealt with here. I have continued using the user name <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArt_Dominique_8658.html" title="User:Art Dominique">Art Dominique</a> on the <a href="../../../k/v/e/Kven.html" title="Kven">Kven</a> talk page, even when signing in as Wiki Digi, not to get other users confused or mixed up with the situation.</p>
<p>I have no problem using either one only - or both - of the these user accounts in question. Go ahead and tell me, which one you prefer for me to use, user <a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a>. You are the one who requested for me to blocked, due to this matter. The user <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> kindly took his time a couple of days ago to show anyone interested, that I indeed had explained on this administrators' site the reason for acquiring the new user account. However, someone else misunderstood her, and placed me in block. <b>Thus, please, go ahead and release me now, a.s.a.p.&#160;!</b></p>
<p>Much damage has already been created on the Wikipedia's <a href="../../../k/v/e/Kven.html" title="Kven">Kven</a> text, since I was unfairly blocked a couple of days ago. The users who have made these changes, have provably either admitted of foul play before, or have admitted of not having proper knowledge about the topic (except for the user <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETravelbird_9a21.html" title="User:Travelbird">Travelbird</a>, that I know of). Sources for the new changes made in question have not been provided by them, despite of the consensus reached earlier, based on the appropriate request by user <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikka</a>: nothing should be changed in the Wikipedia's Kven text, without detailed sources offered first. Sadly, this ruling has not been followed.</p>

<p>This is a non-issue. Popups, for whatever reason, displays images on the bad images list that are only linked rather than displayed.

<dd>This strikes me as a bug rather than a feature. I thought that someone appeared to be manipulating the content in peculiar ways.

<dd>The problem is that the images were linked to using the inline syntax ([[Image:Autofellatio2.jpg]]) rather than the image link syntax ([[:Image:Autofellatio2.jpg]]). Since the image is on the "bad images" list, the two syntaxes have the same effect in articles, but popups.js doesn't know about the list -- so it sees that as being the lead image for the article, and displays it appropriately. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> 05:24, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The reason I am bringing it up on AN/I instead of <a href="../../../c/p/_/WP%7ECP_e7b9.html" title="WP:CP">WP:CP</a> is because the user <i>may</i> be attempting to evade detection by misusing copyright tags.</p>
<p>Based on the user's talk page, they (he/she) apparently started by not specifying any copyright information when uploading copyrighted images. After they discovered such images get deleted, they started claiming to be the creator of the work and releasing the images to the public domain. While it is possible the user really is the photographer, I believe this is unlikely because (a) the images appear to be professional photographs taken from difficult-to-access angles, (b) one image (Image:GTS Millenium.jpg has modified borders (shadowing, etc.) that is identical to the version of an image on another website (<a href="http://www.cruiseserver.net/travelpage/ships/cb_mille.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cruiseserver.net/travelpage/ships/cb_mille.asp" rel="nofollow">[55]</a>); (c) that website indicates everything on it is copyrighted. I did list that particular image on <a href="../../../c/p/_/WP%7ECP_e7b9.html" title="WP:CP">WP:CP</a>.</p>
<p>It possible the user is doing this in good faith, thinking the PD-self-made tag is just necessary Wikipedia bureaucracy to use an image.

<dd>I'm more inclined to atribute this to cluelesnes than bad faith. A lot of people actualy do believe that if they download an image then that copy of the image is theyrs to do with as they wish and other such misconseptions, and consider out attempts to clean it up as misguided paranoia at best and bullying at worst, wich tend to make them uncooperative. Give him a "hand written" warning explaining in detail what he is doing wrong (link to apropriate policy pages etc), and <i>then</i> apply the cluebat in apropriate measures if he continue ignoring us. I find this often works a lot better than getting dozens of "form letters" from OrphanBot about wrong copyright info on image XXX.</dd>

<p>A full scale editing war has broken out on this article: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Dawn_tradition#The_Hermetic_Order_of_the_Golden_Dawn_.28Inc..29" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Dawn_tradition#The_Hermetic_Order_of_the_Golden_Dawn_.28Inc..29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Dawn_tradition#The_Hermetic_Order_of_the_Golden_Dawn_.28Inc..29</a></p>
<p>They’re reverting the article incessantly, and arguing over whose order is at top of the links section, furthermore, there is also an editing war being perpetuated rampantly about a non- traditional Golden Dawn order being included in the links section. The article is being edited and reverted now, every couple of minutes.</p>
<p>Help! Can someone please lock this article to stop this vandalism, so that the other editors and myself can work this out. Please lock this article to stop these new, unscrupulous users frivolously editing the links in this article. Please lock the article immediately, so that myself and the established editors on the Golden Dawn article can stop this rampant editing war.</p>
<p>User 999, Zos, JMAX555 and senergeticmaggot are making false claims that I am using a so-called sock puppet, I vehemently disapprove of this, and I can state categorically that I am not using a sock-puppet. I am willing to send my IP address into a Wikipedia admin so that they can verify that these other new users, that are frequently editing the page are not operative via my IP address.</p>
<p>User 999 is creating schism and false intrigues against me they should he should rightfully receive a warning or a 24 hour block ,so that myself and other established editors of the Golden Dawn article can put a stop to this edit war. Please lock this page immediately to stop further abuse and editing wars.</p>
<p>A moderator has already blocked new users to the article; however, this is not the problem. It is not new users that are causing the disruptions, it is established users: 999, Zos, synergetic maggot and JMAX555. The article needs to be immediately fully protected as the aforementioned users are on one side of a current trademark litigation case and I am on the other. Their trying to get me blocked to that they can vandalise the article to their own biased political agenda. The aforementioned users have in fact had me innocently blocked a few days ago and then vandalised the article to You need to intervene more seriously and put a permanent block on the article, as these problems won’t go away until you take action against the aforementioned users.</p>
<p>These aforementioned users have instigated a full-scale edit war and the problem isn’t due to vandalism by new users. Take a look at the Rosicrucian Order of A+O page that was locked due to these aforementioned users creating an edit war, and now this has spilled over on the main Golden Dawn article.</p>
<p>These users are conspirators and are attempting to get me blocked so that they can go unchecked in an edit war to change the article in a defamatory tone, in an attempt to promote their political agenda over the other orders entries.</p>
<p>Here’s the link to show the aforementioned users last editing war that has now spilled over onto the main Golden Dawn article: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetic_Order_of_the_Golden_Dawn_%28Rosicrucian_Order_of_A%2BO%29" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetic_Order_of_the_Golden_Dawn_%28Rosicrucian_Order_of_A%2BO%29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetic_Order_of_the_Golden_Dawn_%28Rosicrucian_Order_of_A%2BO%29</a></p>
