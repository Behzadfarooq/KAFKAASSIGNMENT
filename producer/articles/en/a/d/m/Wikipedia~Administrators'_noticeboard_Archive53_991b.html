<p>Ok, I remember someone saying that there is some way for admins to tell if an article is on no watch lists. However, I've attempted to figure out how to do this, and have to say I've stumped. I've looked over the admin reading and can't find it there either. Is this a case of stupidity or delusion? If stupidity, I would appreciate being told how to do it. If delusion, then, well, feel free to make fun of me. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 04:47, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think a page that has recent changes on unwatched pages might be useful. There are so many unwatched articles that the list is not very helpful. Also, it has pages that are redirects and articles that have just been created and then listed on AfD. Finally, I cannot get past more than 1,000 pages on the list, so you can only see the articles that start with parentheses, quotes and numbers. Another tool that might be helpful is if there were a list of pages with frequent edits or a large number of edits that are unwatched. I do not know if that is feasible, though. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 05:52, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Archive53_991b.html" title="Edit section: RE: Johnny Lee Clary - Please help">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">RE: Johnny Lee Clary - Please help</span></h2>
<p>Hey there, my name is Nick, my username is Potters house and I have encountered a problem with trying to provide any information about Johnny Lee Clary. I have posted this post off to other staff members also. I am not sure if this is the best route to resolve this, but can think of no other way.</p>
<p>The article Johnny Lee Clary has been deleted. I have known Johnny through telephone conversations and email for a short time now (about 3-4 months). He recently came and shared his life story in for our church group for the first time just two weeks ago. Before I met Johnny I became interested in his story i.e. his conversion from the head of the KKK in the US, to being a Christian Minister who now teaches against race hate groups. I found the article <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Lee_Clary_510a.html" title="Johnny Lee Clary">Johnny Lee Clary</a> as it still is today, deleted, except for some small talk. If you read the talk you see what I have said at the time (notice I have gotten no reply, probable my fault as I don’t know heaps about WIKI policy). From my understanding Johnny Lee Clary was posting as The KingOfDixie and looks like he tried to change a few things on Wiki concerning the KKK. While this is a controversial subject, Johnny being the former leader of the KKK would probably know a thing or two and be able to contibute, but that’s another story. He eventually made an article about himself i.e. Johnny Lee Clary. Johnny being quite new to Wiki and ignorant of rules of conduct found himself at odds with some admins and had his site deleted.</p>
<p>Whilst observing Johnny over the last 3-4 months I have noticed that he is very outspoken against race hate groups such as the Neo Nazis, Skinheads, KKK etc. This, more often than not, lands Johnny in the hot seat. He has experienced persecution from racist groups for his departure from the KKK and voiced opinions against these racist organizations on his webpage, www.xkkk.org. Johnny has also received multiple death threats.</p>
<p>Because of his bold stance against these racist groups Johnny has become accustomed to hatred directed at him by those same groups. Johnny concluded that perhaps the guy who deleted the page <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Lee_Clary_510a.html" title="Johnny Lee Clary">Johnny Lee Clary</a> was a white supremist. I am hoping to clear this up. Before he told me this, I started to create J L Clary, after hearing nothing from posting in user talk on Johnny Lee Clary's article. I wasn't 10 minutes into the J L Clary article when it was issued a deletion notice, and then before I had time to reply (about 5 minutes) it was deleted! I was amazed. I told this to Johnny and he said the main reason he was told that he couldn't have an article was because he was not prominent enough.</p>
<p>Johnny has a very famous testimony and has been on multiple TV shows like Oprah, Donahue, Jerry Springer, etc, and even recently when he preached in our town he made front page news, a double spread on his life, and the local ABC interviewed him live, which is not bad for our town (LISMORE NSW Australia) See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Kerry&amp;dir=prev&amp;offset=20050327125109&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Kerry&amp;dir=prev&amp;offset=20050327125109&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Kerry&amp;dir=prev&amp;offset=20050327125109&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history</a> .</p>
<p>When <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Wilkerson_154c.html" title="David Wilkerson">David Wilkerson</a> came to our town hardly anyone knew or cared, yet <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Wilkerson_154c.html" title="David Wilkerson">David Wilkerson</a> is allowed an article (and rightfully so), but more people know of Johnny. As to whether he is famous or not, just Google search him and see all the TV interviews and radio interviews he does. He hangs with some of the most prominent Christian leaders in Australia. Besides this, just being the former KKK leader should be enough for an article (he doesn't even get a mention in the KKK one, and would be deleted). He was also a Pro Wrestler. So he is prominent in Christian circles, he is prominent amongst race hate groups, and he is also prominent in the WWE wrestling.</p>
<p>Johnny asked me to test the waters for him to see if he was being persecuted by someone from a race hate group. So I created some sites, John Clary <a href="../../../w/a/d/Wade_Watts_9977.html" title="Wade Watts">Wade Watts</a> and Operation Colorblind - the name of Johnny's Ministry. These have been fine until yesterday. I cannot understand why these sites are just issued a deletion notice? Just because they mention JLC? I was hoping to discuss these things but they are just deleted. The one on Wade Watts is about a black gospel preacher who was one of the leaders in the civil rights movement in the US and was good friends with Martin Luther King. He took Johnny Clary under his wing and even ordained Johnny as a minister (to this day Johnny is the only white man ordained in the All Black Baptist Church). But his article is up for deletion because I mentioned Clary and had a link.</p>
<p>That is why I am writing to you to see if you can help. It seems to me that the person(s) deleting all articles which even mention Johnny Lee Clary has an agenda. I thought that wikipedia admins had to keep a neutral stance on every article. It seems like this guy has a vendetta against JLC. Why delete the Wade Watts article. That is guilt by association and could be proof that all deletions are because of racial discrimination! I hope this is not the case and would think that it is politically motivated, as Johnny is a strong supporter of George Bush and Antaeus Feldspar of Kerry.</p>
<p>See:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Kerry&amp;dir=prev&amp;offset=20050327125109&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Kerry&amp;dir=prev&amp;offset=20050327125109&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Kerry&amp;dir=prev&amp;offset=20050327125109&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history</a> This shows how Antaeus Feldspar supports Kerry, which is fine, but Johnny is a strong supporter of Bush.</p>
<p>My hope is that Johnny will be able to have an article like any other famous person, minister, former KKK leader, or pro wrestler, and that Johnny and anyone connected with him and his ministry will in future have certain rules set in place that do not allow the wholesale deletion of the articles associated with him, but that they will be at least discussed.</p>
<p>I thank you for reading this long winded post. I have only been using WIKI for about a year myself so I need your help, I don't really know what else to do. I hope you can help. I personally think that Johnny's story is one that is beneficial to the cause of reconciliation between races and to the3 unity of society as a whole. It would be a shame if WIKI became known for having covert racists. Of course I hope that this is a misunderstanding and that all will be cleared up soon.</p>

<p>Also note his contributions: Featured articles: · African American literature -- My first featured article. Thanks to everyone who gave feedback. While I didn't start the article, I obsessed on it for an entire month and wrote most of the copy. · Ku Klux Klan -- I began work on this article after it became a featured article. Since then I've mediated several editorial disputes on the article (including one of which kept the article from being delisted as a FA) and made a large number of edit.</p>

<dd>Your accusations of racism are highly inappropriate, and you would do yourself and your "cause" a big favor by retracting the allegations. Only administrators can delete articles, and administrators get their positions because they have the full trust of the Wikipedia community. The admin who deleted the article is <a href="../../../t/a/w/User%7ETawker_141a.html" title="User:Tawker">User:Tawker</a>, with whom you may wish to discuss the matter, but in point of fact, the deletion was done because of a virtually unanimous consensus at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Johnny_Lee_Clary_b8b8.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Johnny Lee Clary">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Johnny Lee Clary</a>, which is the procedure we use to discuss whether or not the community feels an article should be kept. All of this discussion doesn't belong here, and any rate. The place to discuss undeletion of articles is at <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a>, but I reiterate that the previous deletion discussion was virtually unanimous. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 01:37, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It was not the content or even so much the intent of Mr. Clary's additions that drew attention and disapproval, it was his <b>behavior</b>. Because of him, I have <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Metzger_22af.html" title="Tom Metzger">Tom Metzger</a> on my watchlist. Having to defend the content of such an article is distasteful to me, but Mr. Clary's vandalism made that necessary. You need not, indeed you should not, look for any deeper reason for Wikipedians objecting to Mr. Clary than checking out his past actions on articles at Wikipedia. Again, not his outspokenness, but his underhandedness. Resorting to the old standby of demonizing those acting against you ignores that most important possibility - you just might be <i>wrong</i>. <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShenme_67cd.html" title="User:Shenme">Shenme</a> 03:50, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Arbitration Committee has passed the following new motion in the Everyking case.</p>
<ol>
<li>Everyking is banned for two weeks for recent offenses</li>
<li>Everyking's current prohibitions (his ban from editing the ANI, and from commenting on other admin's actions except for their talk pages, RFC, and RFA) - set to expire in November - are extended for one year, until November 2007.</li>
<li>Everyking is placed on standard probation for all pop music articles - any admin may ban him from any/all of them for any misbehavior on his part</li>
<li>Should EK harass other admins over their non-editorial actions, any admin may block him for up to two weeks per incident, escalating to one year per incident after the fifth one.</li>

<p>Everyking's message on Tony Sidaway's talk page says, in part, <i>I don't see how that can possibly be the case when the ArbCom hasn't even heard my side of the story yet...</i>, but I count, conservatively, 1200 words of "his side of the story" already posted on the Request for Arbitration page, and if he had anything ELSE to say, any "evidence to add", no one was standing in his way of doing so. It's this sort of thing that makes me wonder how he can possibly believe the things he claims, given how at odds they are with reality and all. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 12:57, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

In this most recent round, I gave him a clear, blunt warning that continued edit warring would result in an extended block. He continued, and I blocked him for a month. I realize this is a very long block, but this user has shown little to no willingness to cease disrupting the encyclopedia. I am hoping a break will convince him that our rules are not optional.</p>
<p>I waffled between giving him a shorter block, such as two weeks, and the monthlong block, but finally decided to try to drive the point home sharply once before taking this to Arbcom. I will not reverse any administrator who changes or shortens the block, but I do urge you to look carefully at this user's edit history before doing so. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 12:20, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Too bad. I, for one, am tired of JFAS's antics. IMO, he richly deserved the one-month block. It's amazing that in an exchange w/another admin he portrays himself as the victim of a conspiracy, somehow persecuted by my "supporters" -- when it is quite clear he's the one who stalked me around the website. What's even more amazing is that the admin bought it. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 14:51, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi. Actually, none of that played <i>any</i> part in my action. What I 'bought' was that he said he would stay away from the <a href="../../../k/w/a/Kwanzaa.html" title="Kwanzaa">Kwanzaa</a> article. Since the block was ostensibly made to protect that page his agreement not to edit it removed any concern in that regard and ended any 'preventative' basis for the block. That said, I probably would have unblocked anyway as the original claim of the block being for 'vandalism' was clearly false and even the revised claim of 'disruption' on that page seemed to me a considerable stretch... certainly slow motion edit warring is not sufficient 'disruption' to justify a block of an entire month. That said, I thank JFAS for agreeing to stay away from the page as it is clear that tempers have frayed and it is best to let the disagreement go. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 12:03, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Justforasecond contacted me via email and asked that his block be lifted, because it was interfering with all of the other employees at his place of work. He pledged in that email that, if he was unblocked, he would abide by the month's block and not edit during that time. I see that, now that he's unblocked, he's editing again and attacking the admin who blocked him. So much for good faith. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 15:41, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Without commenting on the merits of the block or unblock, I just wanted to say, for the umpteenth time: Criticism is not the same as an attack.

<dd>Zoe, I asked you to unblock me and you didn't do it. If you had unblocked me I would have gone on a break but, in spite of my truly desperate pleas, you didn't. Thankfully another admin did unblock me, but without those conditions. So no, this is not a violation of good faith, but maybe a lack of assuming it. I am perfectly within my rights here to question what I see as an overly long, illegitimate block and you are welcome to comment on why it was the correct length, called for. I'm not an admin here so I don't have as much experience in these matters, but the cases I have seen, unquestionably nasty users have not received blocks anywhere near that long. I also put a very clear "spoiler" notice on my page saying not to read the request for an advocate it if you were concerned about incivility, etc. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustforasecond_cc17.html" title="User:Justforasecond">Justforasecond</a> 21:45, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

He's also intent on stating in <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Walsh_%28sports_reporter%29_5645.html" title="David Walsh (sports reporter)">David Walsh (sports reporter)</a> that Armstrong lost an appeal to have the Sunday Times publish a rebuttal of the source of an article which the court found to be libellous because it implied that the sources were true. I don't see that appeal as having any relevance unless it would be usual for such a remedy to be granted by the courts; I know of no instance where it has even been asked for but I guess it must be - I know that an apology in the paper is usually as much as you get, as a long-time follower of Private Eye. As stated, it makes it sound as if Armstrong lost the case (and Socafan apparently believes that the case substantially vindicates Walsh, despite his losing the libel suit, see <a href="../../../d/a/v/Talk%7EDavid_Walsh_%28sports_reporter%29_ea91.html" title="Talk:David Walsh (sports reporter)">Talk:David Walsh (sports reporter)</a>).</p>
<p>I am now involved in this, having originally come to it purely as a <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> problem, and I might just be taking against Socafan because he is so relentless in pushing his personal views, including guilt-by-association and other innuendo in the article. Socafan clearly believes that there is only one neutral version: his. I don't think it is neutral, and Armstrong has already successfully sued the Sunday Times for implying that Armstrong is guilty, which worries me quite a bit. SOme extra eyes would be appreciated. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 15:48, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK, we now have me, Tom Harrison and Phil Sandifer all trying to keep the article neutral, and Socafan continually reverting with summaries suggesting we need to achieve consensus on Talk before moving away from Socafan's preferred version.

<dd>It takes two to tango. Reviewing the history of affected articles I think both IP user(s) and Ghirla (and in some instances as on Soviet partisans other reqistered users) are equally guilty of contributing to the revert war. Therefore the articles should not be semi-protected but rather normally protected; semi-protection was designed to prevent vandalism, not exclude one party (unregistered editors) from revert war while allowing the others (registered) free reign (unless I missed some anon edits that indeed classify as vandalism?). That said, semi-protecting 3 or 4 articles is hardly a spree and I would caution anon to be careful with <a href="../../../p/a/_/WP%7EPA_04e2.html" title="WP:PA">WP:PA</a> and assuming bad-faith in actions of an experienced admin like Alex. I would encourage interested anon(s) to simply create an account. Anonimous users who display advanced knowledge of Wikipedia policies are bound to create some suspicion, which whether justified or not is not creating a friendly enviroment. Finally I would like to add that Wikipedia admins have a long history of catching users trying to circumvene their block and extending their block as additional penalty. While I don't think we have evidence that this is indeed <a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">User:Molobo</a> doing (and his contrib pattern is strange, to my knowledge Molobo was not interested in purely Russian articles, only those relevant to Polish-Russian history), I thought I would stress that just in case.--<sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus"><font style="color:#006400;background:#7CFC00;">&#160;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&#160;</font></a><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span></sub> 14:40, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>I just have an open, informal complaint over the apparent use of the rollback feature. Accoridng to <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators_37b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators">Wikipedia:Administrators</a>, it should only be used in cases of simple vandalism and nothing else. But...however...I've recently begun noticing a misuse of the rollback feature, where the case is <i>not</i> simple vandalism, and which the result leads to more confusion and wasted time.</p>
<ul>
<li>On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_29.html" title="May 29">May 29</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, an anon added four userboxes to <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a>. Three administrators deleted them three different times, each one using the sterile "reverted by...to this version..." Now, two of those admins had deleted the four userboxes in question, so I was actually tempted to revert as there was no clear reason why they were removed. I asked on <a href="../../../t/1/_/Wikipedia_talk%7ET1_and_T2_debates_065d.html#Just_a_quick_question_about_the_whole_userbox_deletion_thing" title="Wikipedia talk:T1 and T2 debates">T1 and T2 debates</a> and I got the answer, but why didn't they just mention it in the edit summary, so it would be absolutely clear?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I added something that I thought was funny to <a href="../../../b/j/a/WP%7EBJAODN_1a71.html" title="WP:BJAODN">WP:BJAODN</a>. It was reverted by an admin, once again with the sterile rollback summary. When <a href="../../../a/h/o/User_talk%7EAhoerstemeier_2da1.html#I_beleive_that_I_at_least_deserve_an_explanation" title="User talk:Ahoerstemeier">I asked him on his user page</a>, I was told that doing manual rollback took more time and that, because most people didn't ever question his deletions, that it was a waste of time. Right. It takes like, 15 seconds to write a summary? I think we both wasted more time using the talk page to explain exactly why the edit was removed than if the admin had just taken a few seconds to explain why he didn't think it was funny.</li>

From Xeno-Lord's (and mine, I suppose) point, the template was suddenly and unfairly halved wholesale. Now that I look into it a bit deeper, I see that <i>somebody else</i> deleted it and there was relevent discussion on the CVG talk page, but there was nothing in that talk discussion to indicate that the characters had been dispersed - just deleted. Had AMIB simply pointed to the direct CVG debate in the edit summary, or started a talk page discussion pertaining to why the template was so radically changed, the 3RR would have stopped, or at least AMIB would have been more justified in his use of the rollback tool.</li>

<dd>Only use the default edit summary on vandalism. Anything more and you just need to write a few words saying why.

<dd>I think it would be best if there were an intermediate step which asked for an edit summary, with a default.

<dd>I'm not in favor of an intermediate step. If I'm trying to wipe out a prolific vandal's edits, I already am going to have 30 tabs open with rollbacks in them. We just need to make sure that admins use the tool in the right situations...or leave a note on the rollbackee's page.

<dd>Hmmm.

<dd>The thing is, the rollback summary is just like a blank summmary - it has no information. The rollback signifies that something was so bad or messed up (like vandalism) that the admin can simply hit a button to roll back. By looking at the diff it should be self-explanatory why the rollback was used. The situations I listed were not as simple to deduce. Hbdragon88 04:49, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I like the rollback summary comment. I used to manually type it before I had a rollback button and I still do if I'm reverting further than the rollback button can. If someone took away the button away I would just go back to manually typing it all the time. It's not inflammatory and it's informative: it tells everyone exactly how far back a reversion goes. The same can't always be said for a custom comment. -- <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek_Ross_f2d2.html" title="User:Derek Ross">Derek Ross</a> | <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerek_Ross_6827.html" title="User talk:Derek Ross">Talk</a> 05:07, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First, Balcer is not an admin (I have no idea how he was able to actually move the page, there should have been a redirect there...). Second, the previous 'multi-poll with secondary votes' was not a proper WP:RM, it has more holes then the Swiss cheese and should never be used as a basis for the move (which has been criticized by many users already); there was clearly no consensus for it. The other votes on the page are getting more and more laugable, with semi-serious discussions now about 'which method of voting will we use to determine the method of voting for the move'. Proper WP:RM is the only solution to deal with this problem. PS. Ghirla's yet another violation of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">WP:CIV</a>/<a href="../../../p/a/_/WP%7EPA_04e2.html" title="WP:PA">WP:PA</a> and accusations of me and others forcing some votes and engaging in 'morbid polonization' is highly offensive and I hope neutral admins will warn him about his behaviour.

<dd>Well, what about that case? That move has evidently proven uncontroversial, so in assuming good faith etc. nobody questions it. The W2J-&gt;Jogaila move, on the contrary, has alrady generated dozens of posts and many users are questioning it, on basis ranging from 'proper procedures (RM) were not followed' to 'that move was done with 1:2 support'. It was that last move that should have been reported here; the only thing to cricitize is that it was moved by a user involved in a dispute, not by a neutral party - but even so I don't see how that move violates any policies. Again, the last move, which was not following WP:RM, does appear to have violated WP:RM and should have been reverted for it (IMHO).--<sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus"><font style="color:#006400;background:#7CFC00;">&#160;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&#160;</font></a><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span></sub> 17:25, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

There had been extensive discussions and polls at <a href="../../../w/%C5%82/a/Talk%7EW%C5%82adys%C5%82aw_II_Jagie%C5%82%C5%82o_f1c8.html" title="Talk:Władysław II Jagiełło">Talk:Władysław II Jagiełło</a>. An admin who was completely and admirably neutral in the matter came along, reviewed everything, thought about it, and closed the poll with their best good faith determination at what should be done, which was to move the article to <a href="../../../j/o/g/Jogaila.html" title="Jogaila">Jogaila</a>. Yes, it was controversial, but I think that we should now respect the closing admin's decision, leave the article at Jogaila, and start the debate anew. It was not appropriate for Balcer to simply drag the article back to <a href="../../../w/%C5%82/a/W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw_II_Jagie%C5%82%C5%82o_0ac3.html" title="Władysław II Jagiełło">Władysław II Jagiełło</a>, especially because he was not neutral (he immediately started a new poll, and voted for Władysław II Jagiełło). Me personally, I don't like the name Jogaila either, but we should <i>respect the decision of the closing admin</i>. If they made a bad call, then it can be addressed, but by all indications I've seen, they made an appropriate decision based on the state of the discussion at the time.</dd>

<dd>First, let's all keep in mind that I am not an admin, so somewhat different standards apply to me than would to an admin in this case. Obviously, I did not use any admin powers to move the article back (since I have none). Given that, I do not believe my action violated any policy or guideline. In particular, I do not believe that a simple user involved in a dispute is forbidden to move the article involved. Now if I had simply moved the article back without doing anything else, that would indeed have been ill advised. This is why my move was followed immediately by a RM request, in which everyone involved will be able to express their opinion, by a clear answer to a clear question. As the talk page indicated, there was no concensus support for <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">User:Kjkolb</a>'s closing of the discussion. I appreciate his attempt to assist in the resolution of the dispute, but in this case it clearly was not satisfactory for many users. This seemed to be reflected in the quick, informal poll started to see what further action should be taken.</dd>

<dd>I am perfectly ready to accept sanctions for any policies I have violated by my actions. My only interest was to resolve what clearly is a significant controversy through a clear, unambigous RM procedure, in which all interested editors would have a chance to vote on a clear question. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 19:42, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm going to revert <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">User:Balcer</a>'s move, but only because such actions have been determined to <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_AndriyK_ce16.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/AndriyK">be disruptive</a> by the arbitration commitee.

<dd>While not doubitng the good faith of Kjkolb, he was not acting as a closing admin, since it was not a proper RM to start with. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw_II_Jagie%C5%82%C5%82o&amp;oldid=65908192" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw_II_Jagie%C5%82%C5%82o&amp;oldid=65908192" rel="nofollow">This</a> is the version of the page before he moved it. I don't see any RM template at the top indicating this is an RM vote. Therefore while Kjkolb acted as a good-faithed neutral editor, he was not a closing admin, just as the vote was not a proper RM vote. Thus, unlike RM vote, when it became clear his move is controversial, it could have and has been reverted without any violation of our policies. Again, let me repeat: the only way to solve this as soon as possible with as little bad blood as possible is to hold a proper RM which will clearly indicate whether there is consensus for a move to Jogaila, and whose decision should not be questioned in the near future.--<sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">&#160;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&#160;</a>|<a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span></sub> 19:51, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OK, he's technically not a vandal yet, but I have reasons to believe that he's one of many Dzoni's sockpuppets. He approached me on my talk page today <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADungodung&amp;diff=66237222&amp;oldid=51012720" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADungodung&amp;diff=66237222&amp;oldid=51012720" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> asking me where Serbian Wikimedia meetups are being held. Needless to say, Dzoni was always asking me such things at sr: wiki (where he's blocked indef. along with a dozen or so sockpuppet accounts) all the time and he was doing it in the same manner (calling me "Dungo" at the very first contact he makes with me, signing without "--"). Also, if we look at his contribs, he's using his famous capital letters, and by skimming his talk page, it seems as he's already gotten into some sh*t by being rude and violating policies. After skimming his talk page again, he's certainly been connected to Dzoni by others. Checkuser would be in order to confirm my claims, seeing as I am certain this is indeed Dzoni.

<p>I am reporting <a href="../../../s/y/n/User%7ESynergeticMaggot_5ec3.html" title="User:SynergeticMaggot">User:SynergeticMaggot</a>, <a href="../../../9/9/9/User%7E999.html" title="User:999">User:999</a>, and <a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHanuman_Das_3020.html" title="User:Hanuman Das">User:Hanuman Das</a> for their use of <a href="../../../b/l/i/Blitzkrieg.html" title="Blitzkrieg">blitzkrieg</a> tactics to push their viewpoints on the following articles: <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thoth.html" title="Thoth">Thoth</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermeticism.html" title="Hermeticism">Hermeticism</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermetism.html" title="Hermetism">Hermetism</a>, <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult_of_Hermes_b04e.html" title="Cult of Hermes">Cult of Hermes</a>, Mental Gender, and Hermeticism and other thought systems.</p>
<p>The onslaught started about 24 hours ago when I tried to remove "references" that are not actually cited in the <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thoth.html" title="Thoth">Thoth</a> article. After some conflicts with 999, and discussion, I opted to move them into an Additional Reading section which he reverted back to the original version, unwilling to work on it. After we used our 3 reverts, he immediately put a prod on <i>Hermeticism and other thought systems</i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermeticism_and_other_thought_systems&amp;diff=65993183&amp;oldid=65992312" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermeticism_and_other_thought_systems&amp;diff=65993183&amp;oldid=65992312" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> and an AfD out on <i>Mental Gender</i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Mental_Gender" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Mental_Gender" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>, seemingly in retalliation. SynergeticMaggot, whom I know in RL, and who ironically claims membership in the Welcoming Committee, Association of Members' Advocates, and Concordia, seconded the prod. When it was deleted by uninterested eyes<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermeticism_and_other_thought_systems&amp;diff=66014358&amp;oldid=66000413" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermeticism_and_other_thought_systems&amp;diff=66014358&amp;oldid=66000413" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>, he readded it none the less<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermeticism_and_other_thought_systems&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=66014358" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermeticism_and_other_thought_systems&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=66014358" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>. 999 put the <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult_of_Hermes_b04e.html" title="Cult of Hermes">Cult of Hermes</a> redirect to redirect towards <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermes.html" title="Hermes">Hermes</a> instead of <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermetism.html" title="Hermetism">Hermetism</a>,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cult_of_Hermes&amp;diff=65991686&amp;oldid=65867943" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cult_of_Hermes&amp;diff=65991686&amp;oldid=65867943" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> Then when I didn't agree and pointed out in edit summaries that Cult of Hermes refers to Hermetism, he put it up for deletion<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARedirects_for_deletion&amp;diff=66033577&amp;oldid=66007379" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARedirects_for_deletion&amp;diff=66033577&amp;oldid=66007379" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>. We continued to argue to the point that he and Hanuman decided to make it a disambiguation then pick their own description of Hermetism, unsourced, instead of the cited versions I have pointed out. In reality the disambiguation disambiguates between the same thing...</p>
<p>As if I didn't have enough to try to get fixed yet, Hanuman went to cause problems with Hermetism, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermetism&amp;diff=66157142&amp;oldid=66047540" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermetism&amp;diff=66157142&amp;oldid=66047540" rel="nofollow">[22]</a> by citing it with a fiction tag and there is a debate going on about whether Manly P. Hall is a reputable source. SynergeticMaggot then attempted to raise questions on Hermeticism.</p>
<p>In all of these articles, I would be the primary contributor and these were selected by browsing my contributions. It is to be expected that I would be the one having to defend or work to improve these articles to keep them up or keep content in. I sent each of them a message<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SynergeticMaggot&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66185382" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SynergeticMaggot&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66185382" rel="nofollow">[23]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:999&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66185521" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:999&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66185521" rel="nofollow">[24]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Hanuman_Das&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66185802" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Hanuman_Das&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66185802" rel="nofollow">[25]</a> which stated:</p>
<dl>
<dd>There are currently challenges made by the same three people, all of whom will recieve this message, on <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thoth.html" title="Thoth">Thoth</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermeticism.html" title="Hermeticism">Hermeticism</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermetism.html" title="Hermetism">Hermetism</a>, <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult_of_Hermes_b04e.html" title="Cult of Hermes">Cult of Hermes</a>, Mental Gender, and Hermeticism and other thought systems all at the same time. Some people actually work for a living and have a life outside of Wikipedia. If you want to make challenges, you are free to do so. But when you know that they are all against the same person, have a little bit of courtesy and challenge them one or two at a time, and allow appropriate time for someone to actually do something about it. I am not a superhuman, and <a href="../../../b/l/i/Blitzkrieg.html" title="Blitzkrieg">blitzkrieging</a> me with all these challenges at once is unrealistic and shady. Try to have some patience and actually make it possible for me to work with you rather than trying to send me on the defensive and effectively make me leave Wikipedia. If this continues, I will have to make this an issue through RfC, Administrator's noticeboard, or Arbitration Committee. Try to use your time actually find sources to contradict mine if you feel that you have too much free time to wait around for me to be able to act on any given article.</dd>
</dl>
<p>in attempt to make them realize that I cannot defend in 6 places at once, and since these are the same contributors, they should be patient and wait for me to be able to handle each of these situations. I had replies accusing me of WP:OWN because I would assume that articles chosen by seeing where I had made major contributions would have to be defended by me<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKing_Vegita&amp;diff=66186218&amp;oldid=66175369" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKing_Vegita&amp;diff=66186218&amp;oldid=66175369" rel="nofollow">[26]</a> and asking me to not contribute to Wikipedia if I cannot dedicate all my time (though I work 40 hours with 12-15 hours commuting time a week) to defend 6 controversies within 24 hours.</p>
<p>I am not asking for bans to be put into effect, but for articles to be locked and protected until I have the opportunity to work with each one. The blitzkrieg tactics employed here only serve to make me incapable of having a fair shot at working on these articles.</p>

<dd>Yeah I made the mistake of readding the prod tag, and user 999 removed it telling me to look into <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">WP:PROD</a> more closely. I realized I was wrong, so I then said the next part of the process was to take it to AfD. All of the users edit related articles, and I wont speak anymore about them after saying that there is a consensus among us that think that what KV is reverting on three pages makes the articles look better. KV is a good contributor, although he does not understand that alot of the material he was putting in was POV and OR. We also fixed the article per Manual of Style. He feels the need to defend the article and is clearly showing that he wishes to OWN the articles. I will abide by whatever the admins choose here, as I am also being accused of uncivil edit summaries below, based on me using Vandal Proof to revert his edits, and me adding test-3 and test-4 to his talk page. Thanks. <a href="../../../s/y/n/User%7ESynergeticMaggot_5ec3.html" title="User:SynergeticMaggot">SynergeticMaggot</a> 01:47, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My intention is not to claim that I own the articles, but that I have a right to defend them. This action was taken out specifically on articles that they <i>knew</i> that I would be defending, as they have looked for them by checking my contributions. If there is POV or OR in them, that can be worked on, but it should be done one article at a time, so that I have a chance to actually work with them. Not only do they have numbers and time (I can verify that SynergeticMaggot can edit Wikipedia all day, without problem, and I suspect the same of 999), but I am the one that must find sources, despite the fact that I already have sources, and the statements they support are not cited. Due to them making me inable to actually work with them in improving the articles, I have had to resort to reverting, in part to bring attention to this matter. Essentially, this is the use of a comparative mob to push POV with a stated unwillingness to work with me, but rather say that these three that work together represent a clear consensus against my version and for their version. I will add more information on my attempts to work with them and others on the articles on a break.</dd>

<dd>This is ridiculous. KV is adding personal information to this noticeboard about me for no reason other than to explain why he cannot fix minor errors in his and other editors wording. If POV's and OR were not added to these article in the first place, there would have been no problem at all. No one is pushing POV, but there are alot of mistakes this editor makes on numerous articles, someone has to fix it. Also, two of the articles are on AfD now, and have been gaining a consensus to delete. This shows that we are not the only ones feel that he articles were OR.

<p>I have been in an edit war in the past with this user, and recently he has repetitavely placed <a href="../../../s/o/c/Template%7ESockpuppeteer_43b0.html" title="Template:Sockpuppeteer">Template:Sockpuppeteer</a> at the head of my userpage.

I'm not completely certain, but I believe that this is inappropriate use of that template. From what I've seen, the template is applied to currently blocked users who are using sockpuppets as means of evading the block, and regardless, his reasons for placing the template on my page are not constructive.

I also checked his userpage, and saw that he had copied content from my own userpage as well as an <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antifeminism.html" title="Antifeminism">antifeminism</a> template that I created and placed it there, most likely with the intent of causing trouble in some way or another.

<dd>Blah blah blah. The difference being Rennix wasn't proven to be a sockpuppet of mine (because he wasn't, but there's no point arguing that now he's banned).

<p>I have removed the template. As long as Conrad is allowed to edit and not actively using abusive sockpuppets, he should be able to remove it if he wishes. Skinmeister has violated 3RR on that page, though as I believe he broke it under the impression that he was reverting vandalism, I don't believe a block is necessary unless he continues to war over the template. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 11:22, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I made the reasons why I was taking down the template very clear to Skinmeister on this page. I don't believe for a minute that he thought he was reverting vandalism. -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamir_%28The_Scope%29_202a.html" title="User:Samir (The Scope)"><b>Samir</b></a> <small><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamir_%28The_Scope%29_5ee9.html" title="User talk:Samir (The Scope)"><font color="black">धर्म</font></a></small> 19:24, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>As an outside observer to this situation (I stumbled onto it last night while reverting User page vandalisms), I agree with Samuel Blanning's views stated above. There is no need to have this template on that user page at this time. It would be best to see Skinmeister and Conrad Devonshire exhibit some self-control and move on in seperate directions, seeing as how the aggression and consternation that both have exhibited with this situation seems to be entirely self-made at this point. If they went on their ways within Wikipedia, I'm sure they'd appreciate their time on the site more. Hope that helps. <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 16:57, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I never called an edit of his vandalism. As most admins know, I use Vandal Proof to revert edits. KV is throwing a fit and reverting edits that 3-5 users agree are consistant with Wikipedia policy, on at least 3 pages (<a href="../../../t/h/o/Thoth.html" title="Thoth">Thoth</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermeticism.html" title="Hermeticism">Hermeticism</a>, and <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermetism.html" title="Hermetism">Hermetism</a>). He has exhausted his reverts and now he wishes to complain about it. He's made it clear <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermetism&amp;diff=66264081&amp;oldid=66179317" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermetism&amp;diff=66264081&amp;oldid=66179317" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermeticism&amp;diff=66267343&amp;oldid=66266197" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermeticism&amp;diff=66267343&amp;oldid=66266197" rel="nofollow">here</a> in his edit summary that he wants to just cause an edit war. We have tried to discuss this matter on the talk pages, it is he that is not working well with other editors. He also brings up his talk page where I placed test3 and test4 templates. He had already reverted so many times that I didnt bother to put tests 1 and 2 first. KV saved me the time, because I'm asking for a block on his account for however long an admin sees fit for reverting twice on the Thoth article, 3 times on the Hermeticism article, and I believe 2-3 times on the Hermetism article. <a href="../../../s/y/n/User%7ESynergeticMaggot_5ec3.html" title="User:SynergeticMaggot">SynergeticMaggot</a> 01:36, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As for my intentions, the edits on Thoth are not against Wikipedia policy. I am attempting to take references where it cannot be verified that they are used within the article out of the references section. When 999 said that they don't have to be used in the article I worked with him and created an Additional reading section. The trio has worked to make sure that didn't stay. In the other two articles mentioned, large sections are being removed without discussion. I have attempted to work with them, pleading with them to give me the chance to improve the articles by working with them and discussing with them, working on them one at a time so that I can focus my attentions and create good article status. They have a stance that published facts put forth by an acclaimed author and published by a reputable publisher are not "reputable sources" and are attempting to remove that in favor of keeping in statements that are completely unverified, but match their <i>point of view</i> on the matter. They have decided to attack me on 6 fronts, nominating articles for deletion that can be improved, are verified, and in the case of <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermetism.html" title="Hermetism">Hermetism</a> existed before I joined Wikipedia. Their actions are that of attempting to wear me too thin to be able to work with them, especially in good faith, in order to push their POV. <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> requires that all viewpoints put forth by renowned proponents be present. Instead of working with me to rephrase things to be less POV and adding sources that disagree with me, they decided to take the <i>easy</i> road and delete my contributions, figuring that they would rather have nothing to the expression of a POV, though well documented by many sources, that they disagree with. Essentially, SynergeticMaggot, 999, and Hanzuman work as meatpuppets, moving from article to article to enforce their POVs. SynergeticMaggot follows my contributions regularly, and 999 follows SynergeticMaggot, and Hanzuman follows 999.</p>
<p>SynergeticMaggot, I know in real life, I convinced him to join Wikipedia originally to help me on these articles, something I am now regretting, and I have applauded him for learning Wikipedia policies and procedures, always freshening up on them. However, I am seeing now that he is doing so and using this knowledge to selectively apply policy and abuse it and procedure to work against the spirit of Wikipedia. He is trying, with the others, to wear me down, get me to overreact, and get banned so they can push their POV while there are few interested eyes in these articles. A vast majority of those dealing with these articles are interested in learning only.</p>
<p>On the subject of 3RR, I am allowed 3 reverts for each article, and I have not gone over that in any of them. Each revert is in restoring a version that I feel is better, is verifiable, and should be discussed to improve, especially since it is long-standing text. Yet, he calls it vandalism, indirectly by the VandalPro edit messages, then calling me a vandal on my talk page. I feel that his actions are effectively vandalism, but in good faith, I have restrained myself from calling it vandalism up to the point of mentioning it here for comparison.</p>

<dd>I fail to see how I am abusing an policies. If there is an admin who sees this they can kindly let me know on my talk page, as I am no longer watching this notice. Also note that I am being accused in two places, the other is in the section above called "Blitzkrieg Tactics to push POV". KV has not gone over the 3RR, yet he has demonstrated his ability to revert first, and complain on AN later. Multiple reverts, as I was told before is enough to block for a given time, which is all I was asking for. And again, no one I know of has yet to call him a vandal, these were automated reverts, and test templates given out to warn KV.

<p>There are two AfD requests I would like blocked as per the aforementioned rules. Each of them state the following text: "Jointly, these policies determine the type and quality of material that is acceptable in the main namespace. They should not be interpreted in isolation from one another, and editors should therefore try to familiarize themselves with all three. These three policies are non-negotiable and cannot be superseded by any other guidelines, or by editors' consensus."</p>
<p>I will discuss both of the AfDs separately as they apply to these policies, but these AfDs are specifically overridden by these policies, and I will show how the deletion of these articles violate these core policies and thus they "cannot be superseded by ... editors' consensus" and must be stopped as per Wikipedia core policy.</p>
<p>This is my third notice on this board in the past 48 hours, probably the last 24, which I cannot remember starting a discussion on before. I certainly usually do not use it. But all the claims are interrelated to the same conflict, originally covered in <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html#Blitzkrieg_Tactics_to_push_POV" title="WP:AN">WP:AN#Blitzkrieg_Tactics_to_push_POV</a> and again in <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html#WP:CIVIL_violation_by_User:SynergeticMaggot" title="WP:AN">WP:AN#WP:CIVIL_violation_by_User:SynergeticMaggot</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unless the AfDs are clearly bad-faith and the AfD participants agree that they should be speedy-closed, these AfDs should stay the course. Also, please keep your requests short, per the text at the beginning of this page which states, in bold: "<b>Please make your comments concise. Administrators are less likely to pay attention to long diatribes.</b>". Comments this long make my eyes bleed. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 18:03, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I am reporting <a href="../../../s/y/n/User%7ESynergeticMaggot_5ec3.html" title="User:SynergeticMaggot">User:SynergeticMaggot</a>, <a href="../../../9/9/9/User%7E999.html" title="User:999">User:999</a>, and <a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHanuman_Das_3020.html" title="User:Hanuman Das">User:Hanuman Das</a> for their use of <a href="../../../b/l/i/Blitzkrieg.html" title="Blitzkrieg">blitzkrieg</a> tactics to push their viewpoints on the following articles: <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thoth.html" title="Thoth">Thoth</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermeticism.html" title="Hermeticism">Hermeticism</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermetism.html" title="Hermetism">Hermetism</a>, <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult_of_Hermes_b04e.html" title="Cult of Hermes">Cult of Hermes</a>, Mental Gender, and Hermeticism and other thought systems.</p>
<p>The onslaught started about 24 hours ago when I tried to remove "references" that are not actually cited in the <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thoth.html" title="Thoth">Thoth</a> article. After some conflicts with 999, and discussion, I opted to move them into an Additional Reading section which he reverted back to the original version, unwilling to work on it. After we used our 3 reverts, he immediately put a prod on <i>Hermeticism and other thought systems</i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermeticism_and_other_thought_systems&amp;diff=65993183&amp;oldid=65992312" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermeticism_and_other_thought_systems&amp;diff=65993183&amp;oldid=65992312" rel="nofollow">[33]</a> and an AfD out on <i>Mental Gender</i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Mental_Gender" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Mental_Gender" rel="nofollow">[34]</a>, seemingly in retalliation. SynergeticMaggot, whom I know in RL, and who ironically claims membership in the Welcoming Committee, Association of Members' Advocates, and Concordia, seconded the prod. When it was deleted by uninterested eyes<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermeticism_and_other_thought_systems&amp;diff=66014358&amp;oldid=66000413" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermeticism_and_other_thought_systems&amp;diff=66014358&amp;oldid=66000413" rel="nofollow">[35]</a>, he readded it none the less<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermeticism_and_other_thought_systems&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=66014358" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermeticism_and_other_thought_systems&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=66014358" rel="nofollow">[36]</a>. 999 put the <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult_of_Hermes_b04e.html" title="Cult of Hermes">Cult of Hermes</a> redirect to redirect towards <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermes.html" title="Hermes">Hermes</a> instead of <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermetism.html" title="Hermetism">Hermetism</a>,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cult_of_Hermes&amp;diff=65991686&amp;oldid=65867943" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cult_of_Hermes&amp;diff=65991686&amp;oldid=65867943" rel="nofollow">[37]</a> Then when I didn't agree and pointed out in edit summaries that Cult of Hermes refers to Hermetism, he put it up for deletion<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARedirects_for_deletion&amp;diff=66033577&amp;oldid=66007379" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARedirects_for_deletion&amp;diff=66033577&amp;oldid=66007379" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>. We continued to argue to the point that he and Hanuman decided to make it a disambiguation then pick their own description of Hermetism, unsourced, instead of the cited versions I have pointed out. In reality the disambiguation disambiguates between the same thing...</p>
<p>As if I didn't have enough to try to get fixed yet, Hanuman went to cause problems with Hermetism, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermetism&amp;diff=66157142&amp;oldid=66047540" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermetism&amp;diff=66157142&amp;oldid=66047540" rel="nofollow">[39]</a> by citing it with a fiction tag and there is a debate going on about whether Manly P. Hall is a reputable source. SynergeticMaggot then attempted to raise questions on Hermeticism.</p>
<p>In all of these articles, I would be the primary contributor and these were selected by browsing my contributions. It is to be expected that I would be the one having to defend or work to improve these articles to keep them up or keep content in. I sent each of them a message<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SynergeticMaggot&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66185382" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SynergeticMaggot&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66185382" rel="nofollow">[40]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:999&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66185521" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:999&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66185521" rel="nofollow">[41]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Hanuman_Das&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66185802" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Hanuman_Das&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66185802" rel="nofollow">[42]</a> which stated:</p>

<dd>There are currently challenges made by the same three people, all of whom will recieve this message, on <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thoth.html" title="Thoth">Thoth</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermeticism.html" title="Hermeticism">Hermeticism</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermetism.html" title="Hermetism">Hermetism</a>, <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult_of_Hermes_b04e.html" title="Cult of Hermes">Cult of Hermes</a>, Mental Gender, and Hermeticism and other thought systems all at the same time. Some people actually work for a living and have a life outside of Wikipedia. If you want to make challenges, you are free to do so. But when you know that they are all against the same person, have a little bit of courtesy and challenge them one or two at a time, and allow appropriate time for someone to actually do something about it. I am not a superhuman, and <a href="../../../b/l/i/Blitzkrieg.html" title="Blitzkrieg">blitzkrieging</a> me with all these challenges at once is unrealistic and shady. Try to have some patience and actually make it possible for me to work with you rather than trying to send me on the defensive and effectively make me leave Wikipedia. If this continues, I will have to make this an issue through RfC, Administrator's noticeboard, or Arbitration Committee. Try to use your time actually find sources to contradict mine if you feel that you have too much free time to wait around for me to be able to act on any given article.</dd>
</dl>
<p>in attempt to make them realize that I cannot defend in 6 places at once, and since these are the same contributors, they should be patient and wait for me to be able to handle each of these situations. I had replies accusing me of WP:OWN because I would assume that articles chosen by seeing where I had made major contributions would have to be defended by me<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKing_Vegita&amp;diff=66186218&amp;oldid=66175369" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKing_Vegita&amp;diff=66186218&amp;oldid=66175369" rel="nofollow">[43]</a> and asking me to not contribute to Wikipedia if I cannot dedicate all my time (though I work 40 hours with 12-15 hours commuting time a week) to defend 6 controversies within 24 hours.</p>
<p>I am not asking for bans to be put into effect, but for articles to be locked and protected until I have the opportunity to work with each one. The blitzkrieg tactics employed here only serve to make me incapable of having a fair shot at working on these articles.</p>

<dd>Yeah I made the mistake of readding the prod tag, and user 999 removed it telling me to look into <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">WP:PROD</a> more closely. I realized I was wrong, so I then said the next part of the process was to take it to AfD. All of the users edit related articles, and I wont speak anymore about them after saying that there is a consensus among us that think that what KV is reverting on three pages makes the articles look better. KV is a good contributor, although he does not understand that alot of the material he was putting in was POV and OR. We also fixed the article per Manual of Style. He feels the need to defend the article and is clearly showing that he wishes to OWN the articles. I will abide by whatever the admins choose here, as I am also being accused of uncivil edit summaries below, based on me using Vandal Proof to revert his edits, and me adding test-3 and test-4 to his talk page. Thanks. <a href="../../../s/y/n/User%7ESynergeticMaggot_5ec3.html" title="User:SynergeticMaggot">SynergeticMaggot</a> 01:47, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>My intention is not to claim that I own the articles, but that I have a right to defend them. This action was taken out specifically on articles that they <i>knew</i> that I would be defending, as they have looked for them by checking my contributions. If there is POV or OR in them, that can be worked on, but it should be done one article at a time, so that I have a chance to actually work with them. Not only do they have numbers and time (I can verify that SynergeticMaggot can edit Wikipedia all day, without problem, and I suspect the same of 999), but I am the one that must find sources, despite the fact that I already have sources, and the statements they support are not cited. Due to them making me inable to actually work with them in improving the articles, I have had to resort to reverting, in part to bring attention to this matter. Essentially, this is the use of a comparative mob to push POV with a stated unwillingness to work with me, but rather say that these three that work together represent a clear consensus against my version and for their version. I will add more information on my attempts to work with them and others on the articles on a break.</dd>

<dd>This is ridiculous. KV is adding personal information to this noticeboard about me for no reason other than to explain why he cannot fix minor errors in his and other editors wording. If POV's and OR were not added to these article in the first place, there would have been no problem at all. No one is pushing POV, but there are alot of mistakes this editor makes on numerous articles, someone has to fix it. Also, two of the articles are on AfD now, and have been gaining a consensus to delete. This shows that we are not the only ones feel that he articles were OR.

<p>I have been in an edit war in the past with this user, and recently he has repetitavely placed <a href="../../../s/o/c/Template%7ESockpuppeteer_43b0.html" title="Template:Sockpuppeteer">Template:Sockpuppeteer</a> at the head of my userpage. This is a reference to a recent incident in which I was blocked for a week for creating sockpuppets with inappropriate names and reporting them myself for username policy violation. I'm not completely certain, but I believe that this is inappropriate use of that template. From what I've seen, the template is applied to currently blocked users who are using sockpuppets as means of evading the block, and regardless, his reasons for placing the template on my page are not constructive. Though slighty off topic, I would like to note that this user has been confirmed to have used at least one sockpuppet, <a href="../../../r/e/n/User%7ERennix_28ac.html" title="User:Rennix"><tt class="userlinks" style="1.3em">Rennix</tt></a> (<span class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../r/e/n/User_talk%7ERennix_741a.html" title="User talk:Rennix">talk</a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Rennix_a86e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Rennix">contribs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">logs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../b/l/o/Special%7EBlockip_Rennix_f94b.html" title="Special:Blockip/Rennix">block user</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">block log</a></span>), himself. I also checked his userpage, and saw that he had copied content from my own userpage as well as an <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antifeminism.html" title="Antifeminism">antifeminism</a> template that I created and placed it there, most likely with the intent of causing trouble in some way or another.

<dd>Blah blah blah. The difference being Rennix wasn't proven to be a sockpuppet of mine (because he wasn't, but there's no point arguing that now he's banned).

<p>I have removed the template. As long as Conrad is allowed to edit and not actively using abusive sockpuppets, he should be able to remove it if he wishes. Skinmeister has violated 3RR on that page, though as I believe he broke it under the impression that he was reverting vandalism, I don't believe a block is necessary unless he continues to war over the template. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 11:22, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I made the reasons why I was taking down the template very clear to Skinmeister on this page.

<dd>As an outside observer to this situation (I stumbled onto it last night while reverting User page vandalisms), I agree with Samuel Blanning's views stated above. There is no need to have this template on that user page at this time. It would be best to see Skinmeister and Conrad Devonshire exhibit some self-control and move on in seperate directions, seeing as how the aggression and consternation that both have exhibited with this situation seems to be entirely self-made at this point. If they went on their ways within Wikipedia, I'm sure they'd appreciate their time on the site more. Hope that helps. <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 16:57, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I never called an edit of his vandalism. As most admins know, I use Vandal Proof to revert edits. KV is throwing a fit and reverting edits that 3-5 users agree are consistant with Wikipedia policy, on at least 3 pages (<a href="../../../t/h/o/Thoth.html" title="Thoth">Thoth</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermeticism.html" title="Hermeticism">Hermeticism</a>, and <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermetism.html" title="Hermetism">Hermetism</a>). He has exhausted his reverts and now he wishes to complain about it. He's made it clear <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermetism&amp;diff=66264081&amp;oldid=66179317" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermetism&amp;diff=66264081&amp;oldid=66179317" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermeticism&amp;diff=66267343&amp;oldid=66266197" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermeticism&amp;diff=66267343&amp;oldid=66266197" rel="nofollow">here</a> in his edit summary that he wants to just cause an edit war. We have tried to discuss this matter on the talk pages, it is he that is not working well with other editors. He also brings up his talk page where I placed test3 and test4 templates. He had already reverted so many times that I didnt bother to put tests 1 and 2 first. KV saved me the time, because I'm asking for a block on his account for however long an admin sees fit for reverting twice on the Thoth article, 3 times on the Hermeticism article, and I believe 2-3 times on the Hermetism article. <a href="../../../s/y/n/User%7ESynergeticMaggot_5ec3.html" title="User:SynergeticMaggot">SynergeticMaggot</a> 01:36, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As for my intentions, the edits on Thoth are not against Wikipedia policy. I am attempting to take references where it cannot be verified that they are used within the article out of the references section. When 999 said that they don't have to be used in the article I worked with him and created an Additional reading section. The trio has worked to make sure that didn't stay. In the other two articles mentioned, large sections are being removed without discussion. I have attempted to work with them, pleading with them to give me the chance to improve the articles by working with them and discussing with them, working on them one at a time so that I can focus my attentions and create good article status. They have a stance that published facts put forth by an acclaimed author and published by a reputable publisher are not "reputable sources" and are attempting to remove that in favor of keeping in statements that are completely unverified, but match their <i>point of view</i> on the matter. They have decided to attack me on 6 fronts, nominating articles for deletion that can be improved, are verified, and in the case of <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermetism.html" title="Hermetism">Hermetism</a> existed before I joined Wikipedia. Their actions are that of attempting to wear me too thin to be able to work with them, especially in good faith, in order to push their POV. <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> requires that all viewpoints put forth by renowned proponents be present. Instead of working with me to rephrase things to be less POV and adding sources that disagree with me, they decided to take the <i>easy</i> road and delete my contributions, figuring that they would rather have nothing to the expression of a POV, though well documented by many sources, that they disagree with. Essentially, SynergeticMaggot, 999, and Hanzuman work as meatpuppets, moving from article to article to enforce their POVs. SynergeticMaggot follows my contributions regularly, and 999 follows SynergeticMaggot, and Hanzuman follows 999.</p>
<p>SynergeticMaggot, I know in real life, I convinced him to join Wikipedia originally to help me on these articles, something I am now regretting, and I have applauded him for learning Wikipedia policies and procedures, always freshening up on them. However, I am seeing now that he is doing so and using this knowledge to selectively apply policy and abuse it and procedure to work against the spirit of Wikipedia. He is trying, with the others, to wear me down, get me to overreact, and get banned so they can push their POV while there are few interested eyes in these articles. A vast majority of those dealing with these articles are interested in learning only.</p>
<p>On the subject of 3RR, I am allowed 3 reverts for each article, and I have not gone over that in any of them. Each revert is in restoring a version that I feel is better, is verifiable, and should be discussed to improve, especially since it is long-standing text. Yet, he calls it vandalism, indirectly by the VandalPro edit messages, then calling me a vandal on my talk page. I feel that his actions are effectively vandalism, but in good faith, I have restrained myself from calling it vandalism up to the point of mentioning it here for comparison.</p>

<dd>I fail to see how I am abusing an policies. If there is an admin who sees this they can kindly let me know on my talk page, as I am no longer watching this notice. Also note that I am being accused in two places, the other is in the section above called "Blitzkrieg Tactics to push POV". KV has not gone over the 3RR, yet he has demonstrated his ability to revert first, and complain on AN later. Multiple reverts, as I was told before is enough to block for a given time, which is all I was asking for. And again, no one I know of has yet to call him a vandal, these were automated reverts, and test templates given out to warn KV.

<p>There are two AfD requests I would like blocked as per the aforementioned rules. Each of them state the following text: "Jointly, these policies determine the type and quality of material that is acceptable in the main namespace. They should not be interpreted in isolation from one another, and editors should therefore try to familiarize themselves with all three. These three policies are non-negotiable and cannot be superseded by any other guidelines, or by editors' consensus."</p>
<p>I will discuss both of the AfDs separately as they apply to these policies, but these AfDs are specifically overridden by these policies, and I will show how the deletion of these articles violate these core policies and thus they "cannot be superseded by ... editors' consensus" and must be stopped as per Wikipedia core policy.</p>
<p>This is my third notice on this board in the past 48 hours, probably the last 24, which I cannot remember starting a discussion on before. I certainly usually do not use it. But all the claims are interrelated to the same conflict, originally covered in <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html#Blitzkrieg_Tactics_to_push_POV" title="WP:AN">WP:AN#Blitzkrieg_Tactics_to_push_POV</a> and again in <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html#WP:CIVIL_violation_by_User:SynergeticMaggot" title="WP:AN">WP:AN#WP:CIVIL_violation_by_User:SynergeticMaggot</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unless the AfDs are clearly bad-faith and the AfD participants agree that they should be speedy-closed, these AfDs should stay the course. Also, please keep your requests short, per the text at the beginning of this page which states, in bold: "<b>Please make your comments concise. Administrators are less likely to pay attention to long diatribes.</b>". Comments this long make my eyes bleed. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 18:03, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHandface_86cc.html" title="User:Handface">User:Handface</a> is up to his old tricks and some new ones too.

Given the nature of the attack and the user's history of personal attacks and blocks for the same, I am happy that the 1 week block was a reasonable response. However, Handface has escalted this by creating two sockpuppets <a href="../../../h/y/t/User%7EHytorium_4524.html" title="User:Hytorium">User:Hytorium</a> and <a href="../../../h/o/s/User%7EHosfant_923b.html" title="User:Hosfant">User:Hosfant</a> to evade the block.

On the other hand, that is 10 seconds of dead link on the English Language version of the 17th busiest website on the internet (damnit). On the one hand, a notice on the article would be meta-garish muy malo. And, there is no other hand... although the chances (if random) were 1 in 1.2 Million that the article I was deleting was the TFA, I should have just checked. No notice, please. --Jeffrey O.

<dd>Well... we could ask devs to have a notice at the top of the article saying "linked from main page" that would be wrapped in a <tt>#mainpagelinked</tt> div, not visible to ordinary users. Or we could ask if they want to change the code and display the same CSS for users with the <tt>delete</tt> permission assigned and hide it server-side to everyone else (not as likely to get implemented, though). <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">xd</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a>)</sup> 07:24, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Some admins could probably do with taking a look. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Fox_1932.html" title="User talk:Tony Fox">(arf!)</a></small> 07:48, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Well, he stopped after receiving the final warning and some explanations of the policies. I have deleted a few attack pages consisted only on violations of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">abakharev</a> 12:54, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm posting this here because a conventional move request was closed with "no consensus". Would an admin please move <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Only_Difference_Between_Martyrdom_and_Suicide_Is_Press_Coverage_d109.html" title="The Only Difference Between Martyrdom and Suicide Is Press Coverage">The Only Difference Between Martyrdom and Suicide Is Press Coverage</a> to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Only_Difference_between_Martyrdom_and_Suicide_Is_Press_Coverage_7853.html" title="The Only Difference between Martyrdom and Suicide Is Press Coverage">The Only Difference between Martyrdom and Suicide Is Press Coverage</a>? It has been moved a million times, the last one of which created many double redirects and I would love to clean them up, but I think it only makes sense if the article's finally named properly (according to <a href="../../../n/c/_/WP%7ENC_b5d6.html" title="WP:NC">WP:NC</a> for song titles, the preposition "between" should not be capitalised). --<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarryCane_57e2.html" title="User:HarryCane">HarryCane</a> 12:33, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm posting to bring attention to this poll, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_Polish_monarchs#Poll:_article_names_of_Polish_monarchs.2C_diacritics_accepted_or_not" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_Polish_monarchs#Poll:_article_names_of_Polish_monarchs.2C_diacritics_accepted_or_not" rel="nofollow">Talk:List_of_Polish_monarchs#Poll:_article_names_of_Polish_monarchs.2C_diacritics_accepted_or_not</a>, opened on the 13th of June. That's obviously a long time, I'm not sure if it's listed on any of the poll pages, so I don't know if any of the relevant admins are aware of it. Hence why I bring it to attention here.
