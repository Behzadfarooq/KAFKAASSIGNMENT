His satirical bent is most obvious, and actually quite funny. Still, there has been a lot of tension at the Islam related articles lately, and this account is apparently an anti-Islamic user trying to ridicule his opponents by <i>persiflage</i>, so I do consider his behaviour blockable under the 'disruption' clause (after fair warning, of course). He will surely yell 'Islamophobia' at attempts to block him, consistent with his rôle, so I do not really know how to approach this. Other admins' comments on how to handle the case would be welcome.

<dd>I agree he is funny, but I am concerned he may spur some more zealous users, upon whom his humour may be lost, into a blind rage. It's true that Alberuni is very hard to tell from a satire; imagine, if we got more of these pranksters, it would be very difficult to decide which are serious. Maybe we should just take him by his word and treat him as an Islamist extremist anyway. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 18:18, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think you just made the most singular and astute observation within this discussion. Good eye! I'm kind of on the fence about how funny this all is though.

<dd>The username "Coq Sportif" makes reference to a French sportwear brand. The image on his user page can be seen as taking an old image out of context as to ridiculise French symbolism (the image is ridiculous all right, like for instance propaganda posters of the Second World War). It is very close to the sort of rethorics one can witness on sites like <a href="http://www.fuckfrance.com" class="external free" title="http://www.fuckfrance.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.fuckfrance.com</a> . Also, the image has been edited to read <i>Va te faire foutre</i> ("go fuck yourself"), which I strongly doubt our little friend here is unaware of. Hence my remark at the bottom of this page. I think that this, added to the nature of his contributions, hint at a disturbance-dedicated user account, which we might as well forcibly definitely shut down. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama_da58.html" title="User:Rama">Rama</a> 14:35, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think we need to see if they have the same location etc before jumping to conclusions. We've had loads of US-based anti-French editors.

<p>I believe <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Paul_339f.html" title="Ron Paul">Ron Paul</a> may be chocked up to coincidence as the single edit was simply from a crude nationalist POV rather than the general, and extensive, fulminations in which Reithy engaged. Placentophagy, however, provides a point with some contiguity in reverting which may require a further look.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the initial set of edits have great overlap with those of Ruy Lopez, whose mentioned sockpuppets have previously been banned for their mass reversions. Specifically, "Coq" insinuated himself into not only a Vfd initiated by Ruy, but as well into the <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_terrorism.html" title="Israeli terrorism">Israeli terrorism</a> article where he attempted to clumsily reinstate a Vfd process and subsequently purged the information.

As far as TJive's elaborate theories about who Coqsportif is - he says Coqsportif is a sock puppet of mine. Furthermore, it is not a typical sock puppet that would be created to get around 3RR, or do blatant vandalism and the like. He says I have created a sock puppet that makes lots of wild edits in "attempts to bury its repeated reversions amid several other disputes which serve as red herrings." I can do him one better. TJive has created this sock puppet to make it look as if it was my sock puppet. Being very clever, he makes it look like I tried to not make it my sock puppet, but in a way where it would look like it actually was my sock puppet. Plus he gets the added bonus of making all of those US nationalist edits on top of casting suspicion on me. Putting past the point that TJive is obviously a sock puppet - look at his first ten edits, it is obvious he is a sock puppet.

<dd>Secretlondon, this was already addressed. The primary purpose, <i>generally</i>, of a "strawman sockpuppet" is to attempt to show cupidity and ignorance from the opposite POV of what is held by the actual, living breathing person. The edits themselves serve to disrupt the pages in question with crude, POV language and continual reverts of material. The selections in question as I outlined demonstrate the same pattern of topics chosen. However, there is another single purpose which is a continuation of reverts which began under other sockpuppets for which it was the only point and action of the account--most of these have been banned. That is shown by the actions in the NED article, where the same revert was picked up by "Coq". In this manner a real purpose (and POV) is being demonstrated albeit hidden in a swath of others which all suggest the entire opposite. Hence massive disruptions of many articles where there is a prior user concern and where there is not. I expect that he is learning from the mistakes he made in revealing himself and will attempt a different tack of justification in his reverts the next time around. --<a href="../../../t/j/i/User%7ETJive_a615.html" title="User:TJive">TJive</a> 02:20, August 8, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I find this all a little conspiratorial and I seriously require some evidence. The concept of a "strawman sockpuppet" is a new one to me. I notice that you've all been fighting on the same pages - maybe you are all sockpuppets of each other? For example Coq edited <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_Cook_5cb0.html" title="Robin Cook">Robin Cook</a>, Ruy (or any other bogeymen) hasn't edited that page. Why would Ruy's bizarre anti-alter ego edit that page if Ruy hadn't edited it? This feels like you are witchunting Ruy by making him responsible for editors with your POV whose modus operandi you find unhelpful. <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecretlondon_1805.html" title="User:Secretlondon">Secretlondon</a> 07:55, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Secretlondon, I know you are on good terms with Ruy but unless you are prepared to explain what is otherwise a massive, involved, and tiring coincidence with the edit histories of five separate registered users all of which have chronologically contiguous obsessions over the same sets of articles and the evidence for which has been laid out here for you to survey at your leisure, your claim of "witchhunting" falls far short. --<a href="../../../t/j/i/User%7ETJive_a615.html" title="User:TJive">TJive</a> 08:20, August 8, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As one of the users who ultimately became rather closely involved in the Reithy/Chuck F foolishness, I'm virtually certain this is a reincarnation of Reithy -- the combination of <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Paul_339f.html" title="Ron Paul">Ron Paul</a>, <a href="../../../p/l/a/Placentophagy.html" title="Placentophagy">Placentophagy</a>, and <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Democratic_Party_of_Australia_6443.html" title="Liberal Democratic Party of Australia">Liberal Democratic Party of Australia</a> is simply too bizarre to be ignored. I see no reason to suspect sockpuppetry by Ruy Lopez, Strawman or otherwise -- Reithy was also more interested in stirring up trouble anywhere he could find it than in pushing any particular political ageanda. Seeing as Jimbo banned Reithy indefinitely last November, I see no reason to tolerate any more of his foolishness. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadicalsubversiv_69e3.html" title="User:Radicalsubversiv"><b>R</b>adical<b>S</b>ubversiv</a> <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadicalsubversiv_1bf7.html" title="User talk:Radicalsubversiv"><b>E</b></a> 21:47, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Certainly however it must be an elaborate coincidence for this user to initiate edits which follow a chronological path through four prior sockpuppets as well to make an identical revert and vote/disrupt the same sets of articles.

<dd>He's back, initially pretended his block hadn't cleared and he could only post on his talk page, so I locked his talk page, and lo and behold, he was in fact able to post elsewhere. He didn't e-mail me during the block, he says, because he didn't know how to. I don't believe him: I think it's because he doesn't want to risk revealing his IP address. There were other silly claims I won't go into.

<p>Minutes after posting to my talk page and obviously visiting my user page, the user copied the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedians_in_Hawaii_f1f4.html" title="Category:Wikipedians in Hawaii">Category:Wikipedians in Hawaii</a> on my user page and copied it to his own. I removed it twice since I thought it was pretty obvious Coqsportif was engaging in some kind mimickry/mockery troll, but he claims that I'm vandalizing his user page. Today on my talk page, the user has admitted that he does not currently live in Hawaii but claims to have been born there. Out of curiousity, I asked him the name of the island and town just to confirm his knowledge of Hawaii, but I was greeted with silence in response. So, the user adds the category back to his user page, admits he doesn't live in Hawaii, and refuses to talk about the claim that he does. If this isn't trolling I don't know what is. --<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 12:36, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is nothing wrong with adding a category link as was done. Doing so is not "trolling". His "admission" was that Hawaii was not currently his primary residence, but that he owns a home there, was born there and will be returning to live in said home which his parents currently occupy. I understand that these claims (coming from someone who has made questionable use of Wikipedia) are likely untrue, however, if we went around stripping out anything in anyone's talk page that we felt they had not substantiated properly... well, at least WikiMedia's servers would have some reclaimed disk space <code>;-)</code> -<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarmil_7a19.html" title="User:Harmil">Harmil</a> 12:59, 10 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I don't see anything wrong with removing articles from categories if they are miscategorized. Coqsportif admits that he doesn't live in Hawaii so I'm not clear why he's added the category, in this case minutes after commenting on my talk page. It looks to me like he's deliberately trolling for a reaction, much like the image he originally added to his user page. In response to his claim, I've asked him what island he was born on and he refuses to answer. I don't see why that question is so difficult to answer other than the possibility that he's making it all up. In any case, he got my attention after I told him I was ignoring him, so it was a successful troll. --<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 13:28, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I hope this is the end of the matter now but for the record I am happy to disclose my birthplace, my property ownership, my ancestry all of which demonstrate I am 100% Hawaiian. But I won't be answering to Viriditas who seems to be engaging in a form of trolling new to me, which is that you accuse someone else of being a troll and then puruse their every edit. I have no wish for interaction of any kind with Viriditas, I did not initiate any, I will not be seeking any. That doesn't sound like trolling but his behavior might well be. Either way I make no formal complaint and just wish the matter to conclude peacefully, it is obvious I started off on the wrong foot and I hope I can quickly fix that and get in step. Thank you to all those who addressed the issue of protecting my user page from Viriditas' edits, it is appreciated. <a href="../../../c/o/q/User%7ECoqsportif_fd4a.html" title="User:Coqsportif">Coqsportif</a> 21:13, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Although the use of <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEdit_summary_0886.html" title="Wikipedia:Edit summary">edit summaries</a> is not an etched-in-stone requirement, it is generally accepted that using them is a <a href="../../../g/o/o/Good_Thing_f477.html" title="Good Thing">Good Thing</a> and it is a heavily encouraged guideline.

<p>Clear exception to 3RR here for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The image has been proposed for deletion, it was deleted from the article by Viriditas which in turn makes it an orphan which means it will be deleted. Rather circular, don't you think? In these circumstances, I believe what is going on is <b>vandalism</b> although I will leave that to others to judge.</li>
<li>The image was initially deleted because it was said to be fake, I think that misunderstanding has been cleared up and now the image is being examined but not on any grounds that would justify its deletion. Viriditas' actions in deleting the image need to be corrected, which is exactly what I did, reverting vandalism is not in breach of the 3RR which is why I persisted with it. I believe I was right to do so. <a href="../../../c/o/q/User%7ECoqsportif_fd4a.html" title="User:Coqsportif">Coqsportif</a> 08:00, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This <i>can</i> be a serious matter. If it's a question of inserting advertising links into article space, the recourse would either be an RfC on the article or a VfD on it (for advertising). If it's in user space.... Well, that gets complicated, but no one may use his or her user page for advertising.

<dd>The message above was written by 222.133.52.110, who originally created the page <a href="../../../r/i/d/User%7ERIDCSP_d1ef.html" title="User:RIDCSP">User: RIDCSP</a>, where RIDCSP stands for "The Research Institute for Development,Communication and School Partnership", a Cameroon organisation. There was a thread about it here before, but it has rolled off. The perceived problem was that it wasn't a userpage at all, but a (rather promotional) description of an organization, and we discussed whether the page should be deleted. Instead, I rewrote the text for NPOV, moved it to article space, and created its talk page to tell 222.133.52.110 that an organization can't be a wiki user, but s/he'd be most welcome to contribute to the encyclopedia as an individual. 222.133.52.110, you are indeed welcome, but it would be better if you created an account for yourself with an individualized name, a person's name--you can be as anonymous as you like--and a userpage that fits that account. Avoid calling yourself the name of an organization. Please click on the "talk" link in my signature if you want me to help set you up; that'll take you to my own talk page. The page <a href="../../../r/i/d/User%7ERIDCSP_d1ef.html" title="User:RIDCSP">User: RIDCSP</a> is now just a redirect to the article <a href="../../../r/i/d/RIDCSP_96bb.html" title="RIDCSP">RIDCSP</a>, it's not a userpage--it's not "you". In other words, you have already contributed a good, informative article to the encyclopedia, you should be proud.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 09:05, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thoughts? This is a relatively non-serious instance of sock puppetry, if thatis what it is, just a chap having fun at the expense of kneejerk school inclusionism.

<dd>The Cyrillic "es" issue has come up before: here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=18773625" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=18773625" rel="nofollow">[42]</a> is where I posted about it about a month ago. On the two computers/browsers I usually use for Wikipedia, Cyrillic "es" looks just like "c", especially in Recent Changes, where we need to be able to spot the difference. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_af9e.html" title="User talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a> 16:45, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This brings up a related question. About a month ago there was a proposed policy for preemptively reserving doppleganger account names. I thought it sounded like a reasonable idea at the time, but couldn't find it again when I was able to act on it.

<li>There was also a suggestion to disallow non-ASCII characters in usernames in the first place. There are a few legit users with strange names, these could be grandfathered. New users should then have 'simple' names. Of course this doesn't prevent them from doing the lower-L/capital-I trick, but it greatly reduces possibilities of impersonation. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 08:41, August 10, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I have blocked both User:Romer and User:Aesculapius75 for 24 hours for vandalizing this page yet again, although the two are making differnt edits. I've suggested to Aesculapius75, who is the subject's son and the creator of the article, that the vanity links to himself should be on his User page, but he refuses to agree, and has indicated that he will return as sock puppets to make the same changes if he is blocked. Romer just says that the page is an attack, although all of the information seems valid to me, and keeps reverting to a bland, non-wikified version despite the efforts of several users to edit the page to a valid Wikipedia-format level. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a> 19:20, August 10, 2005 (UTC)</p>

They have been added by a wide variety of contributors. Since Wikipedia is not advocacy, I do not believe these links are appropriate and am removing all but the best-justified cases.</p>

<p>As per <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_deletion_Log_2005_August_3_486c.html#Category:Delaware_River_crossings" title="Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/Log/2005 August 3">Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/Log/2005 August 3#Category:Delaware River crossings</a>, consensus was to merge Category:Delaware River crossings into <a href="../../../d/e/l/Category%7EDelaware_River_14b0.html" title="Category:Delaware River">Category:Delaware River</a>. Boothy443 took exception to this, and reverted the changes that K1Bond001 had made. I warned Boothy that this was per consensus, and if he did it again, he would run afoul of 3RR. He did, so I blocked him for one day. Now a series of IP's have been recreating the deleted category and recategorizing the articles. I've blocked the first one, but I can't do this all night. Anyone have any ideas on how to deal with this besides protecting the articles? --<a href="../../../k/b/d/User%7EKbdank71_f952.html" title="User:Kbdank71">Kbdank71</a> 21:20, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>At least this will spice up Boothy's RFC. Looks like the IPs are completely different; in fact, they're registered to different continents.

<dd>Notice also that tor supports "policies"; it is possible that some nodes on that list blocked access to the Wikipedia servers, and thus should not be blocked.

For instance, 130.89.25.10 is listed as not accepting any outbound connection, and it's on the proxy.org list, even though it cannot be used as an open proxy. So, there is no need to block it, but you wouldn't know by looking only at proxy.org. --<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesarB_5f7f.html" title="User:CesarB">cesarb</a> 00:33, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

The records on it are separated by blank lines, and the lines beginning with "router" have the IP address for each record. The records with no "accept" lines and a "reject *:*" line do not need to be blocked. As for the rest, unless they have an exclusion on Wikipedia's IP block or on port 80 (looking through the list I've seen at least one which can only be used for IRC), go on and block. I'm just worried about possible technical effects of blocking the whole lot at once instead of gradually. --<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesarB_5f7f.html" title="User:CesarB">cesarb</a> 16:29, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ah, OK, sorry. The guy's being quite the PITA and I'm getting overly terse about him. He started as a POV-pusher then decided he was clever and would run multiple names. He was spotted immediately, partly because he kept using his home cable connection (RoadRunner cable, DHCP but doesn't change very fast at all) but <i>mostly</i> because his editing style is distinctive (he doesn't just act like a dick, he distinctively acts like one), to the point where the AC sanctioned him. So he spawned ever more usernames, all editing in the same trolling and POVpushing style from the same few IPs, also trolling on the wikien-l mailing list and on IRC. Recently he discovered <a href="../../../t/o/r/Tor_%28anonymity_network%29.html" title="Tor (anonymity network)">Tor</a> and has been editing and IRCing through that (leading to frequent short blocks on *!*@*tor* on #wikipedia - Freenode policy is against long blocks on Tor). Whether it's one troll or two (it's one), the behaviour of either is obnoxious enough to block as needed in the opinion of me and many others - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 13:34, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No, actually the joke is on David Gerard. He just won't admit it; even though the proof is in his increasingly overreaching actions, he plods away, and blocks or bans anyone he disagrees with.</p>
<p>I created only two accounts, named KaintheScion and ElKabong. They were designed in a deliberate attempt to provoke David Gerard, using obvious violations of the rules and an exploit in certain routers and Windows XP remote admin software that allows a user to take a "local" IP address from a distant area and use it. Yes, I know and freely admit that this was a gross violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> but Gerard has never been known to listen to reason before, so drastic action was needed.</p>
<p>What I failed to consider was (A) how overzealous David Gerard and others in his cabal really are and (B) how opportunistic certain POV pushers on Wikipedia would be about screaming "sockpuppet" and attaching whatever the name of the latest Wikipedia bogeyman is to the complaint.</p>
<p>In short, I screwed up. Three months after the experiment, David Gerard is still on his witch hunt. Those in his cabal are eagerly helping him cover up his lapse in judgement because in doing so they can cover their own. At least six usernames that I did NOT create are banned. I have a hunch that some of them might be sockpuppets, since there are admins on Wikipedia who will freely advise blocked users to come back under new names as a "fresh start" and claim that as long as no rules are broken, they have no worries.</p>
<p>What is really funny is that from the start, I was doing my level best to create the next <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlberuni_e425.html" title="User:Alberuni">Alberuni</a>. While I succeeded beyond my wildest expectations, I was also shocked when I saw that the name wasn't ElKabong (as I intended) but really the falsely-accused user named Enviroknot, whose name was tagged illegitimately onto an RFAR by POV-pushing users and who the ArbCom freely attacked without ever paying attention to the facts.</p>
<p>Sorry, Gerard. You can whine and complain, you can kickban users, you can remove them from the en-l mailing list, you can do what you want. You have been given power at Wikipedia, far too much power apparently given how corrupt you've become from your use of it. You know the wool was pulled over your eyes. I'm sorry I didn't stop it sooner but that is my own lapse of judgement. Just like everyone else here, I put too much faith in you. I really didn't think you would take it this far.</p>

As for calling Dbraceyrules one, I was joking around. He needs to get a grip and learn that text on the Internet should be taken about as seriously as a whoopee cushion. Also, I did not continue to taunt him, I told him not to leave Wikipedia because his contributions were appreciated.

There's also someone in the same block (presumably the same vandal) who has been adding nowiki tags to articles to screw up their formatting: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Osama_bin_Laden&amp;curid=22468&amp;diff=20826868&amp;oldid=20826823" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Osama_bin_Laden&amp;curid=22468&amp;diff=20826868&amp;oldid=20826823" rel="nofollow">[49]</a>. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 04:43, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, we don't know. I recently updated <a href="../../../b/l/o/Special%7EBlockip_59cc.html" title="Special:Blockip">Special:Blockip</a> when I found a new range. However, anyone who does a <a href="http://www.arin.net/whois/" class="external text" title="http://www.arin.net/whois/" rel="nofollow">whois</a> query can immediately see where the address belongs to. In the case of 65.182.7.34, it's Amnet (I don't know exactly which Amnet, as there seem to be several organizations of that name). It is most likely a dynamic IP, but it's not AOL, and there's no indication it's a rotating proxy for which care should be exercised. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 11:16, 12 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I saw semi-comprehensible rambling, which amused me a bit, and maybe some vague and strange threats, but it never occurred to me that anyone would consider it <i>stalking</i>. I don't see how you get stalking out of it; maybe I missed some part of it. Moreover, a block is just plain silly. The IPs weren't engaged in any vandalism. Blocks are useful for specific things, certain conditions; they aren't a cure-all. You don't just throw blocks at everything that vaguely resembles a problem. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 08:48, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm a bit unsure of what is the best course of action here. On one hand, I really doubt that these are newbies experimenting with anything, and their contributions seem to be spamming Jimbo's talkpage. On the other hand, blocking them for a whole week without giving them a warning at least is rather harsh, and similar to the blocking policy they use at the Norwegian Wikipedia (One strike and you're out). <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 08:54, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It actually works well in the sense that the Norwegian version is seldomly vandalized. Remember, on the Norwegian version there are probably only one or two administrators logged in at a time, and during the night there are probably none. They have other things to do than to keep watching out for vandalism. But the policy (actually it's just convention) does mean that newbies just experimenting may wind up being blocked and chased away, so it is definitely <i>not</i> a solution I recommend for the English version. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 09:06, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was just carrying out the decision as it was articulated on IRC. I raised the issue of whether the edits should be removed, and the eventual consensus developed was to block the IPs for one week. It was not a unilateral decision (as I noted in the first line) but rather a consensus decision as to how the situation should be handled. -- <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> · <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay">Talk</a> 08:57, August 12, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>67.170.135.43 replaced an existing comment with spam and is unrelated. The other IPs produced the rambling verbiage that is the hallmark of <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmorrow_1f6d.html" title="User:Amorrow">Amorrow</a>, some of it signed explicitly by him. See <a href="#User:Amorrow_and_Elizabeth_Morgan" title="">#User:Amorrow_and_Elizabeth_Morgan</a> on this page. From the way the comments are phrased you'd be tempted to think Jimbo responded, but you'd be wrong; mr. Morrow seems perfectly capable of continuing a discussion on his lonesome. "Stalking" is a misnomer, though, and blocking is mostly useless. He's already been blocked. You can go and keep blocking proxies, but it's not going to do much, I'm afraid. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 09:01, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, it seems to me that anybody who goes through all those IPs just to make a few edits could probably keep going through IPs forever. Even though nobody was blocking him at the time, he was continually switching IPs in between rants. I doubt he'll ever try to go back to those IPs, and even if he had only one IP to use, I'm not sure the offense of rambling strangely on Jimbo's talk page is worth a block to begin with. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 09:07, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Proper thing to do is check if all the IPs are really dynamic, reblock any static IPs permanently for running open proxies, and either unblocking or limiting to 24 hours the blocks of the other IPs. Since checking for static IPs is really a bit of a black art, we can probably skip that part (we can always decide to go with longer blocks if the contribution histories show vandalism). Right now we're talking about blocking dynamic addresses with no prior contributions for a week because some eccentric found open proxies. I'd say unblock them all and reblock only if we actually see something persistent <i>from each single address</i>, rather than someone who happens to be using those addresses. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 09:36, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

The person who brought it to my attention never said "range block" but kinda hinted that might be a good solution; I'm not in the dispute (other than to advise the user who asked my advice) but it seems to me a range block by someone who knows what they are doing (I certianly as heck don't) could be a resonable solution. -- <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> · <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay">Talk</a> 08:00, August 13, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>BAD IDEA!!</b> All of Saudi Arabia's internet access comes through one proxy range (for ease in filtering), and that's the range you'll be seeing. Basically, blocking that range blocks the country. If you do need to do a range block, you need to keep it REAL short, make sure your Wikipedia email link works, leave a block message that apologises for the inconvenience, unblock promptly on collateral damage, etc., etc.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That said, I suspect at least some of those IPs are open or near-open proxies (having seen a variety of <i>interesting</i> editors using them). I have no idea which ones and would need to know more about their technical setup of the proxy range, etc. before being able to say more - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 11:31, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>See, exactly the reason I say "I don't know what I'm doing," because not only do I not know the technical aspects of range blocking, but I don't know enough about IP reports (like you get at samspade.com) to understand what exactly is being reported. However, while I don't think I conveyed it well, what I meant was, a range block of the range that is being used (which I think is fairly small) rather than a block of that ISP's whole range. Then again, I don't know enough about range blocks (I wish there was a tech-illiterate explaination of how range blocks work) to know if it's possible to just block XXX.XXX.XXX.13 to XXX.XXX.XXX.25 or whatever, or even if using .13 to .25 is indicative of being in a small range that is limited to .13 to .25. I certainly don't want to block all of Saudi Arabia or any other country for that matter! Having revealed my obvious lack of tech savvy, and seeing that there are greater minds than I on the situation *bows to David*, I shall now sit back and keep my illiterate mouth shut unless there is something useful I can contribute.&#160;; - ) -- <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> · <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay">Talk</a> 12:07, August 13, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It <i>seems</i> that some blocking of sock-puppets has calmed things down a bit, for the moment at least. With regard to range blocks — I suppose that the procedure has been made so impenetrable in order to discourage admins from doing it. Would it be better to make it easier, but limit its use to a small number of admins (or, perhaps, bureacrats or other group)? --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μ&amp;;epsilon;λ Ετητης</font>)</a> 13:30, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Apparently the user <a href="../../../f/w/d/User%7EFwdixon_2050.html" title="User:Fwdixon">FWDixon</a> has been fighting with an anon IP who refuses to discuss removing links to many Hardy Boys-related pages in a civil manner.

He did not, and as soon as I unlocked the pages, the reversions started again.

<p>No, only a developer can delete individual page edits, and they only do that in very exceptional circumstances (which this is not). This isn't a big deal, either - just tell him in the future to do his test edits in the sandbox. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">→Raul654</a> 19:51, August 12, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not quite true. Administrators can delete an article wholesale, then restore all revisions except the ones they want to see gone. This is a hack, finding the revisions is not trivial, and deleting a whole article certainly isn't, but it does work. It's true that any <i>permanent</i> deletion of revisions or articles, such that not even admins can see or restore them, can only be done by developers. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 21:28, 12 August 2005 (UTC)

<p>Bunch of problems here. At one time I thought we had decided not to allow web addresses as usernames, so there's that, though I don't see it in <a href="../../../u/p/_/WP%7EUP_7462.html" title="WP:UP">WP:UP</a>.</p>
<p>The greater problem is that the user is adding a considerable number of links to www.wikinerds.org, a competing encyclopedia project. I have removed many already. These take the form of either: links in the external links section; or attribution in the article itself. In general it has been our policy that when copying material from another wiki, we include attribution information on talk.</p>
<p>It has been our policy not to link to external sources that contain material that we would rather have here, and I believe that the links being added fall well within that boundary.</p>
<p>I have left a note on the user's talk page regarding the links but await further discussion before bringing up the matter of the username itself.</p>

<ul>
<li>There is a dispute about the neutrality and facts and citations of the Michael Dutton Douglas article. I have read the book referred to and it contains none of the "facts" referred to. The clear inference in the article is that the First Lady killed an ex boyfriend because he was going out with one of her best friends. Even if true (anything's possible I guess), such an allegation would require the closest scrutiny and that's what I'm trying to do.</li>
</ul>

<li><a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShem_Daimwood_ae70.html" title="User:Shem Daimwood">Shem</a> has twice removed the dispute tags without discussing the serious issues.</li>

<dd>Shem, tell me the exact page which makes the assertions in that article implying the First Lady is guilty of a pretty serious crime. It isn't there. Tell me the exact page which says he was going out with one of her friends. It isn't there. Tell me the exact page which says she used to go out with him. It isn't there. If you really want I'll photocopy the pages cited and scan them and email to you so you can see for yourself. The article as it stands is quite terrible but in a sense that's not the issue. The issue is your removal of the dispute tags. Restore them and let's work it out in the Talk page but otherwise you are guilty of the disruptive behavior you so freely accuse others of engaging in.

<p>I have removed the bulk of the article, as it was a copyvio from Snopes.com. I have also removed the dispute tags, because there's now very little material left in the article.

Fortunately <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> spotted it and unblocked me. Have I missed something in the blocking policy?

<dd>First, I had seen neither of these when I made my second edit. Secondly, and more importantly, you haven't answered my question.

<dd>Eh? An extensive discussion with Dan100 can be found below.

<dl>
<dd>This is a complete <i>non sequitur</i>. The comment to which I was responding didn't refer to what as said later in the discussion (though I may have misunderstood the non-English construction "this was already discussed"; the two references seemd to suggest that you were talking about what I'd read before I made my edit to the RfA). Moreover, nowhere in the discussion below is there any reference to the part of the blocking policy which you thought justified your behaviour. You seem more interested in (flimsy) point-scoring than in actually engaging with the issue.

<dd>To make this clear; my belief is that Kim Bruning blocked me (and may have done the same to others) for a reason not mentioned in the blocking policy, for a tribvial matter, and that he did so because of a dispute. I contend that his action was petty vidictiveness, and that he's guilty of using his admin powers to settle a score. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 13:47, 14 August 2005 (UTC)

<p>I don't think there's anything particularly wrong with editing closed RFAs. Sometimes people even add votes. In my view, such edits serve no clear purpose, but they're not disruptive. We have the history, after all.</p>

<dd>I think it depends on the kind of edit being done. If you don't leave a clue that you've edited, people won't think to look in the history and be deceived somewhat too easily. (see discussion as linked to above). But that is neither here nor there. I warned Mel Etitis, and we could have discussed or requested advice at that point then. Instead he chose to ignore the warning, reverted a revert, and only at that point did I block him for 24 hours. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> 22:32, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There's a lot wrong with editing RFAs, as Kim has stated - closed RFAs should remain records of the state of the vote when the bureaucrat made their decision. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDan100_0edd.html" title="User:Dan100">Dan100</a> (<a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDan100_803a.html" title="User talk:Dan100">Talk)</a> 22:26, August 13, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>He was making the housekeeping edit of inserting a simple colon, which preserves the content of a comment that has been stricken, without having it auto-numbered in the list. This is routinely done in order to maintain RfA tallies, in many cases not by the person who made the comments. To say that this is "editing other people's signed comments", not to mention a blockable offense, is an extreme stretch, given that it's commonly accepted practice. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 06:12, 14 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Sure! After an RFA is <i>closed</i> though, it might be better to leave a note, rather than make an edit that leaves you with different tallies. See the discussion linked to above for details. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> 11:04, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>On one hand, for closed RFAs to be useful records of the state of a vote, it seems like it would be good for the numbers on top to reflect the actual vote tallies. On the other hand, there could be situations where the fact that the numbers on top were <i>incorrect</i> when the vote was decided on is itself important (say, if there was a discrepancy in the counting of support/oppose votes that caused a RFA to be unfairly accepted/rejected--although I would hope that closing bureaucrats count actual votes one last time by hand to be sure!) This was clearly something that should have been fixed before the RFA was closed; all things considered, it probably wasn't worth going against policy to fix after the RFA was closed. Possibly the correct thing to do in this case would be to not correct the tallies, but instead add a signed note near the top saying that they are incorrect, were incorrect when the vote was closed, and clearly indicating that the note itself was added after the vote was closed? I don't see how that could cause any problems. <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 22:54, 13 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I do check the support and oppose counts by hand and did in this case.

<dd>This is a ridiculous dispute. Kim, you are making a fuss out of nothing. Mel, you might have found a better way round this, taking into account Kim's point of view. Does anyone really believe that Mel was acting in bad faith? This block was unnecessary and needlessly provocative. Kim probably shouldn't have done it anyway, given the previous happenings. In addition to this, blocks are meant to deal with problem users. Mel most certainly does not fit this category.

<dd>I don't know if that comment was aimed at me (it may have been, it may not have been, as I just added to that page), but I will reply. Treating well-established users differently to new users is not necessarily evil. If we have established that someone is a good faith user, and Mel is (or show me evidence to the contrary), then there should be no need to block except in a specific policy violation, where the admin is not involved and the change is actually significant. This is trivial. All it does is inflame. <a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmoddy_2381.html" title="User:Smoddy">[[smoddy]]</a> 23:17, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, now long since I've reverted to the last version by Mel Etitis (with whom I rarely agree on anything), I find this discussion. I hope I don't get blocked for reverting it. In this case, Mel's call was correct, if not his actions (nor mine, oops!). Perhaps as a compromise we can ask whoever closed the VFD (I don't feel like going to look right now) to go back and review the case and fix the NEUTRAL vote formatting, and correct the vote count accordingly, and redeclare the vote closed. I don't mind being reverted for this purpose. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 06:52, August 14, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, tell you what, how about leaving a clear note at the top of the page, saying that the neutral count was off by two, that way it's easy to see what change was made.

<dd>Yes, I've noticed that. Since restoring a deleted page is basically reversing another admin's decision, I often have felt a need to justify my actions. I find that if there is a speedy tag that comes along with the restoration, I can provide a justification in the edit summary when removing it. But in general practice I would like a reason field, even unprotecting has one. I can't imagine it's the first time this has been brought up...? <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 01:29, August 14, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, this is a classic case of a badly handled situation right here. The user name doesn't bother me, but I suppose it should have been changed; as it happens, the user was blocked, probably was outraged, tried to start new accounts and got blocked time and time again. Now we may lose this person's good editing. To top it off, Zzyzx is trying to give him the impression that he has dug himself in a hole he can never get out of.

<dd>Rather than an ouright block, perhaps a suggestion to change usernames be made first? A problem I see is that there's no quick solution to attribute edits to a new account, giving those who should move to a more suitable username a more difficult decision to make. Blocking outright when the editor is doing no other harm is kind of heavy handed.

<p>I find the name offensive and would not have hesitated to block (although I would've left a note explaining this and suggeting using a better name).

<dd>You wouldn't have hesitated to, say, suggest the user think about a new user name, and give them a while to consider it? What on earth is the benefit of this hardline approach?

<dd>I concur with Everyking and, given that the user's misbehaviour arises from an over-reaction to an admin error, I think that it would be appropriate for Tony to apologise to the user for that error. This is not to condone the subsequent misbehaviour. —<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoClarke_a891.html" title="User:TheoClarke">Theo</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheoClarke_5767.html" title="User talk:TheoClarke">(Talk)</a> 10:49, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Would we allow the username User:Springtime for Hitler on the grounds that this too is an in-joke that should offend no one? Or in the <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Chappelle_2cbc.html" title="Dave Chappelle">Dave Chappelle</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chappelle%27s_Show_7f8c.html" title="Chappelle's Show">Chappelle's Show</a> vein, would User:Piss On You or User:The Niggar Family qualify as an in-joke?</p>
<p>The fact that this user is willing to stubbornly create so many socks doesn't bode well for the first time he gets into an edit war with someone. The suggestion that Tony should apologize is absurd; he was routinely following existing policy as per <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUsername_0c30.html#Inappropriate_usernames" title="Wikipedia:Username">Wikipedia:Username#Inappropriate_usernames</a>. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 15:34, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Where is the attraction in unblocking a user who has demonstrated so ably that they cannot behave? The user remains completely free to create another account with another name: we won't know it's them if they just get on with good editing. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 16:56, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The standard template is pretty friendly, although the act of blocking is in itself necessarily pretty hostile. It's a fairly urgent matter, because once an inflammatory username is in the edit history it stays there unless and until the edits are transferred to a new username. I acted quickly in this instance because the name was particularly inflammatory. An editor blocked in this way, solely for an inflammatory username, is always welcome to keep editing either anonymously or under a more suitable username.</p>
<p>It seems that this wasn't a good faith incident, either (see David Gerard's note on socking) but we couldn't have known that. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 18:07, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>yes, the case is closed now, I suppose. But for the record, I do not believe that usernames of this sort should be blocked on sight. You should open an rfc, and give the user a chance to listen to other people's opinions, and to change the name voluntarily. The only things that should be blocked on sight are outright obscenity and racial/religious slurs.

<p>These articles have now been well-established as having been created as deliberate acts of commercial spamming of Wikipedia -- so-called "viral marketing" in contravention of Wikipedia policy. Both are currently proposed for deletion on VfD with overwhelming majorities in favor of deletion.</p>
<p>Leaving the articles up for the duration required for a VfD vote would be to play into the hands of the spammers, whose entire purpose in creating them was to garner "buzz". Therefore, I request that both articles be speedily deleted.</p>
<p>In addition, because the creation of these articles was a deliberate, premeditated act of spamming against Wikipedia, I ask that the creator be blocked indefinitely. It appears that there's IP address evidence that these articles were created by someone within the BBC, the organization whose work is advertised in the spam. This means we should be concerned that this spamming offense was done with the approval of the organization. I don't think it would be too outrageous to block the IP address space of the specific BBC office responsible, unless &amp; until they're ready to explain their actions and apologize for committing this offense against Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 17:58, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>do we even know this is "the BBC"? Sure, the IP is from there, but would we accuse "the BBC" if somebody vandalized the George Bush article from a BBC IP?

<p>There's still the matter of the sockpuppet account. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon_Hawk_01ee.html" title="User:Jon Hawk">Jon Hawk</a> is almost certainly a sockpuppet. Is there any way we can check his IP against other users? This whole thing still smells very fishy to me. I think accepting Jon Hawk's explanation at face value is naive. True, he may be a "British student", but marketing companies love to hire college students to do their viral marketing dirty work. I wouldn't be so suspicious except for the fact that his first day of editing is textbook sockpuppetry. First he creates a trivial legitimate article which he later points to as evidence that he isn't a vandal, then he creates the fake article, categorizes it (with proper name sorting), and links to it from other articles. Once the hoax is exposed, he manages to find the administrator's incident noticeboard to comment on the issue and defend himself. Clearly he has significant experience using Wikipedia. Personally, I think some marketing company found a college student with Wikipedia proficiency and hired him to test the waters for them. This exact scenario has been bandied back and forth in the blogosphere for a couple months now. Not sure there's really much we can do about it though.
