<h2><span class="mw-headline">Proposal notes</span></h2>
<p><a name="Intent" id="Intent"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Intent</span></h3>
<p>My intent in proposing this policy is simple--to introduce an extremely simple (I tried to make the process as "stupidly basic" as possible) and hard to abuse system of peer review and oversight of people with administrative access. As it presently is, barring extraordinary and public abuse of their priviledges as an admin, it is extremely unlikely for anyone to be de-sysoped--for all intents and purposes, the simple act of passing an RfA is a lifetime appointment with little practical oversight and/or possible repercussions for misbehavior under current systems.</p>
<p>Notice how the certification process works: it's basically just RfC certification, but with an extra requirement on <i>who</i> can certify. The RfA recall vote is literally a forced RfA, where a support vote is an endorsement of desysoping. I have no ill will towards any admin, and this process and tool is for administrators as well as editors. Think about it: you need 1 filer, and 25 certifiers to justify that the community needs to reassess an administrator's standing, and the filer <i>also</i> has to state his reasons, justification, and evidence (to which the admin can reply). <i>Then</i> it goes to general community review a <i>second</i> time, and early closingare specifically forbidden and disallowed from this proposed process--to at all times give the admin being recalled the benefit of the doubt.</p>
<p><a name="Reapplication_as_an_admin" id="Reapplication_as_an_admin"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Reapplication as an admin</span></h3>
<p>Any previous admin who was removed by the community is free to reapply as an administrator again at their own discretion, per normal application for adminship guidelines and the will of the community.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Sample Timeline, explanation</span></h3>
<p>Just to clarify/expand on how it would work.</p>
<ul>
<li>Day 1: A user determines he should file an Admin Recall. He posts the above notice of his complaint with full basis/evidence sections on the admin's personal Talk page, to give the admin 24 hours' notice.</li>
<li>Day 2: The user files the Admin Recall for certification.</li>
<li>Days 2-9: Certification window</li>
<li>Day 9: certification closes. If not met, Recall request closes. If met, within 24 hours the recall vote must be initiated.</li>
<li>Days 9-30: Recall vote.</li>

<dd>After the discussions, particularly regarding the existing role of ArbCom, I don't feel this proposal is the answer to possible dissatisfactions with admins.

I support this idea, but honestly, I think it errs on the side of being TOO careful. If you find an 80% majority wanting to desysop someone, then there is a problem somewhere along the line. I'd make it 20 to indict and 66% to convict.
<dl>
<dd>I agree. The question is what percentage of users have to have faith in an admin to make their work viable. If 66% of the community is that unhappy with someone, their continued adminship surely has to be counter-productive. ArbCom is a majority vote, so one might even consider that precedent — if more than 50% of editors no longer wish someone to have those powers, it indicates there has not been an appropriate use of them. Another way of looking at that would be that it needs 75%+ support to be sysopped, but only 51% support to confirm continuation. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 21:43, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I trust the ArbCom more than RfA; generally if an admin is doing something right, some people will be pissed off.

<li>Firstly: what exactly is a user in good standing? (I don't know if I'm in good standing or not). Secondly, what is preventing a more than capable, but unpopular, admin being recalled for something spurious; like not making enough portal talk edits, or contributing a featured article etc. Thirdly: I think there might be a struggle to get enough qualified people to support a request apart from in the most serious cases (the criteria are quite high, and there is evidence to suggest that vote pages can have a low readership). Fourth, why should a recall RfA last for three weeks? (most RfAs tend to spike in the first couple of days, take a look). Fifth, I won't support a policy with consensus misspelt throughout. I am not necessarily against the idea of a recall policy, but I cannot support until it is both better though out and at least the equall of an ArbCom ruling in terms of fairness. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERje_9381.html" title="User:Rje">Rje</a> 01:19, 15 August 2006 (UTC) (Admin.)</li>

We already have an arbitration committee and it's quite capable of desysopping a bad administrator in a much shorter period than that envisioned in this proposal. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 14:37, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Because if 31 users brought a laundry list of things to ArbCom that weren't flaming, violent abuses of admin buttons, and 200+ people said, "You know, this guy really isn't a good guy, and shouldn't be trusted..." ArbCom would clearly remove them? The point isn't duplication and that is a severe misrepresentation of the proposed Recall process.

<dd>I think we should have a community based admin recall process (and I am an admin). I am not sure that this one is the right thing, as it is extremely protective of admins (while it should be possible to start a recall in a typical RfC case with this procedure, the actual desysopping will only happen in extremely rare cases if it needs a 2/3 majority). Ex-admins have often had more than 50% support in re-RfAs, and none of those would have been desysopped by this procedure here. However, anybody who gets recalled by a procedure with a pro-admin bias such as this definitely does not have the community's trust, and should really not have admin tools. <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> <a href="../../../k/u/s/User_talk%7EKusma_087e.html" title="User talk:Kusma">(討論)</a> 09:19, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think if this was just a place where people could report lots of abuse by an admin, it would be better. No voting stuff, just evidence.

<p>The problem with this is that it's rather extreme ... it goes directly to the worst punishment available, desysopping.

<dd>Something like First Recall: lose admin rights for 1-2 months, Second Recall: desysopped, and reduce the 9 month period somewhat?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Long term vandals can game the system too easily</span></h2>
<p>Wikipedia has attracted a number of long term vandals that have periodically caused problems and returning to their vandalism after occasional sabbaticals. Many of these vandals are known to create large numbers of <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">sockpuppets</a> and sleeper accounts to aid in their endeavors. There are also semi-organized groups of editors who are more interested in advancing certain POVs than abiding by Wikipedia's policies.</p>
<p>This proposal's basis of performing a recall based strictly on numbers and without any other considerations of Wikipedia policy and practices means that any one of these vandals can remove an admin with the audacity to block blatant vandals by simply creating a stable of puppets, making a series of minor edits with each of them, and then waiting till the puppets have aged before beginning a campaign to have any vandal fighting admin de-sysopped. POV pushers will have similar abilities against admins enforcing Wikipedia policies on content or user behavior. Unless some form of reasonableness check is added to the procedures to filter out complaints about admins doing unpopular but needed actions all this proposal will do is reduce the number of admins willing to fight vandals, POV pushers, trolls, and other parties trying to advance a personal agenda over the good of Wikipedia as a whole. --<i><a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllen3_f7ae.html" title="User:Allen3">Allen3</a></i>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllen3_35fb.html" title="User talk:Allen3">talk</a></sup> 03:28, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

I mean, if trolls etc. can do all that, they could just as easily prevent the person from becoming an admin in the first place. Presumably the usual investigation and removal can be made if puppetry is suspected, just as with other RfA and other discussions. Besides, if someone wants to make 500 edits from (say) ten accounts, that's 5,000 edits. Is anyone really willing to make 5,000 edits just to troll? And if they do, hey, that's 5,000 good edits; that's worth an admin. Admin status is supposed to be no big deal, getting desysoped should be no big deal, just a chance to concentrate on article work for awhile. Any good organization weeds out the bottom 5% or so periodically. It's ludicrous that admins have, effectively, lifetime tenure from day one. And if the odd admin does get unfairly quashed, that'd be too bad, but no system is perfect. I guess in that case we could dust off that old saying, <i>"That's the way it is. Get used to it."</i> <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 04:09, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It would be quite hard, though. Initiating a recall would require 25 sockpuppets and 12,500 edits. The subsequent recall would easily gain two hundred votes in favor of keeping the guy adminned -- attempts to stuff the ballot box are the best way I know of to draw participation -- so a vandal would need another 600 sockpuppets. And finally, the vandal would need to convince a steward to ignore clear bad-faith voting. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> 04:07, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The filing editor has to meet the 5 month/500 edit requirement as well, for 26 users in "good standing" with 13,000+ edits between them for certification to occur. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/o/User_talk%7ERootology_22b0.html" title="User talk:Rootology">T</a>) 07:54, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>These reasons are exactly why I put in the given numbers (initially 300 edits, then 500 on second thought)--no one is going to spend that much time doing quality edits, and if some moron actually goes to the trouble of using like a bot or something to build up the accounts, seconds of inspection would show them as fakes during certification. Any editor that gets to 500 edits and 5 months is probably going to have something on their user and talk pages, some interaction, and be somewhat known. The 1 filer/25 certifiers by this method makes it so that you have *real* people certifying it. The numbers could also be theoretically raised, but 500 seems a good value to use as it allows people who aren't particularly "hard core" editors to have access to the process. I'd be leery of setting it at say something like "1,000 main space edits". <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/o/User_talk%7ERootology_22b0.html" title="User talk:Rootology">T</a>) 06:05, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Any number you come up with can be overcome by a group or individual with determination, or else will be so large that there will be an insufficiently large pool of qualified individuals to make this a viable policy. It is not the bored school kiddies that present a problem but the organized POV pushers and long-term trolls. Accumulating a couple hundred edits takes a little effort, but not as much as you imply. I have had days were I accumulated close to 500 edits doing simple maintenance and there are tools such as <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutoWikiBrowser_c07e.html" title="Wikipedia:AutoWikiBrowser">Wikipedia:AutoWikiBrowser</a> make it very easy for anyone wishing to make a large number of main space edits to perform close to an edit per minute.

<dd>The problem is that there needs to a method by which the community and admins can police fellow admins without having to go through ArbCom in a completely ill-defined process as it exists now. Like I mentioned below to Amono, frivilous filings will be apparent, as their evidence will have no basis, and the RfA in all likelihood would reflect that. This bit--"organized POV pushers and long-term trolls"--is actually a troubling comment. No editor (admin or regular) is infallible. If an admin did something (action, course/trend of action, etc.) that made someone feel that they were due for recall, and took the time to file and certify, <i>and</i> the community <i>at large</i> agreed with them in the RfA recall vote that the admin should be recalled, wouldn't that be indicative of a good recall filing in the end? The filing itself is no different than an RfC: "I think this is a problem, here's why. Who agrees?" The issue to me is that--on the flipside--is 26 people went to ArbCom to file a complaint all at once about an admin due to perceived admin abuse, or if 26 people actually filed an RfC together against an admin due to perceived admin abuse, it would be a massive deal as so many people would be involved. That's why the threshold and values are there--26 users is a lot of people, but it's still just certification--the community at large in RfA actually makes the decision to de-admin someone, not that group. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/o/User_talk%7ERootology_22b0.html" title="User talk:Rootology">T</a>) 16:44, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The policy does state it, and gives the admin two chances to explain his actions and why he should continue on as admin. During the Certification, his reply is there for all to see, and he's free to participate him/herself in any discussion on the talk page during that week.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">not vandals that can game the system, but cliques</span></h2>
<p>Someone earlier said long term vandals can game it by making 25 accounts and doing this. To me that's laughable. The accounts would be easily found out by checkuser as coming from proxies. Also 25 users x 300 edits = 7500 edits.</p>
<p>The problem I see is that it is 25 people and not 25 instances of admin abuse. Of course an administrator could probably hide the abuse, making it tougher.</p>
<p>What I think would happen is two administrators dislike each other. And there's millions of people on wikipedia. Well one administrator has tons of friends and the other doesn't have many friends on wikipedia. The one with friends gets them all together to de-sysop their enemy.</p>

<dd>Theoretically a vindictive person could get together 25 people who meet the criteria, to get them to certify a given Recall. The thing is that this is only the first step--the larger community still has to actually decide to desysop the admin afterwards via an RfA vote. While yes, it's feasible that someone vindictive could somehow muster up 25 people--their doing it on-wikipedia would be pretty blatant from their contributions, and they'd still be hardly assured of actually succeeding in anything via the recall vote. The other thing is, they have to list an actual basis for the recall, plus evidence. Something frivilous if it actually got the RfA vote going would be shouted down by the larger community. I mean, even this infamous Cabal--how big is it, if someone were to take all the potential members? Anyone reading this--think about who you think is part of a given clique--is that clique really big enough and cohesive enough to sway an entire RfA without being completely obvious and called out for it? Keep in mind as well that the RfAs to actually make someone an admin would be a lot different in tone than if Recall RfA.</dd>
<dd>Worst case: there will be frivilous filings for Recall, the same as there as frivilous DRs, RfCs, RfARs, etc., but the fact that real users have to agree to put forward the basis of the dispute to have any value will keep it in check. In fact if someone *REALLY* wanted an admin stripped of power, the *worst* thing you can do is file frivilously and without cause: if you the vote is successful they're protected from more shenanigans for nine months' time. If you disliked someone a frivilous Recall is the worst thing you can actually do, as you're protecting in all likelihood the person you don't like; I tried to make the system self correcting in this way. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/o/User_talk%7ERootology_22b0.html" title="User talk:Rootology">T</a>) 06:50, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Okay I just want to reassert that votes is a bad idea</span></h2>
<p>Basically I think this should be redone where it purely lists evidence of abuse by an administrator and that is it. No voting. No popularity contests. No admins de-sysoped because of enemies whether vandals, regular editors, political groups, etc. Just like a big complaint pile. The admin only gets de-sysopped if there is sufficient real evidence, not 25 people who hate them. I personally think it would be better to pile up evidence because on <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_de-adminship_8eb9.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for de-adminship">Wikipedia:Requests for de-adminship</a> I see admins being de-admined for single instances, which to me that's out of balance and de-adminning should be taken over the course of long term actions. Also it would be important to require that evidence here remain viewable in histories and not deleted.</p>
<p>I also think this would save much time on arbitration and such. If it's a mere voting thing, any admin that does something controversial will get 25 real editors voting to de-sysop them because they're unpopular (such as if they have to remove a Brian Peppers-like article for privacy reasons). But if it's an evidence thing, then if people think an admin did wrong, instead of making a case, they ad it to a list of evidence under an admin's name. If the admin is being abusive, then evidence will pile up. Furthermore, if it's just evidence, then admins also have to be nice to newcomers as well as long-time editors. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnomo_6299.html" title="User:Anomo">Anomo</a> 12:29, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think you're missing part of the structure of the Recall policy. 25/26 people <i><b>cannot</b></i> get someone desysopped. Period. 26 people are needed to validate, justify, and certify the merit of the complaint, at which point the motion is basically opened to a community census of the admin's performance--another round of <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFA_4c83.html" title="WP:RFA">WP:RFA</a> for that admin. If the admin is good and has done nothing wrong, he's got nothing to worry about at all, and will breeze through as the basis of the dispute and the evidence will be right there for all to see. Having a "crap drawer" for admins is a bad idea in the way you describe, as it would be just that... a gargantuan record of complaints that eventually will be literally people flinging garbage whenever there is a disagreement. The filing process here and the time limitations will bar that right out, and as mentioned before any frivilous, without merit filings would be Very Stupid if you wanted to desysop an admin--the community is smart, and you'd just be giving the guy you dislike a 9 month vacation from your nonsense (plus tipping off the community to your bias). <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/o/User_talk%7ERootology_22b0.html" title="User talk:Rootology">T</a>) 16:36, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

If you file RfC for something, you don't need to wait for them or even give them a heads up, beyond a courtesy message that the RfC has been filed. The 24 hour talk page notification for the admin is because Recall is a Very Big Deal, and to give them the oppurtunity to clear their heads and begin to prepare a response.

<dd>Let's say Admin1 did this--gets another admin or editor to file a bogus complaint vs. him for "protection". First, a good admin won't need to do this. By your assumption of this, it would be done by a hypothetical "bad" admin, or one which was extremely concerned about their standing in the community. If Admin1 did this, and he was really perceived as that bad of an admin or unpopular enough to be concerned about something like this because of their tone, actions, whatever you'd like to list, a "protection" filing would be a tremendously bad idea as it would open them to the community review process--there is no guarantee the certification or RfA would "fail" to their benefit. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/o/User_talk%7ERootology_22b0.html" title="User talk:Rootology">T</a>) 17:10, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Vote confusion</span></h2>
<p>FIrst of all, major applause to this proposal now that I've read it in full. Very, airtight, good benefit of the doubt, and increases accountability.</p>
<p>This confusion of voting "support" or "oppose" - perhaps it would be in order to add that at NO time may ANY user change the vote of another user, <b>even in cases of apparent confusion</b>. For example, if I said -</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Support</b>, So-and-so is a fine admin</dd>
</dl>
<p>CLearly I don't want yo desysop this person, but my vote would count as a vote for de-sysopping, and someone might change it because I was confused on the support/oppose thing. So we should say that you shouldn't change the vote for them, you should message them on their talk page and tell them to do it.</p>
<p>The reason I bring this up is not for the above case, but for possible confusing votes. Like,</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Support</b> - poor administrator and incivil <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a> violator - not sure desysopping is really in order though</dd>
</dl>
<p>That could be hard to judge. I may very well be "unsure" about desysopping, but vote to desysop anyway. SOmeone could say "Oh they were confused" and change it though. The policy should take a step to prevent that. Karwynn <a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKarwynn_869e.html" title="User talk:Karwynn">(talk)</a> 17:17, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>A thought more than a suggestion: what about saying no admin who is voting to support de-sysopping can place a block on said admin ( the 2-day, 5-day after block)? The only problem is, you'd have to say that if THAT happens, no admin who OPPOSES the desysopping can UNDO that block, but then no admin who SUPPORTS it could undo THAT, etc.</p>
<p>Basically, this policy has some room for wheel-warring, maybe no involved admin should be able to take any administrative action on the "recall subject", and cannot take any action to undo any block placed ON him or BY him on another user.

<dd>Since blocks are undoable by anyone, and I'd (hope) everyone had faith in admins in general to do things right, I wasn't even worried about this aspect--I block is just a block, there's no reason another person can't undo one if it's in good faith and per the rules. The time based block for abuse of recall process--I'll add a note to this effect--should not be reduced by anyone. The rules as they are written are pretty explicit: the admin under nomination is not to game the system or use his administrative tools in regards to the filer or certifiers. It takes just a moment for someone else to be brought it, or a ten second post on <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a> or <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a>; doing so is *not* a great burden on the admin under nomination or the admin community.

<dd>Wheel warring in this sense is now covered. Say Karwynn the admin is nominated. You mess twice with the process, using two admin actions. 48+120 = a 168 hour block for flagrant abuse. I see this, and unblock you or shorten the block. Another admin undoes my action and reblocks you for the remaining duration and warns me. I do it again. I'm now blocked for 48 hours. I come back, do it again. Now I'm blocked for 120 hours. Basically, the same remedy applies now in the wording to prevent this.

<p>This is becoming an extremely complex proposal. We already have a way of dealing with abusive administrators--arbitration. The Arbitration Committee can settle such cases expeditiously (in as little as six days where speed is desirable).

<dd>Are there any "what ifs" that you feel are not already answered in the policy? Additionally, this isn't just some casual "let's get this guy desysopped" thing, it's not something a lot of admins will have to worry about. If no one has ever adked you to step down, it probably means you're a good administrator, thus it would be unlikely this policy would ever affect you. However, not all admins are as well trusted by the community. All the "what ifs" are designed to root out trolling and gaming, and even though this isn't my proposal, I think I'm right when I say that bringing up any specific "what ifs" that you think the policy doesn't satisfy would be very helpful.

<p>Is ArbCom really overloaded with de-sysop requests that we need to create a policy such as this one?

<dl>
<dd>ArbCom is not overloaded as such, but the process for ArbCom will (from reviewing previous issues) only remove privs based on massive or extremely flagrant issues. The problem with the system as it exists now is that it's--in all honesty--extremely easy relatively to get admin privs. But, once appointed, the same community that made the decision to give those powers has no ability to reverse that same decision if the community has decided they no longer support the ability of that admin to serve. It's a one-way street at present; this makes it a true function of the community collectively deciding who is fit to serve as an administrator. It's fine that it's basically easy to get admin privs--it should be, as if the community has faith to give someone the buttons, it should give it to them easily. This process makes people jump through some pretty intensive community support hoops to take away those same buttons, twice, in a very streamlined fashion. Right now, if 50-70+ people decide you should be an admin, odds are you will be. This requires a minimum of 26 people to approve the request that you should be reviewed. If a clear concensus majority then decides that you shouldn't be an admin afterwards, based on your evidence and career, that is exceptionally fair. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/o/User_talk%7ERootology_22b0.html" title="User talk:Rootology">T</a>) 18:47, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, previous blocking shouldn't matter. Many admins have been blocked for trolling, 3rr, etc., the same as editors. The 500 threshold in arbitrary one to clear out the obvious puppets.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Instruction creep</span></h2>
<p>This proposal tries to define in minute detail the precise way it should work, with a high amount of arbitrary numbers and precise rules.

<dd>IMO this is way too detailed to begin with. Rather than starting with something slightly less complex than the US tax code, a better process might be to start with a very geneal outline of a proposal and then fill in the details. Starting with an explanation of what the problem is, and why existing procedures have been ineffective in handling such issues. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 20:38, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, the factoring in of a way for it to run is actually for the protection of the admins--it should be feasible for the community to remove an admin for abuse, loss of faith in their abilities, etc., if a sufficient segment of the community agrees, just as for RfA. The "precise" nature of it was specifically to protect admins, the same with the numbers mentioned. Plus as Karwynn mentioned below, it was (I hope) meant to kill any wikilawyering, on any side, so that any removal an admin the community deemed necessary was done 100% fairly and "above board". <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/o/User_talk%7ERootology_22b0.html" title="User talk:Rootology">T</a>) 20:05, 11 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>To me, the amount of instruction actually lends itself to a much stricter interpretation, leading to less wikilawyering. Have you actually read the proposal, or did you just notice it was kind of long? Karwynn <a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKarwynn_869e.html" title="User talk:Karwynn">(talk)</a> 20:03, 11 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>From <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikilawyering_a5b4.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikilawyering">Wikipedia:Wikilawyering</a>: "[...] Typically wikilawyering raises procedural or evidentiary points in a manner analogous to formal legal proceedings, [...]". Having excessively detailed rules which are supposed to be followed to the letter will only help wikilawyers. The more strict the rules, the more the wikilawyers are happy; the one rule they most dislike would be <a href="../../../i/g/n/Wikipedia%7EIgnore_all_rules_528b.html" title="Wikipedia:Ignore all rules">Wikipedia:Ignore all rules</a> (how can you argue the rules if you are supposed to ignore them?).</dd>
<dd>An example of one instance of instruction creep is the wait time of six or nine months before a new review request can be filled. We actually already have something similar to that on AfD, the main difference being that there's no set period (a renomination can be removed if it's filled "too soon", but sometimes you can legitimately have a renomination the following day). You could change it to "no admin should be submitted to recall if he was submitted before recently, unless there's a good reason", but even that is not needed; repeatedly resubmitting an admin to recall, after he was already submitted five times in the last month, would be considered <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html#Disruption" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">disruption</a> (itself a rule with rather fuzzy boundaries), even if you wasn't the one who submitted the previous five times. Almost the whole proposal is littered with unneeded (and potentially harmful) detail like that (to see why this particular one is harmful: it creates <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perverse_incentive.html" title="Perverse incentive">perverse incentives</a>, since the admin is <i>immune</i> for nine full months if he passed a review, and if he thinks his next review and RfA will fail he might go rogue while he can).</dd>
<dd>If you remove all the redundant rules, and expect people to use common sense, what you would end up with is simply something like "any user which is not a new user can nominate an admin for recall; if it's endorsed in seven days by 25 other users (also not new users), the admin must go through RfA again; if it's not endorsed, it gets desysopped". The rest can be dealt with by the other policies and common sense. If the policy is accepted, simply copy the procedures from RfC. And now that it's been reduced to the core, we can discuss the essentials (including how it relates to the several other proposals which failed in the past, and which kinds of effects it would create), instead of getting bogged down in detail. If needed, the detail can be added back later (but I doubt much would be needed, even if it were to pass). --<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesarB_5f7f.html" title="User:CesarB">cesarb</a> 20:37, 11 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If you're that broad, there will be MORE wikilawyering. People will spend all the time arguing about who is and isn't a new user, who isn't established enough to vote, etc. This policy makes sure the process can be done, rather than disrupted or deleted entirely by an admin who doesn't like it. Frankly, common sense doesn't always apply to policies like these - policies that specifically affect admins more often than not. The point of this is to stop potential abuse right? ell, it's useless if the "provisions" are loose enough as to manipulated by those admins by deleting/protecting/whatevering they can do to disrupt the process. THe detail prevents that by not allowing a lot of room for interpretation. It's hard for me to believe that loosening the syntax of the proposition will actually decrease wikilawyering. This way, there is no interpretation, not techniicalities - it's spelled out, very clearly, so as to not be taken advantage of. If you still disagree, could you maybe walk me through a scenario where this process would be weakened or taken advantage of by wikilawyering? maybe I can see your viewpoint better with an example. --Karwynn <a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKarwynn_869e.html" title="User talk:Karwynn">(talk)</a> 20:57, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Looking back over this, the current version does not have the nine month exclusion. This worries me, as it might invite trolling and/or abusive usage of this system. Granted, if someone filed repeatedly, it would be clear disruption, but it could also be a problem if multiple users starting chaining these vs. a given admin. On the other hand, if an admin were to draw that level of apparent level community ire--that it was certified each time--it might be a sign that they are not fit to admin. I don't know. I am inclined to include the nine month window again, or least a six month one. Admin abuse during the window--should it occur hypothetically--could still be addressed via AN/I, RfC, and ArbCom.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">A system of this kind is biased against particular kinds of admin work</span></h2>
<p>I don't think any system of this kind, no matter how much effort is spent on creating safeguards, is going to get enough support to come into force. One problem I see that hasn't been covered so far, and can't be remedied by more safeguards, is that admins who do certain types of work will be more vulnerable than others. I don't mean that a certain type of attitude (rouge vs. non-rouge) would make an admin more vulnerable - that brings up the argument over whether self-declared rouge admins are to be commended for their boldness or whether they're just making excuses to be impetuous and wrong-headed, and I don't think it's necessary to drag that up.</p>
<p>What I mean is that, for example, admins who monitor <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_3RR_4b52.html" title="WP:AN/3RR">the 3RR alert noticeboard</a> will be much more vulnerable than admins who monitor <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">the vandalism alert board</a>. <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> generally involves IPs and new accounts, who won't have suffrage under this proposal and rarely have any reason to claim that they were hard done by, whereas <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_3RR_4b52.html" title="WP:AN/3RR">WP:AN/3RR</a> involves long-established users who often feel intensely aggrieved at being blocked and think that they have good defences. "I was reverting vandalism", "If I didn't revert the page would be left at <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/The_Wrong_Version" class="extiw" title="m:The_Wrong_Version">The Wrong Version</a>, "My 4th revert was 25 hours after the 1st", etc. <i>Blocking someone for vandalism gets your userpage defaced at worst, whereas if this proposal was active, blocking someone for 3RR would put you one step closer to losing adminship.</i> It doesn't just apply to 3RR - those who close AfDs, which may involve long-standing pages worked on by users with more than 500 edits, are going to be more vulnerable than those who speedy delete new pages, generally created by those who just got here. MfDs tend to be even more personal than AfDs. And so on.</p>
<p>Also, any administrator who does get recalled will need at least 104 votes to be safe with the RfA. Remember that all the users that signed the recall petition will be <i>certain</i> to oppose the RfA, whereas no matter how many hundreds of users support the admin's work, they may not notice or support the RfA. Any attempt to remedy this would amount to vote-stacking. To get over 100 support votes at RfA is quite exceptional - that's why we have a <a href="../../../1/0/0/WP%7E100_d2fb.html" title="WP:100">special page</a> for those that manage it.</p>
<p>Oh, and one more thing. 500 edits can be done standing on one's head if you know the right places (stub sorting, RC patrol, categorising uncategorised articles, and so on). The only real criterion is the 5 months.</p>
<p>So bearing that in mind, if this proposal went live, all you need to do is annoy 26 users whose account is more than 5 months old, and you've got a very high chance, if not close to a certainty, of being desysopped. It would certainly create a <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chilling_effect.html" title="Chilling effect">chilling effect</a> on the vulnerable areas I mentioned above, and we haven't got enough admins to discourage people from taking on any of our areas of work. As Zoe says, this is a problem in search of a solution, and <i>we'd need a really, really big problem to justify this solution</i>. We haven't got one. Arbcom will do. If you're seething at something an admin has said or done and thinking "He/she should be desysopped" - take a deep breath, go outside, get a pint with some friends, go to sleep and in the morning you'll probably need your watchlist to remember what it even was. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 23:12, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thank you for the extremely thoughtful comments. It's got nothing to do with anything done by any admin, really, it just looked like a big hole in the current system. I've made a couple of adjustments to the Policy proposal specifically to address your concerns. Specifically:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</b> Requires 30 users, with 10 months of experience each, and 2000 edits each to certify or file (31 total).</dd>
<dd><b>2.</b> 3 of the certifiers must be fellow Administrators.</dd>
<dd><b>3.</b> Re-added the nine-month limitation.</dd>
<dd><b>4.</b> Recall RfA concensus must be 80% or higher.</dd>
<dd><b>5.</b> Recall RfA remains open for 21 days. Certification remains open for 7 days.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I will admit that some areas of the admin work will draw more ire by their nature, but if 31 total users, 3 or more of which are administrators, agree that a Recall of the admin is in order... wouldn't that be a sign that perhaps something was actually an issue with the given administrator? I'd just like to reiterate that my goal in this is to develop a means for the community (admins and editors) to actually control who has administrative access on an ongoing basis. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/o/User_talk%7ERootology_22b0.html" title="User talk:Rootology">T</a>) 23:51, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Now the requirements are getting so sky-high I think it would be easier to get an Arbcom case filed and accepted before those conditions were met. Certainly I'd much rather do that than hunt around for people licking wounds from the administrator in question, not to mention finding 3 administrators (you can't possibly expect this to work without allowing filers to solicit certifiers - no way would 30 potential ceritifiers randomly stumble over this page). You'd almost certainly piss off every admin and probably every non-admin you asked to certify who didn't think it justified, and there would be far more bruised feelings when the recall failed than after Arbcom rejects a case.</dd>
<dd>I don't think the requirements are the problem - in my mind there is no particular set which would be lenient enough to make recall possible but stringent enough to make it only possible when justified. I think the process is intrinsically flawed, sorry. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 00:06, 12 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I figured that any kind of action like this would result in bruised feeling and hurt egos, unfortunately--the same with RfC or if someone actually filed an ArbCom against you. But if the certification and the Recall RfA were both listed both on the Recall and RfA pages, you don't think it would generate enough views by the community to make it potentially worthwhile? Keeping in mind that the first would be there for 7 days, and the latter for 21? <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/o/User_talk%7ERootology_22b0.html" title="User talk:Rootology">T</a>) 00:14, 12 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Not 30 users with more than 10 months of editing and 2000 edits who would publicly support a recall. Bear in mind that I only passed that threshhold myself last month. I think at any point where that became possible, one of the 30 would have filed an Arbcom case (or anyone for that matter, as anyone can file Arbcom cases). I also think that the way Arbcom deals with evidence for and against, and suggesting what remedies should be taken, is far better than anything that could be set up here. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 00:29, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sam, what do you think of my idea of just a place to post evidence of abuse? If the evidence of abuse has to stay there and can't be deleted, then it would be some progress. If it is evidence, then someone could submit it anonymously and not get retribution. It's like if your neighbor's blasting their music loud and you confont them all the time, they hate you, but if you call the cops, the noisy neighbor won't know whose tires to slash. An evidence page may simply shame an admin who is doing the wrong thing into doing the right thing. Badlydrawnjeff said that is too little, but right now evidence pages would probably get deleted and the person who made them banned.</dd>
<dd>I also have an idea that would solve the editing thing. You mentioned that someone smart could do lots of edits really fast. This also is hurtful to newcomers who get picked on well about everywhere as "newbies." What of instead of so many edits, we require say 300 different days of one edit each to an article or a talk page. That way nobody could just do a bunch of editing over a few days, but they'd have to come back every single day. I think 300 different days with each an edit to an article or article's talk page is harder than 10 months and 2000 edits. I think article talk pages should count because it would be harder to do--no spelling fixes but actually writing something that doesn't look like spam.<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnomo_6299.html" title="User:Anomo">Anomo</a> 03:42, 12 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>For the first, we have RfC for that. If there's a genuine problem, you'll find two certifiers, and then you can collect as much evidence as you like.</dd>
<dd>For the second - well, I'm inclined to think that any criterion that excludes me as 'too new' isn't a good one, and I don't think that's just self-obsession, I think I have enough length and breadth of experience with Wikipedia's policy and people that any criterion that excludes me from participating as 'too new' is rather bizarre. 300 days is 10 months, and I've been here for 11, and I'm sure there must have been 30 days where I didn't make an edit. I mean, I really hope there was or I'm more of a Wikiholic than I feared :-). Anyway, I don't think we have a system to even measure that at the moment. And as I said - the requirements aren't the problem for me. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 12:58, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The problem is that the current system empowers an extreme minority of users to make decisions on a process that on the other end of the same phase gives absolute 100% control to the end users of the project. Currently, if 30 admins collectively determined that one of their peers should not be a fellow administrator any long due to his actions, and ArbCom does not agree, that is the end of the story. This is inherently <i>broken</i>. This better way basically opens the door to allow those 30 admins to create a venue for public discussion, where the majority then gets to decide if they are right or wrong, and whether the "bad" admin in question should go. I fail to see any logical reason (no offense) for this to not be policy, except that some admins would be nervous about being Recalled themselves from their lifetime appointment. This system by it's nature will empower the communit to control itself fully, and no admin in good repute with his peers (see the 3 admin requirement) and the general community will have nothing to worry about. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/o/User_talk%7ERootology_22b0.html" title="User talk:Rootology">T</a>) 17:42, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's only inherently broken if your example - that "30 admins collectively determined that one of their peers should not be a fellow administrator any long due to his actions, and ArbCom does not agree" - <i>ever actually happened</i>. It's never happened and I consider it so unlikely that we're back to the fact that this is a nigh-on unworkable solution looking in vain for a massive problem. The problem only exists in the swamps of "might"s and "theoretically"s and "yes, but <i>what if</i>?"s where process creep is born. Of course some admins would be nervous about being recalled; as I said, the trouble is that only the minority of them would actually deserve desysopping, and that minority can be dealt with by Arbcom. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 18:29, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>OK. Reasons for this not to become policy:
<ol>
<li>It's instruction creep.</li>
<li>It assumes a problem that hasn't existed before.</li>
<li>It gives power to users to punish (or threaten to punish -- even if it fails it still has a negative impact) administrators <i>without giving a valid reason or showing evidence of abuse.</i></li>
<li>It contains a number of arbitrary thresholds which are at the same time too strict and not strict enough.</li>
<li>There is no prior requirement for RFC or anything other than a 24-hour warning on the admin's Talk page (which will no doubt become a favourite threat of trolls).</li>
<li>It doesn't clearly explain why ArbCom can't handle this using its existing procedures.</li>

<dd>Some rebuttals:
<ol>
<li>Not all instruction creep is bad.</li>
<li>Admins are not really accountable by the same editors who promote them, so it assumes a problem that has continued to exist, not one that is being conjured up.</li>
<li>Wrong, this has those failsafes in place. If you feel said failsafes are not enough, perhaps you can expand this.</li>

<p>This committee will be in charge of reviewing appeals made by the admin, during all procedings. )Read Section appeal to understand this next part.) Say an admin gets voted off as an admin by the community. He may file an appeal as any defendant can after a criminal trial to suggest that his proceeding was either an abuse of power by the members on the Admin Recall Committee. That the members of the committee were unfair, seemed to side with on side of the issue, or violate any wikipedia policies. You may also file appeals against the filers or supporters of the persons on the admin, for these reasons.... If your rights, policies, abuse of power, misrepersentaion of the facts, or ruining the admin's reputation (delibritly), can be on the grounds of an appeal. So back on the example, The removal of the admin won't intiate until the Appeal Review Committee makes a decision on the appeal. If they pass the appeal, the committee will take in consider that there was a community vote, and they will move to have a vote on wither the admin should be removed or not knowing that there was an abuse of power or any of the other grounds for an appeal. --<a href="../../../z/o/n/User%7EZonerocks_02e9.html" title="User:Zonerocks">Zonerocks</a> 01:50, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is a proposal to be added to the policy at hand. This policy ( Admin Recall ) should be taken seriously, especially when your dealing with someone losing there adminship and respect.

<dd>Exactly. Someone losing their adminship is a <i>big deal</i>. That's why ArbCom handles it. They're not overloaded with de-adminship cases, and while having community control over adminship would theoretically mean a policy like this one to take that away, in practice this will be used almost exclusively by users with gripes against administrators, while people with real, serious complaints will still go to ArbCom to have it dealt with more quickly. <a href="../../../f/a/g/User%7EFagstein_330b.html" title="User:Fagstein">Fagstein</a> 16:43, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sam, what if you have a situation where a good sized group of admins and editors all come to the conclusion that "Admin X" is not fit to be an admin anymore, but the scale of evidence isn't something that ArbCom would act on--but they see a trend of let's say continued behavior for a hypothetical situation, based on which they would not have passed this person on the original RfA. What then? It's not the sort of thing that ArbCom would ever remove someone for, but based on their behavior they would in all likelihood have difficulty passing an RfA. What if these admins and editors feel this person based on their actions shouldn't have the tools? They just have to sit on it?

<p>This should instead be a process of recalling administrators by their peers. If you can't even pass RFA yourself it doesn't make sense that you should be able to get admins kicked out. Generally fellow admins are much better at knowing which admins are acting badly than the larger editor population does. Admins face lots of problems and situations that the general editor population just doesn't understand, and they might take it out on an admin who didn't do a thing wrong; it was just poorly perceived by the people who were affected by the actions.

<dd>That sounds dangerously like the argument where I tell a music snob that I don't like (insert shite prog rock band here) and he asks me if I can play as good as them, then says "you shouldn't criticise if you can't do better". Or "how can you consider yourself qualified to support this article's deletion when you know nothing about the subject". I don't think the judgement of a given admin is necessarily more reliable than a given user with the same edit count and length of experience. There are plenty of sensible users who understand Wikipedia policy that, for various reasons, don't become admins, including lack of time, being unable (or unwilling) to maintain the necessary standard of civility or simply not wanting to be an admin, and taking or appearing to take an elitist attitude towards adminship should be avoided. It should be repeated at this point that I think any admin recall process is unworkable and unnecessary.

<dd>Cyde, there is already such a provision within the proposal - three of the certifiers must be active administrators. Therefore no admin who has the support of his (or her) peers will be subject to a recall. <a href="../../../c/y/n/User%7ECynical_3d57.html" title="User:Cynical">Cynical</a> 23:34, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I have to echo Mr. Blanning's statements: I'm not really taken with this particular proposal, but it bears repeating, again, that adminship should be "no big deal." It's primarily a janitorial assignment, and while I have a great deal of personal respect for the people who take it upon themselves to carry out those tasks, I firmly oppose any attempt to reinterpret it beyond those boundaries. Additionally, I worry that this kind of rhetoric is profoundly counterproductive, leading to the perception that administrators are elitist and "out of touch" with non-administrative editors. Whether or not you personally believe this to be the case, that perception does exist. The fact that we're having this discussion now is testament to that. I see no reason to fan those particular flames. – <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeancdaug_9c50.html" title="User:Seancdaug">Sean Daugherty</a> <small><a href="../../../s/e/a/User_talk%7ESeancdaug_ad69.html" title="User talk:Seancdaug">(talk)</a></small> 04:31, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If the question is standing, I don't think you need that high of a bar to be considered to be in good standing as a contributing member of the community, at all. If the previous level was considered too low, how about 6 months, 1,000 edits.

<dd>Anyway, confidence of the community is pretty nebulous. People call for desysopping all the time, they just get ignored, I'm not sure where you could draw the line between "lost confidence of the community" and "storm in a teacup that will be forgotten tomorrow". Indeed, one of the problems that occurs to me with this process is that when someone feels they've been dealt with unjustly by an admin, rather than going to sleep, waking up with some perspective and quietly forgetting it, they'll be encouraged to start stalking the admin, digging through their past edits looking for other previously wronged editors, and going around trying to organise a recall - in effect scratching their own itch until it becomes a gaping sore.

<dd>Not meant to be fast--the idea isn't to steamroll an admin, it's to give the community and the admin's peers to make the determination if he's due to be an admin based on his history after his initial RfA. Certification: is the filing for Recall with merit (one week)? Recall RfA: is he fit to perform as an admin (21 days--to at all times give the admin benefit of the doubt, and to allow people to change their opinions/votes). Plus as mentioned above, with the <b>80%</b> concensus requirement, it amounts to a supermajority of Wikipedians agreeing that the admin shouldn't be an admin--totally fair.

<p>I've had people, even administrators, angrily demanding my desysopping over something that seemed like a big deal to them <i>at the time</i>, but that in the long run, ended up being, at most, a minor problem. For instance, I may have close a certain "rationales for impeachment" AFD in a controversial fashion ... does anyone even remember that? It got sorted out in the long run, and I don't think (or at least I hope) that people still aren't holding a grudge against me for that, but at the time, tempers were very inflamed. I would thus propose some sort of waiting period for this Admin Recall period so that people can have the benefit of 20/20 hindsight and determine if something was truly worth losing adminship over. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><span style="color:#ff66ff;"><b>Cyde Weys</b></span></a> 17:33, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's already built in, inherently. It takes an entire month for the community process to run, and the admin can't be caught flat footed with a "SURPRISE YOU GOT RECALLED!!!" action due to the 24 hour waiting period. Even then, it requires a substantial number of people to agree. Say you closed an AfD on me that I was POSITIVE had to be a keep, but it was borderline--concensus wasn't happening, so you judge delete. I think to myself, "Oh man, that Cyde is a son of a bitch, I'll desysop him!" (hypothetical, not saying your a SOB). So I file (which I can't since I don't even meet my own criteria for another month or so, but I digress). People *can* file a stupid Recall; the same as I can file a bogus RfC that says "Cyde was mean to me," or "Cyde hates ferrets," or "CydeBot totally is like lame". But the difference is that my evidence would consist of "Cyde's dumb machine made fun of my pet ferret Whiskers," and no one would certify it aside from a few stupid trolls, and you'd have a good laugh over it. And then no one could Recall you for nine months. Even if by some insane fate 3+ admins and 27+ others agreed, it'd never vote you out on Recall for being mean to my ferret. And even IF somehow you got railroaded out and desysopped--see how it's getting more and more implausible for a bogus Recall?--your rerunning 5 minutes later for a new RfA would almost certainly pass given your history. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/o/User_talk%7ERootology_22b0.html" title="User talk:Rootology">T</a>) 17:42, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>? Must've missed your reply when I posted mine, whoops. FOr the record, I'd be in support of a "SURPRISE YOU GOT RECALLED!!!" system just for the laughs. But in all seriousness, I don't think short-term grudges will be a problem, given the length of time and the numerous safeguards against recaller abuse. No one takes that stuff seriously, it'll never go through. Frankly, after seeing in a couple of RfCs how quickly fellow admins leap to one another's defense unconditionally even when presented with at least well-thought out, not emotion-driven evidence, the probability that this will be a problem is hovering around zero. 3 admins, 27 users, and a supermajority vote is what they'd have to go through.

<p>What if you have a situation where a good sized group of admins and editors all come to the conclusion that "Admin X" is not fit to be an admin anymore, but the scale of evidence isn't something that ArbCom would act on--but they see a trend of let's say continued behavior for a hypothetical situation, based on which they would not have passed this person on the original RfA. What then? It's not the sort of thing that ArbCom would ever remove someone for, but based on their behavior they would in all likelihood have difficulty passing an RfA. What if these admins and editors feel this person based on their actions shouldn't have the tools? They just have to sit on it? Live with it, because they made the decision once to empower this person and now their behavior is completely different than previously? That is what it boils down to. ArbCom will nuke me as a rougue admin if I directly abuse the tools, but that is not the only reason for removing someone. As for the police comment above--does the community decide who is a police officer in their community? Actually, yes, they do. They fund them, they finance them, and there are grievance processes. In any community which was not corrupt in it's support of it's officers, if 31 people were to sign an affadavit expressing extreme concern about the actions of a given officer, WITH recorded evidence of the officer's actions, you can bet your butt that same officer would be hauled in front of a review committee of some sort. That's the problem. The community gets to install admins but then that's it. The man or woman they install a year later, two years later, might not be anything of what they DID approve, and the community and their admin peers need a way to rectify that.</p>

<dd>Nothing in this policy requires evidence of abuse, nor is any provision made for dismissing frivolous petitions.

<dd>Actually, the filing clearly has an EVIDENCE section in it. And based on the merits of that, the certification either happens or it doesn't. If it doesn't, Recall closed, see you later.

<p>I'd guess that 99.9% of admins would have NOTHING to worry about with this, and those that work well with their peers (admin or editor) have nothing to worry about. I strongly suspect any disagreement with this proposed process by admins in this talk page--with the exception of Sam's erudite opinions which are based on possible problems for admins who handle one specific subset or two of work--are unfounded and based on a belief that admins will be targetted for removal for being unpopular. THIS IS NOT A PERSONAL attack, but some of the most vociferous anti-recall voices here, Sam excluded, from my tenure here on Wikipedia I see generally getting into the nastiest scraps with their peers over a variety of issues. I think anyone viewing this except objectively does the project a disservice.

<dd>No, the point is to give admins and their peers a form of oversight over each other without having to wait for ArbCom to decide whether or not to take action. ArbCom covers in theory 'anything', this is specifically "part 2" of the RfA. Basically, the point is that if someone presents evidence that someone is not a good admin/fit to admin, the community decides (certification) if that evidence and cause is worthwhile. If the community and the admin's peers agree, then it moves to a long RfA to allow the community to weigh all the evidence and evaluate it. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/o/User_talk%7ERootology_22b0.html" title="User talk:Rootology">T</a>) 18:30, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Karwynn's comment</span></h2>
<p>This proposal is pretty analogous to the part of the blocking policy that deals with editors who have "exhausted the community's patience" and can be banned indefinitely without going to ArbCom. If someone expressed opposition to that, think about it: you don't have to answer here, but what would you honestly think? Probably that the person who did so was a troll who wanted less accountability for himself. So you'll forgive me if I too suspect a little baseless worry. I am <b>NOT</b> saying admins who oppose this are beligerent admins or anything of the sort, just that you seem to be, like rootology said, the ones most often in conflict (nothing inherently wrong with that), and it would seem as though you are pushing <b>against</b> administrator accountability. Wikipedia is built up on accountability to the community. The contributions of all editors and the history of all modifications to any page, even in wiki-central namespaces like Wikpedia: and Template:, etc., are available for anyone to view. Proposal is written, actively edited, and enforced by editors, mostly non-admin editors (who "enforce" policy by reporting vandalism, trolling etc.). COntent disputes in articles, the central units of WIkipedia as an encyclopedia, are decided by a group consensus. Normal editors are subject to a community agreement to remove their editor status (by banning them). Is there any reason why administrators <b>should not</b> be subjected to a similar process? The policy seems to me very thorough in guarding against trolling, puppetting, and pettiness. Look at the requirements in the number and status of editors for certification - no way a sockpuppeteer is going to achieve that, nor will a group of 25+ like-minded trolls get that many edits without being banned AND manage to convince 3 administrators to support them. Admins are notified 24 hours in advance, and so cannot be "ambushed" with this. I can see no room for gaming or manipulation here - if you see ways this can be taken advantage of, please <b>name them</b>. 'll ask this again because I am really eager for an answer: Is there any reason why administrators <b>should not</b> be subjected to a community evaluation process?

I don't think 25 admins or long term editors should be able to use this to gang up on someone. So I'm just proposing that a good idea is a requirement on evidence. A lot of the criticism on message boards found with a simple googling isn't a big incident, but small stuff. Just as an example, it would be always assuming bad faith. If an admin always assumes bad faith about people, well it's bad. So why not put into the requirements that a page of evidence needs to be up. It would be a certain required number of evidence of breaking policy, even WP:BITE before this can start. The important thing is, even newbies should be able to provide on one of these, even if they don't meet the criteria to vote. The evidence needs to be able to hang around--staying up forever--until enough gets gathered and someone should review it as enough solid proof before the 25 can vote. Let's say maybe there's 100 evidence of things like assuming bad faith, personal attacks, WP:BITE, etc. before anyone can do that vote.

<dd>Do you mean a numerical value? I.e., admin has to have x number of policy violations as a condition of filing? There's already an evidence section by the way that has to be completed for filing (really, this is just a VERY streamlined combination of RfC, RFA, and an ArbCom type filing). <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/o/User_talk%7ERootology_22b0.html" title="User talk:Rootology">T</a>) 15:15, 14 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This seems like an opening of the floodgates of wikilawyering. The current proposal leaves little or nothing to interpretation. With this addition, there will be little discussion on the merits of the admin and much bickering about what counts as evidence and what doesn't, what is a legitimate policy violation, and it will all spiral, as all things critical of admins seem to do, into a contest to see who can find the meanest way of calling the other side a pack of trolls. I think this is a bad idea. If there is no credible evidence of abuse, it will be very difficult to find people to certify, and even harder to find enough people to get a 60-70% consensus to desysop. In short, meritless recalls will speak for themselves and fail, protecting the "targetted" admin for 9 months in the process. Am I overlooking any of your concerns, Anomo? I just want to make sure I'm not missing anything you're saying. Karwynn <a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKarwynn_869e.html" title="User talk:Karwynn">(talk)</a> 15:29, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>What Karwynn said. I really tried hard to make this idea of a system 1) as simple as possible; 2) as user-friendly as possible--it's literally just a few steps from end to end, but each step is increasingly difficult to get passage through; 3) as hard to abuse as possible. The initial version was any 25 users plus certifiers, with 3 months/300 edits each. Now its 1 file, 30 users (3 of them admins), with 10 months/2000 edits each. Basically, if you're here 10 months and have 2000 edits odds are you know a thing or ten about wikipedia, and the requirements as laid out make ambush recalls impossible--admin HAS to be notified. He doesn't have to accept or confirm, or he'd just never do that. Then he gets a WEEK to address whether or not there should be a recall RfA. Then he gets THREE weeks in the current revision to display and explain why he should remain, during RfA.

<p>Another proposed amendment: all of the bad stuff brought up about the admin in the recall reasoning would have to be from the past month. This is to prevent people from trolling through years worth of admin contributions and cherry-picking out all of the "bad". Also, this means that if someone sees a serious admin infringement they will need to get on it right away; if they actually bother to wait more than a month they're either trying to manipulate something or they didn't think it was that important, it which case it shouldn't be eligible for a recall. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><span style="color:#ff66ff;"><b>Cyde Weys</b></span></a> 20:15, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

No one should be Recalled for a crap action say in 2005, since they may have been ace since then. Perhaps a modification of: 1 filer, 30 certifiers, 10 of which are admins. Basis of dispute/reason for recall is based on actions in past 90 days (based on diffs/actions). Evidence section may include previous diffs/history to establish patterns, behavior, etc. Keep the nine month time limitation. If someone really, really pushes the admin envelope beyond that, especially after being perhaps unsuccessfully recalled, you can bet then that someone WILL haul them up before ArbCom. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/o/User_talk%7ERootology_22b0.html" title="User talk:Rootology">T</a>) 20:28, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

I think that admin accountability is rather important, and I think that admins should be respectful, but I don't think that recall is the right way to encourage respect/civility by admins. If recall is formulated to address anything beyond specific actions that obviously hurt the encyclopedia, then recall would encourage admins to think about politics on a day-to-day basis, and that wouldn't really be productive for the encyclopedia (janitors should spend their time doing janitorial work, not trying to look good). --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 03:46, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I.e., say you (hypothetically) did something vile and probably worthy of Recall x days, weeks, months, or years ago. What if the policy specifically said under Limitations "Diffs as evidence for basis of dispute must be dated after 10/01/06, the date this policy became effective.

<p>I don't think Recall will work because it will be repealed at the Foundation level. As soon as this goes through you just <i>know</i> someone is going to file it on Tony Sidaway or Kelly Martin or one of the other "cabalists". They may have a warped perception in the community, but there's so much work they do behind the scenes to help the Foundation it's ridiculous. I think, from that point of view, the recall thing would be a failure. There's too much going on that people <i>don't</i> know about and they wouldn't be able to accurately judge whether someone is actually a good admin or not.

<dd>...and you've just revealed a major component of the problem. That "some" admins are "better" than others, at least in the perceptions of the Cabal. I was practically waiting for someone to say such a thing, and your response of this nature to my suggestion of basically giving every admin a free pass vs. the idea of Recall against any past activity is telling--I raised the ante in a fashion of which the policy will basically only apply to anything you do against policy <i>going forward</i>, and your response in turn is that "Oh, Jimbo will crush this, my friends are too special." Thanks for not helping too terribly much, and cementing many people's perceptions that certain admins would never do anything to put their lifetime appointments in the hands of "lessers". <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/o/User_talk%7ERootology_22b0.html" title="User talk:Rootology">T</a>) 22:20, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Cyde, look at how many people vote in RfAs. Several have never interacted much with the candidate, but support anyway. If a ridiculous Recall is filed, <i>will it not be voted down?</i> Getting through 5 admins and 25 other certifiers and then getting a supermajority is not going to be an easy process. People will leap to the defense of TOny, Kelly or many other respected admins. This is not a "only trolls can vote" thing - everyone will have their input. As far as your general attitude, I think rootology is right, you seem to be opposed not to this process, but to greater accountability for administrators.

<dd>Let me get this straight: over 50% of the "voters" would need to vote "I do not support this user as an admin".

<dd>No, it's spefically an 80%+ concensus. I.e., out of 100 "votes", on the Recall itself, a desysop will not happen unless its 80-20-x or higher. No ifs, ands, or buts. It's not meant to be easy to unseat an admin by any means under this policy, and the certification is totally seperate from the RfA by design, to insulate admins from bogus filings... which I keep going over again and again. So, basically, if all 31 certifiers vote "Recall", all that has to happen to squash the whole thing is 20+ people to vote "keep", over the course of TWENTY ONE days. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/o/User_talk%7ERootology_22b0.html" title="User talk:Rootology">T</a>) 23:05, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't want to call it this, because that's the height of Bad Faith, but my suggestion of effectively giving what some might call "Amnesty" for previous actions as the initial basis of dispute/Recall, plus the time limitations, plus either 5 or more admins signing on to certify the Recall, is basically the height of fair play--to be honest, based on ALL of these conditions, an admin would have a better chance with a Recall RfA than they would dealing with ArbCom if they actually did something wrong. Literally, the whole point is to just give users/editors/admins the ability to undo with cause an RfA they feel should not be appropriate anymore. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/o/User_talk%7ERootology_22b0.html" title="User talk:Rootology">T</a>) 23:31, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just thought up the ultimate in fairness. There's a sort of requirement like 2000 edits and 10 months for people to file this and these numbers will probably change. Maybe the statute of limitations could match the edit requirement. 10 months and 2000 edits would mean the previous 10 months or 2000 edits (whichever is greater) are however far the statute of limitations extends. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnomo_6299.html" title="User:Anomo">Anomo</a> 07:10, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>A limitation on the frequency of filing these and a different limitation on how recent the misbehaviour can be don't go well together. Otherwise surviving a recall becomes a free pass for a period of time. If both limits are to be present, they should be the same - so only for behavior since the last recall discussion would be a reasonable limit. Frankly though, such a statute of limitation is unneeded rules expansion.

<p>Well, first let's get it accepted, then worry about the details. But (aside from 30 certifiers being maybe a bit high), the ten admins requirement is a red flag. Naturally admins watch each other's backs, that's only human nature. Plus obviously it's not in the interest of any admin to certify. Have you never heard of <a href="../../../o/m/e/Omerta.html" title="Omerta">Omerta</a> or the Blue Wall. They exist for a reason: mutual self-protection. Besides that, admins are a social group, always chattering away on their private IRC channel and what have you. You certify, you're going to be running into the guy at the next admin cookout or whatever. No, if you must keep raising the bar, how about X number of certifiers must have some given higher edit count/longer service than a regular certifier.

<p>I do like the idea of admin endorsers--it keeps the idiot ones out of the way. But I think ten is too high, and three too low. Five is better.

I.e., if 5 decide/agree on a resolution to somehting on AN or ANI, it will likely stand forever. 5?

<dd>This starts to differentiate admins as a special class, instead of trusting and empowering the community as a whole. I very much doubt that any recall would find 30 users of good standing (a key qualification in this proposal) in 7 days so easily were it not merited. Just because someone has been blocked does not mean they would wish an admin de-sysopped, if they felt general respect for that admin. Besides which, the final result is dependent on the whole community anyway.

<dd>Aaron is correct, of course. And the only reason they would be on the chopping block is for annoying certain groups of people, which I don't consider a powerful argument for desysopping. All admin decisions are reversible and it takes a hell of a lot of effort to actually be a bad admin. {{<a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_substitution_a63d.html" title="Wikipedia:Template substitution">subst</a><tt>:</tt>/And}} --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 23:51, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If the goal is to have admins held accountable to community support, why not just throw out the lifetime appointment thing, and just repeat the RfAs once a year, or maybe on a reduced schedule over time (after 1 year, then 2 years later, then 4, etc.). At least this would be a more "neutral" approach, since good admins would be able to use the opportunity to recieve much-deserved <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/wikilove" class="extiw" title="m:wikilove">wikilove</a> without asking for it (and hence looking desparate), and bad admins could recieve a well-deserved slapping around without some poor schmo having to open an enormously complicated recall request.</p>
<p>What bothers me about this is that it seems to assume bad faith on ArbCom's part, and no matter how many safegaurds you might add by manipulating numbers and voting rules, these recalls are always going to be proposed in the heat of anger... and sometimes an admin is going to make 30 (or 50, or 1,000) wikipedians angry by doing what they're supposed to do as an admin. A user who's having troubles with an admin need only follow the steps in <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">WP:DR</a>. If virtual handshakes can't be virtually exchanged by the time it gets to ArbCom, at least the user will have had time to cool his or her head, get the arguments together, and present the case without using too many exclamation points (implied or otherwise). --<a href="../../../s/b/_/User%7ESB_Johnny_4962.html" title="User:SB Johnny"><font color="green"><b>SB_Johnny</b></font></a> | <sup><a href="../../../s/b/_/User_talk%7ESB_Johnny_91f0.html" title="User talk:SB Johnny"><font color="green">talk</font></a></sup> 23:43, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's got nothing to do with lack of faith in ArbCom, and I went out of the way to NOT make it sound like that--it's literally to give people the ability to fairly undo a previous RfA if the community feels such an action is warranted. As much as your "rolling and extending" votes sound wonderful, based on responses here (and from previously reviewing the annual call of a different method for the community to "undo" adminship if warranted) I highly doubt the admin body politic will ever come together to agree on anything but ArbCom actually "taking" someone's tools away. I'm not saying that's a bad thing; my goal here was to find a way for the community and admins to police themselves effectively and fairly. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/o/User_talk%7ERootology_22b0.html" title="User talk:Rootology">T</a>) 23:57, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem I'm beginning to suspect is that the majority of users for whatever reason are unwilling to put a reverse RfA in the hands of the community--which is odd, as they have no problem with RfA itself as it is, and has been for years. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/o/User_talk%7ERootology_22b0.html" title="User talk:Rootology">T</a>) 00:10, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Not odd at all. When you block people for violations they get upset, even when they clearly violated policies. Enforce policy enough and you will have your own hate fan club. Recall smothers the ability of admins to do the work they need to do, even though the people who brak policy don't like it. I'm sorry, but the reverse RFA is already in the hands of the representatives of the community, arbcom. There is no need to let the angry mob of people you blocked decide your fate. If there was so much admin abuse going on, arbcom would have removed a lot more people by now. But they haven't. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 00:25, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>(<i>Striking part of my previous comment</i>) I think the RfA is in the hands of the community because that's just the easiest way to do it. If the Foundation people had to go looking at every user's contributions to see who would be a good candidate for unpaid work, they'd have no time for anything else. Wikimedia has never been a democracy, and probably won't be in the forseeable future. It uses democratic devices, and has an egalitarian mission, but it's not <i>really</i> a democracy. Even ArbCom is trumpable by Jimbo, and I'm pretty sure this policy could never have teeth unless Jimbo were to declare: "Let it be toothy!" --<a href="../../../s/b/_/User%7ESB_Johnny_4962.html" title="User:SB Johnny"><font color="green"><b>SB_Johnny</b></font></a> | <sup><a href="../../../s/b/_/User_talk%7ESB_Johnny_91f0.html" title="User talk:SB Johnny"><font color="green">talk</font></a></sup> 00:39, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As an aside, I find the idea of administrative terms lengths a lot less problematic than introducing a recall system simply because it does seem rather more fair, less bureaucratic, and because it simultaneously reduces the aura of elitism that is the biggest perceptual problem with the current admin system. I think the problem is the difference between explicit, quantifiable violation of specific policies, and a more general lack of respect and regard for non-administrators that skirts the boundaries of policy. Upon appointment, it's expected that administrators will reflect the most trusted members of the Wikipedia community, but there is absolutely nothing in place to ensure that they continue to do so. ArbCom works perfectly well in dealing with concrete violations of established policy, but to suggest that all problems concerning administrators can be boiled down to such relatively clear-cut situations smacks of the sort of bureaucracy that we frown upon. It's not about democracy, or egalitarism, or any other kind of ideology you'd care to name: it's about ensuring that the collaboration that makes Wikipedia work isn't buried under the weight of mutually exclusive cliques and suspicion between self-imposed castes of users. Not that I have an easy solution to the problem, mind you, but I've seen enough that I cannot doubt that the problem exists. – <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeancdaug_9c50.html" title="User:Seancdaug">Sean Daugherty</a> <small><a href="../../../s/e/a/User_talk%7ESeancdaug_ad69.html" title="User talk:Seancdaug">(talk)</a></small> 04:52, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that something needs to be done; it's ironic to me that I never found myself questioning the judgement of the community or any administrators <i>until I became an admin myself.</i> Personally, I think that this proposal would be hard to be gamed as others fear (I have just read this whole talk page) and I don't really think a lynch mob or the had-a-bad-day-editor is a serious threat -- if you are an experienced contributor, as this calls for, it would be nigh impossible to get 25-30 such editors to agree to "indict" an admin unless there is something seriously wrong.

<dd>If the latter, then what we're really talking about here is a method for petitioning Jimbo or another foundation member, right? If that's the case, then why not scrap all the "CREEPy" rules, and just set up a template and a vote counting technique (the number of votes and/or the number of days that the Admin Recall Petition (ARP) stays open before it's considered submissible should do the trick).

<dd>My personal view is that the 80 percent threshold is very high, and necessarily high, to prevent abusive attempts at removing admins on popularity grounds - and I honestly don't think that, in practice, it would ever be reachable except in cases of egregious admin abuse. But in such cases, I think the ArbCom would act far faster to stop those abuses. Thus, this proposal is, IMO, unnecessary. However, I think something like this might improve the perception of adminstrators and remove an excuse to hate the evil rouge admin cabal. Of course, the problem is that given the high threshold, it would be just as easy to say "this is just a whitewash, it's still impossible to remove the cabal." Damned if you do, damned if you don't? I also believe any adminship review process should be required to cite specific alleged policy violations - not just "I think this admin is doing a poor job," but "This admin uses his blocking tool abusively here [1] and here [2]." <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 09:11, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Problems with this.</span></h2>
<p>While I like the idea of having a way to remove problem administrators, keeping adminship shouldn't be a popularity contest. As an alternative, I think we should base the removal of sysop rights on clear evidence that sysop powers were severely and or repeatedly abused - in other words, without someone breaching our trust, we have no basis to rescend it.</p>
<p>This shouldn't be a form of community punishment for admins that are disliked, so disputes that aren't accompanied by real abuse would need to continue to go through dispute resolution. I don't support any process that leaves desysopping to the opinion of lynchmobs. - <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETriona_934d.html" title="User:Triona">Stephanie Daugherty (Triona)</a> - <a href="../../../t/r/i/User_talk%7ETriona_5b3e.html" title="User talk:Triona">Talk</a> - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Triona&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Triona&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">Comment</a> - 13:54, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The thing is, we <i>do</i> have a process for removal of sysop rights based on clear evidence that sysop powers were severely and/or repeatedly abused. It's called ArbCom. If it's not working, than it makes far more sense to fix it than to circumvent it by adding another layer of bureaucracy. On the other hand, ArbCom can, and should, deal in absolutes. Obvious, quanitifiable abuses, like wheel warring, for example. But that's really not the only form of administrative abuse. Continuous incivility towards fellow editors, abusiveness, and controversial actions that may not violate the precise letter of Wikipedia policy and practice can be equally damaging to the collaborative spirit of the project. Administrators are supposed to be "known and trusted members of the community." There should be a mechanism for dealing with administrators who have repeatedly violated that trust. ArbCom cannot make that kind of judgment: only the community itself can. Ideally, this process should supplement ArbCom, not replace it: the difference between a <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recall_election.html" title="Recall election">recall election</a> and <a href="../../../i/m/p/Impeachment.html" title="Impeachment">impeachment</a>, if you must draw the inevitable political comparision.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Concerns over "lynchmobs" are a red herring. As Karwynn says, the duration of the process would smooth over any hasty, kneejerk reactions to beneficial but controversial actions, the kind which Mr. Weys (and others) have raised legitimate concerns over. Any complaints which persist, pretty much by their nature, are not the complaints of a lynchmob, but those of a segment of the community with a serious issue over the way a particular administrator has wielded his or her sysop powers. The outlined process is no more succeptable to a lynchmob problem than any other form of consensus gathering on Wikipedia: it <i>could</i> happen, but it's not particularly likely. This isn't my favored solution, mind you: I'd prefer a term limit system that applied to all administrators equally. But the system proposed here is better than what we're currently stuck with, which fuels accusations of elitism and cabalism against all administrators and damages the working environment of the project. – <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeancdaug_9c50.html" title="User:Seancdaug">Sean Daugherty</a> <small><a href="../../../s/e/a/User_talk%7ESeancdaug_ad69.html" title="User talk:Seancdaug">(talk)</a></small> 15:02, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd like to suggest a lightweight process for desysopping. An editor presents an application to the arbitration committee for an arbitrator to undergo a deselection process. If four arbitrators support the application this is taken to an RFA-like process that runs for a period to be determined, with a quota to be determined. A bureaucrat exercising his usual discretion then decides whether the candidate is to be desysopped, and a steward performs the desysopping if necessary.</dd>

Typically the arbitration committee will either pass or reject an application inside seven days (often much less). Requiring arbitrator input at an early stage is a good quality control system. The community would still have input, and the bureaucrats would still exercise such discretion as they have. This would address concerns in many old hands, such as myself, that this process would seriously degrade the scope of action of administrators, while ensuring that the community has the option to reappraise adminships. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 22:16, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Utterly pointless</span></h2>
<p>This is simply a troll incitement. There will be lots of attempts to recall unpopular admins - and good ones will have to defend themselves against trolls. But, no-one will be desysopped by the process. So the net result is lots of noise and disruption, but no admins removed.</p>
<p>Why do I say that? Well, I've no doubt that it will be possible to get 30 names to trigger the process in a few cases. But it will be impossible to get the required 80% consensus to desysop thereafter, unless the desysopping is so obviously merited - that arbcom would have done it without a though anyway. I suppose some people are supporting this because they think they can use it to bring folk like Cyde or Kelly Martin to book. Well, news for you, it won't work. Admins who are acting in good faith, even if in unpopular ways, will always manage to get at least 20% of the community to support them. As I say, lots of disruption, noise and discussion will result from this..... but nothing at all will be gained. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> 13:57, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not assuming anything. I said 'some people'.

<dd>The support of your peers in all things is paramount. We have community bans for when a group of admins agree that an editor no longer has anything to contribute to Wikipedia, which is basically set in stone. This is a similar to that in a regard and a natural extension of RfA. The community and it's peers giveth a few extra buttons, and the community haveth the right to review (which is all the process really enables) whether you should continue to have the problem. Part of the issue also is that adminship is "no big deal", but it is perceived to be this Holy Grail of status. It's not and shouldn't be perceived as such. It's simply the community thinking that person x is worthy for a time to be able to keep tabs on other users--if a supermajority of users decides that is no longer the case, why should it continue to be? <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/o/User_talk%7ERootology_22b0.html" title="User talk:Rootology">T</a>) 14:49, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No, with discussion going on with regard to administrator action, there will be all sorts of branches of trolling. Prima makes a comment. Secunda deems Prima to be a troll, and thoughtlessly removes their comment. Prima puts it back, saying not to remove comments. Secunda removes it again, turns whatever heading they're in into a discussion about Prima being a troll. Whatever "side" is in agreement with Secunda begins cheerleading the removal and jeering at Prima. Surprise! You've just created a new problem. WIth a number system, this will still happen, but Prima's votes will still count. See, that's the thing: trolling doesn't always come from the least respected editors.

I want to see bad admins desysopped perhaps more than many others in this discussion, but since I've seen this happen at arbitration I need to know what's broken about the current system that needs to be fixed. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 15:50, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hi Tony. The ONE thing that a community process would seem to have an advantage over ArbCom is that (if I understand correctly) ArbCom requires all previous steps to be exhausted (RFC, DR, etc) before they will hear a case, and that all steps must apply to the same behavior/instance; thus they rarely if ever deal with chronic cases, rather than acute ones - is that a fair summary from your POV as a clerk? If so, I could see some advantage to a system that somehow managed to thread the needle between being trollbait, and ArbComm (yes, I just made that up). -- <i><a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae</a>'<a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">blis</a></i> 16:13, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If someone's conduct as an administrator is so appalling that he simply must be desysopped in short order, it's quite common for a steward to perform the desysopping pre-emptively--this takes a few minutes or a few hours at most. If the case is misuse of sysop privileges or other cases of unfitness to use the sysop bit, historically the arbitration committee has not demanded prior dispute resolution--at least, not on the same issue. See for instance <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Cantus_vs._Guanaco_6063.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Cantus vs. Guanaco">Cantus vs. Guanaco</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Stevertigo_95d4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Stevertigo">Stevertigo</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Pedophilia_userbox_wheel_war_dc02.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Pedophilia userbox wheel war">Pedophilia userbox wheel war</a>, and <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Guanaco%2C_MarkSweep%2C_et_al_f294.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Guanaco, MarkSweep, et al">Guanaco, MarkSweep, et al</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On the facts, I don't see any reason to doubt the Arbitration Committee's competence and willingness to act in the case of unfitness to sysop. You don't see any chronic cases of bad sysopping going to arbitration precisely because the arbitration committee acts long before such cases have had a chance to develop. Abuse of the bit sticks out like a sore thumb and is such a blemish on Wikipedia that the current Arbitration Committee has typically dealt with such cases in a more timely fashion than other issues. The Pedophilia userbox case, for instance, took considerably less than a week from start to finish, and resulted in two desysoppings and sanctions against several other administrators. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 17:08, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>OK, so far I've been negative. Here is what I think could work - and might just get support.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> 16:07, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It is very simple:</p>
<p><b>New policy (or perhaps a restatement):</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Any administrator who is deemed to be damaging the project, or who has overwhelmingly lost the confidence of the community, may be desysopped.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Process:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>The initial step is a <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERfC_a13a.html" title="WP:RfC">request for comment</a> - to allow an attempt at solutions by community discussion.</li>
<li>If this is obviously failing to address the concerns, after 3 days, any administrator may initiate a 'recall petition' on the RfC.</li>
<li>Providing that this motion is supported by at least six other administrators, it may be refered to Arbcom.</li>
<li>Arbcom shall then consider whether an administrator: 1) still enjoys the confidence of the community, and 2) is still of net benefit to the project.</li>
<li>If Arbcom deems the administrator to fail one of these conditions, it may order the desysopping of the administrator, or impose other restrictions or remedies as it sees fit.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That could work quite nicely, but I'm wondering how the ArbCom would determine if the admin in question "still enjoys the confidence of the community"; the obvious methods—straw polls or re-RFAs—would bring us back to the original point, so presumably some other method would be adopted? <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 16:21, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>A quick look at the prior RfC, the talk page of the admin, and the numbers endorsing the recall petition should suffice. Polls are evil and often not reflective. Arbcom members are part of the community, so I guess they'll have a pretty good idea.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> 16:24, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's got some merit, although I'd like to hear from at least one ArbCom member about their viewpoint on workload vs. payoff for such a community-started system. I'm also leery of an "admin-only" step, but it's probably too tough to define a <i>single</i> member in good standing without making it trollbait. -- <i><a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae</a>'<a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">blis</a></i> 16:27, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>OK you've pointed out one case where an RfC was deleted. However, in this case the RfC apparently (according to the deletion reason) consisted of nothing but flames. Do you have any actual examples of non-frivolous, certified RfCs being deleted by an admin without consequence? If an RfC was part of this desysop process and a rogue admin deleted it, do you really think 1000 other admins would refuse to undelete the page?

The purpose of this policy idea is NOT any silly assumption that all admins are corrupt monsters--anything but, I think at least 99.9% of you wield a fair and generous mop. Like I've said throughout the idea is simply to empower the community directly in some fashion to very fairly undo what it no longer holds to be a meritous RfA. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/o/User_talk%7ERootology_22b0.html" title="User talk:Rootology">T</a>) 20:48, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are slightly less than 1000 admins. If you believe that "at least 99.9%" of admins are fair and generous, that leaves 1 (one) admin that might deserve to be desysoped.

<dd>No, what I mean is that I'm not trying to craft a policy to "get" admins.

<dd>The reason I took what you said literally was that it's important to perform a <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cost-benefit_analysis.html" title="Cost-benefit analysis">cost-benefit analysis</a> when undertaking such a proposal. In this case, the cost includes the misuse of the process by trolls, ill will caused by recalls and all the bureaucracy involved. The benefit is having an additional mechanism (besides ArbCom) to remove an admin. If there were dozens of rogue admins that weren't being dealt with by the ArbCom, the benefit would be fairly substantial. However, if only .1% of admins deserve to be recalled, the benefit is essentially non-existent. Processes on Wikipedia are designed to address a problem and thus far it hasn't been shown that there's a problem to address. No problem to solve means no benefit. As long as the cost outweighs the benefit, this proposal isn't going to fly. <a href="../../../a/r/e/User%7EAren%27t_I_Obscure__6bd1.html" title="User:Aren't I Obscure?">Aren't I Obscure?</a> 22:02, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So do what's best for trolls: ignore them. A filing needs 30 certifiers, 3 admins. That's 30 trolls, 3 of whom would have to be admins. Ignore trolling recalls completely and they won't get certified, and away they'll go. THere are all sorts of systems for trolls to use - RfA, AfD, RfC, etc. - but s the answer to close them all down and live in constant fear of trolling? Just ignore them and they'll go away.

So yes, theoretically a bunch of people could put you through the whole recall mess because they don't like the fact that you are enforcing policy. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 02:00, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What part of "dispute" requires that a policy have been violated? There are lots of people who would "dispute" legitimate and necessary admin actions that in no way come anywhere close to violating any policy. "I dispute the fact that this admin deleted all the copyrighted, non-fair-use images I uploaded." No admin should have to go through such an ordeal unless there is actual suggestion that he or she has undertaken actions contrary to established policies. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 02:11, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Any active admin has violated a strict reading of policy a few times. Usually it's speedy deletion of material that doesn't meet a specific criteria but nonetheless doesn't have any place on an encyclopedia. The actual reason people are voting to recall doesn't need to bear any resemblance to the evidence given in the petition. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> 02:39, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I see it in the same way as sysop rights. A burocrat can add them, only a steward (a level higher) can remove them. Giving the rights is determined by the community, removing them by the ArbCom (a level higher). This is a simple principle of safety. The way forward is to find a earier way to deal with abusive admins, without a ful blown ArbCom case. -- <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimvdLinde_061a.html" title="User:KimvdLinde">Kim van der Linde</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/m/User_talk%7EKimvdLinde_a7d1.html" title="User talk:KimvdLinde">at venus</a></sup> 03:58, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Some principles</span></h2>
<p>These are the principles as I understand them. Keep in mind this is not stone-hard fact here. It's the principles this policy is bult on. This is really rootology's policy, so he's more correct about this than I am, but here goes:<br />
<small>Sections below moved out.</small><br /></p>
<p><a name="The_problems" id="The_problems"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">The problems</span></h3>
<ol>
<li><b>SOME</b> administrators act abusively (per Wikipedia conduct policies), with no accountability (a central part to Wikipedia), and/or incompetently. The number/percentage is unspecified. THese behaviors are sometimes the pattern and not isolated cases.
<ol>
<li>Abusive conduct is detrimental to Wikipedia, per reasons outlined in conduct policy.</li>
<li>Lack of accountability is detrimental to Wikipedia - consensus and discussion facilitate rational thought and better decisions</li>
<li>Administrative incompetence - lack of knowledge of policy, or foolhardy actions using tools based on a lack of context about a situation or a lack of knowledge of all the circumstances, including rushed decisions - adversely affects blocks, deletions, and protections, inhibitting the ability of Wikipedians to build an encyclopedia.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Bad administrative actions, as defined above, causes the community to lose trust/faith/confidence in said administrator.</li>
<li>There is currently no system for the community to come together to desysop someone they have no confidence in. - Current dispute resolution steps are in the control of admins for blocks on participants, deletion, and protecton.
<ol>
<li>There is no current involuntary recall process</li>
<li>Filing an RfC will get it flooded by fellow admins, who in my experience generally proceed to throw trolling accusations around rather than listen to the discussion.</li>
<li>RfCs about admins can be speedy deleted on sight, even if they've run for days.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/delete&amp;page=Wikipedia:Requests%20for%20comment/MONGO%20(second%20RfC)" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/delete&amp;page=Wikipedia:Requests%20for%20comment/MONGO%20(second%20RfC)" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> There need not be discussion about this.
<ol>
<li>Asking for the deletion to be reviewed gets you branded a harasser.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>People who complain about admins may be subjected to accusations of harassment or trolling, and are ignored they ask how they are harassing/trolling.
<ol>
<li>As a result, civility, no-personal-attacks and respect are thrown out the window. Blocks may follow.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>There is a "community ban" for removing the status of "editor" (i. e., blocking) in <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBLOCK_89b0.html#Users_who_exhaust_the_community.27s_patience" title="WP:BLOCK">the blocking policy</a>, but no process for community removal of admin status</li>
<li>Arbitration fails to fully desysop poor admins (meaning it gets some, but not all)
<ol>
<li>ArbCom cases filed by less experienced users are less likely to be accepted</li>
<li>Previous discussion on desysopping is considered incivil and is subject to penalty in Arbitration.</li>
<li>"Failed" complainers are branded as trolls by administrators, decreasing the filing of potential cases.</li>
<li>There are only 6 arbiters - don't have the time</li>
<li>Arbitrators only desysop in cases of severe, severe abuse.</li>
<li>Arbitrators are not intended to gauge the community's view of the admin</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Result: If an admin is not trusted by the general community and only by his fellow admins (and sometimes not even then), he remains an admin, despite the fact that an RfA on his/her part would not succeed.</p>
<p><a name="The_solution_.28in_theory.29" id="The_solution_.28in_theory.29"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">The solution (in theory)</span></h3>
<ol>
<li>Provide a method of allowing a consensus decision to desysop based on lack of faith/trust/confidence in the competence/conduct. Assume good faith in predicting the motives of non-troll users.</li>
<li>Provide a system to weed out trolling or frivolous filing
<ol>
<li>A certain time period and number of edits are required to certify
<ol>
<li>"Survival" factor - many trolls permabanned before achieving required time/edits</li>
<li>Assumed greater knowledge of Wikipedia policies/guidelines</li>
<li>Assumned committed interest to improving Wikipedia</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Failed Recalls "protect" admin for 9 months
<ol>
<li>Makes filing in bad faith or for dumb reasons counter-productive for the filer</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Provide a system to weed out emotionally-charged filing
<ol>
<li>Needs 30 certifiers</li>
<li>Needs consensus
<ol>
<li>Unlikely for undeserved recalls, notices displayed at high-profile pages</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Takes a month to complete the process</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Provide greater accountability for administrators - based on the community's trust (this is both a solution and an advantage)
<ol>
<li>Assume that the community at large has decent judgement</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Result: Good-faith consensus-backed desysopping of administrator deemed to be in poor standing</p>
<p><a name="The_advantages" id="The_advantages"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">The advantages</span></h3>
<ol>
<li>Removal of poor sysops - less use of tools outside the scope of policy
<ol>
<li>Removal of abusive administrators
<ol>
<li>Less abusive blocking means more productive editors</li>
<li>Less abusive deletion means more legit content for Wikipedia and greater capacity for discussion in the Wikipedia: namespace</li>
<li>Less abusive protection means more productive editing/discussion</li>
<li>In general, this will mean less conflict on some scale</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Removal of incompetent administrators
<ol>
<li>Less poorly judged blocking, even when done in good faith, means more productive editors.</li>
<li>Less poorly judged deletion means more content for us</li>
<li>Less poorly judged protection (not a problem so much, but anyway) means more editing/discussion</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>More administrator accountability
<ol>
<li>More accountability does not mean stricter polcy/guidelines on use of tools</li>
<li>There is nothing wrong with an admin having second thought based on "Is this in line with Wikipedia polcy?"</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p><br />
Result: More expansion/improvement for Wikipedia</p>
<p><a name="What_this_policy_is_NOT" id="What_this_policy_is_NOT"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">What this policy is NOT</span></h3>
<ol>
<li>An excuse to desysop
<ol>
<li>Duh, voting procedure prevents undeserved desysopping</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>A reason to desysop based on an isolated action/ set of actions
<ol>
<li>If the admin doesn't show a pattern of the bad acts, it will get voted down</li>
<li>This is especially important in cases of perceived incompetence. One or two bad decisions is not enough - it needs to be a pattern to show a lack of improvement to the project</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>A discussion of <b>WHY</b> an admin should be desysopped
<ol>
<li>It's a discussion of <b>WHETHER</b> to desysop someone - meaning, there are no specific criteria AND there is ample chance to oppose the desysopping
<ol>
<li>In other words, it's not like initiating the process means a desysopping, it means it's going to be discussed.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Any disciplinary action beyond desysopping
<ol>
<li>In other words, even if desysopped for abuse, admins won't get blocked or whatever (leave that to ArbCom)</li>
<li>Again, this is especially the case for perceived incompetence - the admin may be acting in bad faith, even if his/her judgement is less than helpful</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>ANYTHING other than a process to improve Wikipedia and the means by which it is written - the recall process is not to be used if you just don't like someone.</li>
</ol>

<dd>The policy as drafted by me (2nd or 3rd draft in like 5 hours) required admin endorsement of the certification of the recall--the original was 25 "users" with 3 months/300 edits, then it was 30 with 5 months/1000 edits, then I settled on 30 with 10 months, 2000 edits, and 3+ admin certifiers of the 30 to eliminate stupid trolling. The nine month exemption was in it from draft 1. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/o/User_talk%7ERootology_22b0.html" title="User talk:Rootology">T</a>) 20:50, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think this is going to face an uphill battle, mostly because of the first section: Problems. I think you'll find many editors/admins who will disagree with it, and I'll post my own opinions here to give you an idea of why.</p>
<dl>
<dd>1.1. <i>Abusive conduct</i> I do not agree abusive conduct is, absolutely, harmful to the project. I believe upholding some of the core principles sometimes requires what is, essentially, abusive coduct towards elements which would challenge those principles.</dd>
<dd>1.2 <i>Lack of accountability</i> Between arbcom, Jimbo and the Foundation/Stewards, I do not agree there is a lack of accountability.</dd>
<dd>1.3 <i>Administrative incompetance</i> I agree this is a problem. As I feel accountability is adequate, I think the solution to this issue is to strengthen the RfA process.</dd>
<dd>2. <i>Bad administrative actions</i> This may be true, but I don't feel it's helpful. Unpopular decisions can well have the same effect. And with the number of active editors, there's usually a good number of people who find any action unpopular.</dd>
</dl>
<p>3.1. <i>No involuntary recall process</i> Again, I feel arbcom fills this role. 3.2. <i>RFCs</i> while part of this dispute resolution process, should not be considered part of the admin recall process. 3.2 - 3.6 show a lack of faith in the current system. I doubt anyone could say anything to restore someone's faith, and for this I'm sorry. Even if you manage a consensus on these points, though, I don't think the solution is another layer of policy &amp; process. If the current system is as flawed as you say, adding to it will only increase the flaws as the new policies and processes are "exploited."</p>
<p>Instead, as I said, I'd hope to see existing process refined and fixed, starting with RfA. If arbcom is too small to handle its workload, maybe it can be expanded or divided into an ArbCom for admin disputes, an Arbcom for policy disputes, an Arbcom for content disputes, etc., etc. This proposal, I fear, has little change of life because I feel there will be very many editors and admins who will concur on some if not all of my points in some way or another. --<a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkSplotch_5c7c.html" title="User:InkSplotch">InkSplotch</a> 21:14, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Notice: <b>WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE COMMUNITY, NOT INDIVIDUALS.</b> That means that saying "well, any good admin action is going to be unpopular among some people" is a waste of time because all that matters is the popularity to the COMMUNITY. Additionally, this is not about popularity, but about confidence in the admin's enhancement of Wikipedia's quality.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I agree about RFA, I think people ought to tighten up their RfA standards. And that doens't mean bump up the required edit count, it means saying "Is this guy really exceptional or just another experienced editor?" Additionally, I find it disturbing that you feel that breaking policy is not disruptive/detrimental to WIkipedia (since the principles I put up define abuse as deliberately breaking policy). Three questions: do you mean ANY editor breaking policy is not detrimental, or just admins are not detrimental when they break policy? Second question: Would you support, then, removal of the parts of the policies and guidelines that state that adherence to that particular is beneficial to WIkipedia? And third: Are you saying you don't think that abusive or incompetent decisions made by admins don't cause the community to lose faith here?</dd>
<dd>Also, I want to clarify: THis is not saying ArbCom don't have good judgement, only that they don't always get to everything because not everything is filed, for the reasons stated in the principles. It's not so much a lack of faith in the committee, more in the system.

<dd>I appreciate you're focused more on the community than individuals, but then, how do you tell? We have an extremely large community, but not that many vocal members the Wikipedia space. So I see people try to draw a line, 10, 20, 30, people to certify...maybe admins too...I just don't believe there's a realistic number of editors you can find to make this process reliable enough. I think RfA is flawed enough, and I'm much more concerned about a process to <i>remove</i> admins making mistakes than the existing process to promote admins making mistakes.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>To address your questions, and I apologize if the answers aren't as direct as you expect. (1) I don't believe all policies are created equal, or that all are meant to be enforced equally. So if some are broken in the enforcement of others, I'm OK with it. I look at the end results. (2) Not necessarily, although I do feel certain policies might benefit from updates or clarifications. Alas, I'm not able to provide you a list :) (3) No, I'm saying I think proper and competent decisions can cause the community to lose faith simply because they may or may not be understood properly. I don't think admins need the faith of the community to do their jobs. Be elected, yes, but once there they're called on to do some very unpopular, often contentious jobs. I have faith in our current resolution process (Foundation, Stewards and ArbCom) to watch out for the abusive ones. I think the incompetent ones are harder to spot, just because incompetent doesn't always lead to abusive actions, which is why I feel efforts are better spent on RfA.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think the faith of the community is better placed in themselves to make a better encyclopedia. Focus on that, and while conflicts <i>will</i> arise, conflicts will be quickly resolved and the project will get better faster. --<a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkSplotch_5c7c.html" title="User:InkSplotch">InkSplotch</a> 22:05, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Respectfully, I don't agree. I've gotten crap from admins when I'm (in intention, at least) NPOV-izing articles and upholding other policies like verifiability, original research etc, or by supporting the keeping of encyclopedic articles that are not to an admin's liking. If I disagree, I'm threatened with blocks and such. It's dangerous to dismiss any inter-editor conflicts as unproductive. But then, how is it decided whose edits stay and whose go? Essentially, by saying I'm to avoid all conflict with administrators, you're saying (or implying) that the non-admin side of a conflict (me) is the wrong side. And once we all accept that, the encyclopedia will benefit. So why not just cut the uselessness then and eliminate all non-admin users? I know that's not what you're suggesting, but that's where (I think) that line of logic takes someone. Point is, it's not always productive to ignore conflict - conflict is inherent to cooperation on some level, and to let a bad edit or something bigger, like the blocking of several productive editors, slide is not productive.

<dd>Actually, I don't mean to suggest the editor is automatically wrong versus an admin. Just ask yourself, are your actions more or less disruptive than the harm to core principles like verifiability, neutrality, etc. you're trying to prevent? Is it an immediate need? Take it to AN/I, and realize you might ultimatly be wrong. And I mean wrong, which could result in blocks, bans, permanent community bans, or other restrictions. You might learn from this and go on, or the encyclopedia could lose an editor. On the other hand, you could be right, other admins might support you, and you gain respect as someone beneficial to the project. Any damage to the project gets fixed quickly, thanks to the exposure. It may sound callous, and I apologize if it does, but ultimatly Wikipedia gains from it all. How much you gain, is in how you conduct yourself. --<a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkSplotch_5c7c.html" title="User:InkSplotch">InkSplotch</a> 22:40, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
