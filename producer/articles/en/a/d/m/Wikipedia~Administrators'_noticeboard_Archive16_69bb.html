His home page screams "problem user" to me, and I've already had one other user complain to me about him. It looks like his main (sole?) agenda here is to attack Catalan nationalism.

<p>... it appears that over-zealous admin action is not just an en thing. I had a Korean friend translate a short amount of text for <a href="http://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipality_of_Strathfield" class="external text" title="http://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipality_of_Strathfield" rel="nofollow">the Korean version of the Municipality of Strathfield</a>, however it was deleted (with no explanation) by <a href="http://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EC%82%AC%EC%9A%A9%EC%9E%90:%EC%B5%9C%EB%8B%B4%EB%8B%B4" class="external text" title="http://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EC%82%AC%EC%9A%A9%EC%9E%90:%EC%B5%9C%EB%8B%B4%EB%8B%B4" rel="nofollow">ko:사용자:최담담</a>. Same with <a href="http://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strathfield" class="external text" title="http://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strathfield" rel="nofollow">ko:Strathfield</a>. Doesn't bode well for the project (it's hard to find Korean natives who are willing to translate for you!). Considering that Strathfield has one of the largest populations of Koreans in Australia, I would have thought that it would be appropriate to have an article on the Korean wiki (South Koreans would find it useful when visiting Australia). Can anyone advise on the best way of dealing with this issue, or at least find out why it got deleted? - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 00:48, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's more important than policy, it's common sense&#160;:) - NPOV tag is saying "there is a problem with this article because X". Without X it's essentially a null statement. (After all, someone could easily tag an article on the basis that they think it leans too much towards one POV, then someone might try to fix the flagged undefined problem by making it lean more towards the opposite POV.) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> (<a href="../../../r/d/2/User_talk%7ERd232_56da.html" title="User talk:Rd232">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Rd232_a3d1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Rd232">contribs</a>) 00:58, 23 October 2005 (UTC).</small>

<dd>It seemed pretty obvious from the start that BigDaddy was supposed to be a strawman, so much so that he was probably a strawman of a strawman, ie, being himself, but exagerated, so it would look like it was a liberal pretending to be a republican.. <i>yes my head hurts too</i>.. but frankly whatever he was, BigDaddy was far too big an asshole to be any of these people. The question is of course, since qwerty was already blocked from editing, no matter who/what it was, for obvious reasons, then why would said person try to evade a block, yet draw so much attention to themselves? why virtually copy a pre-ban talk page, user name, even signature?? not to mention, this whole time, AOL anons seems to have been running around marking just about everyone involved in this whole deal.. last time I checked, only admins could see the ip of registered users, so how did some 2 or 3 post aol anon manage to pinpoint every single one of them?

<li>No, we do not per se. But your question reminds me of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Supreme_Court_e75f.html" title="United States Supreme Court">United States Supreme Court</a> case <a href="../../../f/e/i/Feist_Publications_v._Rural_Telephone_Service_8511.html" title="Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service">Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service</a>. After Feist copied information from Rural's telephone listings to include in its own, the court ruled that there was no copyright infringement; "information" is not copyrightable but "collections" of information can be. So applying that ruling to your question, merely copying and pasting credit listings from IMDB would probably be no different. After all, IMDB is also essentially merely copying and pasting the data from the movie studios' publications and press releases. But then again, I am not an expert in copyright law. <a href="../../../z/z/y/User%7EZzyzx11_e7c4.html" title="User:Zzyzx11">Zzyzx11</a> <a href="../../../z/z/y/User_talk%7EZzyzx11_0d23.html" title="User talk:Zzyzx11">(Talk)</a> 21:11, 26 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Oh, I think I misunderstood your original question. If an article just merely has a "data dump" of credit listings without asserting any sort of context in a lead section, it qualifies for speedy deletion (of course I and many others would prefer that it should immediately be converted to a reasonable film-stub instead of being deleted right away). <a href="../../../z/z/y/User%7EZzyzx11_e7c4.html" title="User:Zzyzx11">Zzyzx11</a> <a href="../../../z/z/y/User_talk%7EZzyzx11_0d23.html" title="User talk:Zzyzx11">(Talk)</a> 21:13, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>However, you also have watch if the "Plot Outline" and the "User Comments" from the IMDB pages are copied and pasted too.

<p>AFAIK, there is no "autoban" on AOL proxies; in fact, the <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">blocking policy</a> makes it quite clear that blocks on AOL IPs are to be kept very short in order to prevent this kind of collateral damage. If you know of specific IP addresses that have been blocked for a longer-than-reasonable amount of time, list them here and they will get our utmost attention. Keep in mind that Wikipedia is not responsible for AOL's... <i>unique</i> proxy scheme, nor is it responsible for the vandalism by AOL users that causes the IPs to get blocked in the first place. <i><b><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a></b></i><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="green">ndroid</font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="purple">79</font></a> 23:43, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes, that's exacly the same person. What is the policy on checkuser, and how do we request it? We could let this user merrily keep on editting WP, ignoring the blocks.

Anyway, the issue of dispute here is due to the blanking of the detailed classification of the Urdu Language by <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJusticeLaw_a1ea.html" title="User:JusticeLaw">JusticeLaw</a> (<a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJusticeLaw_3e45.html" title="User talk:JusticeLaw">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JusticeLaw_eaf5.html" title="Special:Contributions/JusticeLaw">contribs</a>). He consistently blanks the details (Indo-European-&gt;Indo-Iranian-&gt;Indo-Aryan-&gt;Western Hindi languages-&gt;Hindustani-&gt;Urdu) to (Indo-European-&gt;Indo-Iranian-&gt;Indo-Aryan). The detailed classification is taken from the widely used <a href="http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=urd" class="external text" title="http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=urd" rel="nofollow">Ethnologue</a> language reference site, and pointed out in the <a href="../../../u/r/d/Urdu.html" title="Urdu">Urdu</a> language page. For the record, my only "Active" participation in editing the page is to revert blanking and adding the Ethnologue link to the classification.</dd>

<p>When it was originally added, it was argued that this was implicit in the terms of <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyrights_92c4.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyrights">Wikipedia:Copyrights</a> which says:</p>

<p>Regardless of whether or not it is a good idea (or even generally enforced), removing the clause that requires images to be licensed under the GFDL is a fairly substantial change, which didn't even provoke comment during <a href="../../../u/p/l/MediaWiki_talk%7EUploadtext_901b.html#Drastic_cut_proposed" title="MediaWiki talk:Uploadtext">discussion of the revisions</a>.

<p>I have posted a warning on the talk pages of these two anonymous users that if he (or they) do not confirm within 24 hours that they are not a bot (and are thus listening) that I will block. If they don't, I will block for 24 hours and we'll see if some program owner notices. Edits are not too terribly destructive, but it does sometimes look like changes are being made based on out of date copies of the pages. In any case, if these are bots, they need to be approved. <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_fd71.html" title="Wikipedia:Bots">Wikipedia:Bots</a> states that sysops should block unapproved bots without hesitation. <a href="../../../j/d/a/User%7EJdavidb_f8c2.html" title="User:Jdavidb">Jdavidb</a> [[<a href="../../../j/d/a/User_talk%7EJdavidb_d285.html" title="User talk:Jdavidb">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jdavidb_e085.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jdavidb">contribs</a>]] 20:41, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Nobody's been very forthcoming in guidance, here; I blocked 71.112.115.22 24 hours and left another note on his talk page that he could let me know there if he's a human rather than a script. Meanwhile 131.107.0.80 has been making some humanlike edits at the moment, so I've done nothing.</p>
<p>Hopefully this will prompt somebody to notice and either begin answering when people question their edits or else bring their bot(s) up for discussion and approval before further activity occurs. <a href="../../../j/d/a/User%7EJdavidb_f8c2.html" title="User:Jdavidb">Jdavidb</a> [[<a href="../../../j/d/a/User_talk%7EJdavidb_d285.html" title="User talk:Jdavidb">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jdavidb_e085.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jdavidb">contribs</a>]] 00:36, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>That block hit <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">User:Jmabel</a> as collateral damage, so I've unblocked. The IP belongs to Microsoft and is probably being used by several users. It's possible the messages left for our date-article-editing user/bot have never been seen by him but instead by other users at Microsoft. I think rolling back these changes might be a better way to get the guy's attention. <a href="../../../j/d/a/User%7EJdavidb_f8c2.html" title="User:Jdavidb">Jdavidb</a> (<a href="../../../j/d/a/User_talk%7EJdavidb_d285.html" title="User talk:Jdavidb">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jdavidb_e085.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jdavidb">contribs</a>) 18:15, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Bleh. Even with scripted rollback (and knowing for sure that every edit is bad), I don't think any human can compete with the bot for speed. --<a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 18:27, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One could write a bot then, although I don't know if my skills are up for that or if it would be approved. The main purpose would be to disrupt the edits enough that the person starts poking around trying to find out what happens and finally communicates with us, so we can get answers to questions like, "Are you running a bot? Will you stop doing destructive things like delinking some dates and removing information from date articles? Will you start using edit summaries? Will you please <i>communicate</i> with us rather than ignoring us so we can address any issues caused by your edits?" I don't think one would have to perfectly roll back all of the edits to achieve that, so a competing bot would probably be unnecessary.</dd>

"Non-notable" and "weak internet presense" are certainly not blatant attacks on the company.

<dd>Not the first and not the last to be disappointed to find a V/AfD turn up in place of an article that was basically an ad for a nn-company.

<dd>Google is not the source of all knowledge. Show me the top shoe manufacturers in Zimbabwe. If someone knows, they'll create the article, people will VFD for no Google presenece, it'll be deleted.

Google Site Search for "Wilkins Media holdings" (presumably a holdings company for WMC) on wilkins-media.com doesn't even get 1 hit.

Google result priority does not correspond to accuracy, and improving Google's algorithms is what Google does as a business, and teaching people to interpret Google results is hardly within Wikipedia's scope. In any case, someone Googling someone before hiring them is not looking for their resume, they're looking for the <i>other</i> things about them on the Web, and if "some stranger on Wikipedia said they were a loser" is part of a hiring decision there's <i>nothing we can do</i> to fix the long series of misconceptions at work. Besides, that example is something that <i>has not happened</i>, and the thing that <i>has</i> happened was someone who lost while trying to game the system.

<p>Am very concerned about Bakewell Tart and Crusading Composer - both were involved in a bad faith nomination (overwhelmingly efeated) to get the Robert Steadman article deleted, both have continued (particulalry CC) to try to alter the article to show the subject in a negative light. COuld they be looked into? Are they the same person? Vhjh 08:59, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I welcome any enquiry. I reccommend that an aadministrator also looks very carefully at the creation entries to the Robert Steadman article: 19.06 217.42.67.174 creates the page and also adds Steadman's name to other sites. This continues until 09.07 when the editorial duties are taken over by Robeaston and Vjhj who also edit other pages either relating to Mr Steadman or adding his name. A series of other anonymous posters( 86.136.163.90, 86.133.71.137, 86.136.239.9, 86.136.167.52, 86.137.64.72, 86.136.235.69) then add further details to the article. What is noteworthy though is that each time the poster is only active for one day but in that time posts many edits to the steadman article and also Steadman related sites. One anonymous editor even finds the time to remove 'vandalism' from Vhjh's page. These editors claim that they have no relationship to each other or to Mr Steadman, but obviously there is some relationship. I am also skeptical that there are a series of people who have no realtionship to Mr Steadman but who have a detailed knowledge of his home town , university and personal life. I'm not claiming that they are ALL Mr Steadman but it wouldn't surprise me. I am also concerned that the various editors have the same style: call anyone who touches their site a bully or a stalker, whilst belittling THEM and constantly calling for administrators to ban them. Anyone who follows the links to the TES website will find that these are the very traits that the poster calling himnself Rob Steadman is accused of. I believe that this article should be re referred for deletion as a vanity article and the work of sock puppets. Mel Ettis claims that it was a bad faith nomination, but at least two administrators believed that there was enough reason for referring it. I was NOT involved in the original RfD, I was neutral until the editors above started abusing the page. It had been shortened (as recommended by an administrator) and was fine, however, when it attracted some positive responses the page was restored to it's full length. My take on it is that it is the work of mainly one person who reserves complete editorial control. When others added to it they asked for it to be protected, but when they realised that they could not have it permanently protected as a shrine, they preferred to have it deleted - especially as it had been recommended that it wasn't notable enough. To prevent vandalism, they then shortened the article, but once they started to get support they restored it with a vengeance. Why am I bothering to bang my head against a brick wall over this? It's not a vendetta, I just want the creator of this article to realise that it's not THEIR sole property. Once again, I have had a perfectly reasonable and accurate edit deleted for the sole reason that it portrays the subject in a bad light. If just cannot see how anyone else cannot see that this IS a real example of a classic vanity article -from the way it was created right up to the continuimg attempts to keep it free of anything that doesn't show the subject in the most postive light.Crusading composer 18:29, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>No Crusading composer it is a vendetta on your part and that of Bakewell Tart. Today you bagen a new section for REVIEWS and yet only put in one review which you only included the negative points. You have said some of your knowledge and interest comes from the TES messageboard? I wonder if you had any knowledge of earlier vandalism to the page which made reference to the TES messageboards? admin really need to look at the behaviour of this editor - they are fixated an they are out to get the subject of this article - to the point of asking for a second AfD a day after the first had been rejected because it was a bad faith nomination. <a href="../../../v/h/j/User%7EVhjh_9342.html" title="User:Vhjh">Vhjh</a> 19:08, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks Katefan - what is going on is that Crusading composer knows nothing about the subject and yet wants to make everything with a highly biased POV - all negative! It is a personal vendetta against the subject of the article - he has accused me of being Robert Steadman and has accused one of the admin (Mel Etitis) of not being neutral by removing an AfD because Mel and Steadman might have met at uni 20+ years ago. Crusading composer is a vandal with a grudge and some serious invetigation needs to go on about his behaviour. Last night a splattering of very minor edits to other subjects was the first postive thing Crusading composer has done on Wikipedia.CC is either an adult with a grudge or, more possibly, a school kid (as Mr. Steadman teaches). Really very pathetic behaviour. <a href="../../../v/h/j/User%7EVhjh_9342.html" title="User:Vhjh">Vhjh</a> 21:57, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>NO! What is going on here is that Vhjh is deliberately trying to wind me up. I have been invited to join in in redrafting the article. Vhjh is unhappy about that - I have as much right as anybody to edit that article as long as my edits are accurate. As far as being childish and holding a grudge: this person is obviously looking at my contributions and changing them for the sake of it. I am to assume that this person knows more about shield generators than myself and that they have some kind of right to decide what is relevant or not. Vhjh is also reverting my user page. This activity has only one purpose, to make me react so that he can point to my behaviour and say that my edits have no credibility. Make no mistake, vhjh is a very clever and manipulative person with an agenda to remove anyone who tries to 'play with his toys'.Crusading composer 22:19, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>It's unclear how the reconsecration of a church in Germany, or terrorist attacks in India, are of more international importance or interest than a nomination to the Supreme Court. Of the current pages, only the hurricane and the earthquake clearly meet this criterion. I can see why you would want a variety of regions of the world represented, but if this is the point it would be better to remove the oldest news item for the United States, about the supercomputer, and replace it with the newer one. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherparham_ee3b.html" title="User:Christopherparham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopherparham_f0e0.html" title="User talk:Christopherparham">(talk)</a> 18:55, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I don't see how we don't remove some older ones, even if it means replacing a United States story with a story about a different region of the world. And having 7 entries on (as I saw earlier today) is not the solution. I believe that Supreme Court nominations, confirmations, and deaths are all inherently notable, because United States laws affect other nations as well in the form of international, especially internet, commerce. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> <a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315">(talk)</a> 20:04, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I'm not from the United States, but considering the way the United States imposes itself on the rest of the world I'd say a nomination to the US Supreme Court is notable enough to be at the top of ITN. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheCoffee_bcb6.html" title="User:TheCoffee">Coffee</a> 16:29, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Deciding the balance between notability within a region and the number of regions mentioned isn't always easy. What I do on <a href="../../../t/r/a/Portal%7ETrains_Trains_news_1d82.html" title="Portal:Trains/Trains news">Portal:Trains/Trains news</a> (which is transcluded onto <a href="../../../t/r/a/Portal%7ETrains_b02e.html" title="Portal:Trains">Portal:Trains</a>) is list exactly the most recent six rail transport news items, regardless of the region, but try to stick to the more notable news events that occur. For example, right now I've got two US events, and one event each from India, Japan, China and Italy. I've had as many as four events from one country listed there before (there is an amazing amount of Indian rail news on Google News), but that's more the exception than the rule. My guideline for Trains news weighs notability more heavily than regionality, which means that some days will seem unbalanced toward a particular region. But if one region is producing more notable news than another, why not list them? The region balance will change as more news happens, especially with a strict number of events in the news section. <a href="../../../s/l/a/User%7ESlambo_7b8d.html" title="User:Slambo">slambo</a> 16:41, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Before it was deleted, this article was copied and pasted by an anonymous user to (bizarrely) <i>Wikibooks</i>. Naturally, the article has come up for deletion at Wikibooks. Several editors have expressed the desire to have the article transwikified to Wiktionary, for incorporation into various WikiSaurus articles, just as the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_names_for_the_human_penis_%282nd_nomination%29_5079.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of names for the human penis (2nd nomination)">list of slang terms for the human penis</a> has already been incorporated into <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/WikiSaurus:penis" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:WikiSaurus:penis">WikiSaurus:penis</a>. (Wiktionary is the logical place for slang word dictionary articles, and WikiSaurus is the logical place for lists of synonyms. There's no reason for either Wikibooks or Wikipedia to host slang dictionaries and thesauri.) Rather than transiwiki the copy, which was itself not a proper transwiki (the anonymous user did not include author information), I intend, if there are no objections, at some point within the next couple of days to transwiki the original, complete with its edit history. This will involve temporarily undeleting the original, so that <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G%27s_%27bot_00ba.html" title="User:Uncle G's 'bot">the 'bot</a> can access the wikitext and the edit history, and then re-deleting the article. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 20:31, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Is it possible to get that bot to reblock for say 3months - or to list the IP's for manual review? Indef blocks of IP's (other than open proxy) is crazy - but, if we simply unblock, we could be letting a lot of bad guys out of the phantom zone at once. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 22:43, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Editing Wikipedia is a privilege, not a right. I once banned an IP for 24 months for many many months of egregious vandalism. If that IP changes hands 18 months from now, the new owner can ask for a reprieve. However, yeah, the two blocked today should probably not be infinite. --<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolbez_ce9f.html" title="User:Golbez">Golbez</a> 22:57, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>2 years is a very long block. Probably too long in fact. But it's way shorter than infinite. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">(a tenth stroke)</a> 23:02, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can see no need for a block longer than a year - annually reblocking a recurrent vandal is not exactly ownerous for vandal-fighters.

<dd>Additionally, I find it difficult to believe that any vandal sits around waiting for two years just to get a chance to come back and make one edit before being blocked again.

<dd>You two think two years is too long, and you see no need for a block longer than a year? Maybe. But consider that the IP had just come off a three month block, which followed another three month block. Aquillion, if he's willing to wait 3 months each time, why should we wait as well? Strike now, while the iron is hot. We won't have to worry about him for 24 months, unless some admin undid the block without thinking. Will he be back in 24 months? Hopefully not. If not, then everyone wins. --<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolbez_ce9f.html" title="User:Golbez">Golbez</a> 18:37, 2 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>And PS, I noted the block both here and on AN/I, because it was such a radical move. I had originally made it indefinite, they convinced me that a year was better.

<p><b>Petición de ayuda</b></p>
<p>Saludos. Siento no poder expresarme con corrección en tu idioma, pero me dirigo a ti, porque no sé a quien recurrir y sé que dominas en gran medida el español. Soy un antiguo contribuyente de la Wikipedia en español, que hace alrededor de un año volvió a ella. Se encontró entonces con que la Wikipedia en español estaba dominada por administradores que violaban sistemáticamente las normas de wikipedia, como la de la neutralidad y la de no borrar informacion útil. Me he rebelado contra su censura, y he reivindicado el sentido original de las normas. Uno de mis contertulios en mi página de discusión y que ha renunciado a participar en la wikipedia hispana resume así la situación que se vive en la enciclopedia en español:</p>
<p><i>Una vez que me convertí en escritor y no sólo en lector comencé a descubrir la realidad que esconde este proyecto. Ediciones honestas que buscaban enseñar a quienes quisieran aprender fueron eliminadas inmediatamente. Mis intentos de diálogo se vieron contestados por insultos y acusaciones injustos y por la extendida costumbre de recuperar la versión "oficial", es decir, la de eliminar todo incluyendo la corrección de errores ortográficos. Sólo he sido capaz de conseguir algún avance tras interminables discusiones, mediante la búsqueda de docenas de referencias a revistas, periódicos o documentos oficiales capaces de demostrar la insensatez de las críticas absurdas que con frecuencia se hacen y, principalmente, recuperando una y otra vez los datos que se intentan ocultar. Es decir, la cantidad de esfuerzo que hay que hacer es inmensa.</i></p>
<p><i>El gran problema es que las causas de la situación son muy profundas. Por ejemplo, es verdad que hay artículos larguísimos que describen cómo aplicar la política de neutralidad pero no hay ningún sitio donde se establezca breve y claramente qué es lo que no se puede hacer. Así es absurdo que se permita eliminar una edición completamente recuperando la versión anterior sin dar ninguna explicación. Si yo añado algo como "el 12 de marzo Aznar dijo que se estaban siguiendo dos líneas de investigación" cualquiera lo eliminará inmediatamente sin dar ningún motivo. Si lo vuelves a añadir y preguntas en la página de discusión por qué lo han borrado, que lo que has escrito es verdad, que se miren los periódicos que tienen edición digital accesible de ese día y todo eso el resultado es que te lo vuelven a quitar. Y no puedes hacer nada salvo volver a recuperarlo hasta que tú o ellos se cansen. Y es absurdo que esto sea así, porque la política de no neutralidad se resume en dos puntos: sólo se pueden incluir (1) hechos objetivos o (2) teorías existentes descritas indicando que son teorías. Si alguien elimina una contribución que no es puro vandalismo debería justificar que lo ha hecho porque no es ni un hecho objetivo ni una teoría existente. Si no se está eliminando el esfuerzo de una persona que ha querido participar en la Wikipedia lo que desincentiva dicha participación cuando se debería fomentar ya que en realidad se trata de generar un enciclopedia seria.</i></p>
<p>Yo no quiero rendirme. Y no he dejado de debatir con esos administradores. En mi página personal, he escrito un ensayo donde denunció las practicas que se cometen en la wikipedia hispana. Lo puedes leer en [<a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usuario:Visitante" class="external autonumber" title="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usuario:Visitante" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>]</p>
<p>Temporalmente he conseguido algunas mejoras, consiguiendo, por ejemplo, que algunos usen la página de discusión antes de borrar lo que no les gusta o no concuerda con su ideas. Ayer estaba añadiendo información al artículo del 11-M y acababa de discutir con un administrador que quería borrar el artículo dedicado a Leonor de Borbón Ortiz, primogénita de los Príncipes de Asturias, Felipe de Borbón y Letizia Ortiz, y segunda en la línea sucesoria de la Corona española. Este administrador decía que en la wikipedia no debía haber artículos sobre la recién nacida (cuando otras wikipedias lo tienen). Puedes leerlo en <a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discusi%C3%B3n:Leonor_de_Borb%C3%B3n_Ortiz" class="external text" title="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discusi%C3%B3n:Leonor_de_Borb%C3%B3n_Ortiz" rel="nofollow">Discusión:Leonor de Borbón Ortiz</a>. Ahora no puedo escribir en la wikipedia hispana, porque otro administrador, llamado FAR, que se declara amigo del administrador con que discutía, me han bloqueado la IP, tachándome de vándalo. No me dejan ni el derecho a réplica. ¿Puedes ayudarme, por favor? ¿Con quién debo hablar para solucionar esta situación?</p>

<p><b>Petition for help</b></p>
<p>Greetings. I'm sorry that I cannot express myself correctly in your language, but I'm directing myself to you, because I don't know to whom to turn and I know that you have a general mastery of Spanish. I'm an old contributor to the Spanish Wikipedia, who has returned to it after about a year. I found then that the Spanish Wikipedia was dominated by administrators who systematically violated the norms of Wikipedia, such as neutrality and not erasing useful information. I rebelled against this <i>censura</i> [a word that can mean either "censorship" or "sharp criticism" - JM], and have attempted to reestablish the original sense of the norms. [I find this next sentence a bit confused, I believe the confusion is in the original. - JM] One of my <i>contertulios</i> [a word that does not translate easily: literally, someone who attends the same <i>tertulio</i>, figuratively a collaborator in an intellectual enterprise] [I think there is a missing phrase here, probably something like "left a message"] on my discussion page that he had renounced participating in the Spanish Wikipedia and summarized as follows the situation that exists in the Spanish Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once I became a writer and not just a reader I began to discover the reality that this project hides. Honest edits that seek to teach whomever wishes to learn were eliminated immediately. My intentions of dialogue were responded to with insults and unjust accusations and by the widespread custom of recovering the "oficial" version, that is to say, that of eliminating all including the correction of orthographicos errors. I have only been able to achieve some gain after interminable discussions, by means of searching for dozens of references to magazines, newspapers, or official documents capable of demonstthe the foolishness of the absurd criticisms that they often make and, principally, recovering one time or another the facts that they want to hide. That is to say, the amount of force I must bring to bear is immense.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The big problem is that the causes of the situation are very deep. For example, it's true that there are long articles that describe how to apply the policy of neutrality but there is no place where it is established briefly and clearly what it is that one is not allowed to do. In this manner, it is absurd that is is permissible to eliminate an edit completely, recovering the earlier version without giving any explanation. If I add something, whatever, like "On March 12 Aznar said that they were following two lines of investigaion", it will be eliminated immediately without anyone giving a reason. [I may not have fully understood this next sentence - JM] If you come to add it and ask on the dicussion page why it was erased, when what was written was true, that if one reads the newspapers that have accessible online editions for that day and all that, the result is that you come to the point of quitting. And you can't do anything except return to recover it until you or they get tired. And it's absurd that it is like this, because the non-neutrality policy [Huh? Presumably NPOV, but what he wrote definitely means <i>non</i>-neutrality] can be summed up in two points: one can only include (1) objective facts or (2) existing theories, described with an indication that the ary theories. If someone eliminates a contribution that is not pure vandalisme, they ought to justificar what they've done on the basis that it is not an objective fact or an existing theory. [I may be partly misunderstanding the next sentence, but believe I have the general sense correct. I'm guessing that there should have been a comma after "Si no", but possibly it has some other parse that I am missing - JM] If not, they are eliminateing the effort of a person who has wanted to participate in Wikipedia, which discourages participation when they ought to encourage it, given that in reality one is dealing with generating a serious encyclopedia.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I don't want to surrender. And I haven't ceased to debate with those administrators. On my personal page, I've written an essay that denounces the practices committed in the Spanish Wikipedia. You can read it at <a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usuario:Visitante" class="external autonumber" title="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usuario:Visitante" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>.</p>
<p>Temporarily, I've achieved some improvements, achieving, for example, that some use the discussion page before erasing what they don't like or that does not accord with their ideas. Yesterday I was adding information to the article 11-M (<a href="../../../1/1/_/11_March_2004_Madrid_train_bombings_1d6c.html" title="11 March 2004 Madrid train bombings">11 March 2004 Madrid train bombings</a>)and I had just argued with an administrator who erased the article dedicated to Leonor de Borbón Ortiz, primogenitor (first son) of the Prince and Princess de Asturias, Felipe de Borbón and Letizia Ortiz, and second in line of succession for the Spanish Crown. This administrator said that the Wikipedia oughtn't have articles about the recently born (when other Wikipedias have them). You can read it in <a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discusi%C3%B3n:Leonor_de_Borb%C3%B3n_Ortiz" class="external text" title="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discusi%C3%B3n:Leonor_de_Borb%C3%B3n_Ortiz" rel="nofollow">Discusión:Leonor de Borbón Ortiz</a>. Now I can't write in the Spanish Wikipedia, because of another administrayor, called FAR, who is a self-declared friend of the other administrator with whom I argued, has blocked my IP, accusing me of vandalism. They don't even give me the right of reply. Can you help me please? With whom do I have to speak to solve this situation?</p>

<li>This arbitration ruling should be enforced. The key point, though, is that the user must not revert any climate article more than once per 24 hour period. He appears to have done this a few times in the edits you list (such as the two Oct. 19 <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_opinion_on_climate_change.html" title="Scientific opinion on climate change">Scientific opinion on climate change</a> edits) but most of those edits seem to be permissible b/c he only did one revert per day. The problem with all of the edits, though, is that he didn't list why he did the revert on any of the articles' talk page. I will drop a line to him about posting on the talk page. I will also keep an eye on this and if I see him do more than 1 revert per day on any article I will treat it as a <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>.

<li>The above list are cases where the <i>required</i> Talk page was not updated or in a few cases the page is not obvious.

<p>I have not been posting to Wikipedia for very long, but I made a couple of edits to <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_Reconstructionism_88ad.html" title="Greek Reconstructionism">Greek Reconstructionism</a> correcting what I had reason to believe was a factual inaccuracy, and came back a month later to see that my edit had been attacked at length on the article's Talk page by this person who never seems to sign his/her posts and who had gone and somehow discovered my full name and apparently dug up every article I ever wrote to any Hellenic mailing list. This person is making all kinds of untrue statements about me, my group affiliations and my personal biases, and refuses to back up these statements with references or links. He/she keeps referring to past disputes I knew nothing about because they happened long before I was involved in the organizations in question. I have stated that I really don't care about the issue any more and they can edit the page to say whatever they want, but I really would like it if there were some way to remove all the references to my real name, permanently, because it makes me VERY uncomfortable to have my real name published on Wikipedia by someone who obviously thinks the very worst of me and will continue to make negative comments about me on the Talk page. I feel like I am being stalked, and I'm scared. Seriously, I edited like two lines of this article and I have already told the person that they should by all means fix it to say whatever they think is accurate, but they won't leave it (or me) alone!

<p>I haven't the time to dig into this right now, but it seems that if there's unwanted personal info on a talk page, deletion and selective undeletion of history is in order.

<p>Uh, it seems to me that D. Brandt's biggest complaint is that he does not want to show up in search engines - a privacy thing. Why don't you put together a page formatting template for cases like this which allows the sharing of own meta tags and robots.txt file which keeps google, msn and yahoo spiders, etc from indexing the page? In this way, you maintain fidelity to the wiki mission of information, but you don't create needless hassles for D.

<p>I've systematically blocked all of these sockpuppets up to the present time (to the best of my knowledge) and reverted all of their edits that I found. Including socks blocked by others, there are at least 120 or more. There's little doubt that this is the same person as <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraqi_insurgency.html" title="Iraqi insurgency">Iraqi insurgency</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sealand.html" title="Sealand">Sealand</a>, <a href="../../../%C3%BA/b/e/%C3%9Abeda.html" title="Úbeda">Úbeda</a>, believed by some to be Wik. He's using open proxies, which are troublesome to deal with.</p>
<p>At some point very soon (maybe yesterday), Wikipedia is going to need some actual real-live staff to manage the website properly... not just editing admins and operating system sysadmins, but "user relations" personnel. Wikipedia needs at least one full-time "vandal accountability" person who would spend all day every day blocking open proxies, tracing IPs, and filing ToS violation notices. The next fundraising drive needs to raise funds to hire such a person.</p>
<p>Nearly every online multi-player game out there has a sizeable full-time staff to ensure that gameplay runs smoothly and abuses are reined in, and that there's a level playing field that's fair for all. In a certain sense, Wikipedia is very much like an online multi-player game: we all log in and interact, engage in conflicts and resolve them. The difference is, the product of this gameplay isn't virtual castles and treasure, it's something that exists in the real world. However, no online multi-player game can thrive in the long run if only the players themselves try to ensure that it runs smoothly; all of them use behind-the-scenes staff.</p>
<p>Wikipedia will fail if that level playing field isn't maintained. If valuable contributors perceive that vandals and sockpuppets are running amok and unilaterally imposing their will, then they'll just walk away from Wikipedia. Many people take it for granted that Wikipedia is a success, but that's not yet true... it's still a work in progress, and history's final verdict could still be "it was a nice idea on paper, but it didn't work out". If the basic principles of NPOV, consensus, 3RR, dispute resolution, etc. etc. can't be maintained in the face of automated assaults then nothing else matters.</p>
<p>Sometimes, watching the escalating nonsense that we've been facing over the last few months, you feel like asking "who the hell is 'minding the store'?". Right now, the answer very often seems to be "nobody". Instead of losing focus with all sorts of side projects and "sister sites", it's increasingly urgent to shore up the security and integrity of the flagship project, which is by far the most important. I don't know if the powers that be realize what admins on the "front lines" are facing, if they're even aware that things seem to be worsening. As admins we need to have somebody else "minding the store" so we can get back to normal activities instead of all this firefighting. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 11:46, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Here's what happened to prompt my (three) most recent blocks. First, I blocked him, and another user and an IP, for a 3RR violation, which occured on many pages with upwards of 15+ reverts in all. This was so egregious, especially considering I gave him a warning <i>after</i> he broke the 3RR and he just attacked me on my talk page and continued to revet, that I gave him a 48 hour block. During the block, Boothy came back with a (proven) sockpuppet to continue reverting. I blocked the sock and reset the 48 hour block. He attacked me, and admins in general on his talk page. Then I got an abusive email, telling me I support vandalism, and frankly full of lies (saying I assisted the other party). Accordingly, after three incivil messages on both talk and email, I extended the 48 hour block to 72 hours. That's all I did, and I don't know enough about Boothy's background at the moment to speculate on whether a longer block is necessary. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 00:18, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Heh, there have been some times when there was no simple or severe vandalism involved where an indefinite block was so blatantly obvious, but Boothy443 is not a case. The arbcom takes weeks to do a case, and the same user can terrorize more people during this time, thus an editor like BigDaddy777 was among those non-vandalizers deserving of a common sense, regular admin unilatteral block. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedwolf24_a12e.html" title="User:Redwolf24"><font color="darkblue">R</font></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedwolf24_a12e.html" title="User:Redwolf24"><font color="darkblue">dwolf24</font></a> (<a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedwolf24_1e7b.html" title="User talk:Redwolf24">talk</a>) 00:36, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The indef block was what Jtkiefer thought was a good-faith and appropriate use of admin prerogative.

<dd>Whether or not it was done in good faith (I have no reason to think it was not), it was still highly inappropriate. I have never heard of a long-time user being blocked indefinitely for 3RR violations by unilateral admin action. (Actually, I've never heard of <i>anybody</i> being blocked indefinitely for 3RR violations). As an admin, it wouldn't even vaguely occur to me that this was a potentially appropriate use of my admin powers. The only times that indefinite blocks should be used are in cases of impersonation or otherwise inappropriate user names. I think it is arguable that this can be done for particularly persistent vandals, but beyond that, it is simply not a matter for the discretion of individual admins. In this case, it's simply indefensible, especially since the decision was not made in the heat of passion - Boothy was already blocked for 72 hours, so there was no urgency to the situation. Whatever the motives behind Jtkiefer's decision, the decision itself was so completely out of line that I can't but doubt whether Jtkiefer should be an admin at all. Good faith is completely irrelevant here. What this shows is a complete lack of judgment, and a lack of judgment of this sort is not something I'd want to see in an admin. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 16:54, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>Vandalism</i> is <i>not</i> what Boothy stands accused of.

None of these is vandalism - vandalism is just about the least constructive thing one can do on wikipedia, and everybody should be careful before carelessly calling behavior "vandalism" which clearly isn't. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 06:45, 7 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, if you look at the block log, you will see tht four of his six distinct blocks cited vandalism. I think this vandalism was probably more along the lines of a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>, than full-on maliciousness. But I'm worried about what has happened here. It would have been clear to me that an indefinite block was never going to stick. I thought (after such an exteme display of your opinion of him) that it would surely go to arbcom if the block didn't stick. What worries me here is that if no one who is so strongly condemning Boothy here feels comfortable enough to take him to ArbCom, then how did anyone feel comfortable enough to impose an indefinite or even month-long block of him. It looks rather hit-and-run. If he needs a ban, or other sanctions, it's what arbcom's for, after all. I'm not out to get him, but after this fiasco (and it was one, with no less than <i>seven</i> admins blocking or unblocking) I would be disappointed if <i>no one</i> opened a case. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 07:09, 7 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, you're right that in previous instances vandalism was cited. But it was not cited in this most recent case, which, itself, has only come several months after Boothy's last block. My mistake, but I still think we ought to be careful about using terms like vandalism. I completely agree with the rest of your post. I find the behavior of admins who are willing to impose unilateral indefinite or month-long blocks on users, but who are then not willing to take the time to lay out an arbcom case, to be quite disturbing. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 19:09, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree Boothy443 needed a block. However, Jtkiefer has <i>no</i> authority for an indefinite block. I consider it very important that admins feel bound to policy. This is the second time Jtkiefer has blatantly disregarded policy and acted as a law unto himself. We have an arbcom for a reason, and the only authority for indef blocks are the arbcom and Jimbo. I would even be uncomfortable with unilateral 1-month blocks issued by Jtkiefer, but at least this would be within policy. This should stop here. Imho, there is <i>no</i> reason Jtkiefer should not block for a shorter period first, say a couple of days, and come to this noticeboard for second opinions. I would strongly recommend a voluntary parole on Jtkiefer's part to act like this in the future: If you block someone for a week, you have a <i>week</i> to figure out whether the block should be extended. Why would you want to make that decision alone, in the heat of the moment? Jtkiefer is <i>not</i> under voluntary parole, but under <b>obligation</b> as per policy to issue no blocks longer than one month to established editors. I am not questioning his good faith. But it does appear that he has a distorted image of his task and his authority as an admin. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 13:57, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To a certain extent I do confer with others (mostly over IRC) as to whether block if I question the merits of a block, that being said I reject the concept of a parole for it especially since very few people ever feel uncomfortable with my blocks and if they ever due I am usually in favor of my block being shortened if I have blocked for an overly long period of time. <small><a href="../../../j/t/k/User%7EJtkiefer_5ea4.html" title="User:Jtkiefer"><font color="#FF9900">Jtkiefer</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../j/t/k/User_talk%7EJtkiefer_123b.html" title="User talk:Jtkiefer"><font color="#00A86B">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jtkiefer_1273.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jtkiefer"><font color="#FF0033">@</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jtkiefer_4fd4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jtkiefer"><font color="#0000FF">C</font></a></sup></small> ----- 00:00, 9 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It would be helpful if you could show some sign of understanding the general undercurrent of what people are trying to communicate here. You seem to be saying that it's okay to go too far with blocking, because another admin can come and correct your mistake later.

<dd>No, I didn't say that at all and I'm sorry if I was vague on that, I'm just saying that I think people are making too big of a deal of it since it's reversible and even if I do make an honest mistake I can easily undue it and several times have after discussing it with other editors who disagreed. I try not to block whenever possible, especially when I'm not entirely sure about the block, and even when necessary it's best when necessary to consult on any block that isn't say a small block for blatant vandalism or whatever. <small><a href="../../../j/t/k/User%7EJtkiefer_5ea4.html" title="User:Jtkiefer"><font color="#FF9900">Jtkiefer</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../j/t/k/User_talk%7EJtkiefer_123b.html" title="User talk:Jtkiefer"><font color="#00A86B">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jtkiefer_1273.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jtkiefer"><font color="#FF0033">@</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jtkiefer_4fd4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jtkiefer"><font color="#0000FF">C</font></a></sup></small> ----- 03:46, 9 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>In retrospect I made a mistake of not asking the views of a wider population on the Administrators Noticeboard or one of the other general policy pages on the wiki and the blocking policy goes beyond the particular block itself and why it was implemented. I still defend however that Boothy deserves an indefinite block but now realize that it should probably be done by the arbcom, though no case has been brought up against him yet. In response to the statements that this is not the first time that I have not exactly followed policies to the letter I don't know what to tell you, I am not a perfect editor nor am I a perfect administrator but every single time it has been me acting in good faith and if you really feel so strongly about it you should probably file a <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_dbd4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment">RFC</a>. <small><a href="../../../j/t/k/User%7EJtkiefer_5ea4.html" title="User:Jtkiefer"><font color="#FF9900">Jtkiefer</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../j/t/k/User_talk%7EJtkiefer_123b.html" title="User talk:Jtkiefer"><font color="#00A86B">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jtkiefer_1273.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jtkiefer"><font color="#FF0033">@</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jtkiefer_4fd4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jtkiefer"><font color="#0000FF">C</font></a></sup></small> ----- 05:07, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're probably right, but the effect is pretty much the same, and the damage has already been done.

<li>That's probably just intruction creep. Most people have lot of talk pages on their watch lists. So unless some effort was made to hide the spaminator's intent with misleading edit summaries, it just drives up participation all around. Rising tide lifts all boat's equally, etc. If thing <i>do</i> start to get out of hand as the result of some spamming, a simple note someplace public (like here) should be enough to cancel it out. Now I'm off to examine TfD...<br />

<p>I have noticed something worrisome: this vandal has used the same AOL IP address (152.163.100.200) as <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranda56_4537.html" title="User:Aranda56">User:Aranda56</a>. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=152.163.100.200" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=152.163.100.200" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>, and note the 18:17–18:29, 5 November 2005 edits are Aranda56 (confirmed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Curps&amp;diff=27468014&amp;oldid=27467100" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Curps&amp;diff=27468014&amp;oldid=27467100" rel="nofollow">here</a>), while the 22:00–22:07, 4 November 2005 edits are the vandal. Although many AOL users use the same proxy IP, this does suggest that the person involved could be someone geographically close to Aranda56, perhaps someone who knows who he is in real life.</p>
<p>Since the "Mexican G" vandal keeps making vague threats with his choice of username (<b>NOBODY MESSES WITH MEXICAN G"S</b> and <b>MEXICAN G"S IS MY NAME REMEMBER IT AS WATCH WHATS GOING HAPPEN</b> and <b>Lets play Attack Wikipedia Violently</b>) in addition to the garden variety abuse, this might be a case where AOL should be contacted sooner rather than later. And it should be someone fairly high up at Wikipedia... if ordinary users or ordinary admins contact them, we probably wouldn't get the time of day from their low-level customer support staff. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 02:02, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think any admin could contact, cause even though being an admin is no big deal here, it carries a lot of weight elsewhere. Also to Acetic Acid and everyone: Please never block an IP indefinitely unless it's an open proxy. 1) Collateral Damage if its not static, and 2) people change, and although you can block accounts indefinitely, if you block a static IP indefinitely the person can never return. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedwolf24_a12e.html" title="User:Redwolf24"><font color="darkblue">R</font></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedwolf24_a12e.html" title="User:Redwolf24"><font color="darkblue">dwolf24</font></a> (<a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedwolf24_1e7b.html" title="User talk:Redwolf24">talk</a>) 05:44, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please note, i have often found AOL Ips I use when editing via dial-up to be ones thst had been earlier used by various vandals or other users. In a number of cases, these seem to be users who are unlikely to be geographically close to me.

<p>I just got a email informing about this notice. All I know is that I am (not) that MotherF***er Mexican G and I think I may know what got this user severly mad in the first place. Just less than a week ago I reverted vandalism of Scott Keith by probaly the same user Mexican G say and soon after I got a harrasing email from that user saying that Im something bad is coming to happen and Scott Keith is coming for you in which I ignored. I dont know how CambridgeBayWeather and Titoxd got into this. Probaly blocking the user. Than I noticed the attack user names with me involed and this user name User:GOD BLESS SCOTT KEITH which attacked my user page than I knew that has something do to about me and I got severly streessed about that. Im contacting AOL right after this to try to put a permanent stop on that MF before it gets worse as I think i still got that email around and I belive they will act quickly cause of that. Anyways Im going to be in a very long Wikibreak and going to edit much less as Im getting my cast off from my broken leg tommorrow (which let me to wikipedia in the first place) and I could go out to friends house plus baseball practice starts soon so dont expect me around here --<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranda56_4537.html" title="User:Aranda56">JAranda</a> <i>| <a href="../../../a/r/a/User_talk%7EAranda56_692f.html" title="User talk:Aranda56">watz sup</a> 02:26, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</i></p>

In his user page, he spreads his propaganda and accused wikipedia of harboring 'anti-Americanism', and uses it to justify his actions. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fidel_Castro&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=27492944" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fidel_Castro&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=27492944" rel="nofollow">[18]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_the_United_States_%281945-1964%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=27493215" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_the_United_States_%281945-1964%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=27493215" rel="nofollow">[19]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cuba&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=27446139" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cuba&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=27446139" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>.</p>

<p>Background: some time ago, the president of <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nash_the_Slash_8601.html" title="Nash the Slash">Nash the Slash</a>'s fan club (user name <a href="../../../n/a/s/User%7ENashferatu_66ed.html" title="User:Nashferatu">Nashferatu</a>) began waging an edit war to impose his view that Wikipedia should conform to the artist's personal preference not to have his real name publicly disseminated on the web <i>even though the information already exists in the public domain</i>. Recently, he began demanding that if the name is not removed from the article, then the Wikipedia contributors involved in the dispute should also be required to publicly reveal our names in that discussion as well, even though we're not public figures with Wikipedia articles whose real names are already public knowledge listed in other encyclopedias.</p>
<p>Issue: the one user he has "outed" so far has requested that his name be removed from the talk page, and that Nashferatu be sanctioned or even banned as a result of this action. As I've been directly involved in the dispute, however, I don't feel it would be appropriate for me to take direct action in this matter.</p>
<p>Could one or more neutral administrators please review the discussion at <a href="../../../n/a/s/Talk%7ENash_the_Slash_b68b.html" title="Talk:Nash the Slash">Talk:Nash the Slash</a> and determine the appropriate course of action? (Note that while Nashferatu is registered under that user name, almost all of his recent edits have been made under anonymous IP numbers while he wasn't in fact logged in under his registered username. He did, however, sign them by typing his username manually.)</p>

<p>As a new user to wikipedia I find the vandalism procedures difficult to follow. I would paste the warnings to the vandals talk pages but don't even know here to find them or even if they exist. The page <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pete_Price_83f3.html" title="Pete Price">Pete Price</a> has been persistantly vandalised tonight by multiple users including changing hyperlinks to gay porn sites and rival forum sites and homophobic abuse. I would like to see the topic locked at rev 02:08, 9 November 2005 but the reporting system is very difficult to understand.</p>

<p>Would any other admin look into this page? I tried to arbitrate between two groups of very inflexible and often extremely vicious editors, and have given up. Each of the edit-warring group posts pages and pages of comments which often end up in rants. Since one of the parties involved claim I'm taking sides, it might be better that I keep off the page (the claim was:I'm taking sides because I removed a see also link to [[Talk:Acharya S]] from the main article space!!! That, after I explained the Manual of style!!!). Today, one edit-warring user posted <i>Administrators... where are you? 11/8/05 -el Lobo, It is amazing that you Wikipedians allow this disturbed individual to continue his unethical and obsessive rant. Nuke this page while Wiki still has any credibility</i>. So, it may be better if this article was looked into right away.
