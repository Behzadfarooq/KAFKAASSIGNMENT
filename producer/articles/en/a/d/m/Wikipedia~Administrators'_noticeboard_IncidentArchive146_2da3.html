<p><a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">User:Kappa</a> has been removing prods from hundreds of articles and giving no explanation, and making other changes that appears to be vandalism, I started reverting a few, and he just reverts back, I don;t have time for an edit war. He has had a number of previous warnings reagrding this. I reported him at [Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism]] - but removing prods may not be considered vandalism.

<dd>"Vandalism"? Yikes. It's only vandalism if it's made in a deliberate attempt to compromise the integrity of the encyclopedia. It's not at all clear that removing Prods is done with that intention, even if it's done repeatedly and without explanation. A contested Prod is a contested Prod, and goes to AfD or it stays. They're not made to be put back after removal. If you don't know why Kappa removed a Prod in a particular case, <i>asking</i> would be better than reverting. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 01:52, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It would really be nice if he (and anyone else) would give a coherent reason when de-prodding. Unless the nomination was truly bad... I've seen ones where the rational is just "notability" or "nn".

<dd>Well one example of a technical de-prodding was removing it from an article that had been listed as not being in English for 14 days, for some reason the page says they have to go to AfD to be deleted, not PROD, presumably Kappa was de-prodding for that technicality. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 02:04, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Any user is entitled to remove prod tags if they don't think the article should be deleted, <i>for whatever reason</i>, and doing so is certainly not vandalism. However it would be simple to give a reason in the edit summary, even if the reason is simply disagreeing with the opinion of the original tagger, and Kappa ought to do so, if only to avoid further confusion.</p>

<dd>Agreed. While an unexplained deprodding can make me pull my hair out, it doesn't matter. A deprod counts as an objection to an uncontested deletion.

<p>If Kappa is the one removing hundreds of tags, I think it should be him creating these AFD's not us. If he has a reason to believe it is notable, then fine.

<dd>Removing a prod is simply taking down the <a href="../../../s/w/o/Sword_of_Damocles_0f14.html" title="Sword of Damocles">Sword of Damocles</a> to allow a discussion about the article. No one need state a reason for removal, since "don't delete this without a debate" is obvious in the act of removal. Whether the editor wants to state an opinion, or simply wants a debate to take place is up to the individual editor. If in the process, he doesn't want the article deleted, then he simply doesn't bring it to AfD. Prod is a shortcut to deletion. Sometimes you get to take it, other times you're stuck taking the long way around.

<p>It seems like this is good material for an RFC, about how, when, and why to deprod; I think there's some reasonable displeasure with how Kappa goes about doing something unusual, which is somewhat overlapping with the usual someone-disagrees-with-me-argh displeasure.

If this proves to be a problem, we will likely create some rule to prevent it"</i>.</li>
<li>Now I would like to see some statistics on this before jumping to a conclusion, but <i>if</i> Kappa is deprodding lots of articles <i>and</i> those articles have a strong tendency of being deleted on AFD, <i>then</i> Kappa is creating lots of extra work for other people for no good reason, and he should stop that.

<li>A simple count shows that of Kappa's last 1000 edits to article space, 298 were deprods, or about 29%. This spans roughly the last two months. A quick glance over the deprods seems to indicate that nearly none of them made any changes to the article text; someone with a bot can make a more careful analysis if they want.</li>
<li>As corollary to what I said above, if Kappa is not deprodding all that many articles and/or those articles don't tend to get deleted on AFD, there wouldn't be much of a problem (and indeed, there doesn't seem to be much of a problem here). Judged by his talk page, certain users are nevertheless unhappy with Kappa's conduct; perhaps mediation may alleviate this. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 15:26, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Doc, the thing is that it makes it easier for editors using anti-vandal RC tools, who are warning editors on the fly. Some editors may not have the time or inclination or knowledge to check the history of the talk page for warnings, and this may create misconceptions for punitive action. If you weigh in the pros and cons, while removal of warnings may create some problems, keeping them there will facilitate transparency, and easily let people know about past activities of the user without going into the history/contribs. --<span class="user-sig user-Shreshth91">May the Force be with you! <a href="../../../s/h/r/User%7EShreshth91_b54e.html" title="User:Shreshth91">Shr</a><a href="../../../s/h/r/User%7EShreshth91_EA_5106.html" title="User:Shreshth91/EA"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../s/h/r/User_talk%7EShreshth91_b218.html" title="User talk:Shreshth91">shth91</a></span> 12:15, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Yes, someone nuked those things, but they're presently on DRV. The question is whether making the job slightly easier for recent change patrol warrants being incivil to newbies and revert warring to keep old warning templates on their talk page. I'm not accusing anyone in particular of either of this, but it has happened. Since blocks are not supposed to be punitive, neither should warnings supposed to be (semi-) permanent black marks. The idea that you may only 'archive' your talk page in a certain way would be instruction creep. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 12:38, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Shreshth91, forget what is 'easy' for you for a moment and focus on what you are <i>doing</i> here. User gets a warning. They read it and remove it because they don't like it. You then restore the warning. You've just edit warred. To re-insert something you know the user doesn't want to see. On <i>their</i> talk page. I'm sorry, but I can't see the benefits of 'easy' in not having to click on a 'history' link outweighing the 'bad' of actions which serve to greatly annoy users. Even when this is used 'correctly' (as opposed to all the times 'User A' puts a questionable or outright false warning on the page of 'User B' and then harasses them to keep it there) it is a net negative. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 12:50, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Whilst formally keeping within the terms of the article ban, the purpose of these edits is to remove direct links, replacing hem instead with links to a redirect.

<li><b>Comment</b> Could another admin perhaps comment on this?

<dd>I have blocked Fys for twenty-four hours for disruptive incivility and personal attacks.

<dl>
<dd>Frankly I think this situation sucks and Brownhairedgirl is not entirely free from responsibility. Fys' recent edits <i>are</i> related to the issue for which he was article-banned; the issue of naming/merging/splitting <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_George%27s_Hanover_Square_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_21f5.html" title="St George's Hanover Square (UK Parliament constituency)">St George's Hanover Square (UK Parliament constituency)</a> and <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westminster_St_George%27s_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_8489.html" title="Westminster St George's (UK Parliament constituency)">Westminster St George's (UK Parliament constituency)</a>. However, I'm not sure why changing the name in the MP's article is wrong. It seems common sense to me that in an article about an MP, his constituency should be called whatever it was <i>at the time the MP served</i>, even if the name was later changed, and irrespective of what the Wikipedia article is currently called—that's one reason we have redirects. (For example, <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dean_P._Taylor_fbd8.html" title="Dean P. Taylor">Dean P. Taylor</a> is listed as a congressman for New York's 29th, 33rd and 31st congressional districts, even though all those districts are now obsolete and their territory is part of the 27th.)</dd>
<dd>The issue for which Fys was originally blocked and article-banned was over how to deal with a district that either was renamed or altered so significantly that is should have a separate article. Listing MP's in their proper contemporaneous districts does not seem like a problem to me and Brownhairedgirl should not have reverted them (unless they were incorrect contemporaneous names).</dd>
<dd>I suppose if he apologized to Nick and calmed down, the civility block could be lifted early. I would not lift the article ban, but I would caution Brownhairedgirl not to revert Fys on other articles unless he makes factually incorrect edits. Listing MP's according to their contemporaneous districts is not necessarily a precursor to another edit war over the district's article. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 16:17, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Maybe it would be clearer, if I highlighted the changes in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lord_Algernon_Percy&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=86491990" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lord_Algernon_Percy&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=86491990" rel="nofollow">this diff</a> of Fys's edit to <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Algernon_Percy_e98c.html" title="Lord Algernon Percy">Lord Algernon Percy</a>:

</ul>
</dd>
<dd>As you will see, in each case the name of the constituency is displayed as "St George, Hanover Square" (Fys removed an '<i>s</i> suffix, not sure if that was correct).</dd>
<dd>The substance of the dispute is that Fys claims that Westminster St George's is so significantly changed from St George, Hanover Square that it should not be in the same article; no other editor agrees, but all have agreed that Fys might be right and have sked Fys for more evidence. In the meantime, the consenus is to treat the 1918 change as a renaming rather than a new constituency, and therefore to keep the two constituencies in one article.</dd>
<dd>The current effect of Fys' edits was to repkace a link to an article with a link to a redirect. What was the purpose of that, if not as precursor to a split? The constituency name was displayed correctly before and after.</dd>
<dd>I will as you ask desist from reverting further such changes, but it does seem to me to contrary to good practice to replace a direct piped link with a redirect. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 16:44, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, I see what he did, and your description is correct. I would hesitate to label it as intentional disruption; perhaps he plans to provide the necessary sources for his version and is getting ready.

<dd>There were originally two articles, but BrownHairedGirl merged them. Rather than characterising Fys as wanting to split the article into two, I think it would be more accurate to say that he wants to revert the merge.</dd>
<dd>In my view, two constituencies with different names and different boundaries are <i>prima facie</i> different constituencies, and should be considered so unless there is a compelling case to believe otherwise. One could make such a compelling case by going to the library and having a look at the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Representation_of_the_People_Act_1918_1572.html" title="Representation of the People Act 1918">Representation of the People Act 1918</a>, but (as usual on Wikipedia it would seem) people on both sides of the dispute would rather argue than do research.</dd>

<p><a href="../../../d/e/u/User%7EDeuterium_a36a.html" title="User:Deuterium">User:Deuterium</a>, an editor who was extremely combative and rude, and managed to get himself blocked quite a number of times in his brief editing career, has returned as <a href="../../../f/u/m/User%7EFuManChoo_0d4f.html" title="User:FuManChoo">User:FuManChoo</a>. His return became obvious when he began edit-warring over the exact same issues as before, and trolling the exact same editors he previously targetted. This is his second sockpuppet (his first was <a href="../../../a/n/e/User%7EANecessaryWeevil_700c.html" title="User:ANecessaryWeevil">User:ANecessaryWeevil</a>). Eventually he was caught, and, as with the previous sock, I blocked this one under this clause of <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Multiple accounts should not be used as a way of avoiding the scrutiny of your fellow editors by ensuring you leave no audit trail. Using sock puppet accounts to split your contributions history means that other editors can't detect patterns in your contributions. While it may be legitimate to do this from time to time (for example, by creating a special account to make edits that might serve to identify you in real life), it is a violation of this policy to create multiple accounts in order to confuse or deceive editors who may have a legitimate interest in tracking your contributions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then claimed he had lost the password to his original account, and wanted to be unblocked because he now "admitted" he was Deuterium. Well, actually, he demanded to be unblocked, many times, along with various other abusive statements. I offered to try to get him mailed a new password, but he insisted it had to be the new account, not the old one.</p>
<p>At this point, I'm thinking that not much good can come from this editor, and that a ban might be in order.

<dd>He seems to have a tendancy to see any disagreement with his own POV as a personal attack and/or vandalism. And he seems to have more than a few fringe beliefs.

<dd>I was just about to report him.

<p>What can be done about an anonymous Wikipedia user who keeps deleting the same section of an entry day after day and replacing it with text that contains original research with no cited sources?</p>
<p>I have started a discussion on the page the person keeps posting the article to and have encouraged the person to join in on the discussion, but he/she has not replied after an entire week of this. I have also left several messages on the person’s user talk page which have been ignored. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:69.111.57.183" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:69.111.57.183" rel="nofollow">See user talk</a></p>
<p>By consensus opinion with other Wikipedia editors working with me on this entry, I have reverted this article daily for the past three or four days running.</p>
<p>I have attempted to have the page placed in "semi-protection" status twice, but have had my requests denied because the person felt that what was taking place is an "editing war" and not vandalism. While that assessment may be correct, I am at a loss here as to how else one could describe what the person is doing.</p>
<p>And what would be the remedy for resolving an "editing war" when the person in question refuses to communicate?</p>
<p>Any suggestions? I’m new at editing here and have not had any luck finding anything that addresses this situation anyplace else.</p>

<dd>This is in fact a legitimate argument for semi-protecting an article, and Durova seems to have done so in response to your posting here. For your future reference, attempting to contact them via the article talk page and their was entirely appropriate (if apparently unsuccessful). That is the proper and encouraged method of attempting to resolve edit conflicts. If the other party doesn't respond, we we describe it with the term "Sterile edit war", where people make changes back and forth without discussing or posting to talk pages. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 03:59, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have encountered this new user. His/her username gives me some concern about his/her motives. I left a welcome, and suggested that s/he pick another username. I recommend <i>not</i> blocking per {{<a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUsernameBlocked_b445.html" title="Template:UsernameBlocked">UsernameBlocked</a>}}: if s/he <i>is</i> here to "test the Wiki" it will be much easier to manage if s/he edits using <i>this</i> username!

<p>I just received the following email:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Hello, I am emailing you just to mention something. My name is Daniel Rigby. I happen to be the topic of the article I mentioned in my subject (&lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Rigby" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Rigby" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Rigby</a>&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Rigby). I just want to mention a few things. I, along with Charles Phllips (bobsfoot, UNFONE, [and additional sock puppets he created following the format of UNF#]) work for the University of North Florida. I would prefer it if you would revert the topic link and the contents of the article to its state before Charles edited them. I can do the version myself, but I can’t change the topic I believe. I already reverted on of the topics Charles edited before (article on metrosexual, if you look in the history, you will notice the edits by bobsfoot [Charles] and the subsequent suspension of his account). You will also notice that the image used in the edit of metrosexual is the same image used in the topic he made about me under Daniel Rigby. The photo itself is a photo shopped image of Mark Smith, a third coworker of ours. Finally, you should be able match the ips of UNFONE to the same as those used by bobsfoot to edit the metrosexual entry (further proof the UNFONE account is a sock puppet) since Charles tends to use the same computer at work to vandalize wikipedia. Anyway, I usually don’t care enough to do anything about it, but I’d prefer an entirely bogus entry (Yes he made up everything in that article) with my name on it not stay on wikipedia. While Charles may not have much faith in wikipedia I do, and I would prefer it stay a good source of correct information (I use it all the time). Thanks for your time.</i></dd>

<p>Let me be clear: I'm not sure he requires a block <i>yet</i>, although I have made several attempts over the last few weeks to explain to this user how Wikipedia operates and how he is expected to participate. However, I'm hesitant to start with a long drawn-out RfC, mediation cabal, or ArbCom case because I think he honestly believes that he is following policy, and a short sharp shock to show him that what he is doing is indeed in violation of community norms may be sufficient to get him to change his ways. That said:</p>
<p>About a week ago, I accepted an AMA case between <a href="../../../y/a/j/User%7EYajaec_6740.html" title="User:Yajaec">User:Yajaec</a> and <a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolken_de_Fanel_8812.html" title="User:Folken de Fanel">User:Folken de Fanel</a>. The two users were involved in a content dispute regarding the <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Seiya_cadc.html" title="Saint Seiya">Saint Seiya</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/m/Gemini_Saga_b686.html" title="Gemini Saga">Gemini Saga</a> articles. As an advocae for Yajaec, I contacted Folken de Fanel and requested that, until a community consensus could be reached regarding their dispute, they both agree to stop editing the article. Yajaec had already agreed to do that (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAMA_Requests_for_Assistance%2FRequests%2FNovember_2006%2FYajaec&amp;diff=85492449&amp;oldid=85488787" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAMA_Requests_for_Assistance%2FRequests%2FNovember_2006%2FYajaec&amp;diff=85492449&amp;oldid=85488787" rel="nofollow">his agreement to do so</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gemini_Saga&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gemini_Saga&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">article history which shows that he abided by that</a>).</p>
<p>Folken de Fanel then proceeded to post on the Advocacy Case discussion area explaining his side of the story. He also made a comment ("Without these 2 elements, I won't let him edit." - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAMA_Requests_for_Assistance%2FRequests%2FNovember_2006%2FYajaec&amp;diff=85535104&amp;oldid=85501378" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAMA_Requests_for_Assistance%2FRequests%2FNovember_2006%2FYajaec&amp;diff=85535104&amp;oldid=85501378" rel="nofollow">diff showing comment</a>) which led me to be believe that he might be claiming ownership of the articles in question, in violation of <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>. He also accused Yajaec of "vandalism" for good-faith edits which Folken de Fanel believed to be containing false information.</p>
<p>After this, Yajaec, with my assistance, filed an RfC to request community input to solve the content dispute. Folken de Fanel claimed that it was "unnecessary", and asserted that he had proved his case and so there was no need to seek a consensus.</p>
<p>Over the next week, I posted a series of comments on <a href="../../../f/o/l/User_talk%7EFolken_de_Fanel_dd72.html#Your_dispute_over_Saint_Seiya" title="User talk:Folken de Fanel">Folken de Fanel's talk page</a> explaining to him how Wikipedia works, how disputes over content are resolved, and what is and is not "vandalism". I repeated this several times--and others have told me, informally, that I was clear and concise and correct in my points. Folken de Fanel, in his responses on <a href="../../../k/m/w/User_talk%7EKmweber_3bfd.html#dispute_over_Saint_Seiya" title="User talk:Kmweber">User talk:Kmweber#dispute over Saint Seiya</a> merely reiterated his initial position and continued to refer to Yajaec as a "POV-pushing vandal" despite his clear good-faith actions to resolve the dispute properly, with community consensus. In my final two comments on his talk pages, I cited the specific policies he was violating and asked him to please stop, and pointed out that he could be blocked if he persists--in his last message, in which he requested that I contact him no further concerning this matter (a request I intend to honor), in addition to repeating the same assertions he claimed that my warnings that he may be subject to a block constituted "threats" and "personal attacks".</p>
<p>Anyway, like I said above I'm not sure a block is in order--perhaps someone could do a better job than I in explaining his errors and misunderstandings to him; on the other hand, as he honestly believes that what he is doing is in accord with Wikipedia policies and community norms, perhaps a "short sharp shock" will show him that he is not more than any argument could. <a href="../../../k/m/w/User%7EKmweber_6c59.html" title="User:Kmweber">Kurt Weber</a> 00:46, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>With that many block log entries... I think we can all agree he violated the rules numerous times.

<p>I would support a possible Arb, though I'd have to see the evidence to really see if it was possible. It's annoying how he comes along every few weeks to attempt to whitewash the Adolf Hitler article, then disappears with nary a word.

<li>I support an Arbcom.

I did not have time, energy and interest in reporting him so no further action were taken. I want to enjoy myself more while I am here. He also keeps watering down articles on Hitler and the Holocaust.

<dd>I there see votes by <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">User:Radiant!</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalsicol_c774.html" title="User:Calsicol">User:Calsicol</a> at 9:44 and 13:54 UTC.

<dd>"This is the third CFD in a few months to remove a women legislators in the UK category&#160;:( " - Just a guess, but that sounds to me like that could be considered consensus. And if we add in all the other gender-based discussions (such as the recent deletion of all the actress categories, and so on), it really would appear to be so. In any case, this discussion would appear to be better served on CfD. Though I am troubled by another case of BrownHairedGirl modifying a nomination to suit her preferences, rather than making suggestions and and attempting to discuss in order to come to consensus. See the "see also" below for what I'm referring to. - <a href="../../../j/c/3/User%7EJc37_cfd0.html" title="User:Jc37">jc37</a> 01:59, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(sigh)I should have written "the third CFD in a few months <i>seeking to</i> to remove a women legislators in the UK category". The fact that a few partisan males repeatedly push a contentious POV rejected by existing Wikipedia guidelines and by the cross-party consensus in Parliament itself is not evidence of a consensus on wikipedia: no CFD has been closed with a consensus to delete these categoris. -<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 11:54, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with the sentiment of that message, but I disagree that such a strong warning is warranted; calling someone "hypocritical" and "a shameless politician" is overly robust and incivil, but not in any way grounds for an indefinite block (as threatened) unless part of a pattern of abusive behaviour demonstrated repeatedly. (Note for the record that I am myself involved in a completely separate and unrelated discussion with BHG where her actions have been entirely reasonable and commendable, and which is not related to this CfD debate, in which I have no interest (and, in fairness, only an imperfect understanding)). It does very much strike me however that there are two sides to this particular story, and that some naughtyness may well have gone on on both sides. Fundamentally however, there is no excuse for incivility. That's my 2p. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 06:34, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. There is an AfD occurring for this article (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Hassan_Kamel_Al-Sabbah_f578.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Hassan Kamel Al-Sabbah">AfD/Hassan Kamel Al-Sabbah</a>).

Not only did I think this was inappropriate, but I did what we all should do, after restoring those contents I started improving the article and added many references/sources (in this case they are actual US Patents that the article was claiming the subject created). <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">User:Pmanderson</a> came back and deleted the vast majority of the article again, even with the new references/sources.

<p>I was going to report this as a 3RR violation, but this hasn't occurred within a 24 hour period.</p>
<p>Three times now, an anonymous IP based in Adelaide with the one ISP has attempted to - IMO - push a POV by placing the promotion EPW AKA NWA Pro above all the others, in an attempt to gain the websites listed publicity. I originally had it in order of size, but it was suggested to me that alphabetical order would be better. I certainly agree that it is the best order to give a neutral POV. But that wasn't enough for this person. The IP's are;</p>
<p>219.90.231.145 - 219.90.230.143 - 219.90.187.203</p>
<p>It is also possible that this person knows me and is trying to upset me. He isn't because I know the Wikipedia rules are on my side because this act is not only against the NPOV rules, but it also amounts to subtle advertising, which is also not permitted. I'm not keen on having to revert these actions without some back up to control this politically motivated individual. Adelaide is a hotbed for this sort of BS. <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurse_of_Fenric_f242.html" title="User:Curse of Fenric">Curse of Fenric</a> 09:47, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>(Edit conflict with Daniel). I apologize, InShanee, I didn't realize the Prod was new when I removed it, but I'm going to leave the prod off -- IMHO, the existence of the books is verifiable by the books themselves, or by WorldCat if you prefer a secondary source, and Google books returns enough hits to assure me of notability. If someone wanted to delete all the unverified info and stubbify (or, better yet, find an obituary and replace with verified info), that would be fine with me, but I don't think PROD is right.

Personally, I think he's a reincarnation of <a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECourtney_Akins_7935.html" title="User:Courtney Akins">User:Courtney_Akins</a>. But whoever he is, he's clearly a troll, taking the (long, slow) piss out of well-meaning editors. And what's with all his edits? He's edited his own talk page about 100 times in less than a week (half of which he was blocked for), and a couple of articles another 100 or so times. <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnchoress_3b7f.html" title="User:Anchoress">Anchoress</a> 03:39, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>He emailed me, too, very politely asking me to unblock him. He says that he wants to come back to Wikipedia and work for "consensus and sanity." I told him I'm not an admin, and that we get a lot of people who "reform" and then continue to wreak havoc. However, I also said that if he's really serious about becoming a positive influence, perhaps he should request arbitration and have some limits put on him. I think following those limits for a while would be excellent proof of good intentions, but I pointed out that I can't promise anything even if he does that. Extreme humility would be required, and a lot of you are so tired with dealing with this mess that it may not be a possibility. It's a thought, anyway. --<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasamage_4cdb.html" title="User:Masamage">Masamage</a> 04:08, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>His MO is that he trolls and trolls until people get fed up, then he makes nice and sucks up and acts repentant until he gets unblocked. Then he starts trolling again.

<dd>Boy did I waste my breath on his talk page trying to help him out. His next message he STILL wouldn't promise NEVER to troll again (which was my recommendation to him). Seems like he thinks he has some sort of right to troll. Anyone want to get in touch with his ISP about this? He needs to be sent a strong message that he's the one that's done the wrong thing, and if he's abusing admins here there's not much point unblocking him.

<p>A suggestion to all who are getting these emails. If you haven't done so already, make them bounce if you can. You can program Outlook Express to bounce emails you don't want. I don't know about others. If you have access to your email like I have (a domain host including email servers) you can program them to bounce this sort of thing. If this user persists with different email addys, that's spamming and that CAN be reported to an ISP. Even if they are using providers like Hotmail for example. <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurse_of_Fenric_f242.html" title="User:Curse of Fenric">Curse of Fenric</a> 20:15, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

If they want to keep me blocked me for a year, five years, ten years, fifty years; so be it.

<dd>I'm in favor of giving him this one solitary last chance. If he blows it, he's gone; otherwise, so much the better, right? And I don't think that edit you link is trollish, personally.

<dd>It is trollish to edit someone else's talk contributions. IMO if he really did want to edit constructively he would do so without drawing attention to himself. I stand by what I said about him above, I think he's a pathological liar, a troll to the Nth degree, and I think he has a hardon for sucking people's time and goodwill. The problem with 'giving him another chance' is that he is an extremely prolific editor, making 100s of edits a day, and if we <i>do</i> give him a chance, someone is going to have to check them all to keep an eye on him. Are you volunteering? If so, then yeah, I'm all for giving him another chance. <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnchoress_3b7f.html" title="User:Anchoress">Anchoress</a> 00:13, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, there is a limit that can be placed on him. His accounts can be blocked. See, if he truly wants to edit Wikipedia constructively, he can create an account and keep his nose clean without being a schmuck or trumpeting his previous identities, and <i>we would never know</i>.

<p>My view is - he won't take no for an answer, and is trying to not so subtly evade the blocks he has already suffered. I personally take the view of "no more chances". If the block is infinite and he is banned for good, he can wait until doomsday - he won't get in on that account. It's a shame account names can't just be deleted. What Crustacean said about Christian whatever it was proves indeed that he can't be spoken to. I tried and look where it got me - he all but ignored my advice and assumed the right to troll. So I say, maximum action. Ban all his ID's permanently and note his IP, and any ID's that are from the same IP or at least the same ISP be labelled a potential sock puppet. <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurse_of_Fenric_f242.html" title="User:Curse of Fenric">Curse of Fenric</a> 01:09, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm posting to get opinions on this case. This user has certainly exhausted my patience and many other admins have had to deal with him too. I would like to know what others think.</p>
<p>The problem started with a simple edit war in which one party began to use sockpuppets very destructively. The puppeteer doesn't seem to have an "original" account (he started as an anon IP editor), but two "main" accounts have been identified - <a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMessenger2010_fca9.html" title="User:Messenger2010">User:Messenger2010</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyCanada_5255.html" title="User:AndyCanada">User:AndyCanada</a>. Currently all known accounts are indef blocked except Messenger2010. I wanted other opinions before indef blocking this final account.</p>

After some category restructuring (see <a href="../../../b/r/i/Category_talk%7EBritish_MPs_6387.html#Restructuring_again.2C_now_largely_done" title="Category talk:British MPs">Category talk:British MPs#Restructuring_again.2C_now_largely_done</a>), I thought that some category renaming would be appropriate, and made a series of suggestions at <a href="../../../b/r/i/Category_talk%7EBritish_MPs_6387.html#Renaming_subcategories_after_restructuring" title="Category talk:British MPs">Category talk:British MPs#Renaming_subcategories_after_restructuring</a>. I made the suggestions there rather than launch straight into a CFD, because my experience of CFD is that it can easily become conflictual and unwieldy if the range of options for consideration has not been discussed beforehand. My aim was not to somehow stitch up the CFD, but rather to try to clarify the issues by considering them without a CFD deadline looming. (I have seen previous CFDs in this area closed with a referral back to category talk, so it seemed sensible to try that <i>before</i> CFD rather than after).</p>
<p>That proposal was made on 4 November 2006, and I drew its existence to the attention of some editors who I know to be active in the area. My intention was to let the discssion run for a week or two, to help maximise consusus, before proceeding to CFD. (At time of writing 4 replies, all supporting my proposals)</p>
<p>On November 5th, one of those categories was nominated for CFD (see <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_deletion_Log_2006_November_5_1013.html#Category:Members_of_the_United_Kingdom_Parliament_from_English_constituencies" title="Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/Log/2006 November 5">Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/Log/2006 November 5#Category:Members_of_the_United_Kingdom_Parliament_from_English_constituencies</a>) by <a href="../../../s/m/e/User%7ESmerus_1e2d.html" title="User:Smerus">User:Smerus</a>, who was evidently unaware of the discussion at category talk. This CFD was brought to my attention on 6th November (see <a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html#Jumping_the_gun" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">User talk:BrownHairedGirl#Jumping_the_gun</a>), and it nominated only one of the categories, with a rename different to those discussed in category talk. (Smerus proposed renaming <a href="../../../m/e/m/Category%7EMembers_of_the_United_Kingdom_Parliament_from_English_constituencies_5edd.html" title="Category:Members of the United Kingdom Parliament from English constituencies">Cat:Members of the United Kingdom Parliament from English constituencies</a> to Cat:Members of the United Kingdom Parliament representing English constituencies; my proposal was a rename to Cat:UK MPs for English constituencies).</p>
<p>At 10:04, I responded at <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_deletion_Log_2006_November_5_1013.html#Category:Members_of_the_United_Kingdom_Parliament_from_English_constituencies" title="Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/Log/2006 November 5">the CFD</a> by pointing out the earlier discusson, and asking the nominator to withdraw the proposal so that we coukd create a new CFD including both options. Smerus kindly agreed to this at 16:21 UTC, and I created the new CFD tonight (see <a href="../../../c/f/d/WP%7ECFD_d190.html#National_sub-categories_of_Category:Members_of_the_United_Kingdom_Parliament" title="WP:CFD">WP:CFD#National sub-categories of Category:Members_of_the_United_Kingdom_Parliament</a>). I would like to stress that I have no complaint at all against Smerus, who has been civil and helpful and sought to resolve problems to seek a consensus, and who actions all show good faith.</p>
<p>However, in the meantime, at 11:13, <a href="../../../j/c/3/User%7EJc37_cfd0.html" title="User:Jc37">User:Jc37</a> nominated the remaining categories, but proposed only the format offered by [[User:Smerus]. When I returned, I accepted Smerus's offer to withdraw, and created the new CFD at <a href="../../../c/f/d/WP%7ECFD_d190.html#National_sub-categories_of_Category:Members_of_the_United_Kingdom_Parliament" title="WP:CFD">WP:CFD#National_sub-categories_of_Category:Members_of_the_United_Kingdom_Parliament</a>.</p>
<p>However, user Jc37 objects to the withdrawal, and at 00:42, 7 November 2006 says he/she wants only Smerus's proposal to be considered; only if it fails, should the earlier proposal be considered. (see <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_deletion_Log_2006_November_5_1013.html#Category:Members_of_the_United_Kingdom_Parliament_from_English_constituencies" title="Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/Log/2006 November 5">Smerus's CFD</a> and <a href="../../../c/f/d/WP%7ECFD_d190.html#National_sub-categories_of_Category:Members_of_the_United_Kingdom_Parliament" title="WP:CFD">my new CFD</a>, 00:32, 7 November 2006).</p>
<p>This seems to be to be silly at best, and destuctive at worst: the nominator has agreed to a new CFD to consider both options. That CFD has been created. The best-considered discussion is surely likely to be reached when all relevant options are on the table, from the outset.</p>

<p>However, it didn't end there&#160;:(</p>
<p>Having been notified of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Category_talk%7EBritish_MPs_6387.html#Renaming_subcategories_after_restructuring" title="Category talk:British MPs">earlier discussion at Category talk:British MPs</a>, <a href="../../../j/c/3/User%7EJc37_cfd0.html" title="User:Jc37">Jc37</a> then listed the three other categories for renaming, <i>without</i> listing the proposal originally discussed: see <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_deletion_Log_2006_November_6_4d50.html#Category:British_female_MPs" title="Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/Log/2006 November 6">British female MPs</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_deletion_Log_2006_November_6_4d50.html#Category:Current_British_MPs" title="Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/Log/2006 November 6">Current British MPs</a>.</p>
<p>In subsequent comments at <a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html#CFD_for_Category:Members_of_the_United_Kingdom_Parliament_from_English_constituencies" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">00:46, 7 November 2006</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_deletion_Log_2006_November_5_1013.html#Category:Members_of_the_United_Kingdom_Parliament_from_English_constituencies" title="Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/Log/2006 November 5">00:42, 7 November 2006</a>, Jc37 has refused requests to withdraw these nominations and called for another admin to be involved.</p>
<p>Jc37 has stated repeatedly that he/she opposes the use of abbreviations in the category names, and whatever its merits that is an entirely legitimate objection. However, the way in which these nominations have been made appears to have been designed to prevent or hinder consideration of all the options, and subsequent unwillingness to resove the situation reinforces that view.</p>
<p>I <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assumed good faith</a>, but since Jc37 has insisted that it is preferable to run a CFD <i>without</i> including the earlier options, I can only conclude that the aim in the second batch of discussions was to bypass ongoing discussions about the names of these categories, by using the CFD process to trump attempts to explore the issue and seek consensus. JC37 refuses to continue discussion, and has suggested admin intervention (see <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_deletion_Log_2006_November_5_1013.html#Category:Members_of_the_United_Kingdom_Parliament_from_English_constituencies" title="Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/Log/2006 November 5">comment at 00:42, 7 November 2006</a>). I would have prefrred to continue discussion, but that has apparently been refused. In other circumstances I would <a href="../../../r/e/s/Wikipedia%7EResolving_disputes_9a93.html#Second_step:_Disengage_for_a_while" title="Wikipedia:Resolving disputes">Wikipedia:Resolving disputes#Second_step:_Disengage_for_a_while</a>, but since a CFD process is underway, disengagement is a poor option.</p>
<p><b>Requested action:</b> please can an admin close the CFDs at <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_deletion_Log_2006_November_6_4d50.html#Category:British_female_MPs" title="Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/Log/2006 November 6">British female MPs</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_deletion_Log_2006_November_6_4d50.html#Category:Current_British_MPs" title="Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/Log/2006 November 6">Current British MPs</a> as bad faith nominations, and ask all editors concerned to discuss the issues further at <a href="../../../b/r/i/Category_talk%7EBritish_MPs_6387.html" title="Category talk:British MPs">Category talk:British MPs</a> and to return to CFD with a set of proposals which relects <i>all</i> the options for which there is support.</p>
<p>I feel strongly that it would set a very bad precedent for these nominations to continue: if CFD can be used used as a mechanism to disrupt and bypass consensus-seeking discussions, then there ill be a clear disincentive to discuss category changes before moving to CFD. That will only make for more confrontational CFDs, poorer decision-making, and a much harder job for the admins who monitor and close CFDs.</p>
<p>While I await admin response, I will go ahead and make counter-proposals to these CFDs. However, even after making the counter-proposals, I would still prefer the CFDs to be closed. Some participants have already made their recommendations without</p>

<dd>Piccadilly, that is <b>utter nonsense</b>, as would be abundantly clear to anyone who does some minimal reading. I have no objection to anyone nominating a category for deletion, and while I would query the usefulness of a CFD on the female MP categories when there was a previous unsuccesful proposal only three months ago. I have not objected in these CFDs to the nomination to delete the categories (I recommend against, but I have not objected to that aspect of the nomination).

<dd>"All the options" is an interesting statement. It sounds like you feel that you won't be "heard". What was stopping you from joining in the CfD discussions, rather than rather petulently (I apologise, but I'm having a hard time seeing it any other way atm) disregarding the noms except to dismiss them as unwanted? The mere fact that after several hours "away from your computer", you <i><b>still</b></i> chose to not join in the discussion, and start your counter nomination (pointing out that the previous nom was on the 5th, my additional noms were on the 6th, and her counter noms was on the 7th). And I have to admit, I'm starting to find the continued use of "bad-faith nomination" a bit irksome, especially when I consider the circumstances of your attempt at a separate duplicate/subsequent/alternative nomination.

<p>Well, wow. This is apparently what I get for being away from Wikipedia for a couple days?</p>
<p>I'm rather stunned at BrownHairedGirl's accusations, I suppose I shouldn't be, but I am nonetheless.</p>
<p>I think the easiest way to respond would be to show a "timeline", and go from there.</p>
<p>First, take a moment and read: <a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html#CFD_for_MPs_from_English_constituencies" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">User talk:BrownHairedGirl#CFD for MPs from English constituencies</a>. (I'll be referring to it, but for space reasons, am deciding to not repaste it all here. If diffs are still requested, I suppose I can build a list.) I pasted her initial post from my talk page, and my response, to her talk page.</p>

<li>My response: 10:39, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Her response: 10:43, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>And then I responded to Mai Oui's comment at: 11:19, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice the immediacy of the discussion to that point. After that point, no responses whatsoever. I offered to list the rest of the nominations (since "someone else" had already listed a couple of categories that apparently she had made a plan for). I did so, and finished the nominations, though, as I mentioned, I didn't agree with the <a href="../../../m/p/_/MP_c90a.html" title="MP">MP</a> abbreviation, and noted the already existing nominations used "representing" rather than for or from, and so I nominated the rest based on the previsous nom's precedent.</p>

<dd>(interjection) But you didn't menton that the discussion at catehory talk was entirely in suppot of the abbbgreviations, and you didn't mention the abbreviations as an option, and you didn't include a link to the discussions at category talk. Basically, you were pointed to an existing discussion n a naming structure, saw that there was agreement for a particular format, and instead of exploring whay that structure was preferred, decided that you liked a different one, so set out to bypass the existing discussin by making a CFD which excluded the opotion prefered by other editors. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 16:22, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

The concern by Mai Oui! was length of the name, and I never saw a support of <a href="../../../m/p/_/MP_c90a.html" title="MP">MP</a> as accurate. So I think a concern about <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28precision%29_9b4a.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (precision)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (precision)</a> is a valid concern. While <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28abbreviations%29_47f4.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (abbreviations)">Wikipedia:Manual of Style (abbreviations)</a> suggests that such abbreviations are fine in article text (though <a href="../../../m/p/_/MP_c90a.html" title="MP">MP</a> is not one of those listed), <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_1cd9.html#Prefer_spelled-out_phrases_to_acronyms" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions">Wikipedia:Naming conventions#Prefer spelled-out phrases to acronyms</a> says rather clearly that abbreviations should not be used in names.

<dd>First: there were four contributors to that discussion, not "one or two".</dd>
<dd>OK, you had a concern about abbreviations. But did first you looked at the wrong guidelines: those guidelines are about naming articles, but what we are discussing here is categories. The relevant one guideline is <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28categories%29_ac1c.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (categories)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (categories)</a>, which depreactes abbreviations, but also says "Avoid names that are too long or too short. Short, simple names are preferred for categories"</dd>
<dd>Did you raise that concern in the discussion? No. You ignored the discussion and the long history behind it which coukd have been shown if you had asked, and went straight to CFD.</dd>

<dd>JC37, the nominator of that CFD had already kindly agreed to withdraw in favour of a new joint nomination. The longer I let that new nomination, the more likely it was that more people would spend time to a CD that was going.

<dd>The way that reads to me is that you felt that you had to rush your counter nomination because you felt that the people commenting at the existing CfDs needed the guidance of your new CfD?

<li>At 10:04, 6 November 2006 , I posted to opoose the nomination and note an earlier discussion, and asked the nominator to withdraw</li>
<li>At 10:20, 6 November 2006, I added a further comment, noting the need to include the other categs, and the support for a "shorter consistent naming structure" (the nomination would increase the length of already over-long category names).</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I then posted a message to each of the contributors to the CFD, pointing out the existence of an ongoing discussion at category talk.
<ul>
<li>Jc37 replied, noting that while the agreement at category talk was for shorter names, Jc37 disagreed. I replied, noting the need for consistency;</li>
<li>Shortly afterwrds, I left my computer for the day (last contrib 11:01), and did not return until to wkipedia until late in the evening: see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;offset=20061106222815&amp;limit=20&amp;target=BrownHairedGirl" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;offset=20061106222815&amp;limit=20&amp;target=BrownHairedGirl" rel="nofollow">my contribs</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li>So what you're saying is that you were uninterested in any other discussion except the hope that someone had withdrawn their nomination so that you could go forth with yours, and ignored entirely that not all nominations had been withdrawn? Wow. Also, AFAIK, once nominated, the nominator can attempt to withdraw the nomination, but the CfD remains open until an uninvolved admin decides that there is consensus to close. (For example, if the nominator had suggested rename, and the commentors all said delete, and the nominator attempts to withdraw the nom to avoid deletion, the closing admin has the discernment to note that, and choose to close or leave open based on that.) I don't believe that Smerus's nomination was clear-cut at that point, and so closing as a withdraw would seem to me to be pre-mature.

<p>At that point, I started to try to discuss with her, but after seeing the situation, I decided that the best idea would be to suggest that a non-involved admin sort it all out.</p>
<p>Since then, I've not been on Wikipedia (for unrelated <i>RL</i> reasons). And apparently she's attempted to "clarify" / "modify" the previous nominations. I am still not certain why she has such a problem with allowing the nominations as listed, and suggesting her changes once they were finished, if she feels so stongly about it.</p>
<p>Anyway, At this point, I'm not going to presume what to think about this. What I'd like to see is the original nominations be "un-modified", and run their course, and the "duplicate" nomination re-listed once they are done. However, this is now a mess, since several people have already voted in the duplicate nomination, and with her "modifications", the existing noms would seem to be a mess now as well.</p>

<p>Actually, I think the easiest thing to do would be close ALL of the nominations right now as duplicates of each other, and the two of you can get together and nominate them again, without any other nominations getting in the way and confusing me.

<dd>Thanks Kbdank71, that's fine by me, as long as there is some discussion first to ensure that the nominations start off by all offering the various options for which there is obviously some support, and that they include the relevant sub-categories (I'm not sure that any of the existing nominations are complete). I suggest that rather than discuss it in user space, that the discussions should take place at <a href="../../../b/r/i/Category_talk%7EBritish_MPs_6387.html" title="Category talk:British MPs">Category talk:British MPs</a>. I hope that's acceptable to everyone.</dd>
<dd>I should stress that I'm not suggesting any sort of stitch-up or attempt to exclude anything beforehand, just a bit of work to ensure that participants in a CFD are presented with some clear and concise options so that the CFD discussion is less likely to get confused by more options being added in <i>after</i> it has started. I know that folks are entitled to add options, but a bit of preparation should help to reduce the need for that. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 17:11, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Considering that's exactly what she wants, and has apparently striven for through her disruptive counter-nomination, I am sure you can imagine that I am hesitant to agree to that. I would not oppose the current noms all being re-listed adjacent (but not combined) with BHG's counter nomination (something that has been done previously with similar/related nominations), with BrownHairedGirl's unhelpful modifications of the previous noms removed as "confusing" (As Kbdank called them) except that her nominations, as duplicate, were not "complete", since they weren't tagged (simply because previous nominations were already underway). So I would think that her counter nomination should be removed, since it was not tagged. The thing is, nominations are "timed". And while this discussion continues, time is counting down. No matter what happens, I think it would be fair to list them for an additional day or two, due to BHG's intervention. I'd like to hear Kbdank's further opinion on all of this, and once the discussion is done, I have <i>no problem</i> deferring to his judgement. - <a href="../../../j/c/3/User%7EJc37_cfd0.html" title="User:Jc37">jc37</a> 23:18, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Did you contribute or express your concerns? No, you went immediately to a nomination of something very different. It's a real pity that you didn't discuss your concerns before making a nomination, but since your proposals postdate theose at category talk, and since yours arose directly out of the category talk proposals, you can hardly call the earlier ones counter-proposals.</dd>

The available procedures in such cases are either to withdraw the nominations in favour of a new CFD which will need new tags (which you rejected), or to make a counter-proposal in an existing CFD, which I did (and which doesn't need new tags). It's one thing to try to pre-empt an existing discussion by pre-emptively launching an alternative CFD, but it's a bit rich to then try to block the original proposal from being considered as an alternative. Running two CFDs in parallel on the same issue is an obvious no-no: both could pass, in which case we'd have a conflict. Running them back-to-back makes litte sense either, because them we could have two renames in rapid succession. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 03:55, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

Ok, people. I've closed every nomination regarding this that I could find. Please get together and figure out a way to renominate the categories that will cause the least amount of bickering. BTW, I didn't remove the tags from any category, so when you all decide to renominate them, you'll need to re-tag them so they point to the right CFD subpage. Any questions, let me know on my talk page. Thanks. --<a href="../../../k/b/d/User%7EKbdank71_f952.html" title="User:Kbdank71">Kbdank71</a> 12:40, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Jc37 replies above kbdank71 that "I'll follow through and defer to his judgement", his judgment having been (reasonably enough) to get together and figure out a way to renominate the categories.

<dd>That\\\'s a load of crap. There were no personal attacks in my contributions. I did however change my contribution to a more accurate and referenced piece. For instance I added an article regarding the proposed rollout of services and expected timeframe. I then had a look at the ISP\\\'s rollout page and found that they hadn\\\'t even completed half of what they had aimed to do in the article. How is that a personal attack?

<p>Wow, I\\\'ve never had a vandal named after me before. I\\\'m honoured. Longhair and Thatcher131 have pretty much said all that needs to be said here. To answer the vandal: The actual content isn\\\'t the big problem, although it was obviously biased, it isn\\\'t the reason for the blocks - it was the 3RR breakage and refusal to discuss changes on talk pages first. The evasion of blocks, the user page vandalism and Admin\\\'s noticeboard vandalism, the use of open proxies, and the admitted use of an open access point without the owners permission - isn\\\'t really helping your cause at all. -- <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuq_73ab.html" title="User:Chuq">Chuq</a> 05:00, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That\\\'s laughable. The evasion of blocks, the user page vandalism and Admin\\\'s noticeboard vandalism, the use of open proxies and the open access point use is a direct result of overmoderation of Wikipedia. How about before deleting someones contribution and banning them, you consider the article that was submitted and suggest rewording or removal of parts of it, instead of flatly removing the entire thing and protecting the page so no one can change it.

<dd>Once again the \\\"talk\\\" was more in line with \\\"you are just a complaining customer\\\". If I was a \\\"complaining customer\\\", why would I even bother? I\\\'d just switch ISP\\\'s. I like Internode I honestly do, however there rollout is not progressing as they hoped(possibly for reasons outside of their control). It is fact however, demonstrated by the magazine article and the Internode DSLAM rollout page. C.L.V. 66.79.168.59 06:10, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

He/she is so paranoid about pan-Turkic topics.<br />
These are his/her systematically moved articles which i could realise:<br />

(<i>The article of the Britannica is old, not really good, and in many parts not enough</i>). However, if these sources present iranic theories, this time Tajik finds reliable these sources and gives referances from these like this:<br />

<dd>Thomasmeeks, someone stated above that this is an IP address that might be usable by many different people. If that is true, it can't readily be blocked because of vandalism that occurred hours ago, as the block would be more likely to inconvenience innocent people than stop the vandal(s). However, as indicated, I suggest deleting his last edit from the history of that article. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 21:31, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Agreed. But I don't know if the edit needs deleting. Vandalism like that is fairly common (ie. no personal information was released in the edit).

<dd>Good question - my tech knowledge is minimal, so I relied on Moe, but the WHOIS lookup does say "Comment: Addresses within this block are non-portable." So I'll join in the request for education.

<p>Whilst looking through <a href="../../../c/s/d/CAT%7ECSD_4339.html" title="CAT:CSD">CAT:CSD</a> I noticed a number of images tagged by the same person as {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-author_8ff7.html" title="Template:Db-author">db-author</a>}}. This seemed a bit odd as some of them were quite old and the original update seemed quite clear where the images were to be used. The CSD for db-author includes the wording "added by its author <b>and was mistakenly created</b>", the age and previous usage tends to suggest that these fail that criteria. I was going to ask the author about these, but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAngmering&amp;diff=87215865&amp;oldid=86928251" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAngmering&amp;diff=87215865&amp;oldid=86928251" rel="nofollow">notice on his talk</a> that as they were Orphaned public domain "these orphaned images may be subject to deletion as orphans. You may wish to add them to an article, or if they are no longer needed, they can be tagged for deletion by you as...". No mention of moving to commons. I'm not that familiar with all we do with images, but should we be asking people to delete perfectly good free images just because they aren't currently used? If so should {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-author_8ff7.html" title="Template:Db-author">db-author</a>}} be being used in this way or do we need to (a) go through a full discussion (b) provide a different CSD to cover this? --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 08:46, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Please do not make him change it. I find it a little upsetting that you would have a problem with it. Pushing subjects like suicide under the carpet contribute to keeping it taboo, something that 'shouldn't be talked about'. It has been a previaling attitude of the past. I write as someone who works on the articles around this subject on WP. Anyway I think he has chosen it, however, as he likes the band of the same name.

I gave him a blatant vandal warning after its removal from AIV. It was also removed because the user appeared to have stopped ath that point.</p>
<p>The reason I went straight to AIV with this instead of issuing another warning is because of this edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Frederick%2C_Maryland&amp;diff=87211210&amp;oldid=87171160" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Frederick%2C_Maryland&amp;diff=87211210&amp;oldid=87171160" rel="nofollow">[137]</a>. The user recognizes he should be blocked for what he does yet warns of more to come. He has no plan to make good contributions to the encyclopedia. I was also concerned with the personal attacks on me and the general incivility. I'm not trying to report this here because daddy said no so I'm going to ask mommy, but I believe this is a vandalism only account who understands that he should be blocked, therefore, the step-by-step warnings shouldn't have been necessary. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 12:54, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This guy has been carrying on like this for months. His justification is that under "his culture" remarks that degrade women in sometimes particularly offensive manner are OK, and thus allowed on wikipedia because of it policy of respecting all beliefs. Unfortunately he doesn't understand (more like refuses to accept) that this is a two-way street and he himself does not show respect for other cultures. It is OK to have beliefs, they should be respected, but that doesn't give anyone the right to push them onto others particularly when they are offensive to otherss. Not just rude, but a hypocrtite. I suggest often he is just trying to get a reaction. This user has been discussed here before - i know this is about women, but it illustrates his double standards:</dd>

Even after I amended my statements to not appear opinionated (and they weren't in the first place), Unfocused accused me of trying to cover up my original statements - if I wanted to do that, I would have deleted the AFDs, and restored all edits except the one that contained my original statement. He/she has since reverted the edits twice.

<dd>He seems to have reverted your post-closing changes to the AFD closing statement twice mistakenly thinking that you should't be allowed to clarify or ammend the closing statment, and then stopped that, and left two confrontational but not hostile comments on your talk page. Those are not great behavior, but he stopped soon enough that it doesn't seem really disruptive. Most of the flames for the last several hours seem to be limited to a nice toasty discussion on <i>his</i> talk page... which you and all the other editors can just walk away from. I think that someone has to really go out of their way to justify an abuse claim for disruption or the like for an ongoing discussion limited to their own talk page. I think he's wrong on whether it's ok for you to ammend the closing comment; if he keeps the ongoing argument on his talk page, is that causing you any problems? If it bothers you, walk away and ignore him... No need to keep arguing with him there and feeding the unhappyness flames. If he comes out and bothers you on your talk page or elsewhere a lot more, that's a different story. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 03:23, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Chacor, if he comes out swinging into other pages, particularly if he's argumentatively or uncivily crying coverup, then that's disruptive and abusive, and I don't think Core will have much problem getting an uninvolved admin to block briefly. If he goes to DRV civily that's per procedure. If he keeps fuming about it on his talk page, then it's unfortunate but self-contained, and there's no reason to push the issue there with him. Coredesat, hopefully you just disengaging works. Hopefully he calms down overnight and lets it drop or goes to DRV properly. I left him a note trying to get him to tone it down a bit. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 03:37, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I never once requested that Coredesat treat AfD as a vote as he claims above, however, in his closing statements, he included that he deliberately ignored the opinions of several good faith editors and was "being bold" in closing these as delete. Quite frankly it seems to me like obvious administrative rights abuse and I had planned to start a discussion here myself, if the talk page discussion didn't work. But the first step of dispute resolution is always use of the talk pages. I find it quite puzzling that someone should scold me for using talk pages for their intended purpose!</p>
<p>Note well: the deletion of the articles hardly matters; the wiki has enough content to keep anyone busy. However, people who deliberately step beyond the bounds of "serving the community" with their administrator privileges should be brought to notice. I would be disappointed if Coredesat were punished for this, but I would be equally disappointed if he were not somehow reminded and encouraged to use his tools in service to the community rather than in service to his own desires. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 07:33, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>An anon IP, User:71.82.137.219, has been repeatedly adding a medley of unreferenced gossip to the Bipasha Basu article. She's a Bollywood starlet regarded as a sex symbol and this user seems to be fascinated by her. He has been asked, over and over, not to add the gossip re her personal life and has even been blocked for violating the <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> policies. This doesn't seem to have stopped him. As soon as the block expired, he was back with the gossip. He doesn't break 3RR. He adds the junk, other editors delete it, and he returns the next day to add it again. He has never communicated with any of the other editors or admins.</p>
<p>Could we have a longer block on this person? Cleaning up after him takes time that could be better used. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 19:25, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And it's not much of a potential infringement anyway — it is a statement of facts, not directly cut-and-paste. It would be dubious to claim it was copyrighted anyway — saying the date that something happened and that it was the worst nuclear accident in U.S. history is not a very "creative" statement or formulation.

<p>If it hasn't been said enough I'll repeat it for those not in attendence. Removing comments from your talk page <b>is not against policy</b> nor any guideline. In fact there is no guideline to follow. All WP:TALK says is that removing comments may interpreted as hostile. Nothing gives you the right to tell a user that he may be blocked or otherwise if he keeps removing comments from his talk page. The only exception to this is maybe in the case of blatant vandals only used to vandalize Wikipedia, which JJay is not. Arbusto, I highly recommend that you stop reverting his talk page now. Drop the issue. If it's of major importance, than it will always be in the history of his talk page that you attempted to communicate with him and thats all that needs to be done. <i>semper fi</i> — <a href="../../../m/o/e/User_talk%7EMoe_Epsilon_62b6.html" title="User talk:Moe Epsilon"><font color="#000000">Moe</font></a> 02:31, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Removing one's comments from the user's own talk page is not against any guideline or policy, but is strongly discouraged. You can freely remove one's comments from a talk page and there is nothing wrong with it. I agree with Moe, that it is the user's free will that one can remove comments if he/she thinks its hostile. He won't be blocked for it, and he is not a vandal. Whatever he does, the old things will always be seen in the history, and you can say that you had tried to talk to him. If he persistently removes your comments, then we shall see. --<a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerence_Ong_4371.html" title="User:Terence Ong">Ter</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerence_Ong_4371.html" title="User:Terence Ong">nc</a><a href="../../../t/e/r/User_talk%7ETerence_Ong_215c.html" title="User talk:Terence Ong">e Ong</a> <sub>(<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Terence_Ong_928d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Terence Ong">C</a> | <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Terence_Ong_2_9033.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Terence Ong 2">R</a>)</sub> 11:19, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I almost reported this at Complex Abuse, but I'm not quite sure it meets the standards.

<p>Based on the contents of the attack page, all of this seems related to the nonsense involving mini mammoth (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Mini_Mammoth_f114.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mini Mammoth">AFD</a>), which was so bad the AFD was semi-protected.

<p>Hi, user <a href="../../../t/a/j/User%7ETajik_56da.html" title="User:Tajik">Tajik</a> is systematically searching and changing Turkish related articles with wrong and unsourced informations. WikiArticles are not improving because of his/her wrongly editings. He/She is searching 'turk' or "turkic" words in an article and deleting or deforming sentence or changing with 'persian' word in a baseless way. And he generally makes this secretly. He/She is making these changes with 'minor edits'.<br />
A check to the minor edit box signifies that only superficial differences exist between the current and previous version: typo corrections, formatting and presentational changes, rearranging of text without modifying content, et cetera. A minor edit is a version that the editor believes requires no review and could never be the subject of a dispute. By contrast, a major edit is a version that should be reviewed to confirm that it is consensual to all concerned editors. Therefore, any change that affects the meaning of an article is not minor, even if the edit is a single word.<br />
However, Tajik's systematically minor editings hardly affects of articles. And he/she always uses this illegal method. Please have a look at his/her contributions;<br />

Secondly, if he/she is frustrated in editing he/she is inviting to article other wikipedians. What can be the evidence for teamworking else. He/she is not seeing wikipedia as an culture and information organization. He always deforms sourced turkic related articles and infos. He/she could has problems with other nations and races but is here true platform to solve his/her nation-based problems? Please help to improve Wikipedia...--Karcha 10:39, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Tajik is completely out of control, posting personal attacks on my talk page, on the Herat page, about NisarKand, about everything, every where. When NisarKand acted like this, he was blocked by administrators, however no one has bothered to block Tajik's even worse behavior directed at everyone. Tajik clearly shows that he has no understanding of <a href="../../../r/e/s/Wikipedia%7EResolving_disputes_9a93.html" title="Wikipedia:Resolving disputes">Wikipedia dispute resolution</a> policies or Wikipedia NPA policies or WP edit war policies. For example, he is currently attacking me on my talk page for "vanishing when everything is out of control." This I am doing on purpose as it it good solid Wikipedia policy that Tajik should respect and try for himself instead of personally attacking everyone who tries to resolve a dispute in a advised manner.</dd>

<dd>The article I messed up? Well, he didn't follow my edits quite, but his original complaint against me was that I left in a comment that said Pashtuns are the second largest ethnic group in Herat, while Tajik swore they weren't because he had information stating that Tajiks were 85% and Pashtuns 10%. When I pointed out that there is an important reason, namely current human rights issues, for specifically leaving in the information about Pashtuns being the second largest ethnic population, he threw this statistic back at me, saying, again that it was wrong that the Pashtuns were the second largest population, as they were 10% next to the Tajiks being 85%. He has apparently learned something new today about the ethnic population of Herat, and has taken this as an invitation to personally attack me.</dd>

And get him to stop attacking me at all? This is one of the Wikipedia polices I don't agree much with: allow people to continue personally attacking others.</dd>

<p><a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecronudist_ebaa.html" title="User:Necronudist">User:Necronudist</a> has been acting rude and <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">uncivil</a> against several users lately, as well as not caring about other policies either, but as I have been involved in some of the discussions myself, I prefer to let another admin solve this. It has been going on for a pretty long time now, on and off. The first "conflict" I can remember can be found <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Football_Archive6_8679.html#Foreign_players" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Football/Archive6">here</a> (example edits <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AWikiProject_Football&amp;diff=73386289&amp;oldid=73384997" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AWikiProject_Football&amp;diff=73386289&amp;oldid=73384997" rel="nofollow">[160]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AWikiProject_Football&amp;diff=73397488&amp;oldid=73396735" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AWikiProject_Football&amp;diff=73397488&amp;oldid=73396735" rel="nofollow">[161]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AWikiProject_Football&amp;diff=73565482&amp;oldid=73563971" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AWikiProject_Football&amp;diff=73565482&amp;oldid=73563971" rel="nofollow">[162]</a>) and he has since continued to be rude against other users, or has shown a complete lack of understanding of policies and their function (for example <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AWikiProject_Football&amp;diff=76624373&amp;oldid=76617850" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AWikiProject_Football&amp;diff=76624373&amp;oldid=76617850" rel="nofollow">[163]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AWikiProject_Football&amp;diff=84403633&amp;oldid=84396525" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AWikiProject_Football&amp;diff=84403633&amp;oldid=84396525" rel="nofollow">[164]</a>).</p>

And, please note, I've never offended anyone, just spoken frankly.

<dd>I understand, there's no problem for me. You (wikipedians) have lost a football researcher (hobby) and an historian (studies &amp; job) because of a pair of stupid rules.

Wikipedia isn't God (is there a policy like this?&#160;:-), it fails sometimes, maybe you (wikipedians) should try to improve it. --82.61.59.136 18:23, 10 November 2006 (UTC) (ex-<a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecronudist_ebaa.html" title="User:Necronudist">Necronudist</a>)

<dd>Imagine a wikipedia without rules. It's a shame you've been banned, but it's for the protection of the community. Wikipedia functions as a society and an acceptance of the rules of the society are required. Without those rules (even stupid ones), whatever they may be, the society will collapse... and no one user is worth such a collapse.</dd>
<dd>I find your attitude here slightly insulting as well. Moneypedia? Wikimedia has refused buyout offers, runs no advertisements, and is one of the largest collections of free content on the planet.</dd>

Simple. I was here for the culture, to give my little contribution, but if the religion comes first, well, I leave your stupid dogmas to you. It's not right that a person can't revert a vandalism 'cause the vandal has vandalized the page more than three times. It's stupid. I must have the possibility to break the rule for a good reason, not to be scared 'cause I'm breaking a stupid rule.

<p>This is very sad.

I know that in any online environment people come and people go and one isn't supposed to get too worked up about it, but it's always a shame when things go this wrong this quickly, and I often find myself post-morteming these situations and wondering if a happier outcome could have been available if people had sought one. Would it be appropriate for anyone to shed any light on what the heck is going on here? <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 19:07, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>See the history of his talk page, before he removed criticism (as an anon, with edit comment "(sorry, but I don't want any more discussion. (I am Konstable, don't revert))". It looks to me like he decided to leave, and then created an alternative account, clearly labelled it as a sockpuppet account but not for which account, and proceeded to close delete AFD's in order to provoke a reaction (<a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>). When he got such a reaction, he responded abusively, and was blocked. He's now claiming that this is an example of <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a> even though, because the account was a self-labelled sock, that doesn't apply. He claims to have left but is creating socks to pursue the same point and using his admin abilities to unblock his socks. Frankly, I think he is playing a dangerous game and Wikipedia would be safer if he was desysopped immediately.-<a href="../../../g/a/d/User_talk%7EGadfium_49fb.html" title="User talk:Gadfium"><font face="cursive" color="#808080">gadfium</font></a> 19:18, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As for why he decided to leave, I really have no idea. Although we live in the same city and go to the same University, I've never met him (to my knowledge) and have had very little to do with him until the last couple of weeks. I didn't vote in his RfA because I didn't know anything about him at the time.-<a href="../../../g/a/d/User_talk%7EGadfium_49fb.html" title="User talk:Gadfium"><font face="cursive" color="#808080">gadfium</font></a> 19:23, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Just to reiterate, when I initially blocked I did not know who the "sockmaster" was, I just read the contributions and it was clear that the account was being used to get around a ban and/or otherwise against the spirit of allowable uses in <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a>. It turns out that this was a larger case than it initially looked, and two sockpuppets were used by Konstable. Anyway, I think it makes sense to remove the admin bit from K for now, and if he does return and intend to do productive work here (as i've observed in the past he's very much used to doing) then it can be applied for again.

Oh how I miss these wonderful debates on Wikipedia... Some mis-informed accusations from people who had nothing to do with the issue, yet only words of defence against the block from the people whom I've allegedly harassed. The first account was not disruptive, nor abusive. The second account, as I already said (but of course the point of these discussions is to say the same things over and over again) was created to finish off talking to people due to the discussion that was started on my talk page for some reason. If someone is accusing my second account of disruption for quietly talking to people on their talk pages, then I have nothing to say to you and recommend that you quit Wikipedia also.</p>
<p>It was my initial intention to take a break from all admin conrtibutions to get away from the mix of bureaucracy, trolls and arrogant elitists regarding which I was getting increasingly frustrated (and on my user page I made the edit " 01:10, November 5, 2006 . . Konstable (Talk | contribs | block) (temporarily suspending all admin contributions)" removing all mention of me being an admin). Though after being unfairly blocked for "closing AfDs" it was my first impulse to make a post on <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a> detailing the reasons why I quit and why I have no intention to be admin any more, I ended up not requestiong to have "+sysop" removed because I thought that even though I don't want to have anything futher to do with this so called "encyclopaedia" (where? are we writing it right now? I didn't notice), I might change my mind one day and come back - so I would be able to help out again without reposting the long explanation that I had on my user page (deleted to stop discussion, I have <i>left</i> why should I have to keep talking about this). Though now it seems unlikely that I will actually return - this lovely reception on AN/I is the true Wikipedia spirit. A huge post on an issue which all rolls down to me popping in to leave a quick message to Ryulong on his talk page (who knows very well who I am and didn't seem to find this too "disruptive" as some people here would like to think, in fact he argued against the block).</p>
<p>Do what you will with my account, it will make you feel better and help you deny the bureaucratic mess, I want no futher part in it. Go on, maybe put a <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAN_eb66.html" title="WP:BAN">community ban</a> on me for my latest crimes of talking to people, that would make you happy. No, I will not drop by any futher to talk to mis-informed people making false accusations of "trolling". If someone wants to contact me (regarding something other than "trolling"), use my email insted.</p>
<p>As <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">User:Newyorkbrad</a> said above, yes it <i>is</i> sad that I was here to help out enthusiastically, helped bring an article to FA status, have gained about 2000 entries in my admin log within 2 months, and now I want nothing to do with this project. And futhermore that people don't want me here. But that's how Wikipedia works. Two prominent contributors who've also left recently are <a href="../../../w/e/r/User%7EWerdna_2947.html" title="User:Werdna">User:Werdna</a> and <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDraicone_e5d6.html" title="User:Draicone">User:Draicone</a> (actually both for similar reasons relating to bureaucracy), I hope more do leave, maybe someone will learn and quit this a mix of childish nonsense and bureaucracy.--<a href="../../../k/o/n/User%7EKonstable_8474.html" title="User:Konstable">Konst.able</a><sup><a href="../../../k/o/n/User_talk%7EKonstable_e0b7.html" title="User talk:Konstable">Talk</a></sup> 00:22, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm still trying to wrap my poor little brain around what exactly happened here, but I can say that if it is determined that AltUser (<a href="../../../a/l/t/User_talk%7EAltUser_251b.html" title="User talk:AltUser">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AltUser_4c74.html" title="Special:Contributions/AltUser">contribs</a>) is Konstable, he is then also the user behind the impostor (or attack or whatever it was) account Ryushort (<a href="../../../r/y/u/User_talk%7ERyushort_0961.html" title="User talk:Ryushort">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ryushort_eda3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ryushort">contribs</a>). CheckUser shows both were on open proxies, but Ryushort, which used one of the same proxies and was created at the same time, was clearly the same as whomever AltUser was. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 00:53, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The cause of the dispute was almost undoubtedly me. Previously, the administrators who expressed an opinion have been of the consensus that it was inappropriate to remove current warnings from your talk page. In a more recent discussion, a consensus was <i>not</i> reached. I was operating on the prior consensus when I warned Mikedk9109, though he was never blocked for this as far as I can see. He was blocked for removing tags from images without resolving the issues, and for personal attacks. And I believe previously for 3RR violations. Anyway, I certainly appreciate other admins monitoring the situation. This is not really the place to discuss whether or not people should be allowed to remove warnings from their talk page, though. That really is going to require that a specific policy be written (or added to existing policy) and the appropriate discussion take place there. I think we need a firm decision but AN/I isn't the place for it in my opinion. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 20:52, 12 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well everything seems to have resolved itself. I agree that figuring out what the best practice is in this regard and then proclaiming it from an appropriate mountaintop would be useful, as it's best to have everyone on the same page.

<li>It's not such a good idea to revert war on another user's talk page. The more relevant question is whether he heeds the warnings or persists in the behavior that got him warned in the first place.

<dd>Agree with Kingboyk that this is (almost) pointless. The reason to identify the source is to make it possible to identify the <i>ultimate</i> copyright holder for purposes of investigating claims of fair use or infringement. In the case of an album cover the copyright owner is plainly obvious as the music publishing company. The intermediate source (Amazon.com or a person's scanner) is immaterial to the copyright. While you can make a techincal case that the record publisher should be cited by name (Capitol Records, etc) that seems like an overly technical point. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 17:16, 12 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>technically, sure it applies. However, the rationale for specifying the <i>immediate</i> source is to enable investigation of copyright status. For example, a flickr image might be licensed with a version of creative commons license we accept, or a version we don't. With things like book, CD and DVD covers, it is obvious that the image is copyrighted, that the ultimate copyright holder is the publisher or distributor, and we are using under fair use, not a free license. In other words, specifying the source of most web images is essential to determine their real status; specifying the intermediate source of a book, CD or DVD cover adds nothing of value. I've said this in the past regarding TV screen caps; the identity of the capper has no bearing on the copyright status of the image. I would absolutely bow to the understanding of someone like Durin or Carnildo in this case if I am wrong, but I don't don't see any practical benefit to tag and delete such images, especially since they could be recreated in 10 seconds from Amazon. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 17:37, 12 November 2006 (UTC)

<p><a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENisarKand_46f1.html" title="User:NisarKand">User:NisarKand</a> has - once again - used racist and insulting remarks against an entire nationality/ethnic group.</p>
<p>He has been <i>vandalizing</i> various articles concerning <a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghanistan.html" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> (such as <a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghanistan.html" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herat.html" title="Herat">Herat</a>, <a href="../../../f/a/r/Farsiwan.html" title="Farsiwan">Farsiwan</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kandahar.html" title="Kandahar">Kandahar</a>, etc.), pushing for an unsourced and biased <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pashtun_people.html" title="Pashtun people">Pashtun</a>-nationalistic POV, partly extremely insulting against national Iranians or Afghanistan's <a href="../../../t/a/j/Tajiks.html" title="Tajiks">Tajiks</a>.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of his comments:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>"... I mostly see <b>light skinned people among Pashtuns</b>, while the <b>Persians are mostly dark</b>. We Pashtuns are well known to the entire world that throughout the entire recorded history, we always fought invaders and defeated them. <b>This is perhaps the biggest reason to believe that Pashtuns remained pure</b> for a very long time. ..."</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Afghanistan&amp;diff=82381132&amp;oldid=82361846" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Afghanistan&amp;diff=82381132&amp;oldid=82361846" rel="nofollow">[180]</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>"... Afghanistan was called "Aryana" (Land of the Aryans) [...] Only Iranians assume or think they are the true Aryans...this is 1000% false. Afghanistan was always the center of Aryans [...] Aryans were those that lived in Afghanistan 1,000s of years ago. [...] Tajik is someone that has Turkish father and Persian mother...or sometimes vice versa. I am making it clear so English people can clearly understand all this. [...] <b>Learn to live with it...if not...then take a hike to Tajikistan or Iran</b>. ..."</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Afghanistan&amp;diff=83288486&amp;oldid=83284035" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Afghanistan&amp;diff=83288486&amp;oldid=83284035" rel="nofollow">[181]</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>"... I know why you hate us Pashtuns ... because we are very popular and Iranians are not. Here are some examples: [...] <b>Pashtun invented nuclear bomb</b> [...] <b>Pashtun went to space in 1988</b>, a Pashtun (Ashraf Ghani) just almost made it to become head of the United Nations, replacing Kofi Annan, <b>but dropped out of the race</b>. US Ambassador to Iraq is Pashtun through his father, Pakistan's top cricket player of all time was Pashtun, <b>Pashtuns were the first people to go to Australia</b> in 1800s and start trade business there (check www.AfghanExpress.com), UAE's top Afghan business men are Pashtuns, most of the top business men in Pakistan are Pashtuns, the Interior minister of Pakistan is Pashtun...I can go on for hours and name show how productive Pashtuns are in the world. But on the other hand, look at Iranians....Iran's leader calls on whiping out Israel, making blank threats because he doesn't even have the weapons, giving to the world a very bad image of Iran and its people. <b>However, it's natural for people to experiance jealousy some times but people must not take that serious</b>. [...] Pashtuns are naturally gifted with knowledge and wizdoms from Allah (GOD). At the same time, Pashtuns believe that all people of the world are equal, regardless of their religion, color, race, or ethnic backgrounds...that includes Jews, Christians, Hindus, Buddhists, Athiests and etc. GOD created all these different people for a special reason that only he alone understands. <b>This is just my lecture for Iranians and those that think like Iranians</b>. ..."</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Afghanistan&amp;diff=85098491&amp;oldid=84939005" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Afghanistan&amp;diff=85098491&amp;oldid=84939005" rel="nofollow">[182]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few examples, not to mention his countless efforts to falsefy facts, to reject and insult authoritative sources written by leading scholars (<a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia_of_Islam_8ed9.html" title="Encyclopaedia of Islam">Encyclopaedia of Islam</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia_Iranica_05f3.html" title="Encyclopaedia Iranica">Encyclopaedia Iranica</a>, etc.)</p>
<p>However, for most of the time, I tolerated these comments and only once reported him to admin <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">User:Khoikhoi</a> who protected the article <a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghanistan.html" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>.</p>
<p>After that, NisarKand started to take on the articles <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herat.html" title="Herat">Herat</a> and <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kandahar.html" title="Kandahar">Kandahar</a>, flooding the sites with wrong information and unsourced POV.</p>
<p>However, his most recent comment forced me to report him once again to admins, this time directly because of racism and name-calling:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>"... Finally, when Emperor Babur stated in his 1525 AD memoires about calling <a href="../../../t/a/j/Tajiks.html" title="Tajiks">Tajiks</a> "<a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarts.html" title="Sarts">Sarts</a>"....<b>Perhaps he meant to call them "Rats"</b> ..."</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Herat&amp;diff=87536578&amp;oldid=87361326" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Herat&amp;diff=87536578&amp;oldid=87361326" rel="nofollow">[183]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Admins need to react!</p>
<p>This user is not only flooding Wikipedia with POV and racist remarks, but also with politically inacceptable statments, such as taking pride in the actions of the <a href="../../../t/a/l/Taliban.html" title="Taliban">Taliban</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>"... The Taliban were in fact Pashtuns and defeated the Tajiks after they assassinated Ahmad Shah Massoud on September 9, 2001. <u>This is history and has nothing to do <b>with my own nationalistic views</b></u>. ..."</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Herat&amp;diff=87549917&amp;oldid=87536578" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Herat&amp;diff=87549917&amp;oldid=87536578" rel="nofollow">[184]</a></li>

<dd>I think just by what Tajik posted above, its clear that Nisarkhand is not only a POV pusher, but not a decent contributer.

<dd>I think the Afghan articles may have had a little unavoidable bias to begin with. How many Pashtuns have contributed? But that said, NisarKand is his own worst enemy. I think you should act toward people on wikipedia and you would in "real life". Going around insulting people whom you disagree is not going to get you anywhere and the some goes here. So, if he posts another insult (probably as likely as the sun rising) he should be banned. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarsRover_23ea.html" title="User:MarsRover">MarsRover</a> 20:04, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I advise for the administrator to follow <a href="../../../t/a/j/User%7ETajik_56da.html" title="User:Tajik">User:Tajik</a>'s history...there you'll find that User:Tajik is going to articles of other ethnic groups and purposly removing sourced information. If you look at my history, you will not see me visiting any articles of people from other ethnics...none at all. This clearly means I don't bother people from other ethnics or countries. This <a href="../../../t/a/j/User%7ETajik_56da.html" title="User:Tajik">User:Tajik</a> loves spreading false information and reverting other people's hard work...all he does is revert pages without any such discussion on talk. This clearly makes people who are not Tajiks very angry. In other words <a href="../../../t/a/j/User%7ETajik_56da.html" title="User:Tajik">User:Tajik</a> is going around to stir trouble with people from other ethnics. There are too many incidents of this and I am not going to post all of them...<a href="../../../t/a/j/User%7ETajik_56da.html" title="User:Tajik">User:Tajik</a>'s history on Wikipedia is self revealing evidence. Now he brings his fellow friends here to help testify for him...and I never even talked with <a href="../../../s/i/k/User%7ESikandarji_ae16.html" title="User:Sikandarji">User:Sikandarji</a> before. I request <a href="../../../t/a/j/User%7ETajik_56da.html" title="User:Tajik">User:Tajik</a> be banned permanently, he is not here to help Wikipedia in any way. <a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENisarKand_46f1.html" title="User:NisarKand">User:NisarKand</a> November 14, 2006</p>
<p>You have got it all wrong! This is an encyclopedia where anyone can contribute to any article as long as they are neutral and factual. Your comments above show that you consider this to be an ethnic conflict! Sorry to inform you that your clan-mentality has no place here.

<dd>This is not about "ethnicities", and it is certainly not about "only a member of ethnicity X is allowed to write about his people". This is about vandalism and racism.</dd>
<dd>YOU are the one who is deleting sourced information, and claiming that great scholarly works such as the <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia_Iranica_05f3.html" title="Encyclopaedia Iranica">Encyclopaedia Iranica</a> or <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia_of_Islam_8ed9.html" title="Encyclopaedia of Islam">Encyclopaedia of Islam</a> or "false" or "not realiable" (just ask Sikandarji who is a specialist on this issue and an academic in Oxford!).</dd>
<dd>Leaving this aside, NOTHING you say does justify your racist remarks. You have directly insulted other peoples with racist comments, and you are pushing for unsourced POV (like your claims about Pashtuns being the first humans in Australia, the ones who have invented nuclear technology, etc).</dd>
<dd>Because of your POV the article <a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghanistan.html" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> has been protected. And now you have started to mess up the article <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herat.html" title="Herat">Herat</a>. Your POV is not the biggest problem, because it will always be reverted and opoosed with realible scholarly sources.</dd>
<dd>However, your recent racist remarks (not to mention your previous racist insults against Iranians) are way out of control. Racists like you should be permanently banned - not because of your POVish behaviour, but because of your continued racist comments!</dd>

<p>My advise to <a href="../../../t/a/j/User%7ETajik_56da.html" title="User:Tajik">User:Tajik</a> is simply to leave articles about <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pashtun_people.html" title="Pashtun people">Pashtuns</a> and articles related to Pashtuns alone. As you are an ethnic Tajik and you do not know anything about ethnic Pashtuns. In other words, you are not helpful in making people understand Pashtuns and their history. I suggest you focus more on your own ethnic group and help people understand about your own people (the Tajiks). I came to make articles that relate to Afghanistan and Pashtuns more professional, while you are removing my hard work. This is vandalism and a cruel thing to be doing. It's not helping anyone. If I ever leave, eventually other Pashtuns will make their way here and edit the articles with the same information I include in them. The reason is that all Pashtuns know very well about Afghanistan and their history. You are unaware about Afghanistan's history that you clearly stated in the NAME section on Afghanistan...<b>Afghanistan's "FIRST" constitution was written in 1964.</b> This is an obvious lie because Afghanistan had constitutions way before 1964. I provided to you the one which was written in 1923...HERE ----&gt; <a href="http://www.afghan-web.com/history/const/const1923.html" class="external text" title="http://www.afghan-web.com/history/const/const1923.html" rel="nofollow">Afghanistan's constitution of 1923</a> You purposly ignored my findings and until this day left the false statement that you made in the NAME section of <a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghanistan.html" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>. This clearly means that you are here putting false information everywhere. This is just one of your false statements I came across...and there are many. It is not <a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENisarKand_46f1.html" title="User:NisarKand">User:NisarKand</a> doing anything bad on Wikipedia....it is <a href="../../../t/a/j/User%7ETajik_56da.html" title="User:Tajik">User:Tajik</a> who is destroying Afghanistan's and other articles.</p>
<p>I proved to everyone I am not racist. I don't go visit articles about other ethnics, to an average reader...that's 100% clear evidence that I'm not racist. Now you just called me racist about 5 times or so...this means you are Racist for keep calling me racist. If you right now say to me "Hey man I'm sorry about everything...let's be friends" then that will show you are not racist. However, if you failed to do this then you are obviously a true racist. As for me...I am not a racist just because I call my self King. <a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENisarKand_46f1.html" title="User:NisarKand">User:NisarKand</a> November 14, 2003</p>

<dd>NisarKand, your comments are totally meaningless and against the policy of Wikipedia. You claim ownership for certain articles, and then start to mess those articles up with unsourced POV. You claim that "Pashtuns were the first people in Australia", that is wrong anyway. You claim that "Pashtuns made it to space", which is also wrong: only ONE single Pashtun was INVITED by the Soviet government to the <a href="../../../m/i/r/MIR_1efc.html" title="MIR">MIR</a> - it was not an achievement of the Pashtuns, it was Soviet propaganda at the end of the Afghan-Soviet war. You claim that "Pashtuns invented nuclear technology" ... this is totally hillarious, because Qader Khan is a) not acting in the name of Pashtuns and b) Pakistan stole the technology from India! You claim that "Bollywood stars are proud Pashtuns", while all of them do not even consider themselvs Pashtuns (Shahrukh Khan, whose father was a Pashtun civil rights activist, does not even understand Pashto!) - at the same time, you state that "Tajiks should not consider themselvs Persians, because ancestry is not important".</dd>
<dd>You have not provided ONE SINGLE scholarly source for your claims, while - at the same time - you are constantly deleting scholarly sources, only because you do not like the message.</dd>
<dd>However, none of this is important anymore. You claim not to be a racist, while your quotes above clearly prove that you <b>are</b> a racist. This is not only my opinion, as you can see above.</dd>
<dd>You should be permanently banned from Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>And, btw: I did not say "first constitution", but the "first NATIONAL constitution", because - unlike the earlier constitutions - the 1964 constitution was not simply dictated by the king or one of his advisers.</dd>

<p>For the 1,000s times again and again...<b>a person who speaks <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pashto_language.html" title="Pashto language">Pashto language</a> is not automatically considered <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pashtun.html" title="Pashtun">Pashtun</a>....as almost all Tajiks in Afghanistan can speak Pashto...that does not mean they are Pashtuns. You are still not learning this after I repeatidly told you and explained this to you. You have to have family backgrounds who were Pashtuns. That's the</b> ONLY <b>way to be considered a Pashtun. It is these kinds of misunderstanding you have about Pashtuns...and you are trying to make people think like you. YOU ARE TOTALLY WRONG for thinking this way.</b> go back to school and this time try to learn something<b>.</b></p>
<p>I am not afraid of being banned from Wikipedia. I didn't plan on staying here for long. I work for the U.S. government, stationed in Afghanistan and I am a very busy guy. However, I can't reveal nothing else. I guess I've done my work on Wikipedia, regarding Afghanistan's article. I think I stated before that Wikipedia is for unemployed losers, and I'm not one of those. I am happy and excited that my work counts in the real world...because I make serious differences in the lives of poor people in Afghanistan. This Wikipedia or any other media tool is not my friend. I am now hoping to be banned from this sick site very soon:) <a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENisarKand_46f1.html" title="User:NisarKand">User:NisarKand</a> November 14, 2006</p>

<dd>Well, then everything is fine. For your information: Qadir Khan has acted in the name of Pakistan, not in the name of Pashtuns, the same way <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre_Omidyar_5bbc.html" title="Pierre Omidyar">Pierre Omidyar</a> - the founder of <a href="../../../e/b/a/EBay_4cc0.html" title="EBay">eBay</a> - is not acting in the name of Persians! The "Ghans" were not the first people in Australia, they were "subjects of her majesty, the Queen" - Pashtun workers from <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_raj.html" title="British raj">British raj</a> who were deported as semi-slave workers to Australia by the British rulers. It is not a subject of pride - in fact, it is very sad! Another group of Pashtuns lives in <a href="../../../g/u/y/Guyana.html" title="Guyana">Guyana</a>, known as the "Afghans of Guyana". They were brought to South America to work on the fields, the same way once Africans were brought to America to work for their masters. Again, it is not a subject of pride, but the sad story of thousends of people who became victims of European colonialism.</dd>
<dd>As for the rest: have fun in Afghanistan. I am sure that noone will miss you here. And, yeah: you are still a racist because you called an entire ethnic group "rats".</dd>

Now the user will not stop posting to my talk page, claiming that everytime I remove such trolling I'm just trying to hide the truth about what I am. How it proves what I am is beyond me, but I'm looking for someone to take a glance at this situation and try to communicate with this user. i'd really appreciate it, <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 02:22, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Homey has e-mailed an editor asking him to edit for Homey by proxy. An editor on <a href="../../../a/n/i/Talk%7EAnimal_liberation_movement_2a53.html" title="Talk:Animal liberation movement">Talk:Animal liberation movement</a> received an e-mail on November 11 from someone calling himself Roncey Valley/Nick Cockburn. The e-mailer told the editor that I had removed Homey's "the animal rights movement is fascist and anti-Semitic" edits (which Homey had added to various articles as <a href="../../../f/a/r/User%7EFarnsworth_J_07bd.html" title="User:Farnsworth J">User:Farnsworth J</a> and <a href="../../../f/a/r/User%7EFarnsworth_J._4c1d.html" title="User:Farnsworth J.">User:Farnsworth J.</a>), and asked the user to restore them, saying "I can't get involved publicly (so please do not respond on my talk page) but could you look at the page and see about either restoring the stuff she removed or moving it to another article like Animal welfare?" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Animal_liberation_movement&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=87448487" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Animal_liberation_movement&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=87448487" rel="nofollow">[188]</a></p>
<p>"Nick Cockburn" is Homey. I know this because I've received e-mails from Nick Cockburn before, repeating very unpleasant, supposedly personal, material that was being published about me on Wikipedia Review and on an attack site run by WordBomb. There's no question that the e-mails came from Homey. I won't repeat the evidence here for obvious reasons, but I've forwarded it to a number of admins who've been dealing with this situation.</p>
<p>The person set up an account on November 11 as <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERoncey_Valley_5a63.html" title="User:Roncey Valley">User:Roncey Valley</a> in order to be able to use the Wikipedia e-mail system. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=newusers&amp;user=Roncey+Valley&amp;page=" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=newusers&amp;user=Roncey+Valley&amp;page=" rel="nofollow">[189]</a></p>
<p>I'm posting about this here in case anyone else receives e-mails from "Nick Cockburn" or <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERoncey_Valley_5a63.html" title="User:Roncey Valley">User:Roncey Valley</a>. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 02:45, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
