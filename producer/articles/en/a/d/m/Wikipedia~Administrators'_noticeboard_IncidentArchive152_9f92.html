<dd>I for one do not. "Being in the minority" hardly applies when the majority consists of a load of socks. "To a certain extent through heroic figures like Klaus Fuchs, the brilliant activities of the Soviet intelligence service resulted in the early loss of America's monopoly on the destructive atomic bomb." is clearly POV pushing that should be cut. Other edits by Zvesda clearly suggest a virulently pro-Stalin POV. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stalin&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=91550217" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stalin&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=91550217" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> is perhaps the best example. Zoe was entirely correct in reverting, with rollback or no rollback. Allegations of near-3RR on behalf of Zoe are just plain wrong. Admins should be able to do their job without getting whacked over the head by a lynch mob at ANI, especially when dealing with individuals with block logs the length of your arm - quite literally. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoreschi_31bb.html" title="User:Moreschi">Moreschi</a> 15:38, 2 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Zoe's reverts have been proper and there are strong indications of sockpuppetry usage in this article.

<dd>What about the fact that our blocking policy states <i>Sysops must not block editors with whom they are currently engaged in a content dispute.</i>? Shouldn't he have simply contacted another admin to take a look?-<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a><sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 18:53, 2 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Also, taking a look through the history, I cannot see any more obvious sockpuppetry (other than the user mentioned above). The information, whilst it has POV issues, also contained a variety of sources to back up sections. Zoe appears to be removing this information. This seems like a content disupte and as such should follow our <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">dispute resolution</a> process, not unilaterally blocking editors such as Nixor.-<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a><sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 19:13, 2 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Excluding Zoe's recent block, Nixer has been blocked <i>thirty</i> times, for a total time of almost two months. At what point do we say <i>enough is enough</i>? Although I don't think Zoe should have blocked indefinitely a user with which she was having a content dispute, the indefinite block was not exactly a bad idea. -- <b><a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETariqabjotu_f37f.html" title="User:Tariqabjotu"><font color="black">tariq</font><font color="gray">abjotu</font></a></b> 19:45, 2 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>But my point is that as an involved party in this dispute, Zoe should have gone elsewhere for admin intervention. If admins are able to just block users regardless of their own involvement in a dispute it starts to give them carte blanche to do what they want, and opens up the floodgates for increases in users crying foul of admin actions (which, having looked at this page for several months are common enough anyway). In a case such as this, even though the block may have been justifiable, outside opinions should have been sought.-<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a><sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 19:51, 2 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Do you decide that I am distructive from the blocks? For example, once some users added information into article <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparative_military_ranks_of_World_War_II_7f65.html" title="Comparative military ranks of World War II">Comparative military ranks of World War II</a>, which was perverted and vandalized by a vandal Roitr. I reverted them to a consensus version which was edited in a temporary page for more than a month by a number of users, explained the situation, but the users continued to add the info. Then I was blocked for a week. Their edits were completely perverted by Roitr and when unblocked I added manually all their info into non-vandalized version (and now I was supported by even those users). This version continues without sufficient changes until now. But nobody asked me to excuse. After such blocks admins feel free to block me whenever they want.--<a href="../../../n/i/x/User%7ENixer_51c2.html" title="User:Nixer">Nixer</a> 20:08, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Everyone who is classing this as a content dispute must have far better eyesight than I do. All I can see are edits so obviously POV and trollish in nature ("brilliant and heroic" for some spy???I'm not saying I disagree, but most of America would!) that they desperately needed reverting, and blocks for the users involved. My compliments to Tariqabjotu for counting all those blocks: I gave up halfway through.

<dd>Oh, for crying out loud. Look, to describe somone - uncited - as brilliant and heroic - is awful POV that the only remedy for is cutting. There was no American bias before that edit - I don't think that person was even mentioned. Even if he had been, provided he had been described in a neutral manner that is <b>not</b> American POV and should not be tampered with.

<dd>In fact the article was very biased. But I did not revert to support the "brilliant" wording. In fact I reverted the deletion of the material I've added.--<a href="../../../n/i/x/User%7ENixer_51c2.html" title="User:Nixer">Nixer</a> 20:31, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well. Nice little kerfuffle here while I was out Christmas shopping. Nixer had reverted the ridiculous Soviet propaganda that Zvesda had inserted three time. I warned Zvesda about a three revert warning, and he immediately created User:Karl Fuchs, whcih I immediately warned was going to count as a violation of the 3RR if it was used to attempt to revert the article. Instead, Nixer did the revert. I was planning on blocking Nixer for 24 hours for violating 3RR, but once I saw his block log, I figured that 24 hours would mean nothing to someone who's blocked all the time, and so I initiated an indefeinte block. Remember, please, that indefinite is not permanent. If Nixer had agreed not to re-insert the vandalism, I would have immediately unblocked, but instead he decided to whine. I see that Nixer has been inappropriately unblocked -- a 3RR violation is a 3RR violation, whether performed by one person or by a group of people, and all are to be blocked if they are involved in the violation. I had nothing to do with any sort of conent argument over this article, all I was trying to do was to get rid of Zvesda's silly additions (see the addition to <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gulag.html" title="Gulag">Gulag</a> that he also added, which I also reverted). I told him not to add his personal opinions into articles, and he immediately did it again. I warned him not to 3RR, and he did it with his sock puppet, which I have also indef blocked, and I blocked Zvesda for 24 hours. I have now re-blocked Nixer for 10 hours, which is probably about the length of time his block should have continued. Although why this should have to be discussed, I cannot fathom. Wheel warring over blocks is never appropriate, especially without discussion. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe">(talk)</a> 01:09, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>a 3RR violation is a 3RR violation, whether performed by one person or by a group of people, and all are to be blocked if they are involved in the violation.</i> - What? I am confused - I thought <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> stated <i>an editor must not perform more than three reversions, in whole or in part, on a single Wikipedia page within a 24 hour period.</i> and <i>Using sock puppets (multiple accounts owned by a single user) to avoid this limit is a violation of WP:SOCK, but the policy does not apply to groups.</i>? Doesn't this directly contradict that? Just so we are clear on this. Yes, Nixer's actions seem to have been inappropriate, but 3RR doesn't apply across groups - unless you can show that Nixer is the same person as those other editors. (I would support a checkuser in this case).-<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a><sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 01:24, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So, in other words, if a certain trolling organization, or Wikipediawatch, or some web forum decided they didn't like a Wikipedia action, all they have to do is to coordinate an attack on an article so that each member only performs three reverts, and we can't do anything about it, even if it's pure nonsense? <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe">(talk)</a> 21:11, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, that is not my point. You stated that they were blocked for 3RR - and shouldn't be. It is a bit of an assumtion of bad faith to state that they are all part of the same group with no evidence (especially in this case where Nixer is shown to be a seperate editor, and was adding sourced information into the article).</dd>
<dd>With your attack analogy, if it is pure nonsense, and the users are obviously meatpuppets/sockpuppets then they can be blocked for <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVAND_6593.html" title="WP:VAND">vandalism</a> (they don't have to have the full 4 warnings), or the page can be protected/semi-protected.</dd>
<dd>My point here, all along, has been that 1) You had a conflict of interest on the article (which I seem to be in the minority in believing) and 2) your label of the block as a violation of 3RR was incorrect. I am not trying to be persistent, just trying to make sure that you don't think you can block different people for reversions under the 3RR, and to make sure that you don't think it is acceptable to block people you are in a dispute with (it still looks like a dispute to me, as the user was adding information that was sourced so isn't simple vandalism or simple pov pushing).-<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a><sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 16:56, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So a user comes along and adds "George W. Bush" is the biggest war criminal in history" to the Bush article. And I remove it, and warn them not to add their personal opinions to Wikipedia articles. And they add it again, and I remove it again. And they add it again, and I remove it again and warn them of 3RR. And they add it again. I can't block them or remove the edit because "I am involved in the dispute"? <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe">(talk)</a> 18:31, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>While it's true that admins should never block in content disputes, I sometimes see a worrying tendency to call something a content dispute in order to challenge a block. (I remember that in the case of Mel Etitis, too. He became involved in something <i>as an administrator</i>, the user continued the disruptive behaviour, Mel blocked, and hey presto, a thread was started on one of the noticeboards about his "abuse" of blocking powers.) I've looked at the history of the Stalin article. Zoe's last edit before 2 December was a rollback of vandalism in August. How does that make her "involved"? I'm particularly concerned that Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington put in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Nixer" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Nixer" rel="nofollow">block log</a> that it was a "ridiculous block" and that the blocking admin "was involved in editing dispute". Block log entries need to be worded very carefully, as errors cannot be corrected later. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 18:49, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I strongly concur with AnnH's assesment; the charge of "content dispute" is simply a red herring to distract from Nixer's ongoing habits of disruption. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_Tropics_7009.html" title="User:Doc Tropics">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_Tropics_88a3.html" title="User talk:Doc Tropics"><font color="green">Tropics</font></a> 18:59, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In response to this - Zoe had been removing the posts of 'Zvesda' - but Nixer disagreed with this, obviously thinking that some of the information was acceptable. This is a content dispute - another editor, seperate to the revert war between Zoe and Zvesda had made it obvious (by means of a revert) that they don't think it should be removed. How is this anything but a content dispute? I just can't see how it isn't one. And it seems a couple of other editors (2 admins) agree with me too.-<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a><sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 19:02, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why can't you understand what I am saying? Adding 'George W.

Revert warring over it would not be necessary - they are being a vandal. In this case, the user was adding information that was partly sourced. Please try and see what I am saying - we have policies governing blocks and I do not see how you can say that what you were reverting was vandalism or that Nixer was breaching 3RR.

Is this not against wikipedia rules? --<a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurgas00_25ab.html" title="User:Burgas00">Burgas00</a> 17:01, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Decision policy</b> <b>At the end of the discussion, if a rough consensus for deletion has been reached, the page will be removed per Wikipedia:Deletion process; otherwise the page remains.</b></p>
<p>Where is this rough consensus?? I seriously feel that the page should be undeleted since <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> has blatantly flouted wikipedia policy.</p>

<p>Ahem. I think the forum you're looking for is <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">deletion review</a>.

If I understand correctly, one party asserts that there are exactly three content policies (<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>) and that this number must be listed, and the other party asserts that there are several more content policies (such as <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and <a href="../../../g/f/d/WP%7EGFDL_b1b2.html" title="WP:GFDL">WP:GFDL</a>) and that the number '3' is either incorrect or irrelevant.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>In the discussion/vote about the possible deletion of the entry about me (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Tony_Pierce_%28second_nomination%29" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Tony_Pierce_%28second_nomination%29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Tony_Pierce_%28second_nomination%29</a>), the user timecop has chosen to link to a six-year-old resume of mine that has nothing to do with the debate at hand.</p>
<p>Also he's wrong at his slander towards me on two points.</p>
<p>He claims that I hadn't held a job for more than one year, when, if you look at the resume is clearly untrue (it's just a poorly written resume written by a friend of mine).</p>
<p>The debate is whether or not me or my blogging is notable. Something that I didn't start doing until 8/2001. Therefore how is a resume that ends in 2000 of any importance?</p>
<p>Further he claims that I am the "self-proclaimed blogfather." Although it's true that some call me that, including whoever wrote that line in my Wikipedia entry, I've always said that that term belongs with Glenn Reynolds, who has been also blogging since 2001, and whose politics I totally disagree with, but who has spawned more new bloggers than probably anyone. Any search of my 5 year old blog can back me up that I've never claimed to be the blogfather (<a href="http://tinyurl" class="external free" title="http://tinyurl" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl</a> .com/yjaypw).</p>
<p>I am a big fan of Wikipedia. I think that large groups of intelligent people discussing things rationally are better than individuals. I think that you guys should stick to whatever you guys have done to get to this point. Obviously I disagree with those who have agendas against bloggers going out and trying to delete Wiki entries about bloggers, not just because I am one, but because it goes against one of Wikipedia's fundamental principals of only editing things that you are neutral toward (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NPOV" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NPOV" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NPOV</a>), which timecop and some others are clearly the furthest thing from neutral.</p>
<p>Not sure what you can do about that, or if you guys still feel strongly toward that fundamental, but if you can, will you please delete the link to my olde resume if it isn't too much of a bother.</p>
<p>It happens on this entry (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Tony_Pierce_%28second_nomination%29" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Tony_Pierce_%28second_nomination%29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Tony_Pierce_%28second_nomination%29</a>) and he wrote it on 06:48, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>thanks, Tony Pierce 08:46, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Admins, I am sorry if this is the wrong place to post, I don't know where else. This list was created on 4 April 2006 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Muslim_scientists_and_scholars&amp;oldid=46856319" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Muslim_scientists_and_scholars&amp;oldid=46856319" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>. To avoid sensitvites regarding ethnicities, the following disclamier was inserted; taken from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Iranian_scientists_and_scholars_df76.html" title="List of Iranian scientists and scholars">List of Iranian scientists and scholars</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Russians_317f.html#Scientists" title="List of Russians">List_of_Russians#Scientists</a>. The <b>Disclamir</b> is:</p>
<p><i>This is a list of scientists and scholars associated with the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab_World_3da3.html" title="Arab World">Arab World</a> and Islamic Spain (<a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Andalus_24f6.html" title="Al-Andalus">Al-Andalus</a>) that lived from antiquity up until the beginning of the modern age. In some cases, their exact ancestry in unclear. They may have emigrated or immigrated, and thus may appear in other "Lists of...", but nevertheless their names and work are linked to the words "Arab", and "Arabic".</i></p>
<p>This happened with the guidence of two neutral admins: <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">User:Alex_Bakharev</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">User:InShaneee</a>. Now, 8 months later, a newcomer, <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">User:Beit_Or</a>, simply deleted the disclaimer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Arab_scientists_and_scholars&amp;diff=87791496&amp;oldid=87783332" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Arab_scientists_and_scholars&amp;diff=87791496&amp;oldid=87783332" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>.

<dd>While he's had a veritable crapload of blocks, not one has lasted longer than 2 weeks.

<dd>The reason he's not had longer blocks is because of the excessive leniency with which he has been treated (and I share considerable responsability in this).

<dd>I'm not an administrator, but looking at his history, I have to agree, it was long overdue.. Maybe there should be a set 'template' on how users should be blocked. start with 24 hours, then 48 hours then a week, then a month, and at that point, the user goes up for review to see if he's improved in attitude and edits(of course this is somewhat subjective), or if he should be blocked indefinately, in which case he could always apologize.--<a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVercalos_9f82.html" title="User:Vercalos">Vercalos</a> 22:05, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

About a week ago I nominated a bunch of his low quality images that were used (or tried to be used) in the <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweetest_Day_b5ea.html" title="Sweetest Day">Sweetest Day</a> article: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Images_and_media_for_deletion/2006_November_29#Image:10.2C000_CHEERED_BY_CANDY_GIFTS.jpg_.28talk_.7C_delete.29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Images_and_media_for_deletion/2006_November_29#Image:10.2C000_CHEERED_BY_CANDY_GIFTS.jpg_.28talk_.7C_delete.29" rel="nofollow">nomination 1</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Images_and_media_for_deletion/2006_November_29#Image:12_Founders_of_Sweetest_Day_2.JPEG_.28talk_.7C_delete.29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Images_and_media_for_deletion/2006_November_29#Image:12_Founders_of_Sweetest_Day_2.JPEG_.28talk_.7C_delete.29" rel="nofollow">nomination 2</a>. The main issue here is that these are low quality, grainy, skewed photos taken of a newspaper article from a webcam or something. They also are orphans. Anyway, Miracleimpulse has turned the debate into more of his POV-pushing (see deleted The Sweetest Day Hoax) rhetoric. Consensus is clearly against him. I guess I'd just like to have an administrator enter the discussion to try to get it back on track to be about the images, adn not the larger debate.

<dd>Having just perused Miracleimpulse's contribution history, the user's edits are certainly prolific, persistent, and <i>highly</i> focused topically. Is this a textbook case of a <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPA_03df.html" title="WP:SPA">single purpose account</a> in action? --<a href="../../../k/r/a/User%7EKralizec%21_e8c2.html" title="User:Kralizec!">Kralizec!</a> (<a href="../../../k/r/a/User_talk%7EKralizec%21_c54e.html" title="User talk:Kralizec!">talk</a>) 05:43, 5 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Having no other edits outside of the various deletion discussions of the articles he's involved with, as well as POV pushing at two other semi-related pages, I believe I brought it up earlier, but Miracleimpulse is definitely an SPA.—<a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong"><font color="blue">Řÿūłóñģ</font></a> (<a href="../../../r/y/u/User_talk%7ERyulong_923f.html" title="User talk:Ryulong"><font color="gold">竜龍</font></a>) 07:55, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Given the editor's continued hostility (disrupting an IFD is just icing on the cake) and POV pushing, I would be willing to certify a user conduct RFC or give a statement in an ArbCom case if needed. Some form of action (perhaps the community or topic ban proposed earlier) needs to be taken given his persistence, and his status as a single-purpose account is absolutely unquestionable given his unwillingness to contribute to any other subjects in the encyclopedia. --<b><a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoredesat_5b9a.html" title="User:Coredesat">Core</a><a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECoredesat_227a.html" title="User talk:Coredesat"><font color="#6669FF">desat</font></a></b> 08:29, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>This is certainly a bizarre one alright. In the end, if MI were able to cite reliable sources for his "hoax" thesis then he might have a leg to stand on, but I don't recall any such, and this is not the first time I've looked at this article. The images are certainly of pretty poor quality. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 09:46, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Hoax or not, POV or not, sourced or not, these images stink, and that's what the IFD is supposed to be about. MI can argue that they provide source material to back up his claims, and that can be debated elsewhere. But uploading such crappy images isn't the way to provide citations, and I can't seem to get that through to him. <a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENot_a_dog_07fd.html" title="User:Not a dog">Not a dog</a> 14:29, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That may not solve it, the last piece of vandalism was by a registered user who seems to be mostly adding valid info, but inserted some obscenities and has a so-so history. Another was a registed user who is vandal only, but not enough to take him to AIV. A lot of IP addresses but some edits are ok and some are clearly vandalism, and a lot of reverts and changes that may be correct, or hoaxes. Even though I reverted back quite a bit, there still may be problems in the article.

<dd>The fact that rather highly publicised case just closed minutes ago is a complete coincidence. Teenagers are interested in <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petrarch.html" title="Petrarch">Petrarch</a> all the time. That talk page is clearly the ideal place to post declarations of love.

<dd>When I clicked on the diff provided by Prosafiles, I got an "Error" message, which I instantly realized had been produced by Fred's "oversighting" of the information in question. It's always good when the system works. However, when I read the Error message, which looks like a generic message covering several possible reasons why the diff is unavailable, one of the things it says is: "Revisions that contain personal information disclosed without permission may have been permanently removed." Without permission. <b>Whose</b> permission? One would think, the subject of the information. However, here anonymous "Kristi" posted what purports to be information about herself, so presumably she had her own permission. Maybe the message should be made just a bit more generic, maybe by replacing "disclosed without permission" with "that has been inappropriately disclosed." In that way it would cover all information that has been disclosed inappropriately (with that word being partly defined in the recent ArbComm case, with further development possibly to follow), not just information that is inappropriate because it is "disclosed without permission." (I do realize that things like Error messages may be written by a very small number of people who may or may not regularly read pages like this, so if there is a more appropriate place to mention this, someone please let me know.) <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 19:11, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, unless I missed something along the way, there is no requirement for minors to have parental permission to edit Wikipedia, although any responsible adult would discourage a person from publishing a personal telephone number here. I think 6SJ7 has a point, though, because I had had the same passing thought a few days ago. A more generic message would be useful. <a href="../../../r/i/s/User%7ERisker_ce88.html" title="User:Risker">Risker</a> 21:16, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I believe that's the generic message when one tries to look at an oversighted edit. It "may" be that a revision that disclosed personal information without permission has been removed, or it may be that information was removed for another valid reason. There is no need to be overly specific with regard to the oversight explanation. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 21:53, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>NewYorkBrad, having now looked at <a href="../../../o/v/e/Wikipedia%7EOversight_b3cf.html" title="Wikipedia:Oversight">Wikipedia:Oversight</a>, I think you are correct. That page lists three situations in which Oversight is authorized to be used, and the sentence I quoted from the error message seems to be based directly on the first of those. However, the sentence from the ArbComm decision quoted above, regarding when Oversight may be used, seems to go beyond the language on Wikipedia:Oversight. The language on Wikipedia:Oversight addresses information posted without "permission", while the ArbComm says that personal information may also be Oversighted if it has been posted inappropriately by the subject of the information. (That's my paraphrase.) I am not sure where to address such a request for clarification... on the Oversight talk page? <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 17:44, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Was on RC patrol and encountered a questionable edit of <a href="../../../p/a/l/Paltalk.html" title="Paltalk">Paltalk</a> by Uae0707 (<a href="../../../u/a/e/User_talk%7EUae0707_18ae.html" title="User talk:Uae0707">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Uae0707_9ec6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Uae0707">contribs</a>). Here's what happened:</p>
<p>1) I saw <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paltalk&amp;diff=92431323&amp;oldid=92422759" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paltalk&amp;diff=92431323&amp;oldid=92422759" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> and reverted (I think the reversion of this content is OK, as it's pretty much an obvious POV rant). 2) The user <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paltalk&amp;diff=92431904&amp;oldid=92431764" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paltalk&amp;diff=92431904&amp;oldid=92431764" rel="nofollow">re-added it</a> a few minutes later. I reverted and gave a {{content2}} warning. 3) Same thing again: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paltalk&amp;diff=92432161&amp;oldid=92432069" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paltalk&amp;diff=92432161&amp;oldid=92432069" rel="nofollow">[35]</a>. I reverted. 4) Then the user added a toned down version of his previous additions: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paltalk&amp;diff=92432656&amp;oldid=92432281" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paltalk&amp;diff=92432656&amp;oldid=92432281" rel="nofollow">[36]</a>. I didn't look closely at it, and thought the user was just readding the same material, since it seemed so similar, so I reverted and gave the user a content3 warning.&#160;:( 5) The user readded it, and I then saw that the obvious POV was gone.</p>
<p>Anyway, do what you must&#160;:(.</p>
<p>As far as the content goes, I still think the material the user added does not belong in the article, but I feel some other editor should probably look into it, rather than me. <a href="../../../g/z/k/User%7EGzkn_c916.html" title="User:Gzkn">Gzkn</a> 11:43, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are the one who <i>should</i> discuss the matter w/ editors at the article. I got nothing to do w/ the content as i am not involved in the article. My jugdment is that Rev gave his reasons why he tagged the article and you haven't yet countered his arguments. Instead you have been reverting non-stop using the socks i mentioned above. In conclusion, you should have been blocked by now as per the non-respect of the Sockpuppetry. I explained this to you and waited your counter-arguments. I haven't received any so far. I didn't want to block you as i've been thinking you are a newbie and not a vandal. However, disrupting Wikipedia to illustrate a point (tagging other articles) using the socks is warranting a block. So, once for all, please use your registered account above and discuss your issues using better arguments to win your case. -- <i><a href="../../../f/a/y/User%7EFayssalF_b498.html" title="User:FayssalF"><font size="2px" face="Verdana"><font color="DarkSlateBlue">Szvest</font></font></a></i> Ω <small><a href="../../../f/a/y/User_talk%7EFayssalF_f604.html" title="User talk:FayssalF"><font style="background: orange"><sup><i>Wiki Me Up ®</i></sup></font></a></small> 15:25, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This seems not unreasonable to me. The user has persisted in ignoring repeated attempts to communicate. I can't see a single talk page edit in the history (there may be one or two). As a collaborative project, Wikipedia relies on people discussing stuff. Obviously an edit history filled with typo fixes and no talk page issues wouldn't be a cause for concern, but to see so many attempts to engaged, and no response. Blocking may be the only way to get their attention. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> - <a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorwen_11fb.html" title="User talk:Morwen">Talk</a> 16:00, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Further note: pursuant to my raising the question on his talk page, Crzrussian told me that "I blocked the one who was stirring trouble, the one who was reverted by multiple editors." Since the current spate of edit warring started the user who has been blocked has made 15 reverts and been reverted by two other users (one of them Amoruso). <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoruso_6245.html" title="User:Amoruso">User:Amoruso</a> has made 13 reverts and has also been reverted by two other users (one, obviously, being the blocked user). Clearly Amoruso deserves a block too, though arguably only thirteen fifteenths as long as ILike2BeAnonymous's. Or of course, neither could be blocked. But sauce for the goose = sauce for the gander. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 23:13, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I haven't been involved in editing that page before, or in any of the election questions about this issue. I removed the question, asked Cyde not to restore it, and protected. This was a perfectly legitimate series of admin actions. Anyone who disagreed only had to discuss it with me; I'm always open to undoing my own admin actions if people put forward a good argument. What I don't like is for others to assume they know better without any kind of discussion.

<dd>Amarkov, this will be my last comment about this, but I must object to your allegation that I mixed up the editor/admin roles. It was clear from the start that I was taking admin action, because I warned Cyde that he was behaving disruptively and risked a block. There's no need for people to arrive on pages waving a giant "I'm here as an admin" tag. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 02:02, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For the sake of all of our sanity, if Paul August has half the even temper and calm judgment that well over a hundred voters have expressed that they think he does, he can decide what to do with his own question page when he returns and whether it is worth answering or removing. (Sadly, it is by no means the most snide statement surrounding the elections that I have seen thus far.) I would think that it would be far less disruptive than warring over it, and it may well be informative to see how candidates handle such questions; it's not as though arbitrators don't get them in the course of their terms. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindspillage_87a5.html" title="User:Mindspillage">Kat Walsh</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMindspillage_c644.html" title="User talk:Mindspillage">(spill your mind?)</a> 01:28, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I just nominated Wikipedia:Troll bait for speedy deletion because it is pretty apparent the creator <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshall_Matherz_0f61.html" title="User:Marshall Matherz">User:Marshall Matherz</a> is a <a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENintendude_b487.html" title="User:Nintendude">User:Nintendude</a> <a href="../../../s/u/s/Wikipedia%7ESuspected_sock_puppets_Nintendude_dc2e.html" title="Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Nintendude">sock</a> or impersonator based on the edit history. I've not gotten around to recording all of the socks I've noticed, but it appears that Nintendude (and possibly friends meatpuppeting) have created many accounts to continue his type of vandalism, and my guess is he's now trying to publicize himself as a WoW-esqe troll. He appears to have IP edited Wikipedia:Troll bait with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/24.208.226.51" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/24.208.226.51" rel="nofollow">24.208.226.51</a> and a look at this IP history shows that this IP has edited <a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENintendude_b487.html" title="User:Nintendude">User:Nintendude</a> in the past, as well as edited other articles Nintendude has shown an interest in . <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/24.208.226.51" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/24.208.226.51" rel="nofollow">24.208.226.51</a> has had a few non-vandalism edits, but none of them are sourced, encyclopedic additions from what I see. Is it in anyway possible to see what user accounts if any were created by this IP and if this IP has been creating these suspected Nintendude socks, to block this IP from editing or new user creation? It may not stop Nintendude, but it would as least make it a bit harder for him per <a href="../../../d/e/n/WP%7EDENY_da3a.html" title="WP:DENY">WP:DENY</a>.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 21:02, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This user has on many occassions: done personal attacks, assumed bad faith and reverted pages (repeatedly) without consent of other editors. He tends to "control" pages, and reverts to his personal opinion. He rarely discusses in talk pages about major changes and/or reverts. He also seems to enforce his own polices on some pages: which include <a href="../../../w/w/e/WWE_Armageddon_fa19.html" title="WWE Armageddon">WWE Armageddon</a> and <a href="../../../w/w/e/WWE_New_Year%27s_Revolution_07f9.html" title="WWE New Year's Revolution">WWE New Year's Revolution</a> as recent examples. He has been caught violating 3RR in the past, and has came close to doing it other times as well. Other people can't seem to edit pages he likes, otherwise it's automatically reverted due to his opinion only. Some recent problems with him are a matter of a simple match order of an upcoming event. The order doesn't have to be in a certain order, but he seems to think it must be an exact copy of the match order listed on an official site of the event. There is no Pro Wrestling project policy on this, so it's his own policy that he believes everyone must follow... otherwise he reverts. Talk page discussions have started about this, and settled nothing because he won't budge on the matter. One person's opinion shouldn't be dominating articles. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 22:39, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

Granted, it could only be included if some sources were found to show that it was worth putting into the actual article. I don't think <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarrens_af91.html" title="User:Warrens">Warrens'</a> removal was acceptable. Removal of blatantly off-topic posts on the talk pages is fine, but this one wasn't so clearly unrelated. ···<a href="../../../n/i/h/User%7ENihonjoe_c4ff.html" title="User:Nihonjoe"><font color="darkblue">日本穣</font></a><sup><a href="../../../j/a/p/Help%7EJapanese_d024.html" title="Help:Japanese">?</a> · <small><a href="../../../n/i/h/User_talk%7ENihonjoe_488b.html" title="User talk:Nihonjoe"><font color="blue">Talk</font></a> <font color="darkblue">to</font> <a href="../../../n/i/h/User%7ENihonjoe_c4ff.html" title="User:Nihonjoe">Nihon</a><a href="../../../j/a/_/WP%7EJA_dc61.html" title="WP:JA">jo</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><b><font color="darkgreen">e</font></b></a></small></sup> 00:21, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>During the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Tony_Pierce_%28second_nomination%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Tony_Pierce_%28second_nomination%29" rel="nofollow">discussion of an AfD</a> about an entry about me, user timecop linked to a resume of mine that ended in 2000. While linking to it he wrote:</p>
<p>"Self-proclaimed 'blogfather', never held a job for more than a year and never achieved anything except a passing reference for some of his blog-related activities."</p>
<p>Two lies are contained in that sentence. The possible libelous one is the one that says I had never held a job for more than a year. Ironically the resume proves how untrue that statement is. After asking someone to remove the sentence, they only removed the resume. Unfortunately because Digg had this AfD on their front page, tons of people have come to the discussion, some of whom might want to hire me in the future, thus I cannot have such a statement remain which was written for the sole purpose of defaming me.</p>
<p>I wrote on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Timecop#Please_delete_the_link_to_the_resume_of_Tony_Pierce_and_other_irrelevant_slanders" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Timecop#Please_delete_the_link_to_the_resume_of_Tony_Pierce_and_other_irrelevant_slanders" rel="nofollow">timecop's Talk page</a> and which ended with him telling me not to talk to him any longer. Never did he say that my resume proved that he was correct. Thus he knows he's lying.</p>
<p>I wrote <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:AN#Trolls_try_to_get_entries_on_bloggers_deleted" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:AN#Trolls_try_to_get_entries_on_bloggers_deleted" rel="nofollow">on an Admin page</a> to try to get this resolved to no avail.</p>

<p>Please delete that one sentence (that had nothing to do with the discussion since the resume ended at 2000 and I hadn't started blogging until 2001) since it's untrue. Likewise I have never claimed to be the Blog Father. - Tony Pierce 70.219.47.146 05:26, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Normally I would have removed that sentence for you, but Timecop seems to think I am out to get him, and I do not wish to excacerbate the situation with him. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 05:31, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Tony. I hope you are satisfied <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Tony_Pierce_%28second_nomination%29&amp;diff=92641028&amp;oldid=92635167" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Tony_Pierce_%28second_nomination%29&amp;diff=92641028&amp;oldid=92635167" rel="nofollow">with this edit</a> to my delete comment. --timecop 05:50, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am not in the slightest bit satisfied. I asked for a deletion of the sentence, not a strikethru which anyone can see, and indeed attracts more attention to it. If you seem to think that you have information to lead to believe that I haven't held a job for more than a year please provide it now or delete the entire sentence. I have played games with you long enough. Feel free to add Alexa rankings instead of more accurate Technorati rankings all you want - write a whole book if you wish - but if you insist on keeping the lie out there that I cannot hold a job, you will be notified.</p>
<p>One more thing, because I do like to play fair. You try to prove that I'm a non-notable blogger because I "beg" for money, and you linked to an old experiment that I had where I asked people to give me one or two dollars. Well enough people gave me money and I bought a car with that money, and I currently drive that car, infact I just drove it around the country. I've also "begged" for two iPods and gotten them, as well as "begged" for a trip to Aruba and got it. Of your list of nn bloggers how many have simply asked their readers for things and gotten them? I may not have the most traffic of other bloggers, but that was never my goal. It is with the professional job that I have now at LAist where I have tripled the amount of traffic than what it had last year, but whatever. continue your silly war.</p>
<p>But please delete the sentence that contains the libel. You are capable of deleting, so delete it. It doesn't belong there, it isn't true. You know it isn't true. If anyone asks where it went (fat chance) and you want to be honest tell them "it was a lie, I was wrong, and I took it down." - Tony Pierce 06:12, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You do realize that anyone can see ANY page revision by simply clicking on the 'history' link at the top of the page? Deleting a line of text does about as good as striking it out as anyone can go back and review it anyway. And re: begging for money, I imagine most people have more dignity than that. --timecop 06:15, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I do realize that anyone could go into the page revision history and try to weed through the mess that is that page. I can live with that, I cannot live with the strikethrough. What is this now, the fifth time that I have asked you now to DELETE it? Please delete it. If someone wants to go through the history of your lie thats cool with me. What isn't cool with me is a strikethrough that draws more attention to your lie than how it was before. PS good luck flying to Aruba on Dignity while listening to an <a href="http://www.tonypierce.com/2004/8/ipod/" class="external text" title="http://www.tonypierce.com/2004/8/ipod/" rel="nofollow">iPod engraved</a> "from the readers of the busblog". Delete the stupid lie and quit begging for so much attention. The next request will be from someone else and, as I stated in your Talk Page, it will probably result the end of your run here on Wikipedia. - Tony Pierce 70.219.47.146 07:09, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
