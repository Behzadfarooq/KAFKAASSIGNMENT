<p>This is possibly the wrong place to raise this, but is there any Wikipedia policy about avoiding passive aggressive behaviour - some sort of addendum to the "be civil" or "don't be a dick" policies? It strikes me a number of users here - especially the younger ones - are dab hands at this, and nothing, but nothing, is more likely to wind up an "adversary" in a content dispute. Inevitably incensed adversary will react grumpily, and thereby be the "uncivil" one, whereas the passive aggressive behaviour is the cause of everything.</p>
<p>Examples: users being utterly obnoxious and self righteous in a debate, then, when this behaviour is noted, all of a sudden reverting to "please treat other users with respect and don't use personal attacks" - when there hasn't actually been a personal attack (or at any rate the user totally deserved it!). I won't name names or cite example bc my intention isn't to snitch on anyone; rather to see whether the great and the good have thought about whether this argumentation strategy should be seen for what it is: just as obnoxious and odious (and indeed moreso) as not being civil in the first place.</p>
<p>At any rate, when confronted with the behaviour it would be nice to go back and say, smugly, "please don't indulge in passive aggressive behaviour: WP:Don't Be Passive Aggressive" (which is something I do anyway) and being immune from the inevitable response allegations of incivilility or engaging in personal attacks etc. <a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElectricRay_93ad.html" title="User:ElectricRay">ElectricRay</a> 21:22, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What you are proposing is exactly what you are accusing others of doing! If you had some way to say "don't be passive aggressive" and then quote "be immune from [...] allegations of incivility", I don't see how that's different to the alleged problem in the first place - not that I've seen anything that falls under your term "passive aggressive behaviour" anyway.

<dd>I agree with you entirely. Sometimes, one can only fight fire with fire...

<dd>Classic 'passive aggressive' beheaviour already falls under 'don't be a dick'. Remember, it's possible to be perfectly civil while still being a dick. Lawyers (wiki- and otherwise) are particularly adept at this. For the record, trying to goad other editors into a policy violation (WP:NPA, WP:3RR, etc.) is frowned upon, and will often result in censure.</dd>
<dd>Remember that our behaviour-related policies represent guidelines to deal with particularly common problems; they're not meant to be exhaustive. These policies just special cases of 'don't be a dick', and they all flow therefrom. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 21:04, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Gosh, and here I thought "Don't be a Dick" wasn't policy but guideline. The problems with "dick" and "NPA" and "no passive aggression" is that every single one of them has an excessive element of interpretation in it. I can go on, rather pedantically, about why all discussions break down when the interpretive medium hasn't been outlined with metrics to assess behavior, but no one needs to hear that again. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 22:48, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It might make sense to RFC JFAS on this point, just to get it on the record and summarized somewhere. Among other things that provides the opportunity to collect and summarize things, which then can be insta-referenced for future incidents (if any). Also would make it clear to newcomers to the dispute that it's not just El C but a general community feeling that JFAS has been pushing the envelope into abusive territory on this. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 23:43, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fair point, I just dread the work involved and prefer to act unilaterally (did I just say that outloud?). But I think enough of the arbitrators are sufficiently familliar with the case, and JFAS portion of it specifically, that this could be appealed to them in the framework of RFAR/DCV as opposed to documenting much of what has already been noted there. I'm here to save them [and also, very much inadvertantly, myself] time &amp; energy.

<p>JSAF is over-the-top sometimes, see the links El_C provided. However, I can't agree with a blanket statement of "You're not allowed to comment on the activities of this other editor" and I certainly can't agree with enforcing such a decree with blocks. I think El_C is sometimes overzealous in his defense of DCV. She was sanctioned by the arbcom for good reason, and <i>good faith</i> efforts to enforce the arbcom decision should be encouraged, not discouraged. However, whether JSAF is acting in good faith on this matter is probably open to personal interpretation. I've advised him to back off myself, which I think is appropriate. Forcing him to back off with threats and blocks is far less appropriate, from where I sit. I think JSAF and El_C should both drop the issue. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 23:28, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'll gladly drop it — until the next time JFAS targets DCV as in the two cases above, which, if experience is any indication, will be soon enough. If consensus among admins (less so from ones such as Friday who I think is sometimes overzealous in her defence of JFAS) is that I have to go through bureaucratic hoops and otherwise proceduralism to keep the peace, so be it. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 23:41, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nobody's talking about bureaucratic hoops- I'd much rather rely on simple common sense. I agree that JSAF is in the wrong here, but a questionable block on him will only lend his cries of admin abuse more creedence. If you want to block him for disruption, so be it- I'm a firm believer in disruption blocks, despite their controversial nature. But be sure to make a good case for the block- blocking him specifically for commenting on DCV's actions would be a terrible idea, IMO. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 23:57, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't see it as a <i>bureaucratic hoop</i> or proceduralism to ask that there be some formal documentation for an abuse case in which it's escalated to respected admins doing insta-block for incidents which, on the face of it from the immediate provocation, aren't a WP policy violation.</dd>
<dd>That's not <i>you're wrong for doing those blocks</i>; with what I've found by now, I won't object to those. That's <i>I didn't get why those blocks were done or what the big deal was until I dug into it for a long time</i>; if a reasonable editor or admin making a reasonable initial inquiry into a situation they aren't familiar with can think that the action wasn't justified, then it's probably not documented well enough (yet). Part of the reason for all the hoops and procedure is that it gives previously uninvolved/unaware parties the short form intro to what's wrong with the situation.</dd>

<dd>I hear you. I think the RFC is a good idea. I'll even help. All I'm saying is, disruption blocks need to have a good case made for them. If the case is just "he posted on AN/I complaining about another editor", that's not really a blockworthy offense. I agree that there is a pattern of problem behavior here, so surely there are better reasons for a block. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 00:48, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay, good. But I think our words as two admins at the somewhat opposite ends of the dispute really count for something and that the misconduct is rather obvious for the purposes of forecfuly keeping the interaction between the two to a minimum (that JFAS is almost always the instigator in these notwithstanding). I'm sure there are more useful things you could be doing here than contributing to such an RfC, I certainly know of several pressing issues that editors wish me to attend to and I'm not even sure I can find the time to deal with those. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 00:55, 29 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am surprised that few administrators are opposed to this "one man arbcom" action. It is by no means disruption to report incivil actions by a user on probation here, and I think we'd all agree that responding to editors with "opinions are like a**holes, everyone has one" is hardly civil. If posting here is not disruption then there is no reason for these blocks, and El C is abusing his priviliges. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustforasecond_cc17.html" title="User:Justforasecond">Justforasecond</a> 15:18, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

This seems to be a new trend lately: that editors, even respected long-term contributors and admins<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:African_aesthetic&amp;diff=50661575&amp;oldid=50606166" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:African_aesthetic&amp;diff=50661575&amp;oldid=50606166" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, are threatened with blocking and bans in order to protect a trouble user, who is not only contentious, discourteous and incivil since the very first contribution she ever made <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Motherfucker&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=3782336" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Motherfucker&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=3782336" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, but who also manages to violate all Wiki guidelines and policies frequently and continuously and is notorious for her disparaging remarks about "white folks" and other "non-blacks".</p>
<p>Personally, I get tired to see people dancing around the golden calf ad nauseam, and I'm sure that admins like EL_C will appreciate it if their actions are not questioned and if their self-made rules will be accepted without <i>"bureaucratic hoops"</i> and <i>"otherwise proceduralism"</i> such as providing summaries. That's why I suggest to add Wikipedia:Deeceevoice_Immunity to Wikipedia's key policies. Wikipedia:Deeceevoice_Immunity should include guidelines such as: <b>(1)</b> Do not caution DCV to refrain from edit wars, personal attacks and racist remarks -- otherwise you will be banned for incivility. <b>(2)</b> Do not oppose DCV's logical fallacies, unsourced POV edits and other falsifications -- otherwise you will be banned for harassment. <b>(3)</b> If you think that DCV violated Wiki guidelines, suck it up and move on and don't bring it to the admin noticeboard -- otherwise you will be banned for stalking. <b>(4)</b> Wikipedia:Deeceevoice_Immunity can be expanded, but only in favor of DCV, by any admin at any time without notice . <b>(5)</b> If you disagree with guideline (1)-(4) then you are a racist and a life long ban will be enacted. Wikipedia:Deeceevoice_Immunity will save all of us a lot of time and energy. <a href="../../../c/o/y/User%7ECoYep_5bfa.html" title="User:CoYep">CoYep</a> 09:16, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Article: Crystal radio receiver. I added link at bottom in "external links" to one of my "Radio of the Month" pages featuring a crystal radio. Someone keeps deleting it as spam. I'm no spammer. I do have a commercial interest as I am the author of a book on crystal radios, which I sell elsewhere on my web site. Still, should this incidental commerciality ban my valuable and interesting link from the crystal radio receivers page? It would seem that such a policy would ban some of the most knowledgeable people on any subject. Here's the link that keeps getting deleted:</p>

<p>This response is from the very person I am having the problem with. I don't know what Anon is?? Or what this means?? Or what trojan horse refers to? I'm not what this overzealous guardian of all Wikipedia apparantly think I am. A spammer? I'm just a little guy trying to improve an article with a link to related info and my book on the subject. That's all. DV8 2XL is way over my head with all this anger and aggression. I tried several ways to link, hoping to satisfy him. I regret that nothing I do seem to meet with his approval. I have read his User Page and it is clear he has a lot of anger about people changing what he writes. I'm sorry for him, but he should not take his frustrations out on others.</p>

<p>Thank you, Deskana. I have done that. My understanding is that the link is within guidelines and is proper. The guidelines are not so strictly non-commercial as many seem to think. There is much of value out there that would be lost to us if DV8 2XL's overly-zealous reading of commerciality were the correct interpretation of the guideline. It isn't. My link is to my "Radio of the Month," which is a continuing series in which I share with the public photos and info about notable radios from my collection. The commercial aspects of it are minor and in no way color the information or photos presented. To deny it to Wikipedia readers is a disservice to them. Please understand my position</p>

<dd>I'm not fully convinced that the author (Eric Wrobbel) is doing this only for the purposes of spam. Clearly, he knows something about crystal radios, and I'd encourage him to contribute in areas where he has interests (as long as it's not <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>). Besides, <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">we shouldn't bite the newcomers</a>. On the other hand, there's a certain gray area about inserting links to your own web site -- I've been tempted to add links to my inline skate club web site under <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midtown_Greenway_455c.html" title="Midtown Greenway">Midtown Greenway</a> and <a href="../../../c/e/d/Cedar_Lake_Trail_75a9.html" title="Cedar Lake Trail">Cedar Lake Trail</a>, but I recognize there's a conflict of interest in that. One other thing: If these books are available from online booksellers other than the author's web site, they can be listed under the ISBN (International Standard Book Number); see <a href="../../../i/s/b/Wikipedia%7EISBN_7825.html" title="Wikipedia:ISBN">Wikipedia:ISBN</a> for details.

<p>Thanks for hearing my point of view. I HAVE contributed to Wikipedia articles--several times to several articles, though I never had a user name before today. This article seems great as is, so I haven't added or changed any content. But felt it could use a link to the great radio I feature on my "Radio of the Month" page. DV8 2XL, I feel WAY too much anger out of you. Bad for your health. Take a cue from this discussion and calm down. You don't have to save the world from me. So, how about it? Will you put my link back up? Are you interested in crystal radios? Because I can assure you that people who are--like me, for example--are very much interested in seeing pictures and info of the sort that my link provides. --Ewrobbel 04:09, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've got nothing to do with this particular discussion or with crystal radios, but simply as a longtime Wikipedia editor, I need to point out that giving people sarcastic, patronizing "health advice" takes down the civility levle of any discussion. It's not necessary to speak to people that way, and it's certainly not in keeping with the civil tone and acting-in-good-faith presumption that Wikipedia policy encourages. I'm just sayin'. -- <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenebrae_e666.html" title="User:Tenebrae">Tenebrae</a> 04:36, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Eric Wrobbel, you are adding mendacity to spamming if you claim it was only a desire to improve the article that motivated you to post the first two times to a page where a book you wrote is for sale, on a site run by you selling more of your publications. I watch a number of the electronic/radio-television pages, I'm going to make a special effort now to watch the ones that you might also feel need to be "improved" by a link to your catalogue. --<a href="../../../d/v/8/User%7EDV8_2XL_8587.html" title="User:DV8 2XL">DV8 2XL</a> 05:06, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Tenebrae, I am sorry for the sarcasm. Please understand that I'm REACTING here. DV8 2XL keeps calling me a spammer, name-calling to which I take great offense. And now he is stalking me all over Wikipedia. I have tried treating this person in good faith but he was abusive from the beginning. Why no exhortation to him to act in good faith? I get no benefit of the doubt, no civility, nothing but a high-handed judge-and-jury attitude from DV8 2XL. What am I supposed to do? Just go away? Wikipedia's policy on <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">newcomers</a> is being grossly violated here if that's what you want.--Ewrobbel 22:14, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm sorry, the first several links you inserted are clearly links whose <i>sole</i> purpose is to promote a commercial product with no additional information on the topic. You've had a chance to read the applicable policy; would you agree with that statement? The last link seemed more useful and expanded on the topic somewhat; but it was just a picture with a few paragraphs of text and a link at the end to your catalog/price list. This is still a problem with our external link policy. It is clear that you're into the hobby; it would be wonderful if you added content to the article - we could really use your help and insight. <a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKuru_b024.html" title="User:Kuru"><font color="DarkGoldenrod"><b>Kuru</b></font></a> <a href="../../../k/u/r/User_talk%7EKuru_f68a.html" title="User talk:Kuru"><font color="Goldenrod"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></font></a> 22:57, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, Kuru, your statement is correct. You are right about my first link attempts. I was wrong. About adding to the article, I don't see anything to add to the crystal radio article. I added a great deal to the article on "Transistor Radios," repairing many major errors a few months back. You can see those in the history (January 3--I didn't have a user name at that point). About other places DV8 2XL has deleted my links: he has deleted them from that "transistor radios" article (further links and reading--I just put back the reading one but without a link. Probably DV8 2XL will delete that too). And he has deleted my link from the Wikipedia article "Walkman" to my "Radio of the Month" page dealing exclusively with the Walkman. I can't think of any other place I've put any links. I was going to put one on the Television article to my television "Radio of the Month" but I don't think I did. I remember thinking my link was too specialized for a general article on television. --Ewrobbel 23:37, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Whether my links are spam or not is the question. DV8 2XL's use of the prejudicial term "spam" begs the question.

<p>RadioKirk, thank you for your input. I hear you and have read the material you cite. Perhaps mentioning my two books on crystal radios under a "Reading" heading would be acceptable, if a direct link to my "Radio of the Month" page is not. I've added that Reading section and would appreciate your thoughts on whether this is OK. My books are self-published so there is no ISBN number and no way to get them except through my site. But I have not used a link because, if I understand your position correctly, linking to the place where my books can be purchased is against policy, even if the ISBN thing is not available as in the case of a self-published work. Do I understand you correctly? --Ewrobbel 19:09, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>In this case, I'll defer to someone more knowledgeable; my first thought would be, simply <b>listing</b> the book would not be a problem <b>if</b> you can demonstrate that you're a recognized expert in the field (that's usually a requirement for a listing with an ISBN number, as well), since that would then require the reader to do his/her own research into finding the book. Unfortunately, real-world, you're still better served finding a publisher anyway.

<dd>The GFDL issue is a big deal if the intention is to rework the article in userspace and then copy and paste it into the main article, especially if there are quantifiable changes made in the main article.

<dd>I don't understand how copying and pasting the changes back into the article matters, as when he pastes them back in his changes will be logged. I'm also quite confused about your comment that it's especially so if major changes are made in the article. I don't see how this is any more a GFDL violation than copying the article into an offline text editor and copying pieces of that back in. If your concern is that the authors aren't cited, then that's hardly insurmountable: provide a link to the article's history or copy the history into the talk page (which is what we do when we update our help pages from Meta). <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnoutwood_5c9e.html" title="User:Snoutwood">Snoutwood</a> <a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnoutwood_5ab6.html" title="User talk:Snoutwood">(tóg)</a> 06:06, 1 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This editor attempted to insert items in said article and was rebuffed by the concensus of editors there. He then moved it to his userspace.

<dd>I contest it as a POV fork issue...Tom Harrison was, mainly asking the question, about whether it violates the GFDL. Either way, since the concensus there seemed to be against inclusion of some of the items he questioned, and the article discussion page is constantly being bombarded with commentary that has no supporting documetation, much like a blog, it is a contentious article, and things really should be hammered out on the discusion page. Had it been an article that wasn't always being reverted etc., it would be a lot easier to contrue the movement to userspace as a good faith effort to truly build a NPOV article.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 06:48, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For those who don't know, Mongo and I have been engaged in an edit war over the use of references, fact and opinion on articles related to the 9/11 attacks. Mongo has now seen fit to broaden the conflict to this page. For anyone thats interested, I can counter his diff above with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ACollapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center&amp;diff=50928841&amp;oldid=50926911" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ACollapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center&amp;diff=50928841&amp;oldid=50926911" rel="nofollow">this</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ACollapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center&amp;diff=50937276&amp;oldid=50930945" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ACollapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center&amp;diff=50937276&amp;oldid=50930945" rel="nofollow">this</a>.

<dd>How could you call an MP3 copy of a TV network news broadcast that is hosted on a personal Website a reliable source? I already know the answer is, "You can't," and I know that many Wikipedia editors don't know that. However, you could contact someone with high credentials in document reliability--at least a high school English teacher--and find out the answer. Please, go ask the Dean of your local college's English Department how reliable a source those MP3s are. I would love to hear about the University that would accept such material for its own courses. <a href="../../../p/o/o/User%7EPooua_d79b.html" title="User:Pooua">Pooua</a> 04:27, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>After numerous people have been urging me to post my biographical details on Wikipedia, I did so in a factual way. It got a notice for deletion, because of a vanity issue. However, I am internationally known, have innumerable accomplishments, and it is easy to verify by doing a google search under my name. I just put down details in a factual way. It was not so much as a vanity piece, as much as since I am well known (more so than a number of people listed) that if a posting were to be made, that I could at least insure that it was factually correct, and both interesting and insightful.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>Al Seckel</p>
<p>You can look up my page that I posted, and you can check it out by doing a google search under my name which will bring up literally pages and pages of references to me.</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

<li>Don't know anything about the issue itself, but I'm not sure where your statement the Policy cited is very new comes from. It isn't, hopefully it doesn't take much common sense to realise why using blocks to prevent people disrupting wikipedia is quite normal. However RFCs are requests for comments they aren't able to directly impose bans etc. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User%7EPgk_d0c7.html" title="User:Pgk">pgk</a><sup>(<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk"><font color="mediumseagreen">talk</font></a>)</sup> 08:58, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>A partisan "bums rush" to block started with discovery of very recent additions to Wiki policies, still poorly evolved/defined/tested, about commentary, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3ANo_personal_attacks#Off-wiki_personal_attacks" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3ANo_personal_attacks#Off-wiki_personal_attacks" rel="nofollow">"attacks"</a> if you will, in external websites, when some of us are still trying to salvage collaboration with the individual, who is currently not very active beyond several user/talk/RfC <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Whaleto" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Whaleto" rel="nofollow">edits</a> a day. There is a more fundamental set of issues underneath about minority contributors and the situation is very fragile and missteps will be detrimental to a number of editors. I think the RfC should conclude in several days and try to resolve a number of issues including other parties affected without the "nuclear option" just inflaming the situation. Alienation could only make the situation worse and the relevant policy needs maturation and definition. Actually I think the new policy on external commentary really needs its own RfC just to improve the definition of rights, as well as responsiblity. Thanks for your patient attention.--66.58.130.26 10:49, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've misunderstood how the system works, then. The intro to <a href="../../../b/p/_/WP%7EBP_c8aa.html" title="WP:BP">WP:BP</a> implies that anyone can apply for a block if policies are being violated: <i>All users may post block requests at Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents or the other venues listed below.

<dd>66.58.130.26's argument comes down to <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_pleading.html" title="Special pleading">special pleading</a>: asking that a serial violator of multiple policies be tolerated, on grounds that he behaves this way because everyone is krool to him because of his minority viewpoint.

<dd>Partly depends on how egregious one thinks more numerous counterparties cumulative behavior is.

I simply think that the RfC process needs to complete without external disruption and if given the chance to work it out, that there is a real possibility of substantial improvement. Other editors, with polar points of view and some pretty aggressive actions, subject of discussion in other RfCs, are apparently eager for a conveniently long/permanent block/ban on the individual, taking kill shots if you will (too bad, you're dead - no retrial needed), also helps maintain superior numbers. I know because I'm having to soak up the damage right now even though I am greatly overmatched on experience and numbers.--66.58.130.26 11:45, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Block was requested to be lifted, I denied, and now Thewolfstar has posted some less-than-friendly comments ("you nasty socialist-nazi admins and editors are making a real mistake. This is not a threat. This a statement of fact.") on her user talk page. I invite other admins and editors to take a quick look at her edit history and talk page. It has been suggested that she needs mentoring, not blocking. My inclination is to extend the block for further personal attacks, but as one of the "nasty socialist-nazi admins" I might be considered biased. I am not recusing myself from further action, but I do invite examination, comment, and if applicable, constructive criticism and/or input. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a><sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a></sup> 00:27, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>&lt;shrug&gt; I'm far more conservative about it and worry more and more about blocks coming from our discretion.

I just think we should, at the very least, be filing RfAR's at the same time that we do these things. If ArbCom is overworked, we need to address that issue separately.

<dd>Idealism certainly has its place. (So do PitAs.) IMHO, either Thewolfstar will learn to apply civility in interactions with other editors, in which case, <i>ipso facto</i>, there is no problem, or she does not, in which case we can certainly try the usual steps in dispute resolution, if there is any support for that idea at that time. Support may be overwhelmingly for other measures, if she continues.

<dd>The only good thing about this is that if he (or "she") actually owns a website, then it will be much easier to watch out for block evasions and investigate. The pattern of 1) saying that "socialism" is destroying the world, 2) everyone who disagrees with him (or "her") is a socialist, 3) asserting that socialists are out to suppress the truth (for which there is a small group of defenders) is strangely familiar to me. It's somewhat irrelevant, though, whether this is a reincarnation or a friend: the account really seems <i>incapable</i> of constructive work, as the political and paranoid get in the way of everything else. ArbCom is pretty much the only way forward, though. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:00, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

She's been quite friendly to me, but then, I've never been involved in any of the edit conflicts that she's been in as of late. Call it optimism, but I have hope that she'll eventually work her way into comfortable editing. Nonetheless, while I am fine playing the role of a friend and advocate, I don't really want to take sides either, especially when editors who I trust have been involved and feel that her conduct has been out of line. I'd just like to ask, as a favor, for a little extra patience and mercy on her behalf — not to be confused with tolerating rule violations, which should be dealt with promptly — and thank y'all for that which you've shown already. I appreciate the work you all have done. <b><a href="../../../t/i/j/User%7ETijuana_Brass_50f8.html" title="User:Tijuana Brass"><span style="color: #FF4500; font-family: Times New Roman; font-variant: small-caps;">Tijuana Brass</span></a><sup><a href="../../../t/i/j/User_talk%7ETijuana_Brass_8109.html" title="User talk:Tijuana Brass"><span style="color: #228B22;">¡Épa!</span></a>-<a href="../../../t/i/j/User%7ETijuana_Brass_EA_ade9.html" title="User:Tijuana Brass/EA"><span style="color: #228B22;">E@</span></a></sup></b> 12:16, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>For what it's worth, that's a reason I've wanted consideration by ArbCom. I'm afraid of users, even those like Wolfstar, thinking that their politics are why they're getting blocked. Obviously that wouldn't be the case here. It's this person's inability to deal with <i>any</i> disagreement without resorting to rage that's at stake. Users like that, regardless of contributions, aren't cut out for GFDL websites. They need ownership of edits and control over their own words, as the battle of competing claims seems to hit them in a psychological weak spot. I didn't come here to say that, though. I wanted merely to point out that Wolfstar has posted on Jimbo Wales's talk page and tried to explain his or her point of view there. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:36, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've actually reconsidered my thoughts on this: Please don't take this as an insult, or having any negative connotations, but it appears that Thewolfstar is suffering from some sort of mental illness that causes her paranoia (everyone is out to get me), delusions of grandeur (comparison of treatment here to nazi prison camps), and rage against other users.</dd>
<dd>And therein lies the problem. I don't think it's Thewolfstar's intent nor fault that she's acting like this. From accounts of Merecat and Tijuana Brass, it appears that Thewolfstar, when stable, can be a good normal editor. The problem is, when something she contributes gets edited out for some reason, she's unable to see it rationally as the wikipedia system at work: in her mind it's truly an attack against her, censorship, and the breeding grounds for a socialist dictatorship. I don't know what to do about that. Obviously the personal attacks and such need to stop. But, blocking, and harsh words from the admins will only make matters worse in this case. I'm really beginning to fear that there are only two options: permanently blocking her from wikipedia, or ignoring the entire situation. Neither one of them appeals to me in the slightest, but my simple mind isn't coming up with anything else. I think Thewolfstar needs help, both on and off wikipedia. I very much admire Merecat for volunteering to provide it here, especially in the face of so much flak, that's an outstanding job. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">⇒</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Swatjester_088b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Swatjester"><small><sup>Ready</sup></small></a> <a href="../../../r/s/t/RSTA_5dcc.html" title="RSTA"><small>Aim</small></a> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_United_States_Armed_Forces_74b7.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject United States Armed Forces"><small><sub>Fire!</sub></small></a> 21:58, 27 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>SWATjester, it's not a question of "fault" or assigning blame. Blaming the user is quite irrelevant, but <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not therapy</a>. What is her effect on the encyclopedia? There's no need to go any long way round via other people's "accounts" to see that, as Thewolfstar's own contributions are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Thewolfstar" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Thewolfstar" rel="nofollow">only a mouseclick away</a>. Have you tried reviewing them, looking for good normal edits, or any edits acceptable in an encyclopedia? Good luck. Or are you saying that even though she's never acted like "a good normal editor" on Wikipedia, Merecat and Tijuana Brass possess information that she <i>might</i> do so?

<dd>Bishonen, I reviewed all of Thewolfstar's contribs a couple days ago. I think I can count on 1-hand the ones that weren't somehow related to personal attacks, incivility etc. What I'm saying, is that I'm looking at WHY thewolfstar is acting this way, and I keep coming to the conclusion that she can't help it. Raging troll users don't go 180 bipolar between calmly talking with someone, and rampaging against the system. What I'm saying is, I think that Thewolfstar started out not knowing about wikipedia policy. She then makes some edits that earn her a warning. Boom. That triggers it. At this point, the irrationality kicks in, and she flips out. My point is that I don't think the flipping out was a conscious decision to do so: I think she fully and completely believes that there is a cabal out to get her, censor her, and other conspiracies. Did you look at that external site? Just judging from that, it looks like she probably thinks the government is out to get her. So she misconstrues the warnings she gets, takes the wrong actions and starts flaming/personal attacks, gets more warnings, and freaks out more. It just starts a vicious cycle. Now, what I meant with my comments above, is that I don't see the solution. You're asolutely right, nobody needs to be assigned blame here, but something does need to be done to prevent any nuclear explosions coming out in the future. So what is that going to be? Continued mentoring? Call me a pessimist, but I don't think it would work. Continued Blocking? I don't think that addresses the problem, and would be overly heavy handed. I know that I have no power to do anything, communities decision, etc. etc. I'm just saying that I've been thinking about it all day, and I just don't see any solution that both stops the personal attacks, and doesn't drive away a potentially good editor. Nobody should have to put up with the crap that Thewolfstar is giving you Bish, I'll be the first one to defend you as a top notch editor and a first rate admin. But flat out banning Thewolfstar, when it appears that she's <i>trying</i> to contribute, and being hampered by internal forces beyond her control (her own paranoia)...that just leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I could be totally wrong: Thewolfstar could be perfectly fine and just a troll. But if you look at it as objectively as you can, does it seem to you a little bit like she's not in control of her own mental state? <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">⇒</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Swatjester_088b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Swatjester"><small><sup>Ready</sup></small></a> <a href="../../../r/s/t/RSTA_5dcc.html" title="RSTA"><small>Aim</small></a> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_United_States_Armed_Forces_74b7.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject United States Armed Forces"><small><sub>Fire!</sub></small></a> 03:47, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Swat, while I agree with some of what you're saying, I don't think that Wolfstar has a mental problem. Having spent my undergrad years as a political science major, I got to know a number of people who were pretty zealous about their political ideologies. Wolfstar is one of those folks, I think — very passionate about what she believes. When that was combined with a bad start at Wikipedia, and an unawareness of policies, it turned ugly. That's not to say that there's ever an excuse for personal attacks, etc., but I can see a new user mistaking Wikipedia for something more akin to a blog or message board, where that kind of thing is more commonplace. Bish and Geogre are right in saying that her recent edits have been entirely devoted to user talks, but there's always two parties to a conflict, and perhaps continuing to berate her (combined with some honest mistakes in unblocking her) isn't helping much. But, with so many users monitoring her by now, I don't see much harm that could be done in offering her another shot to focus on articles, rather than her talk page, to see how it goes. If it turns bad again, I agree with Geogre, GFDL may not be her bag. <b><a href="../../../t/i/j/User%7ETijuana_Brass_50f8.html" title="User:Tijuana Brass"><span style="color: #FF4500; font-family: Times New Roman; font-variant: small-caps;">Tijuana Brass</span></a><sup><a href="../../../t/i/j/User_talk%7ETijuana_Brass_8109.html" title="User talk:Tijuana Brass"><span style="color: #228B22;">¡Épa!</span></a>-<a href="../../../t/i/j/User%7ETijuana_Brass_EA_ade9.html" title="User:Tijuana Brass/EA"><span style="color: #228B22;">E@</span></a></sup></b> 05:53, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Brought to you by the fine people at fisheaters, the one time prolific linkspammer. I found someone had added an Anglican commercial site. A frequent blanker removed the link. I readded it, since it wasn't a problem for one commercial link and they kept calling it MY link. I ignored it, some people look for any reason to troll until I found one of the blankers made this very complaint. My RFC that was filed in response to the one I filed on the fisheaters website owner would give you more insight into this sick sad tale. <a href="../../../d/o/m/User%7EDominick_690e.html" title="User:Dominick">Dominick</a> <a href="../../../d/o/m/User_talk%7EDominick_f59a.html" title="User talk:Dominick"><sup>(TALK)</sup></a> 19:25, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>By most standards "Xs are well endowed and are on the giving end of anal sex" is a compliment, though the choice of article does confuse it somewhat.

<p>An odd fellow.

Has been blocked on occasion for vandalims and personal attacks, and seems to have a severe inability to comprehend consensus and established fact. When provided with sources, he ignores them completely, instead descending to personal attacks and other bits of silliness.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive95_c51d.html" title="Edit section: Israelbeach Vs. Woggly">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Israelbeach Vs. Woggly</span></h2>
<p>In the past 24 hours there has been an escalation in the war of the words between <a href="../../../i/s/r/User%7EIsraelbeach_1341.html" title="User:Israelbeach">user:Israelbeach</a> and <a href="../../../w/o/g/User%7EWoggly_b7b8.html" title="User:Woggly">user:Woggly</a>. Woggly who never apologized for her personal attacks against Israelbeach was never addressed or blocked for these attacks by the administrators. In fact, she has been attacking Israelbeach, whose identity is for all to see, from an anonymous position. Not very fair or ethical!</p>
<p>Israelbeach, in turn, revealed Woggly's identity, something he was wrong for doing. According to Wiki policy: "This sort of behavior is blockable on its own (for example, moving another user's User Talk page), but should be considered an aggravating factor for the purposes of the block. For example, behavior that would earn a 1 day ban might become a 1 week ban if the Administrator believes the behavior was for the purposes of harassment. <i>The block should only be enforced after warning the user and these pleas go ignored.</i>"</p>
<p>Israelbeach was warned by <a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">user:jpgordon</a> and according to the logs deleted all material within minutes. <i>Israelbeach should not have been blocked according to Wiki policy as he never ignored any warnings by adm but reacted quickly to them</i>.</p>
<p>Woggly is now rightfully worried about legal action that Israelbeach can take against her for stating, without substance, that he was "dangerous" and other accusations made in front of his local community and the world public. She now appears to be leaving Wikipedia on her own.</p>
<p><b>Solution:</b> Both Israelbeach and Woggly are professional editors and should be encouraged to stay with the Wiki project. The block on Israelbeach should be removed immediately, as it only serves to increase conflict. Remember, after a first warning, Israelbeach on his own removed all personal data even though he thought he was correct due to that personal information regarding Woggly was posted by Woggly with a direct link to Wikipedia that anyone can find on a simple Google search.</p>
<p>Both Israelbeach and Woggly should be warned with no punitive action taken and instructed not to interact with one another on Wikipedia. These are two professionals with tremendous pride - do not expect either to aplogize at this point. We must encourage both users to stay, to avoid court action (with the documentation that Israelbeach has on these clear personal attacks, no judge would deny Woggly's guilt) and keep Wikipedia operating with less negative news coverage.</p>
<p>I do not blame Woggly or Israelbeach for their now wanting to resign from Wikipedia, I place the blame solely on the desk of the administrators (with the exception of <a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">user:jpgordon</a>) who could have taken action on the personal attacks which started this conflict. Woggly and Israelbeach are both assets to Wikipedia, all action should be taken to keep them here.

Despite the fact that diffs show his edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Peter_Dale_Scott&amp;diff=34391060&amp;oldid=32565751" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Peter_Dale_Scott&amp;diff=34391060&amp;oldid=32565751" rel="nofollow">[38]</a> was almost identical to Scott's page <a href="http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~pdscott/" class="external autonumber" title="http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~pdscott/" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>, Brainhell claims that his edit was "SUBSTANTIALLY different from Scott's page, in non-trivial ways", and therefore he now owns the copyright to his edit. In truth, he just switched around a few words. I've reached my limit with this user; he refuses to entertain the possibility that he may not understand how copyright works. Could someone else go over the discussion on <a href="../../../p/e/t/Talk%7EPeter_Dale_Scott_ee0b.html" title="Talk:Peter Dale Scott">Talk:Peter Dale Scott</a> and talk to him please?</p>
<p>One thing you should know, another Wikipedian e-mailed Scott about his page's copyright. Scott responded by posting a noncommercial-only license on his page, which is still GFDL-incompatible. Brainhell doesn't understand this point either, and he now believes that Scott has relinquished his copyright entirely. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 04:07, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, the only way we can use any text verbatim is if it is in the public domain. Non-commercial licenses are not enough to satisfy Wikipedia's copyright policy, and unless we can get evidence that the page is released under the GFDL, a compatible free license, or in the public domain, we cannot copy it. It is a copyvio, whether it is plagiarized outright or just paraphrased it without citing the original source.</dd>
<dd>A further note: Wikipedians agree to release their contributions under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. There's even a nice link just below the edit window as a reminder. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">xd</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a> - <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_edit_counters_Flcelloguy%27s_Tool_0e9a.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject edit counters/Flcelloguy's Tool">help us</a>)</sup> 04:19, 1 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I already know that, I was wondering if someone else could talk to Brainhell. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 15:50, 1 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I won't, I'm afraid, because I've tried talking to this user before. He has demonstrated ... mmm... unusual inflexibility over the User:Lucky 6.9 business. Lucky left the project because of what he and some other people perceived as implacable persecution over a rather minor matter by Brainhell. Lucky's departure appears to please Brainhell, though he still worries about the fact that Lucky isn't deadminned as well. Many users tried to speak to Brainhell over that. My advice would be to not waste your breath, but go straight to the next step, whatever it may be (I haven't reviewed the actual page involved). <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 00:59, 3 May 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<p>I expanded Peter Dale Scott/Temp a bit.

<p>Appeals to Fluffy to stop just produces more agressive abuse. At this stage someone needs to intervene.

<p>The guy has completely out of control at this stage with his attacks. (None of us can for the life of us see what he is complaining about! He produces as "evidence" links that are empty or show the exact opposite of what he claims, then accuses Damac of lies, dishonesty, yada yada yada.) But his abuse of Damac got so severe that after issuing a number of warnings to stop I ended up blocking him. The guy has a serious problem. Whether he is a troll or merely someone with a mental illness that impaired his judgment is up to guesswork — though my gut feeling was the former — but Damac did nothing to deserve all the personal attacks and diatribes. I would have left the blocking to someone else if I could find them but I couldn't find an admin and something needed to be done immediately. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:#006666; background-color:orange"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 23:23, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My own thoughts: "Monkeypuke" is bad, but not horrible; consider asking the user to change it (only one edit, BTW, no history to gauge). Same with "Horsepoo" (possible vandal account, but only four edits; I'd say lift block, ask user to change name, and watch. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadioKirk_a5db.html" title="User:RadioKirk"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; color: #161;">Radio</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RadioKirk_8f39.html" title="Special:Contributions/RadioKirk"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; color: #161;">Kirk</span></a> <span style="font-size: 10px; color: #161;">talk to me</span> 00:15, 3 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd><i>Informing</i> users of a vote isn't votestacking. <i>Advocacy</i> would be. The comments I saw simply informed others of a vote (which is OK), made an accusation that some people were seeking votes to delete (which isn't, but as it didn't indicate whether <i>they</i> or their opponents were advocating deletion, therefore mitigated any transgression) and invited people to vote (which is OK).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You in the past have accused other users of all sorts of contamination and vote-stacking if they informed anyone else that there is a vote taking place. I think, as before, your behaviour is a gross over-reaction to users informing others that a vote is taking place, given that without being informed by others most people would not be aware that a vote was taking place, must less a vote in which they had an interest.</dd>

<dd>Looking at the afd and tfd pages, all too often most votes on many issues involve the same cabal of people, many of whom scream votestacking the moment someone else appears, having been told there was a vote taking place on a topic that they might want to participate in. It seems that users are meant to possess some sort of <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">wikipsychic powers</a> to know without being told what is going on every day on every page. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:#006666; background-color:orange"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 23:29, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>This AfD closure was out-of-process. People were leaving legitimate comments and reasons for their positions. Notifying people about an AfD is not "vote stacking". Even advocating that they take a certain position in the AfD is not against any policy. Some people may not like it, but it is not against policy.

<p>"Out of process" is one of those nothing-phrases. Were the blocks appropriate? Possibly.

<dd>If you don't like the phrase "out of process" I will give you another one. The early closure was unfair and illegitimate. It was unfair because people were going there with an expection of having their voices heard and considered with respect to the matter. Illegitimate because there was no good reason to close the AfD early. The blocks are unfair and against policy becuase the blocks themselves, being that they have no basis in policy, are a violation of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 00:07, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have unblocked both. I can find no rule that allows their blocking. They did not say "come and vote 'x' way", just "come and vote". That is not in any way a blockable offence. All it does is increase knowledge and partipation. If leaving unsolicited messages on more than one talk page about issues is spamming then everyone, including Jimbo, would have to be blocked because 100% of Wikipedians "spam" under that definition all the time. Indeed Clyde is guilty of spamming by alerting various users to what he did. If they are blocked for spamming, then so must he, and everyone else. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:#006666; background-color:orange"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 00:04, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is wikilawyering nonsense. Gaming the system is disruption and disruption is blockable. It is irrelevant what one says in spamming, since spammers invariably notify people they feel are likely to see things their way. Informing one or two knowledgable people, who might add insight to the debate is one thing, but anything more than that is an attempt to play the numbers game. Frankly to compare this to general posts on userpages is just idiotic. And actually, <i>your</i> unblocking is out of process and may well be viewed by arbcom as wheel-waring. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><small><sup>ask?</sup></small></a> 00:15, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>When in doubt and you cannot find a rule to defend your argument, throw some snide comment about "wikilawyering"!!! Some things never change. There is no rule against contacting users in a non-advocational manner. The arbcom can confirm that. I simply applied the rules. Try learning them sometime. Nowhere in Wikipedia did we give you wikipope powers of infallibility to give you an ability to make up your own rules as you go along where they suit you. Cyde broke the rules.

<p>I disagree that this should not be written policy somewhere; if it happens often enough to be argued about and discussed as an unwritten policy, for heaven's sake someone write it down so that you can point to it and warn people "Hey, don't do that". We have achived instruction creep, but it's not documented, and that's not fair to the users. "Commonly held informal policy" is generally by nature arbitrarily and randomly abusive to users.</p>

<p>This is getting crazy. He closed a vote out of process, having blocked people for telling other people a vote was going on. His blatent abuse of his position, which led to the forced closure, is being discussed on the Deletion Review page.

<dd>(after many edit conflicts) While it may have made sense for Cyde to issue a warning prior to blocking, the behavior the editors were engaging in constituted disruption which is blockable by itself. Second, closing a highly acrimonious, disrupted AfD early where the AfD is clearly going to result in a keep or a no-consensus is well-within the discretion of an admin. Any objections to that should be brought to the deletion review page, not here, and are then only relevant for a relisting or not of the article and are not relevant to demands that Cyde relinquish his adminship(which frankly, I find a bit ridiculous). Furthermore, please note that the current messages being sent about the DR only to the poeple who voted for deletion is exactly the same sort of unacceptable votestacking. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 01:16, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>Actually, here is one case (I think there are more, but I haven't had time to go look for them) where the Arb Com ruled that spamming talk pages for votes in an almost identical manner to this constituted disruption <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Guanaco%2C_MarkSweep%2C_et_al_f294.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Guanaco, MarkSweep, et al">and the user was blocked for it</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 01:28, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>On March 4, StrangerInParadise used the Special:Whatlinkshere feature to contact 43 users with a certain userbox.

<dd>It seems to me what was disruptive was making a personal attack by claiming someone was a "rogue admin".

<dd>While that might be a good thing to discuss at some point, the basic point remains: If even the editors who are unhappy with Cyde agree that its a plausible interpretation of the Arb Com rulings, it's very hard to see how he can be reprimanded for it(especially whent there are other editors like myself who interpreted the Arb Com ruling in precisely the same way). <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 01:44, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

Any substantial debate, regardless of how lopsided the keep/delete count may be, implies that an early closing would be a bad idea.</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_policy#Early_closure" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_policy#Early_closure" rel="nofollow">[44]</a> (emphasis mine) Clearly, discussion was ongoing and the AfD should not have been closed. Cyde was not "doing what is right". He had even voted on the AfD prior to closing it.

<dd>Cyde's behavior has been completely appropriate. He might run into some conflicts with people that disagree with him, but I have seen no basis for stating that he "wasn't doing what was right".

<p>If we're still looking for the arbitration case concerning talk-page spamming, it was <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_IZAK_d3bf.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/IZAK">Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/IZAK</a> that included the finding "6) IZAK has used the communication system of Wikipedia aggressively in an attempt to influence the outcome of Wikipedia polls, particularly with respect to Isr/Pal issues." and the accompanying principle against such actions. Also, as a voter in the StrangerInParadise case, and the one that wrote up all the proposals, I can say that the vote-stacking spam was absolutely a major part of the disruptive behavior that got him sanctioned. In any case, arbcom precedents do not generate policy, though they ought to be useful measures of good practice, but I find myself astounded that anyone would defend talk-page spamming. It is ridiculous to assume that any useful measure of consensus can be gotten when such disruptive behavior takes place. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 04:16, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Random users having to hang around admin pages watching side conversations or read admins / arbcom members minds' to understand what is ok and what isn't is very, very wrong. I'm fine with this being an official WP policy; having it an unwritten but blockable WP policy is WP community abuse of lower level WP members. Spell it out, or don't enforce it. This won't cover new innovative methods of abuse the first time or two they happen, but this is far from the first time WP has seen AFD related spamming. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 21:40, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Quoting <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">Wikipedia official policy on sockpuppetry</a>:</p>

<dd>It is considered <i>highly inappropriate or unacceptable</i> to externally advertise Wikipedia articles that are being debated, or where one wishes to stir up debate, in order to attract users with likely known views and bias, in order to strengthen one side of a debate and influence consensus or discussion.

</dl>
<p>Does this policy really apply? I keep seeing mixed signals on "inviting all one's friends". Some say it is fine to invite people to AfDs, but my reading of the official policy explicitly forbids it.

<ul>
<li>Jdforrester, the admin who placed the block, hasn't had a chance to comment (unless there was off-wiki communication...?).</li>
<li>The block is more than a week old. A few hours to discuss shouldn't make a difference.</li>
<li>Sgrayban made legal threats on-wiki following his block: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sgrayban&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=49935373" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sgrayban&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=49935373" rel="nofollow">[48]</a>.</li>
<li>I'd like to avoid any actions that might be seen to have even a hint of wheel-warring to them.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I hope that Master Jay will reverse his action pending a discussion here. I don't mean to come down too hard on him—it's a <a href="../../../g/o/o/Good_Thing_f477.html" title="Good Thing">Good Thing</a> that he posted a notice here for review in the first place. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 03:16, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Not one person here admin or not is above the US Laws regarding emails and electronic privacy communications. If Adam Carr wants to post emails sent to him that his problem and no one elses. Wikipedia admin should have deleted the email since it violates US Law and reminded the user that it is illegal and not to mention it reveals personal imformation which is another thing Wikipedia says it doesn't allow. So either wikipedia Admin are above the law and can interprete there own meanings are they also willing to finish this to end because I am more then willing. Although I really think James Whales(Jimbo) will agree that the actions by the admin that banned me was illegal and he should have removed the private email from wikipedia instead. Think about this first, is anyone really willing to see this through? I suggest to let me be and let me handle this the way it was started in the first place which was in private emails and not on wikipedia. --<a href="../../../s/g/r/User%7ESgrayban_0d5b.html" title="User:Sgrayban">Scott Grayban</a> 05:23, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've reblocked Sgrayban indefinitely for the above on-wiki legal threat, since the rationale for unblocking, if I'm reading correctly, were that his legal threats were off-wiki and that if it had been on-wiki he should have been blocked.

<p>I'm not so sure this one is so cut and dried. The block of the original username I find correct; this one's borderline.

<p>I support the block on username alone. Is it offensive? No. Would it be appropriate on MySpace? Yes, if their policies allow it. Is it the username of an <b>encyclopedia</b> editor? No. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 14:52, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I <b>do not</b> support the block based on username alone. It would be another thing entirely if the username was "Lesbian and bi girls kill babies", but this is most certainly not the case. What is offensive about saying a group is 'awesome'? And why can't the username of an encyclopedia contain such? If the policing of usernames requires the determination of them being 'encyclopedial' or some vague notion of what's appropriate for an encyclopedia, then what's next? Why, in that case, have usernames at all, and force everyone who edits non-anonymously to use their real name. Also note that what you are leaning to right now is the creation of policy, and if that's going to happen this issue needs a lot more attention than this. --<span style="background: #CCEECC;"><a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKickstart70_e0ea.html" title="User:Kickstart70">Kickstart70</a></span>-<span style="background: #CCCCEE;"><a href="../../../k/i/c/User_talk%7EKickstart70_36c5.html" title="User talk:Kickstart70">T</a></span>-<span style="background: #EECCEE;"><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kickstart70_b60c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kickstart70">C</a></span> 15:32, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I can't see any way in which someone would register that name except for the purpose of being confrontational. Userboxes have been deleted for that very reason. It reminds me of -Ril- signing with that annoying ~~~~ signature, and putting on his user page that he was going to keep that signature unless the arbitration committee forced him to change it ("live with it" or "learn to cope" or something like that).

<p>Significantly I have not been blocked when entering other edit talk pages, during the same online visit.</p>

<p>Considering that previous blocks of accounts conducting vote spamming have been a little controversial, I figured I would toss this one up here. I have indefinitely blocked the new user account <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERictonilpog_70f4.html" title="User:Rictonilpog">User:Rictonilpog</a>, as, aside from setting up a bunch of user boxes on their user page, the account's only actions have been to spam user pages to call for votes on a certain AFD. I don't normally like to get into these types of controversial blocks, but this is almost certainly a sockpuppet account of someone, given how much knowledge they displayed of the project. (Userboxes, AFD, etc.) And they were going 90 MPH with their spamming. - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasAndroid_b0eb.html" title="User:TexasAndroid">TexasAndroid</a> 18:07, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The more I look at it, the more I wonder what is actually up here. While it technically spoils whatever the joke is, I feel the joke/prank is over at this point. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERictonilpog_70f4.html" title="User:Rictonilpog">User:Rictonilpog</a> created a subpage of his User page, User talk:Rictonilpog/Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Political fallout from seperation issues. Notice the AFD part of the name. That is what I saw and acted upon. The page is actually about whether a certain cat is cute. He then started the Spam run, asking people to come vote on the cute cat page. But nothing on the spammed notice showed what the vote was actually about. And if you hovered over the link, as I did, and did not read close enough, as I did not, you may only see that it appears to be a vote on an AFD page for a potentially inflamitory topic.</dd>
<dd>I get the feeling that someone was trying to stir up a reaction of some sort, fooling potentially politically sensetive people into coming racing to a political vote page only to find a cute cat vote instead. I still do not think they planned on an admin being the one fooled like I was.</dd>
<dd>Given the recent kerfuffles over vote spamming, I wonder if someone wasn't trying to make some sort of point with all this. That would be a flagrant <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> violation, but it's hard to know at this point.</dd>
<dd>At this point all I know for certain is that the reasons under which I blocked him, spamming for an AFD vote, were not true, so I could not justify leaving him blocked. If someone wants to reblock him for the spamming itself, or for WP:POINT violations, that's up to them. - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasAndroid_b0eb.html" title="User:TexasAndroid">TexasAndroid</a> 19:12, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have a suspicion which it would be pointless to voice. If he starts it up again or does other blockable things, block and RFCU; if this is a one-time <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> game and he's finished, then leave it as blocks are supposed to be preventative, not punative (I think). <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 19:52, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>IMO, spamming is spamming whether it is to an actual AfD page or to some joke page. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 21:45, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
