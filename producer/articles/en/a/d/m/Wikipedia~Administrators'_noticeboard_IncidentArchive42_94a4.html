<p>Yet another lie from a user incapable of telling the truth.

<dd>I agree. I did express some concern on Jtdirl's talk page about the precedent set by the subject of an article locking it. I am satisfied by his answer that he acted in good faith, though it would have been better in my opinion to have had another admin lock this particular article. I think this anonymous complaintant is not acting in the best of faith, and I think if one looks at the history there is little doubt this is yet another incarnation of a blocked user. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathunder_61f8.html" title="User:Jonathunder">Jonathunder</a> 20:15, 2005 August 22 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Labelling statements of fact and honest debate as "lies, stalking, vandalism and harassment" and using admin powers to win edit wars is a poor sort of example to set, and being backed up by a member of the ArbComm merely underscores this point. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMineeyes_e408.html" title="User:Mineeyes">Mineeyes</a> 20:16, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In my opinion, the total of behavior of Jtdirl shows sensitivity that has gone too far, and the use of/position of admin aggravates the problem. It really is disruptive if a person with sort of paranoia may use privileged enforcement alone by his own judgement, in his own case. The situation seems such that the judgement of the person in question is heavily influenced by his problems, are they "Jtdirl is being wikistalked and harassed" and/or some other problems. We should understand that already from the language Jtdirl used above desctibing me. For these sorts of situations, there should be clear requirement of recusal. If the suspected "sockpuppet" or whatever (or alleged vandalism) is objectively seen such, <i>another</i> will do things that are needed. I believe that idea is written in many places in WP policies. How is it that it is not followed? <a href="../../../2/1/7/User%7E217.140.193.123.html" title="User:217.140.193.123">217.140.193.123</a> 20:49, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Jtdirl did nothing wrong. He removed a statement from an article that did not belong (It was a self reference and it was not notable in the grand scheme of things), and not only that, but it was the first time he had edited that article in over two years. FURTHERMORE, the comment he removed was added by none other than permabanned member NoPuzzleStranger aka Wik. Jtdirl was right to do it, and then people and/or sockpuppets put it back when it did not belong. He was absolutely right to protect it, it was being vandalized. Their summaries show a blatant disregard for the wiki way - "Useful to know so as to watch for shameless self-promotion. *Keep*" "It's a warning, not a self-reference." "Warning of shameless self-manipulation" - Since the last time he'd edited was two years prior, what exact manipulation are these folks referring to? Stalking and trolling. Deal with accordingly. --<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolbez_ce9f.html" title="User:Golbez">Golbez</a> 22:00, August 22, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Krhm. "Not over two years"... Concluding from writing style, topics chosen and also from the IP's Irish location, the IP 159.134.137.114 which made plenty of edits to that article on 18 March 2005 (see User:159.134.137.114, contibutions etc), in fact seems highly likely to be <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">User:Jtdirl</a>. Of course it is a kind act towards WP that he shares his private knowledge of the topic (and I wouldn't raise such issues as Original Research, POV, etc). It would not be correct to allege that the IP is Jtdirl's sockpuppet, as by definition an IP never is sockpuppet, only accounts may be. If such sitiation arises, David Gerard and arbitrators may then judge whether the IP is same person as Jtdirl. <a href="../../../2/1/7/User%7E217.140.193.123.html" title="User:217.140.193.123">217.140.193.123</a> 22:42, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>By my definition, none of the edits I looked at are <i>vandalism</i>. They don't look like good edits, I agree, but that's not the same as vandalism. I feel calling these edits vandalism is a way of fitting them into a certain box in order to enable them to be dealt with more easily. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 22:19, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

What bothers me is that such an assertion would be made when a user has deliberately chosen a username. On the same note, I think it was in rather bad taste for <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkyring_afb0.html" title="User:Skyring">Skyring</a> constantly to address him and refer to him here on Wikipedia as "Jim". Whether his real name is John Smith, <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Duffy_e0d6.html" title="Jim Duffy">Jim Duffy</a>, or <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Charles_07f6.html" title="Prince Charles">Charles Mountbatten-Windsor</a>, he has a perfect right to be anonymous on Wikipedia if he so chooses. I may really be <a href="../../../j/2E/k/J.K._Rowling_a858.html" title="J.K. Rowling">J.K. Rowling</a>, but if I chose the username Ann Heneghan, I have the right to expect that people use that name to refer to me. In any case, <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">Jtdirl</a> had not edited that article for over two years, and it took him over four months to discover that <a href="../../../n/o/p/User%7ENoPuzzleStranger_093e.html" title="User:NoPuzzleStranger">User:NoPuzzleStranger</a> had inserted into it the statement that <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Duffy_e0d6.html" title="Jim Duffy">Jim Duffy</a> was editing Wikipedia under the username <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">Jtdirl</a> — hardly what you'd expect from someone who has got over-possessive about an article because he's the subject of it.

<dd>The above is all very precious, as a lawyer would say, but there is no doubt about the equivalence of <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">user:jtdirl</a> and <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Duffy_e0d6.html" title="Jim Duffy">Jim Duffy</a>. Regardless of whether he takes a long time to edit his own article (and as noted, a Dublin anon made a major rewrite in March this year), the information is certainly pertinent to the article. The article itself mentions various publications from which Jim Duffy presumably derives some income, and the question needs to be asked as to how far Wikipedia is prepared to go in promoting a writer's interest, or self-interest. Just how does this differ from the various promotional pages we see for bands of little renown which are intended to drum up recognition? <a href="../../../s/e/l/User%7ESelectman_31f7.html" title="User:Selectman">Selectman</a> 22:37, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I prefer the phrase "edits made by sockpuppets of a user banned for a year for wiki-stalking." That's clear-cut. Really clear-cut. I just found and blocked another likely sockpuppet of Skyring.

<p>This was peremptorily deleted by one sysop who disputed the close.

<li>Yes.

<dd>No. The deletion was closed with a no consensus result. Someone then contacted me and asked if it was okay to relist on VfD. I said he should do that with my blessing because it was a close result and there were only four voters. Someone else went ahead and listed in on VfD. It was then that Radiant simply edited the original VfD page to reflect his preferred result and summarily deleted the article. The article was restored and is now being discussed in the right place: VfD. It was a failed attempt by Radiant to hijack a legitimate VfD. Whether VFU is bust or not is moot; the article never belonged there. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 17:46, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There has been a lot of that. Tony decides that things weren't good speedies, so he undeletes them and, instead of saying, "I could expand that," says, "Improper" speedy. Admins can undelete <i>improper</i> speedies, not "unwise" or "bad" speedies. Tony further refuses to honor VfU when something <i>is</i> listed there, and he won't use it for anything. He has said that VfU is for the non-admin only. This is not new or news, and it won't be settled until ArbCom acts. Polite requests and even firm demands have meant little. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:20, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is a little bit naughty. The VfD was closed and then someone unilaterally deleted the article. It was thus clearly an out-of-process deletion. If you disagree with he undeletion policy that states that a sysop can undelete an out-of-process speedy, then campaign honestly to have the policy changed instead of falsely claiming that I'm refusing to "honor" something that doesn't enter into the equation.</p>
<p>And arbcom won't act over a dispute on policy, you know that. If you really do think (and goodness knows, I suppose it is possible) that a sysop is required to take what he thinks is an obvious out-of-process speedy to VFU instead of just restoring it, then have policy changed and I'll abide by it. I should have thought that an article that is deleted despite the VfD being closed as a keep is is a clear case of an out-of-process speedy, and as the article was headed for VfD anyway I don't see that it makes much difference. As it happens, the second VfD was closed as a redirect by the very same sysop who had earlier decided unilaterally that it was a delete. The power of consensus, you see... --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 02:19, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Are mostly coming in through two ranges assigned to Prodigy Internet in Melbourne: 202.147.97.0/24 and 203.82.183.0/24. I dunno if these are a business or a net cafe or what, but there has been literally <i>nothing</i> from these two ranges in the last two months except trolling, vandalism and sockpuppetry. I've blocked both /24s for three months. That's a fairly extreme block for an IP, but those who've had fun with the sockpuppet legions might like the following list:</p>
<p>Newshounder, Terpt, Bertzenfartzen, Chokitoass, Barnabyhanson, Plunger, Rebeve, Longterg, Edwardlongstreet, Towelhedzras, Justase, Osamabeenlaughing, Adam Corr, AdamEve, Thecunninglinguists, Shintaro, Shukidalam, WhereIsTheLove?, Cupcaketwinkie, Frankly, Carlaz, KarlJetter, Dirtyboo, Ericcantona, Hansolocousin, Dertyharry, Planetaustin, Moodaltering, Rousterspor, Pewtang, Hooters, Peacenick, Woozer, Coqsportif, Gookoid, Reject, Toshiba, Jakemelen, Huchi, DavidGlick, Sunak and Wakemeupwhen.</p>
<p>All of those are the same user or one of two people. It doesn't really matter which, IMO, as (as I said) there's been literally <i>nothing</i> positive from those IP ranges in the last two months.

<dd>Well, at least some of them are legit, if somewhat discardist. Example: <a href="../../../t/a/k/Takaharu_Furukawa_52a5.html" title="Takaharu Furukawa">Takaharu Furukawa</a> is now a redirect to <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archery_at_the_2004_Summer_Olympics_052c.html" title="Archery at the 2004 Summer Olympics">Archery at the 2004 Summer Olympics</a> and the target confirm that person did compete as described. <i>However</i>, he only redirected the page, without a merge. That is just being WP:BOLD, but does seem to discard a fair bit of information. Still, the editor would seem to be within their 'rights' to do that. I checked a handful and they seem to be the same thing. The only problem is that he hasn't delinked the now-redirected articles from their target, so they've become circular links. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 02:07, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think what is truly worrying is the complete lack of notification to a user that his edits are turning into a source of major discussion (thanks to --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> for being polite in this regard). The archery articles that I have redirected I did so because the articles in question contained no information that was not already contained on the archery page. One who examined the matter more closely would notice that I did not redirect several archery articles which did, in fact, include more information than country of origin and finishing place at the Olympics. I did not merge any material because, quite simply, there was nothing to merge. Obviously, if a large number of users disagree with these assertions, I am not going to start a protracted edit war or anything silly like that, but I challenge anyone to inform me as to the value of articles that contain nothing but the nationality and finishing place of athletes when this information is already contained on the main page of the subject. These articles are not deleted, and any editor is free at any time to expand these redirected stubs into well-written and informative articles, or even poorly written and uninformative articles as long as they contain information that is not already found on the archery page. Note that I also have been deleting the links in the archery article as I have been redirecting the articles, so any that I did not delink were mere oversights. (EDIT: After examining the archery page more closely, I realize that the contestants are linked multiple times on the page and that I have only been delinking them from the main listing. This was, as I said, an oversight and not on purpose) In the future, if anyone has problems with my actions, they should come to me first; this is only polite. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 16:22, August 23, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi. Let me point this out: The articles you reverted do in fact contain information that is not already found on the archery page, namely birth dates. In addition, they are part of categories. My view is therefore that redirects should be avoided. I will try adding information here and there to make them more "worthy" of inclusion. <a href="../../../p/u/n/User%7EPunkmorten_c486.html" title="User:Punkmorten">Punkmorten</a> 00:20, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry for all the fuss; I didn't know enough about the subject to start a discussion with Indrian over whether it was a good idea or not.

<p>It would probably be a good idea to ask the editor who put the information there where they got it, it's probably public domain somewhere.

<p>It's a bit of a Catch-22 situation; if the article really does contain classified information, and the chap who has just blanked it is justified in his actions and has been authorised to do so, then he has actually <i>confirmed</i> that the information - which is persistent and available in the page history - is classified information, in which case he is probably breaking a rule or two himself. -<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshley_Pomeroy_6ac2.html" title="User:Ashley Pomeroy">Ashley Pomeroy</a> 22:11, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Quite. My initial impulse on seeing this was to consider saving a copy to my hard drive, although I didn't bother because it's nearly certainly a hoax. Given how Wikipedia content gets dispersed to mirrors and database dumps, it's likely that the best thing a goverment entity could do if its secrets were posted on Wikipedia would be to simply ignore it, and not draw attention to it in any way. Alternatively, they could have a mole editor list it on VfD as "unverifiable", which would be workable if Wikipedia were the only public source (and if it wasn't, they've lost the secret anyway). <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 23:16, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Honestly, unless someone's blanking a vandalism warning, I don't complain about it. If you are trying to communicate about a dispute, however (and it appears you are), I take blanking of a page not only as an indication to move it to the next step in dispute resolution, but also as excellent evidence to be presented on your behalf. But I would say that it, in itself, is not vandalism. Deleting instead of archiving is a perfectly reasonable method; I've seen admins do it.

<p>If you actually read the above you will have to see that there was nothing wrong with my removing the discussion and your insistence on putting it back is clear harassment. Furthermore, the argument was not-mid argument because Squeakbox here insisted upon getting the last word in and continuing to press his harassment during his bad behavior. Furthermore I notice other people on his talk page complaining about his agressive behavior and baseless threats. Perhaps it's about time I started filing complaints against editors who are breaking policy instead of just sitting back and waiting for them to file false accusations against me. I have reverted my talk page again... but you are right about one thing: It is not over, because something needs to be done about admins who think they are above the policies here and how go on crusades of harassment against people who point out that they did something wrong. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 19:07, August 23, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Nobody has to create an archive if they don't want to.</li>
<li>If someone removes an old comment from their talk page then assume good faith and believe them when they are saying they are clearing out old stuff.</li>
<li>If someone removes a new comment from their talk page then this implies two things
<ol>
<li>They have seen that comment</li>
<li>They do not wish to respond to it</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Since they have seen the comment, reposting it is pointless. At RFAr we ask for evidence that a notice was <i>posted</i> about the RFAr.That's all. We do not require that the person has to keep the notice on thier talk page.</li>
<li>Since the person has indicated that they do not wish to discuss the matter, and nobody can <i>force</i> someone to discuss things, then reposting deleted conversations serves no useful purpose whatsoever. All it can be used for is harrasment, which is not allowed on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">(a tenth stroke)</a> 22:16, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I have not been harrassing DreamGuy but he most certainly has been harrassing me; without justification, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 22:29, August 23, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well if that is true then your best course of action is not to go to your harraser's talk page at all. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">(a tenth stroke)</a> 22:48, 23 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>But of course it's not true, so his harassing me on my talk page was even worse. The only alleged "harassment" was a good faith dispute over his actions on a RfC for his he falsely claimed did not have enough signatures and labeled speedy delete, and then when I removed the tag and pointed out that there was enough (a couple of times), he deleted some signatures from the page and then listed it for speedy delete again and removed it from the RfC page and very rudely assumed bad faith, harassed me, and got an admin involved. For him to claim I harassed him when a brief look at the edits involved (where it's still left to be seen, as the main page has in fact been speedily deleted due to intervention by an admin who has a history of showing up to take the side of anyone complaining against me, even if they are chronic 3RR block violators and etc.) shows clear uncivility, outright personal attacks and harassment by him is just absurd. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 14:50, August 25, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>and then harrass me withouit pausing for breath by wrongly accusing me of falsification, even though you know fully well I never falsified anything. I deleted invalid signatures, as you well know, because you have been told the signatures in question were dated from 4 days before the rfc began, and were pasted in by someone else without the permission of the signers, as that person has admitted. In spite of my requesting to you to explain how these signatures were "valid", and which policy states signatures pasted from a talk page from 4 days before the Rfc began have to be considered valid, you have faikled to explain why you believe the rules support such validations on an Rfc. What do you think would happen if your idea became policy, and outdated signatures posted from a talk page from 4 days before the beginning of an rfc were considered valid. It would destroy the Rfc process. But whatever the rights and wrongs of the policy, at the moment it does not allow out of date signatures pated froma a talk page without the permission of the signers is not now considered policy. Try changing policy if you feel about it that strongly, but don't harrass people for enforcing the one we have. I did not contact Slim, another invention. I was absolutely right to ignore the bad signatures. What frightens me is that if DreamGuy got his way any bad faith user could paste signatures from anywhere, ignore their date stamps and thus pursue whatever bad faith Rfc's they wanted. Wikipedia would not last very long with such a dishonest policy, yet this is the stance DreamGuy aggressively takes. When I question him on his rather outlandish beliefs around pasting signatures into an Rfc he does not answer me but instead blanks my comments, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 15:24, August 25, 2005 (UTC)</p>

For clarity I hear paste the Rfc as it was initially created. decide for yourselves if this is a legitimate Rfc. It is from Talk:Encyclopædia damatica#Use of multiple userID's?.

<p>I am readding the signatures which are at the heart of this dispute, and not included in your diff. They were pasted from Talk:Encyclopædia damatica onto the Rfc. DreamGuy claims they are valid for an Rfc starting on August 19. I claim they aren't, and that first ignoring them when removing Rfc/Girlvinyl from the Rfc page, and then deleting them when DreamGuy insisted they were valid for the Rfc, was perfectly legitimate behaviour on my part. Should we allow to certify Rfc's on a talk page, transfer the certifications to the Rfc and then use them as if they were signed when the Rfc was created, ignoring the fact that they are 4 days old, and were not put on the Rfc by the signers. Or should wee not allow such practices. Make your own minds up, but my understanding is that wikipedia does not allow such behaviour, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 17:48, August 25, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I see that this user was blocked. I don't know if simply having "troll" in the username is a good reason to block, especially since I haven't seen much disruption take place from this user, even though s/he appears to be very inclusionist (though not disruptive, and not a "blanket" keep voter on all VFD debates like <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChubby_Chicken_8f69.html" title="User:Chubby Chicken">User:Chubby Chicken</a> was). I think the subject of having/not having "troll" in the username has been discussed before and that the most common opinions were that it is acceptable to have "troll" in the username but that one is far less tolerant of vandalism or disruption coming from them. I see that Rossami discussed his concerns about the username with Trolderella, and perhaps a further admonition of the wisdom of such a username choice might be appropriate, but was a block really neccesary when most, if not all, of the edits are legitimate? <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 07:00, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

I blocked two Erwin Walshs now, they are <i>not</i> the same user because the userpage of the second Erwin Walsh I blocked is a redirect to the first one.

I commented on his talk page that fair use seems an unlikely claim for these images and immediately after I said that, he appears to have went away.</p>
<p>Strange as it seems, upon reflection, I am not actually sure he was trolling. Which is to say he may have been uploading pornographic pictures in a good faith effort to illustrate the pages pornographic actresses, without realizing that these were probably no good for copyright. But the question comes in, what to do now? Should one revert the changes to the models' pages and send the images to IFD? or perhaps just delete them? And I can't help wondering about the larger question.

<dd>IMHO if it was good faith it was insensitive, misleading, mis-informed, unrepresentative and plainly has the potential to provoke and distract. I know some editors want to "push the envelope" on the inclusion of images in WP but including something pulled straight from a contemporary porno flick is not my idea of helpful. It's "abusive" because anyone seriously editing this sort of article should realize that some of its readers would be annoyed by it (to put it mildly), for all the above reasons, <i>never mind the model's silicon enhancement</i>. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 13:06, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I guess it could work as a depiction. I mean, obviously it's acting, as Calton says, but I don't see why that necessarily makes it less valid as a depiction. I don't see why it shouldn't be considered good faith. But aside from that point I don't know if it's a helpful addition to the article, either. To be fair, if offensiveness is an issue, as Wyss seems to suggest, it seems a lot more moderate than a lot of the images we have on sex-related topics. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 13:10, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's no depiction, it's a fantasy, created for entertainment purposes. If the image had been included in the article's pornography section I likely would have deleted it without comment. Offensiveness is not the issue btw. For example, I have no problem with this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellatio" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellatio" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>, it's the context, content, placement and caption.

<dd>Well, I wasn't thinking about the fact that it was produced for entertainment factoring into the equation. Anyway, I think the basic point is that while it may not be the best choice of image for the article, it's not really a good faith question or something that needs to be raised on AN. If he starts revert warring over it, OK, then maybe. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 13:25, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't think it was in bad faith, bad taste maybe. I think putting a porno style photo into an article about one's lifestyle/sexual preference is a bit distasteful, but not enough to warrant action. Just revert and give reasons for the removal. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Who_d857.html" title="Special:Contributions/Who"><font color="#FF0033">∞</font></a><a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho_d957.html" title="User:Who">Who</a><a href="../../../w/h/o/User_talk%7EWho_fe12.html" title="User talk:Who"><font color="#00FF00">?</font><font color="#FF00FF">¿</font><font color="#0033FF">?</font></a> 13:31, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'd be concerned about this image from a copyright standpoint. For an article about the specific porn flick in question (or about pornographic films in general), a few still images might be appropriate. For an article about the broad topic of lesbians, two actresses faking it in a copyrighted film may be stretching the 'fair use' provision past its breaking point. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 13:38, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's certainly copyrighted and not licensed for our use. It could be <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">fairly used</a> in an article that discusses the movie it's taken from, or even possibly in an article that discusses the depiction of lesbian sex in mainstream pornography. (No, really. I'm sure there've been many <a href="../../../w/o/m/Women%27s_studies.html" title="Women's studies">women's studies</a> dissertations on the subject.)

<p>I assume it's not worksafe, so that's something to be considered too. There's no need for <a href="../../../l/e/s/Lesbian.html" title="Lesbian">lesbian</a> to contain non-worksafe images inline, and most people browsing in public won't expect it to. ~~ <b><a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickptar_0554.html" title="User:Nickptar">N</a></b> (<a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickptar_0d70.html" title="User talk:Nickptar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nickptar_06b7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nickptar">c</a>) 15:54, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Did Irate's case ever go through the ArbCom a second time? Or was the decision purely Jimbo's? I think even if Jimbo is going to impose a ban it should be temporary until we can get an Arb decision. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 13:03, 25 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The second final decision was to be monitored for 1 year, but then Jimbo banned indef after the IRC discussion. At least that's what I understood of the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Irate_009a.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Irate">arb decision</a>. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Who_d857.html" title="Special:Contributions/Who"><font color="#FF0033">∞</font></a><a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho_d957.html" title="User:Who">Who</a><a href="../../../w/h/o/User_talk%7EWho_fe12.html" title="User talk:Who"><font color="#00FF00">?</font><font color="#FF00FF">¿</font><font color="#0033FF">?</font></a> 13:07, 25 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's a shocking contrast, between just being monitored and being banned outright forever. I suppose if it did go through again the ArbCom would just rubberstamp what's already been done, but I maintain that things have been handled wrongly in this case. My attempts to raise the issue with Jimbo haven't gone anywhere, though. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 13:17, 25 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes there is a big step between monitoring and banning, but anyone who promises to distrupt the point of wikipedia (i.e. writing an encyclopaedia) who has a histroy of disruption (which I understand Irate has) should be blocked imho. However, regardless of whether he should or should not be banned, he has been banned and sockpuppets of banned users should be banned regardless. If Irate wants to complain about his ban then he should bring it up with Jimbo or another administrator by email or on the mailing list or somewhere. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 13:56, 25 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Personally, I never thought it was all that clear that he was promising to disrupt. I thought there was more than one way to interpret what Jimbo said that he said. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 18:25, 25 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Seemed clear to me. He promised to continue to follow the rules as he has always done. Since he has a history of not following the rules, he's saying he'll continue down that path. I don't see how there is any other way to interpret that. --<a href="../../../k/b/d/User%7EKbdank71_f952.html" title="User:Kbdank71">Kbdank71</a> 20:16, 25 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Maybe he was saying that he always <i>has</i> followed the rules, and will continue following them? Now, if that's it, then not only is the "offense" not bannable, it's not even an offense (and wouldn't be anyway since it was said on IRC, but I guess that's a mere technicality now—hey, if we're going to start dishing out punishments for IRC talk, boy have I got some charges to file...). <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 06:51, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Any kind of limitation (like throtteling) always somehow seems to turn out to bite the people who propose it. What happens if a logged in user is busy fixing a large wikiproject, for instance? It would make it very tough for people to make move-based fixes across large numbers of pages. Undo-like functions are typically a lot friendlier. Better rollback for vandals would be grand.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> 18:51, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay, I've worked out that the isNewbie test only limits the most recent 1% of registered accounts. That means that Willy must be registering sleeper accounts and waiting for them to grow up before launching rampages. It also explains why it doesn't go on ad nauseum, he can't just come back immediately when he runs out of appropriately aged accounts. I have suggested on the bugzilla thread that isNewbie should also test edits &gt; 100, and that SpecialNewusers could really come in handy in a situation like this. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 21:12, August 25, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Another idea that might solve things like this came to me in another thread. Basically, make it so the only users who can move pages and do any other potentally dangerous general-user things are "approved users". All you have to do to become an approved user is get tagged by another approved user or an admin, which they're allowed to do whenever they feel like it; becoming an approved user wouldn't be hard or significent. Anyone could check who approved a given user at any time, though, or see everyone who a given user has approved. This would effectively give the move to everyone, since it would be so easy to become an approved user; but would create a huge stumbling block for people like Willy, since he'd have to seek out approval every time he wants to start vandalizing. (Although he could use one approved account to approve others, it would be easy to find out who was approving Willy accounts and make them stop or ban them as Willy sock, depending on the situation; so he'd have to start again at getting approval for every wave.) Although not <i>perfect</i>, it seems to me that this would greatly limit this type of vandalism, without posing too many restrictions for normal users. It would also encouraging socializing with new users, and might influence many of them to stay. Of course, it would probably be harder to implement than throttling, but it seems to me like it might be a more sturdy and less risky solution; and it could be extended to cover other problematic abilities as they arise. <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 21:11, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I think a minimum edit count required for moving anything would be the best solution.

<p>Please note I am now running a block bot. It has blocked the last five incarnations of Willy (My willy is bigger than yours!; May the Willy on Wheels be with you!; Microsoft Willy on Wheels!; George Willys Bush; Willy willy willy willy... Mushroom, Mushroom!).</p>
<p>I realize an automated block bot can be dangerous, but this is an emergency. I will run it under supervision if possible, but will keep on running it even when I'm not here. Please note this is <i>not</i> a request to run such a bot; I am already running it and will continue to do so and am just letting everyone know. The bot is running under my account (admin). I hope no admin is misguided enough to think of blocking me for whatever reason; if so, I will unblock myself.

<dd>Admins have immunity from collateral damage.

<dd>Actually, a crude form of throttling is possible: too many moves at once gets a 30-second block. Something like that. It would annoy legitimate users but not seriously hamper them (unless they're in the process of doing a mass Willy revert, precisely the wrong time to block or annoy them). It's a possibility, but better to be cautious. Another problem is the fact that the underlying IP gets blocked when a username gets blocked, and can remain blocked even after the username block expires. That makes it much more problematic... dialup users would have to hangup and redial, so it's more than just a brief throttle. I think a MediaWiki update is really the only good solution. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 19:31, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Oh yea, the block bot should monitor the move log, and not just usernames. Look for any user making more than say 5 moves in 1 minute.

<li>That will probably trap users doing cleanup. Earlier today I was doing many more than 5 per minute.

<dd>This needs to be done several times a week for maximum effectiveness. OTOH, it will lose effectiveness as soon as Willy stops creating such patterned user names. And that may very well be at once after today's purge. But basically, if you can find any users you suspect are WoW sleeper accounts, I suggest adding them to the "sleep accounts" section of the ViP:WoW page. Several admins watch there regularly, and one of them will certainly make a judgement on the account in short order. I also suggest taking the suspected account and first giving it a search in the IP block list to avoid duplicating blocks. <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasAndroid_b0eb.html" title="User:TexasAndroid">TexasAndroid</a> 22:41, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi there. I made a mistake. Instead of using the Move button, I merely created a new page and then did a cut-and-paste. I realized later that this was the wrong thing to do -- that it stranded the page history. So I undid my move, but I cannot delete the (now empty) new page, and without that, I can't complete the Move.</p>
<p>The existing page is: <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Paul_II_International_Airport_5028.html" title="John Paul II International Airport">John Paul II International Airport</a> The page it should be moved to: <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Paul_II_International_Airport_Krak%C3%B3w-Balice_119a.html" title="John Paul II International Airport Kraków-Balice">John Paul II International Airport Kraków-Balice</a></p>
<p>Could someone help me out? I already updated the redirects which now point at <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Paul_II_International_Airport_Krak%C3%B3w-Balice_119a.html" title="John Paul II International Airport Kraków-Balice">John Paul II International Airport Kraków-Balice</a>.

This wouldn't be a problem (I don't know anything about Oak Island, so for all I know the anon has a point) if these notes led to any debate or improvement of the article. However, User:192.197.71.189 was asked repeatedly on his talk page to lay out his arguments on <a href="../../../o/a/k/Talk%7EOak_Island_5b95.html" title="Talk:Oak Island">Talk:Oak Island</a> and to engage in discussion aimed at improving the article. To this date, the anon has not posted a single message on the article's talk page, nor has he responded to the messages left for him on his user talk page. All he's done recently is insert the same message over and over every two or three days.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any advice on how to handle this sort of situation? I'm not sure if a block will be effective: a 24 hour block will be entirely useless, as he's already demonstrated a remarkable persistence during a period of several weeks or months. More importantly, there may still be a slight chance that this person has some information that could lead to an improvement of the article. What's the best course of action? I'm leaning towards page protection. Any thoughts? --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a> 01:02, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>you could try adding some commented out text to the article. Other than that you may just have to accpet that you will have to keep reverting it. I ended up reverting one artilce once a day for a simular time peroid as you have on this one. I've added the artilce to my watchlist for what it's worth.

<dd>Actually he hasn't edited his talk page since last Nov 17th when he apparently had a bad experience with an impostor. He has only edited two article talk pages since then, too. So it appears that he doesn't look at his own talk page and may have forgotten that there are talk pages for the articles. One of the two times he edited an article talk page he gave "Chad Matsalla" as his name. Maybe it will help to know that. --<a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENathan_Ladd_432f.html" title="User:Nathan Ladd">Nate Ladd</a> 01:29, August 26, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>AOL/TimeWarner now owns other, less demotic properties. The new Netscape ISP is AOL's attempt at countering the no-frills PeoplePC players, and so po' boys like me who only spend $10/month for access will find themselves in an AOL IP pool. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 17:04, 26 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What this really calls for is a way of placing smarter and more specific blocks. Is there a way to block <i>only</i> anonymous users from a given IP range, for instance, or to block those and new users from that range, while allowing existing ones to continue posting? That could be used as a temporary measure when there's a spike in vandalism. An even better option would be the ability to put that kind of a block on specific pages. A temporary page-specific block that targets anons and users created after the block is placed could also be useful in protecting vandalized voting pages and the like. <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 05:31, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This user is posting inappropriate articles; when people tag them "Vote for Deletion" he deletes these tags, then stalks them, placing complaints on other peoples' talk pages. Please do your best to check out this person. Describes himself as "slight autistic".

<p>Its not that I deleted the tags as a matter of course I just saw that you didn't do the nomination properly for a while (the entry was red for quite some time) I only removed the ones that weren't formed properly then left them on when Klenk performed the nomination correctly. Besides he's the one stalking me and any check of his edits concerning me will show a series of mean spirited personal attacks and rudeness directed at me, even his post here has quite the snide tone to it.

<dd>I must say, I wouldn't wait twenty-four hours; I mean, how long does it take to complete the process? If someone hasn't completed it within an hour or so I'd delete (or possibly complete it for them, depending upon how much time I had and how much I agreed with the VfD). Why would anyone place the template on an article and themn wander off for a day or two before explaining why and adding it to the VfD page? --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 22:26, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Mel, it was I who placed the tag and left it incomplete. I didnt mean to wander off -- I just didn't know there were additional steps. I'm still learning how to tag; and a couple of users have been very helpful guiding me. Also, your instincts serve you well -- a few people did complete them for me. But the user in question did not wait for the tag to be comleted -- it just disappeared immediately on a few pages. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Klenk_243c.html" title="User:Paul Klenk">Paul Klenk</a> 22:35, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, sorry — that's the main answer to my question. I think that my point is (should have been) that I'd not wait twenty-four hours before acting, but that the action might be deleting the template, completing the VfD, or contacting the person who placed it there to find out if they'd made a mistake. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 22:54, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've been noticing an increase of one-off vandalism of a certain type recently by anon IPs; with a random comment added and immediately, in the next edit, removed by the same IP. I know this already happens in tests and whatnot, but it just seems to be happening more commonly than before.

<p>One of my user pages came under attack from a vandal in my absence today, though fortunately it was only the one that I keep for such events (User:Francs2000/temp). However in his message on my talk page <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillybadboy_aa61.html" title="User:Billybadboy">Billybadboy</a> (<a href="../../../b/i/l/User_talk%7EBillybadboy_bfa4.html" title="User talk:Billybadboy">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Billybadboy_aa71.html" title="Special:Contributions/Billybadboy">contribs</a>) made suggestion to the use of sockpuppets if I block him (for previous vandalism) and used the term <i>nooga nooga nooga</i>.

His Talk page looks in places more like that of a troublesome anon, full of vandalism warnings. He has up-loaded a fair number of images, none with cources or copyright details, most of which have been put up for deletion (some now deleted) or tagged as having no source; on one set of images (photos of U-boat commanders) he removed the no-source template and added "fair use", with the claim that he had got them from [http:www.uboat.com], and had been given permission for their use. When <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarmil_7a19.html" title="User:Harmil">User:Harmil</a> checked this he was told by that site's admin that he'd never heard of Tykell, and asked that we not use his images.

<dd>There's a difference from being confused about copyright law and outright lying and pretending to have permission.

<dd>Dear all,</dd>

<dd>Wikipedia was recently a subject of intensive research of an huge international human right organization. A team of people from different nationalities and ages were acting on Wikipedia for 20 days, investigating previously noted anomalities of Wikipedia free editing and forming a final report, which (between the others similar reports) will later be a guide to all future moves of the organization concerning Wikipedia. Acting under an account of a real person, their privacy is to be held private. Therefore, very few private information will be revealed.</dd>
<dd>Also, this is a result of the lack of final possition of the organization concerning Wikipedia and human rights, which was still not formed.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>The team's final post on Wikipedia, where they explain their actions can be found on the following addresses:</dd>

They further claim to have chosen the Macedonian conflict as a case study after having recieved several reports of strong bias in Wikipedia's apparently authoritative coverage. The process of their study was primarily to discuss and update the related articles in accordance with international norms, though at times they would intentional provoke conflicts to witness the community response. They conclude fairly strongly that the Wikipedia process is inadequate for protecting the interests of national and ethnic self-identity and providing a neutral representation of cultural and historical matters. In short, they believe these areas of Wikipedia are presently incurably biased by the effort of editors with strong POV. I have not studied the edit history of this entity, but the document itself appears credible on its face. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 05:48, August 28, 2005 (UTC)

I saw this edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Jim_Duffy_%28author%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=22022447" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Jim_Duffy_%28author%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=22022447" rel="nofollow">[22]</a> and wondered if the user might be a reincarnation of <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkyring_afb0.html" title="User:Skyring">Skyring</a>, so I went to <a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENotanerd_508c.html" title="User:Notanerd">Notanerd</a>'s userpage to have a look. He claims to have been editing Wikipedia since 30 September 2004, and to have become an admin on 19 March 2005. His UserContributions <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Notanerd" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Notanerd" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> show that he started <i><b>yesterday</b></i>, and that he has <i><b>eight</b></i> edits! I looked on List of Administrators <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_administrators" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_administrators" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>, and couldn't find his name. I then looked at his (quite lengthy) talk page, and, by checking the contributions of someone who had apparently sent a message to it, I found that it is, in fact, the talk page of User:Jobe6, and has just been pasted into Notanerd's talk page.</p>
<p>Could someone look into it, please? Thanks. Ann Heneghan <sup>(talk)</sup> 12:11, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not sure what's going on here. His talk page is identical to that of User:Jobe6. Can anyone confirm if they are the same user? There is no redirect from Jobe6 to Notanerd, which is standard when changing one's user name.

<p>All the evidence suggests that this is Skyring's sockpuppet No 19 (19 within one month of a one year ban!!!). The same pages were edited, the same way, with the same personal comments as in all the others. The user has been banned and edits reverted. Even if it wasn't, and the evidence strongly suggests that it was, stealing identities, user pages and claiming a non-existent admin status in itself would warrant a block. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><font color="#006666"><b>Fear</b><font color="#FF6600"><i><b>ÉIREANN</b></i></font></font></a><a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:Ireland coa.png">Image:Ireland coa.png</a>\<sup><font color="blue"><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl">(caint)</a> 01:17, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</font></sup></p>

Some of the IPs display the same MO (i.e. the Goatse vandal), a WHOIS reveals that the IPs in question are from several completely unrelated organizations, which may be indiciative of IP spoofing or the use of an anonomyzer.

<p>For anyone doing newuser patrol (the hard way, by paging through <a href="../../../l/i/s/Special%7EListusers_21e7.html" title="Special:Listusers">Special:Listusers</a>), be aware that a lot of Willy-style sleeper accounts are being created daily with a "Milk" theme. I've blocked all the one's I've found. The "User:MilkMan" vandal very much seems to be Willy under a different name, his signature style is very characteristic. Note however that there are some perfectly legitimate users with "Milk" in their name.</p>
<p>PS, lots of us have been clamoring for a "Special:Newusers" feature, but it seems we are getting about 10,000 new accounts per day. So manually paging through it may not be satisfactory. It's best to use a bot to fetch data from Special:Listusers on a daily basis and then do various diffs and comparisons with yesterday's userlist. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 17:28, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've started doing a regular (new)user patrol, for which data acquisition is almost completely automated. Server-side support would be nice, but it would be most useful in the form of a monolithic full user list (and also IP block list) in text/plain format. The resulting list is not all that long (certainly much shorter than some of the largest media files on the Commons), and the load on the DB servers would also be reduced by doing a single, unconstrained lookup instead of several constrained ones, which is how it has to be done at the moment.

<p>Being the hacker that I am, I modified a version of Special:Listusers to create Special:Newusers, which is intended to show the most recent 1% of registrations (the current "newbie" definition in Mediawiki) organized with most recent first. Now we only need a dev to test it, fix any bugs I might have left, and install it.

<dd>I don't know how easy this would be, but what I'd like to see is a user list sorted by account registration time, similar to the RC list.

<p>Encyclopædia damatica is an article about a website that has many detractors. In the interest of NPOV the detractors criticisms of the site should be included in the article, of course, but they should not be allowed to use Wikipedia as a foundation to harass and attack the websites owner.</p>
<p>The current protected version is actual, real-life harassment of the websites owner. It is harassment to link the owner of the site to their real-life employer, a fact that has nothing to do with the website itself. It is wiki-vandalism (and further harassment) to include an excessive number of inline links to outside information and pictures that have been removed from the article itself.</p>
<p>This information says, in essence: "I know where you live." "I know where you work." "I know what you look like." That is stalker behavior, not encyclopedic. Publicizing it is incitement to other detractors to take on real life harassment via letters to employers, prank calls, etc.</p>
<p>I reverted the page firmly believing this is vandalism and harassment. I'm now blocked. 3RR does not cover vandalism and harassment. If listing to this information was done on a talk page it would fall under <a href="../../../r/p/a/WP%7ERPA_efd5.html" title="WP:RPA">WP:RPA</a>, we shouldn't allow it in an article either.</p>
<p>Yeah, I feel pretty strongly about this. There is a real life person here who these detractors are trying to ruin by sending disparaging letters to real life employers. By not doing a sanity check before blocking someone on 3RR and then <b>PROTECTING the page with the links intact</b>, Wikipedia administrators have <i>tacitly endorsed</i> using Wikipedia as an information source for this harassment. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchmuckyTheCat_0da1.html" title="User:SchmuckyTheCat">User:SchmuckyTheCat</a> 135.214.154.104 21:58, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think it's entirely fair to complain of people editing the template while protected when you made your edits and then protected it after you'd done that. This edit war is bad, and there's plenty of blame to go around. Why don't you revert to the old version which though it may not be to everyone's liking served for a very long time, and tomorrow when at least the biggest concerns have been discussed it could be changed again. That would be a lot more effective than what those of you revert warring are doing now. --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 12:23, August 30, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The protection doesn't really have anything to do with it; this template has been protected for months for visibility reasons. Also, the version I protected was by Uncle G. And third, the biggest concerns have already been discussed (on <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EVotes_for_deletion_5926.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Votes for deletion">Wikipedia talk:Votes for deletion</a>) and it seems that the reverts are being made by people who haven't read the discussion.
