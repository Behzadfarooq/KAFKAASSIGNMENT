<p>Some time in January, <a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">Giovanni33</a> (<a href="../../../g/i/o/User_talk%7EGiovanni33_9764.html" title="User talk:Giovanni33">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Giovanni33_df83.html" title="Special:Contributions/Giovanni33">contribs</a>) arrived and began to make big changes in the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> article and other related articles. His changes were resisted by those who had been editing the article for some time, as they were considered to be attempts to insert and present fringe scholarship as mainstream views. He sometimes edited as <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.121.40.153.html" title="User:64.121.40.153">64.121.40.153</a> (<a href="../../../6/4/2E/User_talk%7E64.121.40.153.html" title="User talk:64.121.40.153">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.121.40.153_e013.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.121.40.153">contribs</a>), and acknowledged those edits as his, when he inadvertently got logged out.</p>
<p>After Givanni33 had met with some resistance, <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBelindaGong_bd31.html" title="User:BelindaGong">BelindaGong</a> (<a href="../../../b/e/l/User_talk%7EBelindaGong_f84e.html" title="User talk:BelindaGong">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BelindaGong_2da5.html" title="Special:Contributions/BelindaGong">contribs</a>) turned up to support him. She sometimes edited from an IP address – 38.114.145.148 (<a href="../../../3/8/2E/User_talk%7E38.114.145.148.html" title="User talk:38.114.145.148">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_38.114.145.148_e485.html" title="Special:Contributions/38.114.145.148">contribs</a>), which she agreed was probably hers. Her very first edits both as 38.114.145.148 and as BelindaGong were reverts to Giovanni's version. They both reverted aggressively, while lecturing their ofor reverting them. They very quickly violated 3RR, but were not reported as they were new (even though they had been warned gently but frequently of the rule before the actual violations occurred).</p>
<p>They continued to revert unrepentantly, and seemed to take advantage of the fact that the "old" editors were reluctant to report them, or to go beyond three reverts themselves. Finally, after a long period of gross violations from both of them (on one occasion, Giovanni reverted an article 11 times in about eighteen and a half hours, despite being asked repeatedly to stop), they were both blocked. See the reports [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RRArchive10#User:Giovanni33_combined_with_User:64.121.40.15327_noticeboard/3RRArchive10#User:BelindaGong|here" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RRArchive10#User:Giovanni33_combined_with_User:64.121.40.15327_noticeboard/3RRArchive10#User:BelindaGong|here" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>] and [[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RRArchive10#User:Giovanni33_combined_with_User:64.121.40.153|here" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RRArchive10#User:Giovanni33_combined_with_User:64.121.40.153|here" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>].</p>
<p>Since then they have been careful, and have not violated 3RR, although they have, on numerous occasions, taken six reverts between them in a 24-hour period. They have also voted together. Belinda often shows up to revert just as Giovanni has used up his three reverts. In fact, as I write these words, she's doing it right now at <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFCU_026f.html" title="WP:RFCU">WP:RFCU</a> results came in on Saturday. <a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">User:Giovanni33</a> is <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBelindaGong_bd31.html" title="User:BelindaGong">User:BelindaGong</a>. They had constantly denied this, and had put up an elaborate pretence of not knowing each other (see their talk pages), while suggesting that User:Str1977 and User:KHM03 were sockpuppets, and that I was a meatpuppet for Str1977.</p>
<p>I would appreciate some advice on what I should do now. I seem to recall that in the past, admins have blocked indefinitely an account that was sockpuppeting to get round the rules, and have also blocked the main account for a period. In my view, Giovanni is the <i>real</i> account holder, as Belinda nearly always just reverts to his version, whereas he posts long messages to the talk pages in order to justify his edits (though he then insits on posting his extremely controvesial edits even if he hasn't achieved any kind of agreement.</p>
<p>I know I can't block people I'm in dispute with. Does that mean that I shouldn't block Giovanni or Belinda, since I have opposed their edits? Is an indefinite block on Belinda justified?</p>
<p>Advice would be welcome. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 04:11, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're right that you shouldn't block them, as that would be an abuse of your administrator privileges. But it sounds like they are definitely violating the spirit of 3RR, which is an abuse of having a second account. Coming here and telling the story was the right thing to do, as it sounds like this is a problem that needs to be addressed. I don't have time right now to investigate the specifics and engage in the appropriate dialogue before considering a block (which may well be necessary) but I'm sure some other admin will do so. <a href="../../../m/o/i/User%7EMoink_dc9f.html" title="User:Moink">moink</a> 06:04, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think the article <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> could benefit from mediation. I'm surprised to see very few citations. In controversial pages like this, people have to stop presenting their own views and do serious scholarship. That means presenting a multitude of views and documenting who says what. I know next to nothing about the subject (I'm an ethnically Jewish agnostic raised as an atheist), but reading the article and the discussion I don't understand the difference between the views. Assuming one is mainstream and the other is more of a fringe view, they should both be presented so that someone like me understands the different views and can recognize which are mainstream and what the controversy is about. I don't know if the parties in this debate can accomplish this without moderation. I'd also try to get everyone to agree to a ONE REVERT policy. If there is a clear controversy, three reverts just waste everyone's time. If people can't behave civilly and work together, perhaps the page needs to be protected and all edits happen by agreement on the talk page. If you all worked together you could probably create a great article. Good luck. -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuelWantman_9090.html" title="User:SamuelWantman">Samuel Wantman</a> 06:50, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I second this notion. Infact my proposal has been that no one revert anothers work without at least coming to the talk page first.

<dd>I think FionaS did admit to being a sock infact. But, not my sock. She stated that she wanted to speak out but not be targed for harassment in her main account. This person may be an established older user. There are legitimate reasons for somoene to have a sock, and it appears Fiona made a good argument for why she adopted this sock. I also note she did not do any reverts. That editors feel they must hide inorder to express themselves is indicative of the chilling atmosphere that results when those with a contrary POV are bullied. <a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">Giovanni33</a> 10:17, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Comment: I admit I edit warred in the very beggining. I have stopped. I noticed you keep bringing up my past 3RR violations to paint me as an aggressive edit warrior, but the truth is otherwise. I extensively used the talk pages to work for and infact build real consensus. I pleaded that no one reverts to undo anyother editors work (except for vandalism) without first at least going to the talk page. My idea to stop edit warring was ignored. Still, I learned that simply winning an argument by providing references while the side failed to and went silent, did not entitle me to edit war in vio of the policy; being right is no excuse. So I stopped. I am reasonable and I have been convinced when wrong. I can be swayed, but with reason, and evidence to support the claims. After my first block, I never violated the 3RR again. But I continued try to find out what the objections were and have them substantiated, using reasoned arguments, and sources. This apparently emboldened other users (my theory) who started to show up, agree with me and help me out--but no different than the tag teaming you have enjoyed with your confidants in pursuing for your POV. (another theory is that they are real sockets created to make it look as if they were my sockets to use as a diversion away from edits work). But, I assume good faith. When the threat of possible equality for a secular POV encroached, in part by my winning over the moderate voices, the aggressive attacks of socket puppet accusations started, and expanded so that anyone who agreed with me was automatically suspect; to assume bad faith was made the norm and civility was thrown out. That Belinda proved to be my wife (a fact I felt I had a right to keep private) was seized on as excuse to avoid even trying to work on the article to address contentious points. Now it's locked. Temporarily this might not be bad if it forces others to go to the talk page to address the issue.</li>

Freethinker was a newcomer, yet as soon as he explained his relation to me he was attacked, blocked, and his page defaced with a socket puppet label. This is the opposite of assuming good faith. Now he doesn't want to come back. Infact you called him a "meatpuppet" outright, after he explained his connection to me. He was new and wanted to help with the POV disputes. I mentioned before to you that the Wiki policy states, <i>"Do not call these users "meatpuppets"; be civil."</i> It should be reasonable to understand (yet you said you can't understand it after it was explained to you) The only other time I used another account was once when I was at a friend's house, to introduce him to Wikipedia (I think getting a more diverse body of pov's is healthy, not bad), and I used his account only to respond to a question on my talk page. This was all open and disclosed by me. Its lot logical to assume that this is an attempt by me to use a socketpuppet, esp. when I use his PC and even sign his name to my message (which I corrected, to my name when I know full well about the usercheck abilities. Yet, despite this you keep spreading a negative bad faith interpretation that assumes a negative intenion on my part. I also will say that as a result he was blocked, and I was blocked for an additional 48 hours (72 in total for having my wife edit and inviting a friend). I don't protest this, even though I'm innocent of any sockepuppetry, and did not violate 3RR or any rule. What I do protest in the strongest way possible is the continued distruption with constant socketpuppet allegations of me and others based on allegations and variations of different half-truths that insult, disrupt, and distract from honest editing.</dd>

<dd>I think the Christianity article's problems, in part, stems from an ideological rigidity kept in tact by a dominance of multiple users sharing the same basic POV. Apparently any new comer doesn’t meet groupthink standards is bullied into conformity, silence, or expulsion. I felt I was. You will recall that user Sophia stated she felt bullied and ganged up on, when she first joined, that it was scary. Others stated similar sentiments. The very fact of the nature of maintaining one POV means that newcomers who do not fit will get the bite experience. Most will probably leave. In this sense the article space acts like just like institution, it’s self-selecting.</dd>

<dd>The socket puppet allegations have not stopped but are now being pushed agressively despite the fact that the checks have cleared me and the others. This now objectively serve as a tool keep the status quo by attack users integrity instead of their arguments. I see it as intimidation and disruption with the aim of getting me permanently banned. In my forced wiki-break (although I've been editing in the other wiki language sites) I've also had a chance to read a lot of messages so I'm confident I know whats going on, what you have been saying, and others, and can easily see what the motivations and goals are not in good faith. You want me gone for good. I'm sorry if I'm not going to violate any rules to make that easy. Belinda is not my socketpuppet, and I can prove she is my wife. That should restore my credibility and put to rest this modern day inquisition. I’m willing to forgive and continue assuming good faith as I realize that is not a luxury but a necessity in order to focus on the collaborative effort we are all supposed to be part of.</dd>

<dd>Despite my concilliatory and amicable disposition, and the fact that I've pleaded to to focused on my arguments to improve the Christianity article, the continued allegations of socketpuppetry by those I've had Pov diputes with, continue unabated. I think, are being done in bad faith being pushed by a handful of edit warriors as a result of the POV differences. The speculations continue to disrupt good faith discussions and turn them into personal attacks. It has gotten so bad that I think it borders on harassment. Sadly, I've been convinced that AnnH has been making this her mission, expanding it to anyone whose agreed with me, is taking the form of an ugly inquisition; even an older valued editor has left in protest describing it with this kind of language. AnnH continues to lead this attack spreading bad faith assumptions, making interpretations and speculations to cast the worst possible light over me and others, over and over in different places. I have had a hard time even keeping up with trying to defend myself over the many one-sided half-truths being spread. Keeping my marriage private was my right; that I chose to not share this fact is irrelevant to the fact that she is my wife and hence not a sockpuppet, which is all that should matter (I've offered to prove it-- if any arbcom admin is interested, by sending you our respective ID's for Giovanni and Belinda Gong, our real names). I disclosed this after a usercheck showed our connection to offer a valid explanation for the appearance of sockepuppetry. We were both blocked. Due to the POV dispute I've had with AnnH and a couple others, they are now taking advantage of this to continue what is essential a personal attack, including anyone else who has agreed with my pov. Even after a usercheck has cleared them and myself, all kinds of accusatory speculations continue unabated. The result is in effect to disrupt constructive edit work to improve the substance of articles. This is indecent, counter-productive, and harassment. The role that AnnH describes of my wife, also exactly matches her own role in pushing for her own Pov with user Str1977; they have use up 3reverts each between each other, and AnnH has even accidentally gone over 3rv's in a 3RR vio herself. AnnH says that was an accident and I believe her. She is careful to follow the letter of the rules, although this McCarthy like witch-hunt is certainly violating the spirit of several other equally important wiki rules and principals. I ask her to stop this, if not for me then for the good of Wikipedia as it's inimical to the good the project.

<p>I've blocked <a href="../../../s/h/u/User%7EShultz_fa0d.html" title="User:Shultz">User:Shultz</a> for one week for a series of trolling edits on the Ref Desk, despite warnings and his previous extensive history of blocks for this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Shultz" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Shultz" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>.</p>
<p>I warned him for a series of edits in which he created a redirect from 'Kim Il Sung City' (in Korean) to <a href="../../../s/e/o/Seoul.html" title="Seoul">Seoul</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Undelete&amp;target=%EA%B9%80%EC%9D%BC%EC%84%B1_%EC%8B%9C&amp;timestamp=20060201225735" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Undelete&amp;target=%EA%B9%80%EC%9D%BC%EC%84%B1_%EC%8B%9C&amp;timestamp=20060201225735" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> and then asked on the Refdesk what the redirect meant <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reference_desk/Miscellaneous&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=39840350" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reference_desk/Miscellaneous&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=39840350" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>.

<p>In another bout of Korea-related trolling, he started with a question <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reference_desk/Humanities&amp;diff=39839600&amp;oldid=39838903" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reference_desk/Humanities&amp;diff=39839600&amp;oldid=39838903" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, added a wikilink to it after Dirk had answered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reference_desk/Humanities&amp;diff=39874588&amp;oldid=39873896" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reference_desk/Humanities&amp;diff=39874588&amp;oldid=39873896" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> and then (using another IP address which he had previously identified as himself <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Switzerland&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=37581742" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Switzerland&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=37581742" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>) berated Dirk for not noticing the wikilink which had not existed when Dirk answered. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reference_desk/Humanities&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=39891393" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reference_desk/Humanities&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=39891393" rel="nofollow">[10]</a></p>

<p>I've discussed this matter with Shultz, here's my best AGF interpretation of what might have happened.

<dd>Deceptively drawing attention to a POV redirect can hardly be good faith; neither can insulting someone for noticing something that clearly wasn't there.

<p>I've been experiencing long-term difficulties with <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_lay95_7bd8.html" title="User:Rick lay95">User:Rick lay95</a>. I now feel too personally involved to block this user, since his <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERick_lay95_43cc.html" title="User talk:Rick lay95">talk page</a> comprises mostly messages from me. He's been blocked twice this month (the second time, I'm convinced he used <a href="../../../z/e/o/User%7EZeo6_69b9.html" title="User:Zeo6">User:Zeo6</a> as a sock puppet account to evade the block - please see my rationale at <a href="../../../z/e/o/User_talk%7EZeo6_7920.html" title="User talk:Zeo6">User talk:Zeo6</a>). Since the second block expired, he's persisted in uploading images without source details (despite 38 previous missing source/licensing reminders and three messages from me in which I've offered to help him if he doesn't understand how to deal with source/licensing tags), he has blanked a redirect page and he has removed an AfD tag from a page he created - I left a "final warning" after that one.</p>
<p>Since the final warning he has uploaded images which he tagged as public domain because he "couldn't find anything that matched and that happened to be the closest [he] could find". As a result, I left a long-ish comment <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Rick_lay95#Image:PRDFgroup.jpg_and_Image:PRTgroup.jpg" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Rick_lay95#Image:PRDFgroup.jpg_and_Image:PRTgroup.jpg" rel="nofollow">here</a>, warning him that he needed to start heeding copyright issues and to follow policies. He has since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_episodes_of_Power_Rangers&amp;diff=40163259&amp;oldid=40161728" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_episodes_of_Power_Rangers&amp;diff=40163259&amp;oldid=40161728" rel="nofollow">added a speedy delete tag</a> to an article for no apparent reason.</p>
<p>As I've said, I feel too personally involved in this case to give another block myself. It could be that due to my lengthy involvement with this user and my subsequent frustration, I'm over reacting. However, I feel a block (probably longer than the 24hr/48hr blocks he's already had this month) is in order - please could another admin review this case and take appropriate action (either issuing a block or telling me to cool down if I'm over-reacting!).

<dd>We occasionally have what could be called "rolling blocks." What happens is, an editor ends up on a dynamic IP address that has been blocked earlier in the day for one reason or another, and is blocked as a result. Sometimes it is not a direct block of the IP address, but a <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutoblock_1669.html" title="Wikipedia:Autoblock">Wikipedia:Autoblock</a> that causes it. Generally, the problem corrects itself quickly, as the user is moved onto a new, unblocked IP just as quickly as he or she was moved on to the blocked one. It's inconvenient, but barring all users demanding static IPs from their ISPs, there is nothing that can be done. In future, if you have this problem, you can email the administrator who placed the block, or add {{<a href="../../../u/n/b/Template%7EUnblock_0164.html" title="Template:Unblock">Unblock</a>}} to your talk page. Make sure to say you believe it is not an actual block of your account, but a block of the IP you are on, and give that IP address (it will appear in the block message you see). An administrator can do a "hard unblock" (acutally input that IP into the unblock page) and force an unblock of that IP, whether the initial block was an actual IP block or an autoblock. <font color="#696969"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> <sup><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><i>Talk</i></a> • <i>Contact</i></sup></font> 23:35, 18 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>Thanks for dealing with that, Flcelloguy. My question: I understand that this is our usual practice, and I have no problem with what Flcelloguy has done, but is it really necessary for us to complete AfDs if they are both badly formed and clearly are going to be kept? Obviously any AfD that is correctly nominated has to go through the process (even if that will certainly lead to a speedy keep), but does one that appears to be either bad-faith or based on a misunderstanding of the process and that is not correctly nominated need to? This is not a rhetorical question (and not necessarily about the current user; I'm think more of clear bad-faith or retaliatory nominations such as often come up); I'm curious to know what others think. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChick_Bowen_2101.html" title="User:Chick Bowen">Chick Bowen</a> 00:57, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I just think that anyone, who we believe is acting in <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good faith</a>, has the right to nominate articles for deletion. If we need to speedy keep them, we speedy keep them - it's no big deal. In addition, most of the articles that he nominated weren't "obvious" speedy keeps, per se; it's no harm to put them through AfD. Of course, that's just my opinion.

<p>It is clear that there will be no acceptable solution whereby some of the more polemical templates are deleted, but not others. The various templates related to George W. Bush are a clear example of this. The only long-term solution will be to get rid of them entirely, which is what I've just done. In the interest of avoiding more divisiveness, please discuss any future actions here first.

<p>I'll say a few more things: This is not the End Of The World As We Know It. As the French Wikipedia and German Wikipedia have demonstrated, the project will not grind to a halt if we disallow polemical userboxes. And before anyone says "let's wait until we have a comprehensive userbox policy", let me counter this by saying that we're under no obligation to keep stuff which is irrelevant to the project's main goal. Once we have a comprehensive userbox policy, let's see if it says "polemical templates are Ok and encouraged"; if so, these templates can be recreated in a flash. But for now, things will be much easier without them. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a>&#160;<small><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkSweep_9d72.html" title="User talk:MarkSweep">(call me collect)</a></small> 22:32, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

Basically, not only is this unencyclopedic material enjoying the full benefits of an inclusionist deletion policy designed to keep encyclopedic material, it is expected that userboxes will be treated as a special case - never speedied - always reviewed - inevitably kept.

<dd>Sigh. Does it not occur to you at all than it will cause more "divisiveness" to just whack them in a flash than to just leave them for a while? Does it not occur to you at all that doing so and then saying "please discuss any future actions here first" is problematic? We're under no <i>obligation</i> to not delete every person's user page that has anything on it that doesn't aid the project, but we don't because most of have some slight shred of common sense. What was the emergancy that required this action, almost certain to result in recreations, wheel wars, blocking, and further driving potentially good editors from the fold as well as giving the "freedom of speech" provocateurs something else to scream about?

<dd>I've considered this. In fact, I've ignored userboxes for a long time, treating them essentially like trolls, hoping they would go away. But they clearly won't, on the contrary. We can no longer ignore the elephant (no political pun intended) in the room. I don't see why we shouldn't enforce core policies vigorously. We don't go around first debating whether we want to enforce 3RR, for fear that we will be accused of "censoring free speech" (or treason, for that matter). --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a>&#160;<small><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkSweep_9d72.html" title="User talk:MarkSweep">(call me collect)</a></small> 23:00, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Aaron might be right, but what is the other option? No compromise will be acceptable to the warriors, and they clearly will not go away. Will some editors leave over this? Quite possibly. Will some of them be a loss? Probably. But the alternative is a) just allow wikipedia to become a POV-pushers club, and campaigning ground/my space. 2) Wait. But for what? Will it get better? I think the problem here has in fact been too much delay and tollerance. If we had delivered a swift 'no' to this several months ago, we wouldn't have created all these new warriors.

<li>These are probably the most often deleted, restored, and recreated templates of the lot. Is there some special "Delete and I really mean it this time" tab that has been used? Further, since I've seen Jimbo (praise be his name) quoted a few times with regards to "not acceptable", didn't he also ask for restraint in deleting things? For less action and more talking?</li>
<li>This "fire" is caused at least in part by the repeated deletion of these stupid little boxes. If they aren't deleted <i><b>right now</b></i> than they won't go to TfD and DRv, then we won't have the non-stop three ring circus. A little bit of patience would go a long long way to defusing this stupid and pointless cycle. Did the memo go out that Wikipedia had to be finished tomorrow and I missed it?</li>
<li>One of the things that we're supposed to be good at as administrators is resolving conflict. We're meant to help people talk about things, we're meant to educate newcomers into our occult ways, we're meant to be patient and thoughtful. By continuing to randomly delete stuff we're creating POV warriors, not stopping them. When we balance out the damage done by these templates continuing to exist for another week or even a month by the "forest fire" that is created by the continued and repatative deletion, there is no contest.</li>
<li>I'll ask Mark directly: why was it that these had to be deleted <i>now</i> as opposed to next Thursday?<br />

<p><b>A quick and dirty summation</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Stop fighting the boxes. The boxes aren't doing anything and do not present an ugrent problem.</li>
<li>Editors and admins are doing things, and it is the continued posturing on both sides that is the urgent problem.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Possible classes of userboxes, with totally made up percentages</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Marginally useful (5%)
<ul>
<li>These are the language, browser, etc boxes. Convert these into categories. The users who have are likely to be amenable to reason, and there is no rush.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Useless but not mostly harmless (90%)
<ul>
<li>"This user is made of meat" <i>et alii</i>. These are mulitplying because they are easy, and the "pick lists" of userboxes make this worse. Slow the creation of these and eventually eliminate them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Potentially harmful (5%)
<ul>
<li>Divisive user boxes (.1%) - These are mostly either simply jokes in poor taste like the original "This user is a pedophile" or trolling like the "This user had been attracted to females under 16 while not under 16"</li>
<li>Polemic user boxes (4.9%) - These are the thorniest issue. "User dislikes George Bush"</li>
<li>These need to be removed, we all agree on that. The only question is how and how soon.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>What's the harm again?</b></p>
<ul>
<li>All problems arise from the <i>editor's behavior</i> and not the user boxes.</li>
<li>The mostly harmless 90% are often used by the newest members of the community. Not a <i>huge</i> problem, and it's good if people have fun and learn some wikimarkup. But when the first edits they make (or the first 75) are hanging curtains on a user page, it's easy to lose sight of the "encyclopedia first" concept.
<ul>
<li>First get rid of the pick-lists, then slowly {{subst:}} and deleted the existing templates while explaining nicely the reasons why. Again there is no rush. This can almost certainly be done with simple talking, and work on the wikiproject. I've dipped my toe in here, and the response has mostly been "Sure, I thought it was funny, but since you asked nicely I'll take it down."</li>
<li><font color="blue">This is not an urgent problem, and is not amenable to a quick fix.</font></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Divisive boxes - are actually few and far between.
<ul>
<li>In some cases it's just stupidity, and a simple explanantion is all that's required. More often it's trying to get a rise, and should be treated as such. When SPUI pops a "pseudo-pedo" userbox on his page, deleting the box isn't going to do anything. Remember <i>We don't feed trolls.</i> Editing is always a better way to solve a problem than use of sysop powers. Edit troll boxes into something mild. If someone wants to edit war, 3RR blocks are uncontroversial.</li>
<li><font color="blue">This is an urgent problem only if we make it so, but <i>is</i> amenable to a quick fix.</font></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Polemic boxes - these are the actual problem. These range from the mild "This user doesn't have a problem with the UN but just thinks they are useless" to the shocking "This user supports Hamas' campaign of suicide bombing".
<ul>
<li>These may also be used for vote stacking. I've only seen one instance of it, but there could be more. No images in templates, full stop, would solve half this problem. This is, I believe, also supported by the developers. Using {{subst:}} would solve the other half. Talking about other ways to use an image-free, substituted template for vote stacking might be spilling the beans.</li>
<li><font color="blue">This is not an urgent problem, but <i>is</i> amenable to a quick fix.</font></li>
<li>The big problem is that people feel like they that they <i>ought</i> to be able to voice some opinions about Geogre or somesuch. And to some small degree, they should. We're humans, we have opinons.
<ul>
<li>When we use admin powers to stop people from expressing their opinon (or some fascile mass-produced group-think opinon as the case may be) they are going to be upset. They can't restore things, and if they re-create them they just get deleted again. So now DRV and TfD are totally constipated because people feel like they need to have their "voice heard". Of course that's bollocks, there's no freedom of speech here, only the freedom to contribute.</li>
<li>Deleting fairly mild "Anti-pope" user boxes as if they were "This user hates jews" is troll-baiting. As long as we keep jamming people down, they are going to keep popping back up in other places. The irony of deleting an anti-George bush template is that it's only going to convert another mild-mannered editor into a "template freedom fighter".</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><font color="blue">This is urgent problem, but is not amenable to a quick fix. But it <i>can</i> be made less urgent.</font></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>A proposed solutions</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Stop deleting boxes for reasons of "controversy" or "trolling". Someone must stop shooting first, and we're meant to be the sensible ones.</li>
<li>Use redirecting and editing to fix problem boxes. User 3RR if required. Stop playing with the sysop buttons, you'll go blind.</li>
<li>Get some less inflammitory members of our community to engage the template warriors in dialog. Work on the wikiproject.</li>
<li>Have a little more patience, use care, and remember that everyone thinks they are right.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I have to agree with Aaron. What we must remember here is that the majority of users with these boxes probably won't have any knowledge of this debate, or the damage the boxes can cause. Imagine an editor who doesn't read AN, or TFD or anything like that, but sticks to a few articles about his favourite subject, whatever that may be. Upon going to the user page of another editor, he finds a "This user does not support George Bush" box, or whatever, and thinks "hey, I like that", sticks it on his page and thinks nothing more of it. If he sees one day that it's been deleted or removed from his page, can you really be surprised when he wonders why or gets a little annoyed? We need to explain to users like him why these boxes are such a big deal. <a href="../../../r/a/v/User%7ERaven4x4x_5184.html" title="User:Raven4x4x">Raven4x4x</a> 02:03, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I highly 2nd this suggestion above. I'd ask that it be put onto a separate page somewhere, so it can be referred to. This is really sensible, and right. We do need to get rid of these things, but we also need to do it in a way that adds, rather than splits, the community. 134.10.12.31 01:58, 18 February 2006 (UTC) (<a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesseW_not_logged_in_c093.html" title="User:JesseW/not logged in">User:JesseW/not logged in</a>)</dd>

<p>Not doing something about polemical userbxxes is not an option. They have been used in several instances of attempted vote stacking, they are divisive because they inject external political advocacy into Wikipedia, they give people the wrong idea about what Wikipedia is for and what a user page is for. They are harmful. And the boss wants them gone.</p>
<p>Speedy deletion has been very successful, and the new criterion has gained wide acceptance among acculturated Wikipedians. It's not as if we're doing this without explaining what is happening, and it's not as if a huge number of editors were using these boxes--a large-scale survey I did found that only around 10% of all active editors on my watchlist actually had polemical userboxes.</p>
<p>But still the number of useroxes grows. Up from 3500 on January 4 to 5800 when I checked again on February 14. The page of political belief-based userboxes is up from 45 in January to 150 in February. A relatively small number of editors are producing userboxes in any great numbers, and quite a few of them those already known as trouble-makers on these pages. Names like Mistress Selina Kyle (92 boxes), and Bourbons3 and his sock Dussst (a total of 174 boxes across both incarnations).</p>
<p>People with no interest in editing the encyclopedia become Userbox producers and advocates--<a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVargher_cf94.html" title="User:Vargher">User:Vargher</a>, on <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a>, said "Jimbo Wales is the founder of Wikipedia, but WE are the community. WE build the encyclopedia, so WE decide." A quick check showed that Vargher had produced a grand total of five article edits and seven talk page comments in his three weeks on Wikipedia, during which time he had managed to make SIXTY edits to his user page. Bourbons3, in addition to his prolific userbox creation activities, made a habit of uploading pictures he obviously did not own with deliberately falsified upload summaries.</p>
<p>So its utter nonsense to say that Wikipedia isn't being damaged. It's pie-in-the-sky to imagine that we can get anywhere by talking to the kind of people who come to Wikipedia to produce this trash. And its insulting to equate those, some of us senior Wikipedians with an edit count that would make your eyes water, destroying this damaging rubbish, with those producing it and frankly little else on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 07:42, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Tony, I think you may be trying too hard to save Wikipedia from the evils of userboxes or the deletion process or whatever you feel is most urgent at each moment. There are five days since your last article edit. For the month of February so far article edits are 7% of your total contributions. So here is my annoyingly condescending advice to you: Relax a little&#160;:) Make some old-fashioned content-contributions. Let someone else carry the torch for awhile. Don't burn yourself out, we want to keep you around for a long while. <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 11:44, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Tony describes an ever-growing problem here in Wikipedia. People like Vargher, for instance, demonstrate <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_Deathphoenix%27s_Law_0a82.html" title="User:Deathphoenix/Deathphoenix's Law">my law</a>: that the number of opinion-expressing userboxes is inversely proportional with number of edits that user makes to the main articlespace. I won't say that I'm much better, because I'm just a lightweight editor, but the amount of time and serverspace that these relatively new users spend on Wikipedia could be better used for editing articles. If they want to go around making pretty little userboxes expressing their opinions, why don't they go on some other Wiki, or maybe LiveJournal or something? Jimbo and the Wikimedia Foundation have all their currently-overloaded servers to make an encyclopedia: not so people with a tiny amount of main articlespace edits can go around making pretty little userboxes saying that they are opposed to George W. Bush. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">D</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><b>e</b></a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">ath</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 13:27, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Aaron Brenneman's post has convinced me that our approach has been much too lenient so far. We've seen a lot of silliness related to the more polemical userboxes, plenty of boundary testing behavior, and a few cases of borderline trolling. This has to stop. We need to keep in mind what the goal of this thing here is. This is not boxopedia.

<dd>Good work Ilmari. But do we have any guidelines as to what is an appropriate "low resolution" in relation to the original work? I also had a look at the various images in <a href="../../../f/a/i/Category%7EFair_use_TIME_magazine_covers_e016.html" title="Category:Fair use TIME magazine covers">Category:Fair use TIME magazine covers</a>. The majority seem to be used on the article relating to the subject on the cover, and <b>not</b> the particular issue of the magazine itself. There is a clear contradiction with the wording on {{<a href="../../../t/i/m/Template%7ETIME_c2ff.html" title="Template:TIME">TIME</a>}} which has as the only fair use rationale:
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><i>to illustrate the publication of the issue in question</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>There is a clear anomaly here which needs to be addressed I think. Fair use for the article on the subject on the cover could be argued in many cases I am sure. It seems to me the best way forward is to modify the template.

<dd>I've reverted your modification, since the rationale you added was way too broad. To quote an analogous example from <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:fair use</a>, "An image of a rose, cropped from an image of a record album jacket, used to illustrate an article on roses" does not count as fair use. However, I agree that there's a gray area here. In particular, I believe that using a picture of a TIME magazine cover to illustrate <i>the fact that a subject appeared on the cover of TIME magazine</i> probably does count as fair use. —<a href="../../../i/l/m/User%7EIlmari_Karonen_d189.html" title="User:Ilmari Karonen">Ilmari Karonen</a> <small>(<a href="../../../i/l/m/User_talk%7EIlmari_Karonen_f3b7.html" title="User talk:Ilmari Karonen">talk</a>)</small> 12:55, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I think that if the fact that a person/place/thing appeared on the cover of <i>TIME</i> magazine is itself a notable fact, and one which is discussed in that subject's article, then it is appropriate to have the cover image to illustrate this fact. However, this isn't quite the same as a general allowance to use the covers in any context whatsoever when an illustration of its subject is needed. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan T.*</a> 13:15, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's exactly my point. It seems to me that many articles are using the TIME magazine images as a general picture of the subject without reference to the relevance to their portrayal on the cover. I think some wording needs to be fashioned on the template to restrict this blanket use.

<p>I quite agree with <a href="../../../c/a/c/User%7ECactus.man_4fe2.html" title="User:Cactus.man">Cactus.man</a>; fair use is not for illustration of the subject within an image per se, it's for illustration of a discussion of the image itself or its immediate context. Meanwhile, I've added a sentence about deletion to Ilmari's very useful template (thanks for that), though I think we could have a specific time limit. I'll start a discussion at the template talk page. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChick_Bowen_2101.html" title="User:Chick Bowen">Chick Bowen</a> 16:55, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

I often find that people should have received a test4 or bv template long ago but people often seem to not bother warning people when reverting vandalism or give them too leniant a template i.e. test1 when the edits are clearly vandalism not just a mistake. Really I do not really see the point in warning a blatant vandal as they are not the sort of person who would be likely to take any notice, in fact, it would probably encourage them.

<dd>Consider me a "rogue" admin in this sense. I show no mercy...I even rollback with a different summary for vandals. Adding a&#160;:) or "cool...I can edit" gets a test1....but "I suck cock", which I see here all the time, gets you 24 hours on the spot, more if you vandalized other stuff.

<dd>No vandalism from this particular IP since last warning. The IP appears to be registered to a school, so this is probably a series of separate delinquents rather than one persistent one.

<dd>But the current warning system is just not working properly because people are using either too leniant a template or often not bothering to warn a user at all (resulting in the situation we have with this ip). Arniep 00:08, 18 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I warn with test1 for people just playing around (and I rollback). If they have vandalism with a clear intent to damage the article/person in question, they get a test4 and my revert usually has "reverted vandalism by...to last version by..." in the summary. If the edits show a <i>clear attempt to compromise Wikipedia</i> more than once then they will get:</dd>
<dd>A)blocked indefinitely if it is a new account with an innapropriate/suggestive/fractalic (like "snfdsfnp444") name or an account with no other edits(a vandal account)</dd>
<dd>B)blocked for 24/48 hours if it is an IP or a new user with an exceptable name(most anything) and some other edits (not a vandal account).</dd>
<dd>C)blocked for 15 min - ~1 hour if it is an AOL IP.</dd>
<dd>And pretty much there we go. If someone keeps adding ":)" or "hello?" to an article, they will get test1 up to test4. They are not "true" vandals. Adding "HE IS GAY AND LIKE TO SUCK HUGE COCKS" will get you thrown out the door much faster. It is really just common sense.

<dd>Mindspillage says in her rationale <i>"(warning) What does it cost you? A few minutes of refreshing someone's contributions page to see if they're still at it.</i>". This is the whole problem- that it is not at all the only cost- what it costs is a lot of time wasted by wikipedia contributors in dealing with vandalism when they could be improving articles! I don't think that a distinction should be made between offensive or non offensive vandalism, whatever sort it is it still wastes a lot of time for everybody so is detrimental to the project. I think that the applying of at least a short block of at least half an hour for blatant vandalism would greatly reduce the amount of work in dealing with this problem.

<dd>It really depends on the person you're dealing with. If someone is trolling, then a tame warning will indeed encourage them: if the vandalism was attention-seeking behavior and you warn, they know that they got somebody's attention. However, it's hard to tell a priori what is going on. So it's only fair to warn at least once, but warn according to the severity of the vandalism, ranging from "can I edit this? LOL" (a clear test-1) to some horribly malicious stuff (jump directly to test-4). The person who writes "can I edit this? LOL" will probably stop after test-1. If someone removes a warning or gives some other indication that they are aware of it but just don't care (like writing "screw you, I can do what I want"), I wouldn't hesitate to block immediately. The other thing you can try, but only for serious vandalism: warn once; if they continue, warn a second time and block for 2 minutes. That will force them to go to the talk page and it also sends the message that you mean business. Oh, and I also tend to block longer for sneaky vandalism, like changing dates and numbers. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a>&#160;<small><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkSweep_9d72.html" title="User talk:MarkSweep">(call me collect)</a></small> 00:44, 18 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As to Arniep's last comment: That seems a little extreme though. Plenty of good editors, even admins, once did silly stuff like adding smiles to a page, and it does not hurt our credibility that much either. Using test templates on obvious trolls is a good way to waste time, and hurt our credibility. I guess you do get to rack up your edit count, if you are in to that. Nevertheless, the trolls are the ones that bother me, not the users who are just playing around with an editable encyclopedia for the first time; they may become a good future admin.<b><a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoice_of_All_a6ef.html" title="User:Voice of All"><font color="blue">Voice</font><font color="darkblue">_of_</font><font color="black">All</font></a></b><sup><a href="../../../v/o/i/User_talk%7EVoice_of_All_cf88.html" title="User talk:Voice of All"><font color="blue">T</font></a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Voice_of_All_b66c.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Voice of All">@</a>|<a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="darkgreen">ESP</font></a></sup> 00:47, 18 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, that's a good way to think about it. Try to assess the damage done to Wikipedia's reputation by the vandalism. If no reasonable person will get upset about it (perhaps they will scratch their head and wonder what that smiley is doing there, but they won't pick up the phone and call the Foundation's office), it's benign. If it's designed to cause offense, the gloves are off. Perhaps we should make templates along those distinctions, rather than first warning, second warning, etc. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a>&#160;<small><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkSweep_9d72.html" title="User talk:MarkSweep">(call me collect)</a></small> 01:05, 18 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm afraid that is missing my point, which is that we spend much too much time dealing with vandalism when we could be improving articles. Being liberal with vandals is harming the project.

<dd>(edit conflict)I was deliberatly ignoring your point. How can you possibly know how much time anyone else spends vandalfighting? I frequently do a spot of recent changes patrol when i am otherwise at a loss for what to do. When I'm in the mood to get stuck into an article I don't patrol for vandals. Also when i am patrolling for vandals I often read the pages that i am reverting. Sometimes i edit them to improve them. If I never delt with vandals ever again my article contribution rate would not go up. i'm sure of that. If yours would then stop looking for vandals and start editing articles.

<p>While I think existing policy works fine, I do think people need to use {{<a href="../../../b/v/_/Template%7EBv_74e1.html" title="Template:Bv">bv</a>}} more often. I often see a number of <i>blatant</i> vandals while on RC patrol, and I find it crazy to be using a friendly test message with these people. I recommend going straight to {{<a href="../../../b/v/_/Template%7EBv_74e1.html" title="Template:Bv">bv</a>}} (created just for this purpose) and then if the vandalism continues, {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest4_bd45.html" title="Template:Test4">test4</a>}}. Then only block. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 01:41, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This template (it read, "This user supports the Libertarian Party.") was recently deleted; I was unaware that a simple statement of support for one's political party was somehow divisive. Does anyone have a suggestion for better wording ("This user is a member of the Libertarian Party."?) that would be allowed to stand in template-space? I cannot find any evidence that this went up for TfD and it certainly doesn't seem to qualify for T1 (though, that's what it's listed as)... <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadioKirk_a5db.html" title="User:RadioKirk"><span style="font-size: 13px; color: #161;">Radio</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RadioKirk_8f39.html" title="Special:Contributions/RadioKirk"><span style="font-size: 13px; color: #161;">Kirk</span></a> <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadioKirk_dc7c.html" title="User talk:RadioKirk"><span style="font-size: 10px; color: #161;">talk to me</span></a> 04:06, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you but, if I may persist, this fails to address the issue. I've read discussions on that which is politically divisive and how, for instance, several GWB templates qualify for T1. I remain unconvinced that a simple statement of support for one's political party—or, at the very least, of membership therein—qualifies. A political <b>statement</b> and an acknowledgement of political <b>affiliation</b> hardly compare. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadioKirk_a5db.html" title="User:RadioKirk"><span style="font-size: 13px; color: #161;">Radio</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RadioKirk_8f39.html" title="Special:Contributions/RadioKirk"><span style="font-size: 13px; color: #161;">Kirk</span></a> <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadioKirk_dc7c.html" title="User talk:RadioKirk"><span style="font-size: 10px; color: #161;">talk to me</span></a> 22:18, 18 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Wouldn't it be easier to just forget about your political userbox, as per Jimbo's request, and just write a sentence on your user page about your party affiliation?

<dd>Easier, perhaps, but I'm arguing a principle. I read Jimbo's request as issued in the spirit of the <b>polemic</b>, not necessarily to be extended to a simple acknowledgement of political <b>affiliation</b>.

<p>Some one needs to do something about this page. There has been a long running content dispute there since September 2005, and the page has been protected countless times (and is so now). However, instead of any fruitful discussion, or any decent debate, the two groups of editors remain locked in a mudslinging verbal match. So almost everyday, there would be 10 paragraphs of "you said, I said" venom added to the talk page.</p>
<p>Here is a sample of today's entry from <a href="../../../r/p/s/User%7ERpsugar_c3a3.html" title="User:Rpsugar">Rpsugar</a> (<a href="../../../r/p/s/User_talk%7ERpsugar_dcdc.html" title="User talk:Rpsugar">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Rpsugar_60ef.html" title="Special:Contributions/Rpsugar">contribs</a>):</p>

<p>Can an sysadmin please remove "A Day No Pigs Would Die" from the Children's Book's category? The book has been banned, hence making it not appropriate for children.

<dd>Hmmm, I don't think I'd call it a crystal clear speedy under T1. I'm also not sure I'd call the issue wheel warring. Undeletion policy allows an admin to revert an out of process deletion. If Grue does not believe the template matches T1, from what I can see, one course of action open to him is to declare it out of process and undelete. Might be best to run it through XfD and get consensus on the questionable status of the template. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">talk</a> 15:21, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's a bit premature to say "wheel warring" just because an administrator reverts a deletion. There are many circumstances in which an administrator might do this--one such is the exception clause in the undeletion policy. Obviously if you ended up fighting over it, you could have a wheel war situation, but it looks like you're both being fairly mature over it even if you disagree.</p>
<p>If you really think it should be speedied, I'd try to convince another administrator to do so, or else convince Grue that it should be, in which case he'd probably be happy to do so himself. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 17:01, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article <a href="../../../w/b/o/WBOB_704e.html" title="WBOB">WBOB</a> needs to be changed/moved to WDJO, which is the new callsign for the radio station. The radio station has changed hands last week, and the entire article became invalid. I am in the process of rewriting the article to describe the change, and the future for the station, but obviously the callsign needs to be modified to fit the change, and possibly a redirect from the now defunct WBOB callsign so that users may find the new station.</p>
<p>After reading the help guides, I have become thoroughly confused as to the process of modifying this page, so I thought it best to let some experienced users and administrators know of the issue, so that they could take care of it, rather than me screwing it up royally.</p>

<p>Both <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a>, and <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColle_f98a.html" title="User:Colle">Colle</a> have called my contributions vandalism (each on more than one occasion) and it is really starting to bug me. I'm not sure if wikipedia can do anything, but I've spoken with Hipocrite telling him it would be a content dispute and not vandalism - and I have also posted a message explaining my frustration on the <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion.html" title="Abortion">Abortion</a> talk page. Is there anything else that can be done? This is really upsetting. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChooserr_aa51.html" title="User:Chooserr">Chooserr</a> 02:14, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, you might start by being more cautious in your presentation of information. For example, in <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion.html" title="Abortion">Abortion</a>, you added, <i>It has been reported that abortion is the leading cause of death for women reproductive age in most third world coutnries <a href="http://www.rho.org/html/cont-ec.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rho.org/html/cont-ec.htm" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>.</i> However, looking at your citation, we find it saying, <i>In developing countries where abortion remains illegal, unsafe abortion is a leading cause of death among women of reproductive age.</i> So what's wrong about your interpretation?
<ol>
<li>It's <b>a</b> leading cause, not <b>the</b> leading cause.</li>
<li>The article was talking about <b>illegal</b> abortion.</li>
<li>The article said nothing about <i>most third world countries</i>. It refers specifically to developing countries where abortion remains illegal.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>If we assume good faith, we must assume that you did not understand that your presentation of the data was distorting the data; that it was an honest mistake on your part, and that when the mistake was pointed out you understood the correction. Calling it "vandalism" was incorrect; <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVAND_6593.html" title="WP:VAND">WP:VAND</a> makes it clear that NPOV violations are not vandalism. However, it is blatant and (if my good faith is unwarranted) disingenuous POV editing, and Hipocrite and Colle would be more correct barking up that tree instead. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 03:35, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>At the risk of sounding like a Wikipedia fanboy - when it's described as "Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia that anyone can edit", it shows how well the Wikimedia Foundation's branding and publicity efforts have worked. Because that's really the key, and it's good to see an article that doesn't focus on criticisms of Wikipedia's reliability and accuracy. It's also interesting to read about the Chinese Wikipedia - due to the language barrier, many of us have no idea what's going on there. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 05:31, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well....hmmm. I would say that consensus is needed for deletion the 1st time. So during the 1st AfD/TfD consensus, you need ~60-66% to delete (depends on socks/arguments/consensus too), anything less is keep/redirect/merge. DRV is a challenge to a decision...it should require consensus to overturn...not just "some people disagree with deletion" or a even weak majority. Otherwise DRV becomes useless and gets flooded, because if ~40% is needed to keep for TfD and ~51% needed for DRV...anyone might as well challenge almost every single TfD/AfD if they disagree with the decision; when only a 7-12 people vote (like most normal AfDs/TfDs) that 40% could too easily be 50%, especially when people "rally" or it is seen as just "a vote".<b><a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoice_of_All_a6ef.html" title="User:Voice of All"><font color="blue">Voice</font><font color="darkblue">-of-</font><font color="black">All</font></a></b><sup><a href="../../../v/o/i/User_talk%7EVoice_of_All_cf88.html" title="User talk:Voice of All"><font color="blue">T</font></a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Voice_of_All_b66c.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Voice of All">@</a>|<a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="darkgreen">ESP</font></a></sup> 04:40, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Opps....well hopefully my lecture is still usefull. In this case though...then DRV is like the 1st time, since Speedy is unilateral...so then they should be undeleted.

<p>Just now I got a message from <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz">User:Deiz</a> about a possible copyright infringement of Image:HIM logo.jpg. Here is his message:</p>
<p><i>How are you the "creator of this work"? This is as clear-cut a case of copyright violation as I've yet seen on WP. It's the intellectual property and trademark of HIM, which in turn Bam Margera has sub-licensed for a fee. Just because you drew a copy of it in MSPaint doesn't mean you created it, much less have the right to release it into the public domain under the GDFL - what if you did the same to the McDonald's M? You even gave it the filename "HIM logo". There is a tag for "logo" which you should immediately apply to this image. Copyrighted images can only be used on WP to identify the artists and works they belong to, which does not include being part of a WP editor's signature. This is exactly what all the picture licensing controls are designed to avoid. <b><font style="verdana" color="#990099">++D</font><font color="#669900">e</font><font color="#9900CC">iz</font></b> 05:07, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</i></p>
<p>My response to this is didn't I draw it? Meaning, if I draw an image, whatever it may be doesn't mean that I created it? Now, I know it's HIM/Bam Margera's log and all but does that stop people from drawing a heartagram? If it is copyright infringement, I'll be happy to remove it where needed.

<dd>Same here. You don't say "I'd hate to see this go to court" unless you're planning to go there (or want the other person to think you are). The entire point of mentioning court is to scare the other party into submission, or in other words, to get your way by alluding to legal action, so it counts as a legal threat in my book. <font color="#696969"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> <sup><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><i>Talk</i></a> • <i>Contact</i></sup></font> 06:30, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Over at the science reference desk there's a 13-year-old Wikipedia editor (User:Bowlhover) who's talking about committing suicide and seems serious about it. Without getting into the ethics of whether or not to let him, I think it would be a very good idea if we could let some professional counsellors know what's going on. We're doing okay at the moment I think, but none of us are trained in this. Any suggestions as to what to do?

<ul>
<li><b>quick suggestion</b>: If the check user info includes this user's location, you could do a bit of research on the net, 411 or whatever, and see if you can find a local suicide provention hotline or mentalhealth crisis hotline and refer the user to that. if the check user info is more specific (i.e. you can deduce the user's identity, or parents (likely owners of the connection?)), you could contact the local social services or children's protection services and alert them to the problem or as mentioned before, the local police. If the isp is a schoolboard connection, perhaps notifying the administration there would be a good option (on the chance that students are required to log-in to access the net, site historys may be able to i.d. the specific user?). At my work (a homeless shelter) threats of suicide and self harm are usually reason enough to involve the police (ofcourse this can be a matter of discression depending on how serious someone appears, sometimes engaging the person will work before the police are needed. of cource, over the net, its hard to tell.) someone communicating a desire to commit suicide or self harm is a bit diffrent, we usually try to emphisize engaging the person, or getting them talking on a crisis line. if it escalates, the police would then be called. Again, the net is not a great fourm for evaluating this. I thin the goal should be getting this user <b>face to face</b> to someone who can talk to them, asses the situation and make proper refferals. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_McGregor_%28Can%29_39a4.html" title="User:Mike McGregor (Can)">Mike McGregor (Can)</a> 17:01, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I still think the local police to the IP (if you can get such, ie a local ISP, otherwise call the ISP to contact the police) is the best bet. They have access to the proper people, as well as they can force an individual to seek counceling. It is a life or death matter to be delt with seriously by the police, no one else. We are not their parents, if you saw someone say im going to kill myself on a roof would you be calling councelers for them?

<p>We've had a few users who appear to have had some disturbance, and a few of those whose long-winded rants included overt threats of sexual violence. As our userbase grows, concerns like that are <i>also</i> going to grow, as well as ones over potential suicidal ideations. It would be nice if we had some system in place to deal with them, even if it's just a standing email adress to handball them off to.

<p>Yesterday I created {{<a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfd-privacy_bdbf.html" title="Template:Afd-privacy">Afd-privacy</a>}}, a template intended to extend Jimbo's "afd-blanking" crusade, so that users know what's going on, that it <i>wasn't</i> vandalism, that the original discussion is still available, and so on. My view is that AfD discussions could still be closed as normal, etc., but on receipt of complaint, or if anyone's worried about privacy issues with the AfD discussion, the subpage can be blanked no sooner than 24 hours after closing (to give people a chance to see the discussion as she was closed), and this template bunged <del>hither</del> <i>thither</i> to provide a decent explanation as to why it all happened.

<p>This is not true, since for almost all works, published in Soviet Union before 1973 copyright was restored on January 1 1996 according GATT provisions, signed by President Clinton in 1994.

<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>I have a 2:27 minute mpeg (25 MB) video clip that gives a snapshot of Tehran University. I intend to upload it on <a href="../../../t/e/h/Tehran_University_d4a3.html" title="Tehran University">Tehran University</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/g/Higher_education_in_Iran_8a25.html" title="Higher education in Iran">Higher education in Iran</a> articles. The promotionary video clip is made by the Public Relations Office of Tehran University itself. My father worked there. I think the videoclip will be very useful, even though very brief.</p>
<p>To where do I upload it (is the uploading just like an image)? And what about tagging? Does it need it, and if so, what tag and how?--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 03:46, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Uploading audio/video is just like uploading an image, but I don't know what the size limits are. You can use Media: instead of Image: when linking to get a direct link to the video.

<dd>The example you provide seems to me to be a synthetic statement and thus a violation of NOR. for what it is worth I have had a variety of conflicts with RJII. In my experience he seldom if ever provides citable sources beyond dictionary definitions or other encyclopedias, and is an extremely tendentious editor who refuses to accept any opinion other than his own. Note that he would probably say the same thing about me. Alas, my guess is that most of the editors who can attest to RJII's disruptive behavior are ones who have experienced it directly, i.e. people who have also had conflicts with him. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 16:26, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, see my problem is of the other foot. After discussion with both sides I can see where RJII is coming from with regards this article, so I want to ensure my potential bias towards his position is removed and let someone else have a view.

<dd>I used to edit that page extensively, but I gave up mostly because of RJII's uncompromising and impolite nature. I was not always perfect either, but I do think that he is unwilling to compromise on anything, which many of us tried doing numerous times. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force">The Ungovernable Force</a> 01:29, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I am glad you are having a different experience. My suggestion would be to work with him on finding verifiable sources. However pigheaded he may be, if he always has a verifiable source (and I think books and journal articles are better than using other encyclopedias), he will be on safe ground. I assume no one is accusing him of violating NPOV. See if you think there is anywhere else he may be on weak ground in terms of NOR. As long as he can provide verifiable sources, people can criticize or disagree with him all they want, but his edits will stand. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 17:41, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm saying I don't see any revert at all here, unless I compared the wrong versions. In any case, it doesn't matter - if you have to ask whether or not you're violating 3RR, then you either are, or you're gaming the system. But in this case, I don't see any reason to worry. I'm saying that if you make 4 edits in a row, even if that counts as a revert (i.e. you reverted once, then you put that info back in over four edits - that's basically a second revert), that's still only one, not four. Perhaps I don't understand the question, but perhaps you shouldn't use 3RR and get some other dispute resolution steps out there. --<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolbez_ce9f.html" title="User:Golbez">Golbez</a> 23:54, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I suspect there's some confusion here over meaning. Cyberboomer, you <i>do</i> know there is a difference between "change" and "revert", right? "Revert" means to change a page back to a <i>previous</i> version, or to restore <i>removed</i> material or re-delete material <i>added</i>? There aren't any hard-and-fast rules (that I'm aware of) limiting the number of changes you can make at a time (though major changes are probably best discussed ahead of time, even if only as a courtesy); however, there <b>are</b> rules about <i>reversing</i> other editors's work, in order to prevent back-and-forth "edit wars" (<a href="../../../l/a/m/WP%7ELAME_0afb.html" title="WP:LAME">WP:LAME</a> has some priceless examples). --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 00:06, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
