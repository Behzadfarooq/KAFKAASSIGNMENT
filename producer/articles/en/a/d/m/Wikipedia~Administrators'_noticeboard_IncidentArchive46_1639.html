<p>I'd welcome some outside comment on <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">User:Jguk</a>. See his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=jguk" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=jguk" rel="nofollow">user contributions</a>, and the past <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Jguk_Evidence_ecc2.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Jguk/Evidence">arbcom</a> decision regarding him. The vast majority of this user's edits are disruptive and seem to be trolling. He is currently engaged is several edit wars over date styles, spelling styles, and other issues. His past arbcom decision specifically warned him against revert warring, which he ignores. Most users have accepted the compromise to not change date styles, except for <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">User:Jguk</a>. For example:</p>
<p>He has changed date styles on several articles, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../f/u/_/Fu_Hsi_aa35.html" title="Fu Hsi">Fu Hsi</a>: (to which he has made <b>13</b> reverts, after initially changing date styles) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fu_Hsi&amp;diff=20489437&amp;oldid=20486673" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fu_Hsi&amp;diff=20489437&amp;oldid=20486673" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></li>

</ul>
<p>He also seems intent upon stirring up more revert wars over spelling styles, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheese.html" title="Cheese">Cheese</a>: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cheese&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=23620528" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cheese&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=23620528" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></li>

</ul>
<p>He also performs unexplained deletions from articles, and subsequent revert warring to enforce his POV: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sumerian_king_list&amp;diff=24497890&amp;oldid=22478670" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sumerian_king_list&amp;diff=24497890&amp;oldid=22478670" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sumerian_king_list&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=24586497" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sumerian_king_list&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=24586497" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sumerian_king_list&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=24592922" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sumerian_king_list&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=24592922" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sumerian_king_list&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=24646428" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sumerian_king_list&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=24646428" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>.</p>
<p>These are just a few examples, and represent the tip of the iceberg of this users deliberate and provocative edits, and all have occurred since his arbcom case. He has also been quite uncivil towards me, accusing me of various unsubstantiated charges. I would appreciate it if someone would inform this user of Wikipedia's policies regarding styles, civility, consensus, and revert warring.

<dl>
<dd>Yeah, I'm not entirely happy about this myself either. Jguk, could you do both yourself and us a favour and steer clear of date-notation issues? --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 03:53, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Seems rather bad. Hopefully Jguk will show up to give his side of the story. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 04:22, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>What seems bad? First, please look at Sortan's contributions. It probably is a role account that has been trolling on this date issue for sometime (as well as a bit of wikistalking of myself and personal attackes). Second, which of Sortan's edits are you defending? Does anyone doubt that when an anon changed some dates in a page titled up 52 BC that they should be changed back to (i) be consistent with the title?; (ii) be consistent with the WP approach of not changing these things? What motive can Sortan have to edit-war over that other than to be disruptive?</p>
<dl>
<dd>So wikistalking in the defense that every vandal can now use? You are allowed to make article "consistent" without violating the truce, but others aren't? Please elaborate... <a href="../../../s/o/r/User%7ESortan_7006.html" title="User:Sortan">Sortan</a> 15:04, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The other examples that Sortan gives bar one are of other editors (mostly himself) aggressively edit-warring to change the date styles from a stable version that used BC to suit his personal preference - again contrary to WP policy. The exception is the article on "cheese", which, after I changed wording so that it was more vivid (and didn't use any date style whatsoever). The aggressive edit-warring by Sortan and others to make sure that it did include their date style at all costs has resulted in an error arising in the article (which, of course, I can't correct because it would be edit-warred back to the error). Have a look at the initial insertion of date references and what they say now.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Please elaborate on what you think the error is? Your change resulted from a desire to remove references to BCE rather that an attempt to improve the article, and the changes you instituted made the article worse and inaccurate, as noted by several others. As for the aggressive edit-warring.... do you want to count up the number of your reverts vs. anyone else and see how much greater your number is? <a href="../../../s/o/r/User%7ESortan_7006.html" title="User:Sortan">Sortan</a> 15:04, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>So the links above all show examples of my enforcing wikipedia policy about not changing date styles. Sortan's user contributions, however, show the opposite.</p>
<p>Once you've examined Sortan's history - and questioned why he has made this comment just below my comments on him - you'll see which user is acting in good faith, which one has a strong history of supporting wikipedia, and which one whose vast majority of edits have been knowingly disruptive. I'd welcome support in reminding Sortan of why we are here (ie to write an encyclopaedia) and to tell him to stop the disruption he is causing, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 06:22, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Not sure what Sortan's previous account was (and this is such a blatant role account), but his next one was going to be James-R - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 10:03, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd also like to ask Jguk to stay away from the issue of dates and reverting over other style issues he disagrees with.

<p>SV, you may recall that the WP approach to this style issue is not to change the style, and I abide by this. The flip side of this is that when someone does attempt to change the style, it is reverted. That is all I'm doing - enforcing the current policy, and I urge others to join me in doing so. As far as issues on verifiability are concerned, I have a long record of being interested in similar issues, and when I saw there was a long discussion on there, I was interested to see the page. I made a small copyediting adjustment to bring consistency to the language (which has nothing whatsoever to do with the BCE style issue) and bolstered up the language in some places. You then decided you did not like my copyediting adjustment to give consistency as you preferred to adjust for consistency in the opposite direction - and take umbrage at me for it too. Please don't make this disagreement personal, thanks, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 19:07, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Don't play games. I don't see this as at all personal, but you know you followed me to that page, and you made a little anti-PC edit while you were there just to be annoying. Please point me to the policy that says style issues ought not to be changed. You argued precisely the opposite for weeks on end over the British v American English issue on the MoS, namely that they <i>must</i> be changed, no matter how established one style was, in order to make the style consistent with the subject matter, and so far as I recall, you ended up getting your own way because you wore the opposition down with constant reverting and arguing. Now suddenly you've changed your mind because the first-contributor rule suits you over the BC/BCE issue, and now that you see things differently, you claim that policy supports you, which you also claimed when you were arguing exactly the opposite. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 19:57, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I made numerous edits on that page, unfortunately you concentrate on the one you disagree with. You now fault me for abiding by current policies and approaches whilst arguing that, where I think they are wrong, they should be changed. Isn't that what we're meant to do when we disagree with a policy? Where my preferred approach and current policy give the same end effect (albeit for different reasons), of course I have to cite current policy, not my preferred reasoning, as the justification - one has the weight of an agreed approach, one doesn't, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 20:04, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I really don't understand your positions at all. When it comes to spelling styles, popularity and google counts are not to be taken into account (for example <a href="../../../y/o/g/Yogurt.html" title="Yogurt">Yogurt</a>, where you gleefully changed AE to BE <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yoghurt&amp;diff=13627710&amp;oldid=13627391" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yoghurt&amp;diff=13627710&amp;oldid=13627391" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yoghurt&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=13627796" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yoghurt&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=13627796" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>), but when it comes to date styles, popularity suddenly becomes all important. When it comes to spelling styles, the style should reflect the subject matter, but when it comes to date styles the first contributor should be followed. Consistency is paramount, except where you disagree with that consistency, in which case, the article should be inconsistent.&#160;???? <a href="../../../s/o/r/User%7ESortan_7006.html" title="User:Sortan">Sortan</a> 21:21, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'd also like to ask what policy you believe you're applying here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sumerian_king_list&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=24660899" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sumerian_king_list&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=24660899" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>?

<dd>IMO, this is a matter of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECivility_3fb1.html" title="WP:Civility">tolerance and civility</a>: certain minorities consider BC/AD notation inappropriate and offensive in articles deeply related to their religion &amp; history, and prefer alternative denominationally-neutral and commonly accepted BCE/CE <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/ce.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.religioustolerance.org/ce.htm" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>.

<p>Although I make no apology for preferring what I see to be a more reader-friendly approach than the "don't change date notation" compromise, I do abide by it. I continue to urge other editors to do likewise. Remember it cuts both ways - WP says both BC/AD notation and BCE/CE notation is acceptable, but don't go changing the style. Where others have edited inconsistently with that compromise, I have reverted them, and will continue to do so. Similarly where certain editors have tried to change articles that are stable in using BCE notation to BC notation, they have been reverted by others enforcing the compromise, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 19:39, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's not quite what WP policy is. The arbcom ruling was don't change from one style to another unless there is a substantial reason to do so. Editors on some pages believe there is a substantial reason. You revert their edits nevertheless, in what looks to me like a violation of the arbcom ruling. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 00:30, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Actually, I'm not on the Arbcom so I can't be sure that my evaluation of your case being a likely reject candidate is sound.

<ul>
<li>Well, perhaps "vigilante" should be replaced with "reckless". I have now seen some admins who have done some pretty reckless things be awarded a barnstar for actions which were needlessly disruptive without many redeeming points. I am left thinking that if a newbie started doing some of those things (they cannot delete AFD discussions, but they can blank them), we would be sending them angry messages not to do so and then threaten with blocks. Personally, I think administrators and established users should be held to <i>higher</i> standards since they should know the rules, while the introduction of such a barnstar seems to suggest that they are not even held to the <i>same</i> standard. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 15:04, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>CALUMNY ALERT! MATIA accuses me of calumnies against him, but in his own logic, it is OK for him to make calumnies against me. MATIA, do the phrases <i>innocent until proven guilty</i> and <i>the burden of proof rests on the prosecution</i> mean anything to you?

<p>At first it was a user who said he was Albanian and wanted to force that Arvanites are an Albanian minority in Greece. I've told him that he should respect the <b>culture</b> and the <b>history</b> of Arvanites. He had discussions with various users and at some point he gave up. During the '90s the Albanian president Berisha did the same claim and there were many written protests from Arvanites in Greek mass media. Arvanites and Albanians same a partly common origin, yet Arvanites don't want to be labeled as Albanians. REX got involved at some point, and after a while, he prefered to label the people he talked with as greek-extremists instead of. And later he copy pasted again and again parts from a Unesco report and a helsinki watch report and today the talk page is very <b>difficult to read</b> for people, like <b>the admin who blocked me</b>. He asked for an RFC and I've supported him. Unfortunately the RFC's on balkan history are left unanswered.

<dd>At some point around september, after seeing that RFC didn't work, I've started looking for sources on Arvanites.

The other book is about their <b>culture</b>: it has Arvanitic songs and few pages about their <b>language</b>.

The solution to the disagreement would seem to be actually quite simple: there are multiple points of view involved, and they should be properly attributed and represented neutrally as diverging points of view. Instead, each side takes their own POV as The Truth and tries to discredit and malign the other side. Several attempts at getting the parties to work towards a compromise have failed: the article was protected, the editors were given a forced cooling-off period, etc. We need some new ideas. One thing to try would be to start imposing sanctions for inflammatory or insulting remarks (such as accusing others of lying) and general stubbornness (such as insisting on formal apologies).

<dd>I agree, I have already asked MATIA to draft a proposal, so that I know what he wants. He refused. He has started this conversation in a lame attempt to discredit me. The tactics are well known and such tactics are employed by people who have no sources to support their claims. I have made proposals twice, I have proposed mediation twice, I have found all the sources and I have requested comment (no one answered). MATIA hasn't provided any sources. Everything he said was in the form that he knows better and that I should listen to him because I know nothing about the Arvanites. I want to get this over with. MATIA is not co-operating, I want to know what he wants, I want to know what his sources are. He won't respond. MATIA, how about writing a proposal on how you want the article and present it with your sources like I have done on at least two occasions?

<p>If you check MATIA's <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Matia.gr_f3da.html" title="Special:Contributions/Matia.gr">contributions</a>, you will see that he has been active and knows what is going on on <a href="../../../b/o/m/User_talk%7EBomac_71d1.html" title="User talk:Bomac">User_talk:Bomac</a>, presumably through his watchlist.

<p>I know that a number of admins and other editors have run up against this person, and have dicovered that he's not amenable to reason. After an instant flare up when I copy-edited an article on which he'd been working, he's been following me around.

<dd>I went to his talk page to offer an olive branch, but Shauri has already left a lovely message that was much more generous than any I would've made.

<dd>You're likely using the wrong stick: I think the time for olive branches has long past. Reading his Talk page, I can see that first I, then Knowledge Seeker, then Ann Heneghan, and now Shauri have all cautioned him in the most polite of terms against personal attacks, all to no avail. The pattern of Anittas' behavior and the utter groundlessness of his objections to Mel is such that I'm inclined to think that RFC would serve as nothing more than as another pulpit from which to bash Mel and his "defenders." I strongly feel the next step is a clear and unequivocal warning that continued stalking, personal attacks and the recruiting and encouragement of other nogoodniks to his campaign will result in temporary blocking for disruptiveness. I'll be pursuing this course with Anittas with Mel's permission should Shauri's attempt fail. <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 22:40, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I suggest you to have a look at the reply at his Talk Page. I was expecting a better reaction, but I'm afraid that's all I could achieve. I may be naif, but not enough as to realize that his "offer of good will" means only a "surrender without conditions". Mel, my apollogies for taking action without your express consent - but despite we have only talked twice before, it's the least I could do for the person who welcomed me when I joined WP seven months ago.

<p>Mel, stop trying to make people do your (clean - not dirty) work. Hannibal and Byzantine relied too much on mercenary troops and look what happened to them. Yeah, I'm sure you don't have time to waste on a RfC against me - especially when you're busy with the RfC made against you.</p>
<p>Shauri, thank you for your lovely message. It was nice. I offered Mel peace. I offered him status quo. He didn't care to take it. He won't address me directly. He only likes to address me in third person. How am I supposed to communicate with him? If Mel wanted peace, he could have gotten it from day one. Then day two. Then day three, and so on. He could make peace, to-day, if he wanted to. But why would he want peace? He feels stimulated by my bitriol comments made against him. Mel, you're a philosopher and stuff. Tell us: what philosopher argued that man needs an enemy to define himself? It was something in that direction. You need me, Mel.

<dd>(after edit conflict) For most people, once someone hangs up a dial up connection or turns off a DSL connection they give up their IP, and the ISP then reassigns it to someone else the next time someone connects to the system. Hence if you block an IP, they might just hang up their modem connection, redial and get a new IP. Meanwhile, the IP you have blocked for a year could be picked up by anyone who uses the same ISP, and suddenly they would be blocked even though they are entirely innocent. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 02:21, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Which means that they must have been editing, and been blocked from, Wikipedia at some time shortly before. If they had been using a username, it would have had to be more than 24 hours ago, or the IP autoblocker would have got them. I doubt any vandal stays that mad for 24 hours. Therefore, it is overwhelmingly likely that this person evaded their block by taking advantage of their dynamic IP.

<dd>regarding you being armed I don't even want to know&#160;:), but on the fact that any actions from IP's especially for AOL and such are just treated like oh well they're trolls but we can't block them because a legit person who isn't threatening to kill one of ouredits might be affected by the block and it's so hard for him/her to request to be unblocked, it isn't. I for one add to my watchlist the userpage of every user that I block for over a week just in case something like that happens and even though I would hate for a person to be innocently affected and I hate banning unless necessary I think that we can't stop treating IP's with kid gloves just because their IP's even if that involves forcing the ISP's to cooperate and deal with the issue themselves or risk being cut off. <small><a href="../../../j/t/k/User%7EJtkiefer_5ea4.html" title="User:Jtkiefer"><font color="#FF9900">Jtkiefer</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../j/t/k/User_talk%7EJtkiefer_123b.html" title="User talk:Jtkiefer"><font color="#00A86B">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jtkiefer_1273.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jtkiefer"><font color="#FF0033">@</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jtkiefer_4fd4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jtkiefer"><font color="#0000FF">C</font></a></sup></small> ----- 01:38, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The talk page on this article is home to a rancorous debate between some Hindu and Sikh Rajputs and some Muslim Rajputs. It continues to spill over into the article itself; in particular, a fellow named Shivraj without a wikipedia account keeps adding a hopelessly chauvinist and carelessly edited section to the article. I don't want to start a revert war, but his edits are awful and totally un-encyclopedic, and have made the article too long.

<dd>In spite of the fact he has lashed out at several of my friends and now at me (because he feels I've somehow rejected his friendship), Iam compelled to write something in Spawn Man's defense.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Contributions, he has made many, including numerous WWI battles and campaigns (and is an active member of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Battles_64fd.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Battles">Wikipedia:WikiProject Battles</a> ). He has had 5 of the articles he started featured in DYK over a very short period of time. So this is not some mere vandal, troll or pest but a very prolific and enthusiastic contributor.</li>
<li>Age, while it may not be an excuse is certainly a valid explanation and should be taken into consideration. It is not easy being 14 with all the hormones gushing into ones brain. The sense of self-esteem tottering on a pin-head. And it is sometimes very hard just to say "I'm sorry". I'm still apologizing for or embarassed by some of the things I said/did as a teenager.</li>
<li>A poor example. He made some silly, childish and rude comments earlier on my talk page, similar to those he would make later to Wiglaf. I deleted them, simply out of impulse because I felt they had no place there and made both him and my talkpage look bad. He noticed and took it as a sign that it was ok and would later do the same on his. I feel responsible for this, especially since it seems to be the major charge against him. Had I known, rest assured, I would have spared my delete key. Mea Culpa...sorry.</li>
<li>Other circumstances. His user page has been vandalized no less than 3 times in as many days. This would put any of us in a combative mood and perhaps a wee bit paranoid too. Plus he has had some deletions/edit wars with some of his articles.</li>
</ul>
<p>While I certainly do not condone his recent behavior, I think banning and/or blocking is an extreame measure. He has vowed to "Turn over a new leaf". I think he deserves a fair chance to do this. Please consider. Thanks, --<a href="../../../r/2E/d/User%7ER.D.H._%28Ghost_In_The_Machine%29_1bea.html" title="User:R.D.H. (Ghost In The Machine)">R.D.H.

<dd>I hope it for your sake Ghost, since you appear to appreciate him. His possible auto-vandalism would be consistent with his unsavoury use of the "wheel chair joke" to gain sympathy. A method he admits to use consciously on your talkpage<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:R.D.H._%28Ghost_In_The_Machine%29&amp;diff=24798415&amp;oldid=24798385" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:R.D.H._%28Ghost_In_The_Machine%29&amp;diff=24798415&amp;oldid=24798385" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>, in spite of the fact the he claims it to be a "joke" on his talkpage. However, what concerns me most is that he still fails to grasp <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">Wikipedia:Civility</a>, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:R.D.H._%28Ghost_In_The_Machine%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=24891813" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:R.D.H._%28Ghost_In_The_Machine%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=24891813" rel="nofollow">here</a>, something for which he has recently been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Spawn_Man&amp;diff=24813657&amp;oldid=24807292" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Spawn_Man&amp;diff=24813657&amp;oldid=24807292" rel="nofollow">admonished</a> by <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> who refers to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;oldid=24323046#Talk:Helen_Clark" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;oldid=24323046#Talk:Helen_Clark" rel="nofollow">earlier warnings</a>.

<dd>I appreciate his contributions, enthusiasm and his friendship, such that it is. I do not appreciate his behaviour at times, as in the examples you provide. But I'd like to think, overall, his good qualities outweigh his bad (I also noticed his Oriental retelling of "The Parable Of The Spoons", but had no idea it saved him from a block). So far he has kept his vow. I take this as a positive sign and that there is no need for him to be "babysat" by anyone yet. But should it come to that, might I recommend <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELordAmeth_30dd.html" title="User:LordAmeth">LordAmeth</a> for this task? Should he be confirmed as admin and if he is willing? He has SM's trust and respect. He also hasnt crossed him yet, as we have, and seems a lot more patient with him than we are. --<a href="../../../r/2E/d/User%7ER.D.H._%28Ghost_In_The_Machine%29_1bea.html" title="User:R.D.H.

<p>An editor who clearly exhibits a consistent editing pattern and other tell-tales has been using a variety of usernames and IP addresses. His use of multiple accounts in order to edit the same articles, or vote for deletions turned to sock puppetry. I bring this to other admins' attention in order to invite additional input to this this editor, whom I hope can learn to work in more collegial manner. He undoubtedly makes many useful contributions, but his prediliction to sock puppetry ought to be curbed. His past incarnations have included:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>see above</i></li>
</ul>
<p>The editor is particularly given to editing lists, and articles on guns, Iceland, "Ich Bin Ein Berliner"/donuts, Battlestar Galactica/Star Trek (and other sci-fi), vampires/werewolves, the Cold War, the American Civil Liberties Union, as well as a variety of other articles. This is not a vandal, but perhaps an editor who can become more helpful to the project. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 07:30, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Credit goes to Willmcw for finding the pattern in this confusing mess. I've been posting notes on any number of his or her user talk pages and article talk pages trying to get in touch with him regarding his "dispute" on <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_War_f6d9.html" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>. But instead the article gets reverted by one new sockpuppet after another almost daily... This is quite odd. Every editor who has shown such dedication to any goal on Wikipedia uses the talk pages, often to the point of soap-boxing. I can't figure out any way to explain this behavior. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> | <a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.html" title="User talk:172">Talk</a> 07:55, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would like to add some more user names to the above list. If Willmcw wants to combine these with his list, that's fine by me:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>see above</i></li>
</ul>
<p>I'm certain there's more, but that's all I've got for now.

<dd>Thanks, Willmcw, for sorting that out. There were a couple of names in the preliminary list I came up with that were probably innocent bystanders, and it looks like you've figured out which were which and found many more.

<p>I'm not familiar with "getting X on wheels" as an English idiom. Unless this is regional slang (a google reference would help here), it seems Redwolf24 is just teasing us with an intentional choice of words and a small prank. He's joking about carrying a bomb in his luggage at airport security, and I'm just the humorless drone writing it down in the incidents log.</p>
<p>I realized though that I had no idea, offhand, what to do if we ever had an enemy-within emergency. Good bookmarks include <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Stewards" class="extiw" title="m:Stewards">m:Stewards</a> and <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Requests_for_permissions" class="extiw" title="m:Requests_for_permissions">m:Requests for permissions</a>, however the latter points out that if an urgent de-adminship is ever required, the best thing to do is to contact a developer on the #wikimedia-tech IRC channel. By the way, it turns out that admins can delete pages even when blocked (though they can't move them). I can picture at least one reason why that's not a good thing. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 08:50, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>They can also unblock themselves, so it's really a moot point. I'd personally like to see blocks disable all modifications to wikipedia, including rollback/protection/blocking and even self unblocking. That way we could respond more quickly to admins gone bad or hijacked accounts, and should things ever become so bad that admins start blocking eachother for dishonourable reasons without there being anyone not reasonable enough to unblock them again we've lost already anyway. I see no problem with technically enforcing the no-self-unblocks rule. --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 08:56, 6 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I for one, have questioned the admin self-unblock feature, though I was ignored&#160;:) I still feel strongly about it being disabled. If I get blocked for something, reguardless of reason, I would expect to be unblocked for a good one, not just because I was able. The ability doesn't give the right. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Who_d857.html" title="Special:Contributions/Who"><font color="#000000">∞</font></a><a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho_d957.html" title="User:Who">Who</a><a href="../../../w/h/o/User_talk%7EWho_fe12.html" title="User talk:Who"><font color="#FF0033">?</font><font color="#FF00FF">¿</font><font color="#0033FF">?</font></a> 09:17, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I'd tend to agree. The ability to unblock yourself seems particularly silly, but a blocked admin should really find themselves in the same position as any other blocked user; just able to edit their own talk page. One rule for everyone is a decent enough motto. <a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFiliocht_c3e2.html" title="User:Filiocht">Filiocht</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/l/User_talk%7EFiliocht_11a7.html" title="User talk:Filiocht">The kettle's on</a> 09:18, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>It's not an entirely moot point. In an emergency, you could simply do continuous blocking (one per second if necessary, or multiple admins tag-teaming) until a steward could be contacted. If the block itself has no effect, however, there's no point. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 09:25, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The ability to unblock oneself is probably needed as a failsafe sanity measure. With a block bot I suspect I could block all admins on the English wikipedia within 60 seconds or less. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 09:25, 6 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well then I know what you will be doing on April's Fools day&#160;:) Chances of a rouge admin or compromised admin account running a block bot are fairly slim I think. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Who_d857.html" title="Special:Contributions/Who"><font color="#000000">∞</font></a><a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho_d957.html" title="User:Who">Who</a><a href="../../../w/h/o/User_talk%7EWho_fe12.html" title="User talk:Who"><font color="#FF0033">?</font><font color="#FF00FF">¿</font><font color="#0033FF">?</font></a> 09:31, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Just to add that the unblocking yourself feature is useful when one finds oneself blocked as a result of an block on a dynamic or proxy IP that causes collateral damage, which I have suffered on a number of occasions just this last couple of weeks alone. --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> (<a href="../../../k/h/a/User_talk%7EKhaosworks_e07b.html" title="User talk:Khaosworks">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Khaosworks_06d3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Khaosworks">contribs</a>) 09:47, 6 October 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's not an unblock of yourself though, that's an unblock of an IP; you could still disallow unblocking yourself as a user. I'd be fine with both being prevented though. Regular editors manage to get unblocked when they get collateralled just fine, admins should be quite able to cope. --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 14:33, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I too realized it was a joke, but felt it was one best reverted (for the sake of anyone who might drop by Guettearda's page and not know what was going on). It wasn't that much work, and I blocked Red for 17 seconds (a la Jimbo re: Boothy443) to remind him to be careful of what he does, and received a playful 17 second block back (which I don't mind at all, so don't make a big deal out of it). I felt, and continue to feel, that "Medcom on wheels" was an innocent colloquialism, and that the inside joking between Guettarda and Red was innocent and frankly, funny. We have to have a sense of humor here: If we take every action seriously and catastrophize it into the most nefarious plot possible (i.e., one of our more prolific admins is really WOW) then we will very quickly start to lose valuable contributors over molehills made into mountains. <b>This should not become another RickK.</b> -- <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> · <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay">Talk</a> 18:12, 6 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I concur with Essjay. It was silly, and RC patrol was probably alarmed for a bit about the possibility of a doppelganger, so perhaps it wasn't the best thought-out joke. Essjay reverted it, no further mayhem occurred, no harm done, certainly not worth anything more than a reminder not to make the RC patrollers drop their coffeemugs in worry when they don't know about the joke. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindspillage_87a5.html" title="User:Mindspillage">Mindspillage</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMindspillage_c644.html" title="User talk:Mindspillage">(spill yours?)</a> 00:21, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am appalled that people would take such an obvious joke so seriously. If Guettarda really gave a damn, he would have said something about it. And Guettarda obviously found humor in this. I see nothing wrong with administrators (or rather, any users) messing around in the user space, so long as everyone involved agrees that it's in jest, and it doesn't affect other users. This did neither. A few contributors who are a little too tight-assed about things have led to one of the best admins I know on Wikipedia to take a Wikibreak. I know some people were pissed over April Fool's jokes, but none of them were threatened with de-adminship, and their pranks were a lot more visible than Redwolf24's. Let's remember that we're here to build an encyclopedia, but let's also remember that things like this don't disrupt it at all, and are part of what makes Wikipedia fun. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315"><font color="red">Ral</font></a><a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315"><font color="green">315</font></a> <a href="../../../p/o/s/WP%7EPOST_8e4c.html" title="WP:POST"><font color="blue">W<sub>S</sub></font></a> 02:51, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I just got up to speed on this whole thing, and frankly, I'm disgusted. Sure, WoW is an asshole, but it's in NO WAY comparable to joking about a bomb in an airport--no way in hell. I had noticed the comment on Red's talk page, and laughed, but it wasn't until I saw Essjay's page that my blood really started to boil.

It's a fucking <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colloquialism.html" title="Colloquialism">colloquialism</a>, people, I mean Jesus H. Christ! It's not so much that people can't take a joke (which they obviously can't), but that this seems to definately be a time when the community has overreacted.

<p>Guys, let's not start finger-pointing here. One decent admin taking a break is bad-enough; we don't need to chase off any more, especially when all of this is a <b>huge misunderstanding</b>. OK, we've come to a consensus already. Do we need to continue to express our outrage that will do nothing but irritate some of the above admins? I urge everybody to take a deep breath, and calm down.

<p>this should help, a sub-topic heading. Acutually I did forget to comment on the ability to delete pages while blocked. I think this is much worse than being able to unblock oneself. Say we did have a rogue admin, this ability defeats the purpose of blocking someone, even if they could still unblock themselves, they could easily be blocked again.

<dd>I suggest that an admin should be able to unblock any other user while blocked, but not unblock themselves, or use any other admin powers. That should satisfy any problem with one admin gone mad and blocking all others.<a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadfium_9104.html" title="User:Gadfium">gadfium</a> 08:24, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sounds like a good idea, but I don't think we should be too bothered about it if it'd mean a lot of work for the devs. After all prevention of ever promoting a rogue admin is better than any cure. Another point - page deletions can be undone, but image deletions can't so I think that would be the biggest problem. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_wub_6388.html" title="User:The wub">the wub</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_wub_1807.html" title="User talk:The wub"><font color="green">"?!"</font></a> 09:50, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Note that ther is also the possibility of an admin's account being hacked. I think it really makes sense that a block should actually <b>block</b> an admin from almost all use of admin poswers. If this is tricky to implemet, it may not be worth the trouble, but if it is fairly easy, it should IMO be done. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 00:36, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think its worth stating here at this AN/I a few things:</p>
<p>1) I hold no grudge against Curps for reporting this<br />
2) I'd like to thank those who defended me...<br />
3) I have reentered the arbcom race after the constant prodding of a few people. Who knows, maybe 'any publicity is good publicity'&#160;;-)<br />
4) I'm back from my rather short break. I knew I wouldn't be able to make the break too long as I still have <a href="../../../r/f/m/WP%7ERFM_dd02.html" title="WP:RFM">medcom stuff</a> to watch over.<br />
5) Perhaps its worth noting that I planned on running for bureaucrat October 20th. Unlike the arbcom run, this whole ordeal can hurt me because some annoyed people can oppose me. As for the arbcom, opposition votes don't exist, but of course I may have lost a voter, though I doubt those opposing me were gonna vote for me in the first place.</p>

<li>It was an obvious speedy. The "spam" speedy isn't there just for allnatrlv1agr@.com. It's for anything that is simply an external link. Those who believe in administrator discretion (such as Tony) should also believe in admin discretion on what constitutes "content" before the link. If the purpose of the article is advertising <i>and</i> there is simply a link, <i>then</i> it is a speedy spam. If it is advertising but there is a lot of text, then it is an AfD. I'm not sure where this sudden trend of calling speedies "bad" and "inappropriate" came from -- especially when people want to claim that they can undelete because admins have no need to consult (and the corollary argument is that they have the ability to delete without consultation), but "spam" is one of those speedy guidelines that has a lot of latitude in it to start with. I don't mind folks disagreeing with a speedy, but calling it "bad" is unnecessary and contentious. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 15:17, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>It was an obvious invalid speedy, but I don't feel moved to undelete it and I doubt whether any other admin will. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 05:57, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>There is no "spam speedy". A1 didn't apply to this case as there was ample context to determine what the article is about. A3 didn't apply as there were several sentances of text in addition to a singel link. teh CSD says "<i>Any article whose contents consist <b>only</b> of an external link, "See also" section, book reference, category tag, template tag, interwiki link, or rephrasing of the title.</i>" (my emphasis). As far as i can see, even a single sentance of text that is not one of the above means this criterion does not apply. A7 didn't apply because this was about a group, not asingle person. G1 clearly didn't apply, as this was quite coherent text. G3 is for "Pure vandalism". This looks like a reasoanbly good faith effort, albiet by a contributor who does not fully understand what content is welcome and what is not. I would have voted to delete this on AfD, but I think it is simply out of line to speey delete it, becaue no speedy criterion applies to it. I would like to take this to VfU for a ruling that this is not a valid use of speedy deletion, but the problem is that i don't really want it undelted, and i can't see any way this would ever survive AfD. This really is the kind of thing that a band-speedy criterion would be good for. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 16:24, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>There is a spam speedy. <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVAND_6593.html" title="WP:VAND">WP:VAND</a> defines spam as vandalism, and vandalism is a G3 speedy. It relies on external links rather than other content, however. I presume A3 is intended to derive from that, but doesn't actually say so and also specifies <i>"single"</i> whereas WP:VAND is plural. I'm wikilawyering, but the point is that spam <i>is</i> speedyable. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 22:30, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Note that I am calling these speedy deletion's "invalid" or "incorrect", not "bad". I presume that <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> belives, and the deleting admins belevied, in good faith, that this speedy was proper. I ask if they can carefully reread <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> and still think so, adn i ask them to accpt that unlike many procedural policies here, CSD has and should have very little wiggle room, because it bypasses consensus. IMO if a page is not clearly covered by the wording of the CSD, it should <b>not</b> be speedy deleted, no matter how obvious it is that it doesn't belong here, or that it will eventually be deleted by AfD. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 16:24, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Yes, my beef is with Tony and others who feel that administrator priviledges should be used to undelete just about anything, without using VfU, because there is such technical latitude, but that administrators who used the same latitude to delete something are "obviously bad." That's the invocation of a petty squabble on another front and yet another attempt to expand the supposed "deletionist/inclusionist" bull flop. I never mind disagreement, nor disagreement that goes through the procedures, but the attempts to create political parties and posture as the heroes of factions is destructive. (And, incidentally, I <i>wouldn't</i> have pulled the trigger on this article, although it is one of those that can only fail on <s>V</s>AfD. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:38, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I am on wikibreak, and somehow just foolish enough to come by and read AN/I. Zach and everyone who supported him have just commited a massive (if well-intentioned) error. The statements of FOTW and WFD not withstanding, they and their users have absolutely no sustainable claim to copyright over the image of a flag produced in the standard colors, with the standard symbols and in the standard dimensions. Such a recreation lacks any semblance of the requisite creativity to substain a copyright claim in the US. The only possible entity with a copyright claim is the nation or organization that created the flag, <s>and unless they have been defending that claim they have almost certainly defaulted on any protection long ago.</s> That is to say nothing of the multitude of fair use claims that could be made for a flag. They all should have been tagged {{<a href="../../../p/d/-/Template%7EPD-flag_ce83.html" title="Template:PD-flag">PD-flag</a>}} and welcomed into Wikipedia. Zach, since you belong to both websites, feel free to inform them that their claims over such images are absurd on their face and entirely unsustainable in US courts. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 03:18, 8 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The above is probably correct except for one minor point -- unlike trademark adn patent claims, copyright owners do <b>not</b> lose protection by failure to assert claims. A copyright owner can slumber on infringments for decades, adn then asert his or her rights, and be upheld -- the inaction is irrelevant. Whether there is a copyright claim will depend on the laws and practices of the various countries involved. Whether ther is a fiar use claim depends on US law (and I am pretty sure that there is a good one). <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">User:Dragons flight</a> is 100% correct that FOTW and WFD have no claim to the flag images, as oppsoed to any supporting text or other <b>original</b> work. Therefore, their terms of use have no force or importance. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 03:32, 8 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>As for the fair use stuff, that was one of the reasons why I moved PD-flag to {{<a href="../../../f/l/a/Template%7EFlagimage_27dd.html" title="Template:Flagimage">Flagimage</a>}}, because of all of these various copyright issues. Plus, even if we claim images under fair use, they still <b>cannot</b> be allowed due to the <b>non-commercial</b> licenses both websites have put on ther images. That is the heart of the issue, and frankly, if Wikipedia said that we cannot have non-commercial only images, then they have to go. Also, in order for an image to be fair use, the image has to credit the source. Many of the images were not crediting either website, which makes it not eligable for fair use. Plus, I also received complaints from FOTW members about their images being used on here, which means that they want their images gone. If I was not tagging these images myself, others would have. I will still continue to tag images using both templates until I make sure I got everyone of them tagged. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zach</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Sound Off)</a> 03:59, 8 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>That's nice and all, but they have no legal claim for their images to be protected, and hence the non-commercial clause and their wishes are entirely unenforcable.

<dd>Someone already replied on the HD. But the anon is (thought to be) Skyring, a currently banned user who is to be reverted on sight. We don't make exceptions because, when we do, there are fights over what can and can't be reverted when it is done by a banee. My understanding is that, if another editor wants the reverted edit to stand, they should make it themselves. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 13:22, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>More adventures in crazy-land. Wikipedia, the wiki where you aren't allowed to fix typos.

<dd>Hey, maybe it's another administrator conspiracy!</dd>
<dd>In any case, here's a story: New York City used to have a problem with graffiti on subway cars: they dealt with it by a zero-tolerance policy, immediately pulling out of service trains with any graffitti to scrub away the vandals's work. This caused a lot of short-term aggravation, but eventually the vandals, their pathetic bids for ego-boosting attention frustrated, went away. Just an observation, but if Everyking wants to enable some troll's crusade, he should knock himself out. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 05:08, 8 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Skyring is not a vandal by any stretch of the imagination, but actually a very good editor. This is actually all about a personality feud, and I think it's completely insane to let a personality feud get in the way of making quality edits to improve the product we're here to create. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 06:17, 8 October 2005 (UTC)

<p>Whilst I'm not taken in by the statement on the user page, it does claim to be used by 5 users. After consulting on IRC (not something I normally allow to take precedence over on-Wiki), I have indef blocked the account. Two principal reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is impossible to reliably attribute the edits to the people making them, as the GFDL demands;</li>
<li>Such an account can be used for simultaenous vandalism attacks (not present from this account).</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, their edits to date (about 30 minutes of them) are more than a little trollish (insisting heavy handedly that an allegedly POV page must be deleted unless blah blah). That alone isn't grounds to block of course.</p>

Hi!
  Help! I have been unfairly blocked and am seeking administrators to
assist me! If you care to check out the history you will see procedure
wasn't followed, and no proof given for blocking me. The person even
blocked my user page! It isn't fair, so I am emailing as many admin as
I can! There is strength in numbers, and this is now a matter of
principle. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

<dd>Yes I can. I've explained this many times. The blocklist used to show IP numbers when the user tried to edit and the autoblock was enabled. It would say 141.76.1.121 has been autoblocked because it was recently used by soandso. Recently, that bug was fixed and you only see a number, but for a while Administrators used this bug to get IP numbers by blocking a person and waiting for them to try to edit.</dd>

<dd>Please answer the question that was asked: <b>How do you have any knowledge of these blocked users' IP addresses?</b> The most logical explanation is that you were in contact with these users outside of Wikipedia and asked them to show up here to support your positions.

<dd>I would be happy to answer your question again, but I still have the same answer. I got the IP numbers from the block list. At one time, the IPs of many of the people that Jayjg and SlimVirgin banned (under the guise of being my sockpuppets) were on the block list. I don't know if this was a bug they fixed or what, but I don't see their IPs on the block list any more. --<a href="../../../z/e/p/User_talk%7EZephram_Stark_54e5.html" title="User talk:Zephram Stark">Zephram Stark</a> 01:53, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you make a claim and then fail to provide any evidence of that claim, it doesn't reflect well on you or your motives. You constantly speak of administrative abuse and oppression, but when asked to back these claims up, you're basically saying that's it's too much work. The issue now is whether you're actually willing to substantiate your accusations or you're simply looking to disrupt things. If you don't wish to fall into the latter group, then <b>yes</b>, your investigation really is necessary. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 03:36, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For the sake of clarity, the diff that Zeph keeps offering as evidence that I've blocked a dozen of his sockpuppets came in response to his comment that Go Cowboys was the 11th editor to be blocked <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AZephram_Stark&amp;diff=23061910&amp;oldid=23059561" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AZephram_Stark&amp;diff=23061910&amp;oldid=23059561" rel="nofollow">[36]</a> so I replied that Felice Angleterre was going to be the 12th and Zephram himself the 13th. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AZephram_Stark&amp;diff=23073044&amp;oldid=23061910" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AZephram_Stark&amp;diff=23073044&amp;oldid=23061910" rel="nofollow">[37]</a> It was a joke. In fact, I've blocked four of his accounts: EKBK, Go Cowboys, Felice Angleterre, and Professor Stevens. Black Angus is next, and the only reason Zephram isn't blocked is that he's up before the arbcom, but I'm beginning to wonder whether that should necessarily stop me. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 11:19, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Is anyone listening to what SlimVirgin is saying? Is this what you want Wikipedia to be? SlimVirgin lost a content dispute. "<a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">Terrorism</a>" now has a definition that conveys information <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Zephram_Stark_Evidence_e915.html#Evidence_presented_by_Zephram_Stark" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Zephram Stark/Evidence">despite all the people she blocked to keep it from happening</a>. (I guess I will have to go look up all those blocks now that she is even denying that she did it, and denying that she <a href="../../../z/e/p/User_talk%7EZephram_Stark_Archive1_6a55.html" title="User talk:Zephram Stark/Archive1">admitted</a> doing it.) The dispute was over before she blocked EKBK, before she locked EKBK's user talk page, and before she threatened to block me in the post above. So why is she still at it? Why is she still permablocking people after the fact? Why is SlimVirgin still accusing people of being sockpuppets with absolutely no evidence after any conflict between her and those associated with the "terrorism" article is over? I think the answer to that question is as clear as the nose on your face. Please think about it and do the right thing. This little clique of administrators must end. --<a href="../../../z/e/p/User_talk%7EZephram_Stark_54e5.html" title="User talk:Zephram Stark">Zephram Stark</a> 19:15, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Was this (the "weird-arse stuff") on the wiki or e-mail? If not on the wiki there's no way a block for that is justifiable (even on the wiki itself it probably wouldn't be, depending on whether it's more along the lines of abusive or just strange, but even less so off-site). Obviously the legal threat issue is more serious, but she might be convinced to retract those threats after seeing how seriously we take them. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 09:47, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Everyking, there's a ton of it on the wiki, so never mind the other ton on e-mail.

Sophie/XAL operates in a reality completely disconnected from the rest of us, and is frustrated that no-one here will support her view of things and gets angry, abusive and disruptive.

<dd>I don't think that this rant will advance her agenda in any way, but in case the opinion of a French-speaking third party is need, I would like to inform you that XAL is not only making irrelevant statements completely at odds with reality (that <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.Monniaux_7db1.html" title="User:David.Monniaux">David.Monniaux</a> never edited <a href="../../../b/o/g/Talk%7EBogdanov_Affair_a499.html" title="Talk:Bogdanov Affair">Talk:Bogdanov Affair</a>, to cite a particularly blatant example among many), but also employing insults, out of place irony, and downright rude language; she notably insults David by calling his PhD a secondary school certificate.</dd>

<p>Cheers to whatever overly helpful person of observably limited comprehension took it upon themselves to bowdlerise my edit. I didn't say "difficult to understand", I said "goddamn patently insane and disruptive". The lesser edit so understates the situation as to be a falsity. Don't do this.

<dd>His edits (the most recent twelve or so I looked at) seemed reasonable, perhaps a little overreaching on one or two, but not blatantly pov, etc. His user page indicates some very strong and one-sided views on some contentious topics, but so far he's stayed off those articles.

<p>User:66.126.151.134 has been spamming a couple of blogs of his across a large number of articles, and the only edits on that account have either been that spamming action or to remove warnings from his talk page.
