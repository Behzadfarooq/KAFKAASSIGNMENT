<dd>NO, there is a problem with this bot. I caught it today repeatedly reverting blankings on bios. The blankings were by the subject objecting to libels. (The anti-vandal bot was doing the same thing ont he same article).

<dd>Instead of bios specifically I'd prefer a whitelist of users to be implemented, which the bot would not revert whatsoever. That would still block out vandal blankings of properly-sourced information. – <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChacor_c07b.html" title="User:Chacor">Ch</a><a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChacor_1f31.html" title="User talk:Chacor">acor</a> 06:38, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, a whitelist is easier for AVB, as (I think) it has all admins automatically whitelisted. I think that VoABotII is a lot more lightweight than AVB, so won't have these lists, and they would perhaps be difficult to implement - and the subjects of libel are unlikely to be on such a whitelist. The simple way to solve this is for an admin to protect a page which needs blanking, blank it and then unprotect it - this should stop VoABotII reverting, without the need for quite bulky lists. Of course, the difficulty is getting an issue of libel to an admin's attention, but then again, most subjects of libel seem to know that they can easily email info-en for help. If there are lots of people who don't know this, then we do need a prominent notice somewhere informing users affected by libel to either contact us or leave a message here (which will probably get quicker attention) - something on the article talk page of all bios, maybe? Perhaps an idea would be to have an IRC bot which will relay large changes to biography articles to a dedicated channel (not vandalism-en-wp), where people can sit and check what's happening and revert the bot (or bring it to an admin's attention) if neccesary. <strong><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_980f.html" title="User:Martinp23">Mart</a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartinp23_2732.html" title="User talk:Martinp23"><font color="red">inp23</font></a></strong> 12:54, 7 January 2007 (UTC) <small>If such a bot is needed, I've got some code for a similar task which is easily adaptable</small></dd>

<dd>To my knowledge, there is no "format used on Wikipedia" for references. Certainly the relevant style guide, <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> doesn't mention anything of the sort. Any coherent and standard format within the given discipline is acceptable. And certainly some major style guides, e.g. Chicago, use "first last" as the format for inline citations, which is a common use of the citation templates. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 18:03, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Gentlemen Please read for the facts:</p>
<p><br />
Please be advised that there are currently several counterfeit and completely bogus versions of the genuine Aktion Reinhard Camps website which can only be found here: deathcamps.org</p>
<p>These counterfeit websites are utilising various twists on the URL: deathcamps.org</p>
<p>In order to fool people they are hyphenating the url and or substituting letters and domain suffixes.</p>
<p>It appears that some of the counterfeit websites are linked to forums and websites sympathetic to Nazi and Supremacist groups.</p>

<dd>You certainly could put a sentence into the article which is sourced and says that she has been called anti-Islamic, but there's a difference between putting a sentence in an article and putting an article into a category. In an article, there's room for an opposing view from another source that thinks she isn't anti-Islamic. In a category, there isn't.</dd>
<dd>Moreover, since there's dispute about the matter, we can't say she *is* anti-Islamic. We can only say she's been *called* anti-Islamic. So your category would have to be something like "accusations of anti-Islam sentiment" to be accurate. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_Arromdee_cac5.html" title="User:Ken Arromdee">Ken Arromdee</a> 03:05, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Arbitration notice</b> — This isn't the first time Raphael1 has been disruptive.

Any three administrators for good cause may ban him from Wikipedia for an appropriate period of time." I think he can easily be banned from these pages he's being disruptive over; if any three of you guys decide it warrants a block under the probation clause, that can happen too. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 17:56, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

Guy, you said on Raphael1's page that <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> requires consensus to include any negative comment about a person. That isn't my reading of the policy at all. Indeed, the word 'consensus' does not even APPEAR in the text of the policy. Our 'living persons' policy requires that negative comments be <b>properly sourced</b>. We DO have general policies against <i>edit warring</i> without consensus, but they'd apply to both 'sides' here and have nothing to do with BLP. So far as I can see... addition of the category IS properly sourced here. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 18:15, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Per BLP, the subject of the article needs to pretty much state word for word that she is anti-islamic. She has not done so. So labelling her in this manner is subjective, POV and draws a conclusion based on her statements, which equals Original Research. BLP has a higher standard. <a href="../../../k/y/a/User%7EKyaa_the_Catlord_f18d.html" title="User:Kyaa the Catlord">Kyaa the Catlord</a> 18:28, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

The user has since indicated on my TalkPage that they were photos of himself. I realise now that this may be a slightly more serious problem than the usual vanity postings in this sort of articles as the user identifies himself as being 16 years old on his UserPage. The photos thus constitute child pornograhpy in many jurisdictions. They were originally uploaded to Commons not here however, can an admin with sysop access on Commons delete them to prevent them reappearing in future?

<dd>I was just comeing here to post that, myself. Even if the user is actually above 18, the caption of the photos states that the subject of the photo is a teenager.

<dd>Age of consent is immaterial to the law in the UK where it is unlawful to posess a naked and sexually explicit picture of a person under 18 years of age unless one is formally partnered with them. This included images downloaded from the internet. This is paraphrasing UK law. The images would be very much better deleted quickly even if they appear to be 18+ precisely because of the caption associated with them. One can argue that these pictures are not erotic wth some justification, but safety dictates that they should go. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 16:52, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Age of Consent is 16 in most places in the U.S., but AOC is not the issue here. Explicit images of teenagers under the age of 18 are considered child pornpgraphy in the U.K and in the U.S. No special oversight is required, the usual process of speedy delete is sufficient. <a href="../../../a/t/o/User%7EAtomaton_fe94.html" title="User:Atomaton">Atom</a> 16:56, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Are there still images in need of deletion on Commons? Which ones? Or uploaded by which Commons user? (Please give a link to the commons user by prefixing if you can).

<dd>What an accusation&#160;! The Indian contributors have been tag-teaminig on these Pakistani articles for many months before I got 3RR and the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Pakistan_a77c.html" title="History of Pakistan">History of Pakistan</a> was "protected" for more than three months. Now that I have some Pakistani contributors involved to represent the Pakistani perspective they have started this accusation. One can simply look at the history of these articles to see tag-teaming by Indian contributors before Pakistani contributors. I have invited many of my friends to wikipedia that does not mean that this "puppetry". One can accuse the Indians of the same regarding these Pakistan related articles.</dd>

Most of their citations are from those websites which promote (-&gt;)Hindutwa. They never accept any input from any user who does not agree with them. They insist on adding Indian script to Pakistan and Islam related articles and have been indianizing all such articles with twisted words and dubious citations. They force other users into accepting their citations no matter how questionable they are. Just look at their talk pages and you'll clearly see their unity in promoting Hinduism in Pakistan and Islam related articles, and Indianizing all such articles. They have literally occupied Pakistan related articles and won't let anybody other than members of their lobby make any major changes. If someone resists their propaganda agendas they persecute that user with full force and unity. <a href="../../../s/z/h/User%7ESzhaider_2a97.html" title="User:Szhaider">Szhaider</a> 03:16, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Szhaider and Siddiqui are absolutely right.Bakman and other Indian users play edit wars by editing in groups,therefor being careful not to break the <a href="../../../3/r/r/3RR_7ad8.html" title="3RR">3RR</a>.Nothing but a clear form of meatpuppetry.Bakaman and his fellow imperialists have made racist remarks towards Pakistani users as seen on the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Pakistan_a77c.html" title="History of Pakistan">history of Pakistan</a> talk page. If Bakaman and his fellow indian imperialists can't get have their own way around,they then go running to Indian administrators to assist them in their crusade against Pakistani wikipedians. Right now Bakaman and fellow imperialist <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeptrivia_80bd.html" title="User:Deeptrivia">user:deeptrivia</a> plan on writing an article on "Pakistani textbooks"(to be specific textbooks used by a small group of religious fanatics in Pakistan) to stereotype us and brand us as extremists.This can be seen [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Bakasuprman#Hi" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Bakasuprman#Hi" rel="nofollow">here</a>].They had done this before when they created an unsourced article on Christians in Pakistan which had been deleted yesterday upon my request. Unfortunately they clearly outnumber Pakistani wikipedians and are able to edit war in groups to keep all Pakistani items categorized as "Indian" despite my efforts to make it "SOuth Asian" to keep it neutral. I tried to revert the article on [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C4%81%E1%B9%87ini" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C4%81%E1%B9%87ini" rel="nofollow">Panani</a>],but they keep changing it to "Indian" and keeping all refferences to Pakistan out including consistantly vandalizing the Pakistani tag I place on the talkpage. And due to the lack of diversity among administrators,they have a clear advantage over us. The alligations Bakaman states are false.Bakaman is racist towards Pakistanis(particularly Muslim). His fellow imperialists(and possibly him)are part of a racist site called [<a href="http://www.hinduunity.org/|" class="external text" title="http://www.hinduunity.org/|" rel="nofollow">hindu unity</a>].They make disruptive edits to Pakistani articles such as <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistani_nationalism.html" title="Pakistani nationalism">Pakistani nationalism</a> by sticking their <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_3e50.html" title="POV">POV</a> into them.They consistantly edit war on Pakistani history articles and try to keep out all refferences to Pakistan,again in large numbers to keep from violating the <a href="../../../3/r/r/3RR_7ad8.html" title="3RR">3RR</a>.And for your information,Pakhub is <b>not</b> Islamaist.This is another part of Bakaman's propaganda.Any attempts to revive Pakistani history is automatically claimed as "Islamist" by Bakaman and his fellow imperialists.Please read the articles on Pakhub to decide for yourself. They have also unleashed nationalistic bots and tagged Pakistani and Iranian related articles to Indian categories.Their consistant efforts to keep all consensus out(with the assistance of biased admnistrators) is a clear violation of wikipedia's neutral and no propaganda policies.<a href="../../../n/a/d/User%7ENadirali_c5a5.html" title="User:Nadirali">Nadirali</a> 05:55, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am getting Pakistani editors to protect the Pakistan related pages being filled with Indian propaganda. I am also urging my friends to join wikipedia and contribute to Pakistan related pages. The Indians have been team-tagging and reverting any changes to Pakistan related articles. The new Pakistani contributors will soon be able to give balanced view of Pakistan-India disputes. Indian have the right to give thier side of opinion so Pakistanis also have the same right. The Indians have filled Pakistani articles with Indias propaganda. Any change to reflect Pakistan view point is reverted and the Indian contributors team tag to defeat smaller number of Pakistani contributors. Hopefully this will change as I have been trying hard to convince many Pakistanis to join wikipedia and contributue to the articles that interests them.</dd>

<p>Wikipedia is not a blog, where you can put down any information, and because you have a few admins on your side, nobody can question your actions. The Pak tag belongs anywhere, where there are Pakistani ancestors involved. The fact is, Panini had nothing to do with modern Indians. If it hadnt been for some users here, the article would still have a ROI flag. (check history). So maybe you guys should pull yourselves together and stop defending biased information, backed up my some Indian written sources. If you dont want to call people of Pakistan, Pakistanis, what else do you want to call them? Indians. I see...makes no sense, but since you have admins on your side, who are we to question? <a href="../../../u/n/r/User%7EUnre4L_fd85.html" title="User:Unre4L">Unre4L</a> 13:45, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>P.s I provided 5 .edu sources of Ancient Pakistan being a valid term. Even then you question this. This obviously shows you have no regard for correct information being put on Wikipedia, but only information where you can cram the word "India" in as many places as you can. <a href="../../../u/n/r/User%7EUnre4L_fd85.html" title="User:Unre4L">Unre4L</a> 15:54, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>First I thought Google was the only argument you could come up with. Now I know it. Ok...let me make it very simple. Why do you think we are arguing about this? Because people are misinformed, and since they are misinformed, they use it more often. If Ancient Pakistan came up with as many Google results, then this argument wouldnt be taking place, now would it? And your Google argument is not going to cancel out any official educational sources. <a href="../../../u/n/r/User%7EUnre4L_fd85.html" title="User:Unre4L">Unre4L</a> 23:39, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This user and I got into a dispute over my nomination of Val42 to be an admin. This dispute was originally being discussed on Val42's user page, then Trodel decided to switch it to our personal user pages. I believed, today, that our dispute was finished, but then he left me a comment tonight that was a threat against both myself and Val42. Apparantly Trodel got so angry with me that he has threatened to block me for alleged trolling and he has threatened to oppose Val42's nomination for adminship simply because I was talking with him over this dispute. I do not believe my remarks were rude, but if they were I would apologize, but he would block me for trolling, which i quite simply am not doing. He has not actually done it yet, but This is the channel that the wp page about threats directed me to, so i am posting it here. If any other admin reads this, please help me out here, because I do not want to be blocked because of the power tripping of Trodel. Thank you.</p>

<dd>I just found out that he removed an addition to an article that was disputed and resolved some time ago. I believe this is a covert personal attack, as it was his first edit after threatening me, and he had no previous history on the page. the page in question is <a href="../../../c/h/l/Chloe_Sullivan_036c.html" title="Chloe Sullivan">Chloe Sullivan</a>. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGreenFaerae_48fa.html" title="User:TheGreenFaerae">TheGreenFaerae</a> 09:04, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Having read the arguments, I don't think you were trolling. However I do believe you turned friendly advice into a percieved personal attack and then beccame quite beligerant about it. It would do you both good to calm down. Incidentally, what Trodel was saying about the nominator needing to be of good standing IS a common requirement for people&#160;!voting on RfAs. That is not a reflwection on you, but on your experience of wikipedia and therefore how well you can judge a candidate.

<dd>I agree with that, and I did concede that point. I suppose it appeared as if I took it personal, although that was not the case, but that is not what this issue is about. He is threatening em at this point, after I conceded the dispute. After I said that he was right, he then threatened both myself and him. I'm worried that he is going to block me for something I did not do.

<dd>My take on that (which I hope will be confirmed by Trodel) was that either, it was unrelated to the dispute or that he came across the article in your contributions (it is fairly common to look at someones contributions to see what you are dealing with) and decided that that section was as stated by Spartaz and removed it. <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViridae_a0d4.html" title="User:Viridae">Viridae</a><a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViridae_b84f.html" title="User talk:Viridae"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 09:19, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well i still disagree with that, but as part of my resolution regarding it, I will not say anything about it.

<p>This user insulted me for responding to a request for my opinion and my observations - insisting that I prove it. Then when I wasted time finding references for my observation (how ridiculous is that), he still blamed me. I therefore began reviewing his edits, I deleted this text since it was, in my view, clearly unsourced fancruft. Then he couches his "report" on my alleged misbehaviour as "I would apologize but I can't." However,instead of finding a way to apologize <small>(he could apologize on his own talk page, he could apologize by emailing me directly, he could even have apologized above (<b>note that he did not - he only claimed he would</b>)</small>. His actions show that he is more interested in wasting other peoples time than spending any of his own time. He wasted your time responding to his frivilous complaint, wasted your time looking through contribution screens (since he could not be bothered to include a link), wasted my time having to come here since one of the editors above asked me for comment. And, I suspect, he will respond to my comment by finding a way to waste other people's time instead of taking some of his own time to read through complaints on this page to get a feel for what is or is not a valid complaint. Finally, he characterizes me as "power tripping" which I view as a borderline personal attack.</p>
<p>In my view trolling is any person who "thrive[s] on getting good people to [waste time] fight[ing]..."<a href="http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2006-December/057469.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2006-December/057469.html" rel="nofollow">[68]</a>. In his last post on my talk page, he did not apologize, but continued to blame me for his own failure to listen to good advice, and in fact restated his personal attack in Nixon fashion<a href="http://www.americanheritage.com/people/articles/web/20051117-richard-nixon-watergate-checkers-democratic-national-committee-crook-bob-woodward-john-ehrlichman-haldeman-archibald-cox-vietnam.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.americanheritage.com/people/articles/web/20051117-richard-nixon-watergate-checkers-democratic-national-committee-crook-bob-woodward-john-ehrlichman-haldeman-archibald-cox-vietnam.shtml" rel="nofollow">[69]</a>. Therefore, I may continue to review his edits for unsourced claims and if he objects he can do so on the article's talk page; however, I will view further comments concerning this policy discussion on my talk page as trolling and will block accordingly. --<a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User_talk%7ETr%C3%B6del_2c9f.html" title="User talk:Trödel"><font color="#06C">Trödel</font></a> 22:09, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I take this as he is personally going against me. He said, himself that he is going through my edits, so how am I to take it as anything but a personal attack? I did not mean to insult him. But why should someone be insulted by sourcing thier statements? As you see on the Chloe Sullivan page, I have been in disputes about sourcing additions before, so I know what the policy is regarding citing one's sources. It is my view that he took this request way too personally, and I'm sorry that it insulted him, but I just wanted to know where he was coming from in his statement. And he said not to contact him again. So why would I have emailed him? That would have been contacting him, and apparantly trolling. i was never trying to start a fight. I simply wanted to see evidence for his opinion, as it was not official policy, which I read several times. I object to the charge that I was wasting time by asking for WP:CITE. I feel he is trying to bully me out of Wikipedia, and I really need protection.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGreenFaerae_48fa.html" title="User:TheGreenFaerae">TheGreenFaerae</a> 00:01, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

If you won't do this, youa re blocking me by proxy, by making it impossible for me to edit something, knowing you'll just wipe it out when I leave. This is a direct personal attack. My apology was not empty. You simpyl refuse to accept any apology. You apaprantly want to see me gone, and it seems you will not stop until you achieve this. All I'm asking you to do is leave me alone. Why can't you do that?

<p>I am not sure if this is the right place for this, but here goes. <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Mary%27s_Catholic_School_d413.html" title="Saint Mary's Catholic School">Saint Mary's Catholic School</a> just survived an AFD vote <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Saint_Mary%27s_Catholic_School_a298.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Saint Mary's Catholic School">here</a>. I did not participate in the vote in anyway; I just found the article afterwards while looking over recently closed AFDs. When I went to the article after the AFD I found that someone had made it a redirect, with the comment "Merge/redirect -- lack of independent sources, lack of info." This is after an admin had closed the AFD wih a keep. As far as I know, the article has not undergone a DRV. So it seems like <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> did not like the admin's decision when the AFD was closed and took matters into his own hands. I reverted and left a note that the article just survived the AFD, so in my opinion, it should not be blanked by redirecting. I rewrote some of the article, and left it at that intending to continue later. I come back today and find that it is once again a redirect with the comments by Shimeru of "redirect -- still no secondary sources, and manifestly no consensus to keep. Needs sources before it can stand alone as an article." I subsequently reverted again with a comment asking him to not redirect a page that just survived an AFD. As far as I know Shimeru is not an admin and this page survived the AFD. This is not the first time I have run into him following the redirecting of a page without consensus. See <a href="../../../d/e/s/Desert_Ridge_Junior_High_School_542a.html" title="Desert Ridge Junior High School">Desert_Ridge_Junior_High_School</a>'s edit history.

<dd>Wait, there's nothing wrong with what this person did. Just because the SCHOOLs fanatics get a false consensus keep doesn't mean that a lack of sources has to be accepted as status quo.

<dd>It would have been polite to let me know about this posting. For the sake of clarity, the admin closed it as a keep via no consensus -- he confirms this on <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">his talk page</a>. He has also stated on DRV (in regards to an earlier AfD he closed in the same manner) that he does not consider such closes to prevent a merge/redirect. I was simply enacting a merge/redirect rather than taking a second article to DRV -- it seemed simpler. Since it has twice been declined, I have no intention of continuing to attempt to do so; I will wait for a few days to see whether secondary sources are added, and then decide whether to DRV it or not. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 06:16, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I wasn't sure if I should ask this at RfC or here, but after reading what RfC is for, it appears that this forum is the more appropriate place to bring this issue. It doesn't necessarily require administrator intervention, but could use input from those who enforce policy which especially includes adminiatrators as well as the entire community. The issue is this...an editor complained about another editor's conduct on the discussion page for the the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Crichton_1cc6.html" title="Michael Crichton">Michael Crichton</a> article: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Michael_Crichton#William_M._Connolley_seems_to_stalk_this_and_related_articles" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Michael_Crichton#William_M._Connolley_seems_to_stalk_this_and_related_articles" rel="nofollow">[71]</a>. After some discussion (including input from me), a couple of other editors have deleted the discussion, with one calling it a personal attack. I restored it once, and the originator of the discussion has restored it once: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AMichael_Crichton&amp;diff=99206982&amp;oldid=98827801" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AMichael_Crichton&amp;diff=99206982&amp;oldid=98827801" rel="nofollow">[72]</a>. I truly don't know if the discussion should be left or was rightfully deleted and am respectfully asking for some input. Thanks in advance. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7ECla68_4b38.html" title="User:Cla68">Cla68</a> 00:15, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The <i>guilty</i> editor was me. I viewed the header ==William M. Connolley seems to stalk this and related articles== and associated anon comments as off-topic and a distinct personal attack. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7ECla68_4b38.html" title="User:Cla68">User:Cla68</a> seemed to disagree and restored the section. I see no evidence that it has been removed a second time and I left it alone rather than edit war. The discussion continues to grow there and is rather irrelevant to the content of the page - the discussion should be on the article rather than some perceived conspiracy and attacks on editors. <a href="../../../v/s/m/User%7EVsmith_d492.html" title="User:Vsmith">Vsmith</a> 03:40, 8 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Actually, the discussion in question has now migrated into a debate about whether it's appropriate or not to add criticisms of Crichton's scientific views to the article. Thus, the discussion is now about the article also, not just one editor's contributions to it. Please excuse me for wasting space on this noticeboard with an issue that doesn't require an administrator's intervention. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7ECla68_4b38.html" title="User:Cla68">Cla68</a> 03:52, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Now we have a new version of the article about a Les Balsiger in Troy, Montana who ran controversial anti-Catholicism ad campaigns in western Oregon (Portland) during a papal visit. This Balsiger apparently was associated with an offshoot of the <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seventh-day_Adventist_church_a2b6.html" title="Seventh-day Adventist church">Seventh-day Adventist church</a>.</p>
<p>However I see no <i>proof</i> that the anti-Catholic Les Balsiger who was recently living in Troy, MT is also the college administrator now living in La Grange, Oregon. Yet the article identifies the administrator as the same person.</p>
<p>According to Google, La Grange, OR is 396 by car from Troy, MT and 259 miles from Portland, OR.</p>
<p>The submitter of the new article, Oregonians (<a href="../../../o/r/e/User_talk%7EOregonians_c46f.html" title="User talk:Oregonians">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Oregonians_39f7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Oregonians">contribs</a>), a brand-new editor, also mentions Balsiger in an edit<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-Catholicism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97550141" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-Catholicism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97550141" rel="nofollow">[73]</a> to the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Catholicism_6249.html" title="Anti-Catholicism">Anti-Catholicism</a> article.</p>
<p>While the La Grande Balsiger has edited Adventist-related topics,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Historic_Adventists&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=95580450" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Historic_Adventists&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=95580450" rel="nofollow">[74]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Historic_Adventists&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=95581028" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Historic_Adventists&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=95581028" rel="nofollow">[75]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Historic_Adventists&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=95581658" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Historic_Adventists&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=95581658" rel="nofollow">[76]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Historic_Adventists&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=95582316" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Historic_Adventists&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=95582316" rel="nofollow">[77]</a> that does not make him the same person. It's entirely possible to have two very different individuals named "Les Baliger" from the same family of <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seventh-day_Adventist_church_a2b6.html" title="Seventh-day Adventist church">Seventh-day Adventist church</a> members yet be very different people.</p>
<p>Whatever the controversial aspects of either Les Balsiger, they deserve not to be confused with each other. --<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A. B.">A.

<dd>Very sad situation; I can't tell what turned this editor so suddenly off from Wikipedia, but I hope someone has at least tried to find out. Regarding the block length, I see the argument for a short block, but I also wouldn't want the user posting more ethnic hatred 25 hours from now. Perhaps a longer-term or indefinite block, with the talk page unprotected, and a note from the blocking admin that the user is welcome to come back and resume editing anytime he promises to be a contributor again. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 02:08, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Probably nothing, but it's worth keeping an eye on... user:CyberAnth has, over the last day or so, been afdingg quite a large number of articles on sexual terminology, irrespective of whether they have sizable, well-written articles. In each case, the argument is <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a>, which would bee all very well if his targets were more general or if the articles in question were all simply dictdefs - but neither is true. Quite a few of the votes have basically snowballed to keep, simply because the articles are clearly not what is being claimed. As I said, it's probably nothing, but - as I said in one of my afd comments - after the first dozen or so it becomes increasinggly difficult to assume good faith. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 11:18, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Despite the use of apparently legitimate Wikipedia policies as reasons for deletion, information removal, etc the user clearly has an agenda related to deleting or sanitising Wikipedia articles related to sexual innuendo or terminology as can be seen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;offset=20070106042051&amp;limit=50&amp;target=CyberAnth" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;offset=20070106042051&amp;limit=50&amp;target=CyberAnth" rel="nofollow">here</a>. This user's choice of going against the grain of opinion can probably be most clearly seen on the deletion nomination page for <a href="../../../w/a/n/Wanker.html" title="Wanker">Wanker</a> at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Wanker_%282nd_nomination%29_1586.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Wanker (2nd nomination)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Wanker (2nd nomination)</a> <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJooler_fb16.html" title="User:Jooler">Jooler</a> 11:27, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hm.

<li><a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">User:CyberAnth</a> has been addressing these "well-written" articles on verifiability grounds, and as such xe has a point. However well written content is, if it is not verifiable it must go. It's a shame that so many <i>other</i> contributors have not made any effort to rebut the verifiability concerns with good sources, but have instead decided to turn the AFD discussions into discussions of the nominator, or have simply cut and pasted rationales with no attempt to address the article and the sources at hand whatsoever. That does not help AFD in the slightest (and I predict, given how often this pattern has occurred in the past, that those editors' failure to address verifiability concerns will result in the articles coming back to AFD again, weeks or months from now). If an editor raises a concern that an article, or even a succession of articles, is unverifiable from reliable sources, and goes to the effort of addressing each of the cited sources explaining individually why they are unreliable (as <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">User:CyberAnth</a> has done at length in several of the AFD discussions — <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FBean_queen&amp;diff=98851582&amp;oldid=98843439" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FBean_queen&amp;diff=98851582&amp;oldid=98843439" rel="nofollow">example</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FErotic_spanking&amp;diff=98624513&amp;oldid=98598107" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FErotic_spanking&amp;diff=98624513&amp;oldid=98598107" rel="nofollow">example</a>) it is <i>those other editors</i> making subsequent "speedy keep" cries whose behaviour should be censured.
<p>I also note that there are a lot of editors on this noticeboard that are not following our <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Wikipedia:Assume good faith</a> directive. That one editor has nominated a set of articles, all with related topics, for deletion with a single rationale, is hardly unusual at AFD. This regularly happens when an editor discovers an article that xe thinks should be deleted and proceeds to discover other related articles. None of the editors complaining about <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">User:CyberAnth</a>'s nomination of several related articles have assumed similar bad faith on the part of the nominator at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_All-Star_Near_Misses_60c4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/All-Star Near Misses">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/All-Star Near Misses</a>, for example, even though that is, similarly, a nomination with a single rationale of a group of articles from a single category. And this bad faith <i>is</i> being assumed on their part. Nowhere in this set of AFD discussions has <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">User:CyberAnth</a> given an actual bad faith rationale, such as a tit-for-tat rationale. Whether right or wrong, the rationales given are evidently good faith ones, attempting to hold Wikipedia to our policies.</p>
<p>I am the only editor to have added any citations at all to <a href="../../../f/i/n/Fingering_%28sexual_act%29.html" title="Fingering (sexual act)">Fingering (sexual act)</a>. I find it most disappointing that other editors address verifiability and source reliability concerns not by citing and evaluating sources but with edits such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Bean_queen&amp;diff=98862631&amp;oldid=98862228" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Bean_queen&amp;diff=98862631&amp;oldid=98862228" rel="nofollow">this</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Fag_hag_%282nd_nomination%29&amp;diff=98858733&amp;oldid=98851470" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Fag_hag_%282nd_nomination%29&amp;diff=98858733&amp;oldid=98851470" rel="nofollow">this</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Fag_hag_%282nd_nomination%29&amp;diff=98846624&amp;oldid=98846184" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Fag_hag_%282nd_nomination%29&amp;diff=98846624&amp;oldid=98846184" rel="nofollow">this</a>.

<li>I've observed this as well.

While I think he did identify a couple of cases of poorly written, truly neologistic articles, he tends to cut-and-paste the same nomination statement across a large number of different AfDs. The user has already been told that WP is not censored, and has now been warned regarding <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. In the majority of cases, they are well-written and sourced articles for subjects that have almost obvious notability. This user should be counseled to invest more research in his nominations, and perhaps "practice" with the AfD's that are strongest before mass-nominating many items irregardless of their articles' current quality. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 16:00, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Your comment is a prime example of the assumption of bad faith that I just pointed out. You state "The user has already been told that WP is not censored.". But nowhere in any of these discussions has <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">User:CyberAnth</a> actually said that it <i>should</i> be censored. Xyr nominations have been based upon verifiability from reliable sources, elimination of original research, the policy that Wikipedia is not a dictionary, and the avoidance of neologisms. The assumption that this is an attempt to censor Wikipedia <i>is an assumption of bad faith on your part</i>. Please stop it. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:10, 6 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am not assuming bad faith, but the fact that he has focused on articles that fit into only one category is patent; considering that all of them are sexual slang, a concerted effort to remove them meets the dictionary definition of censorship. He has also blanked large sections of certain articles without prior discussion. There's no evidence to suggest that he's interested in improving WP <i>in general.</i> I am willing to agree that the user is in fact acting in good faith, and that their intent is to improve WP: but that nevertheless does not contradict that their actions have the effect of being censorial and potentially disruptive. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 16:28, 6 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a>, it is good editing to remove material from Wikipedia that cannot be supported by reliable sources (and some random webpage that mentions a slang term does not constitute a reliable source for an encyclopedia article). I suggest you focus your complaints on specific individual edits and discuss each one on its own merits. --<a href="../../../j/w/s/User%7EJWSchmidt_1173.html" title="User:JWSchmidt">JWSchmidt</a> 16:57, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Many if not most Wikipedia articles lack references other than Wikilinked terms. Do people look at random articles? I just looked at 10 random articles and found the following with no references: <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_gazzetta.html" title="La gazzetta">La gazzetta</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltimore_County_Executive_c641.html" title="Baltimore County Executive">Baltimore County Executive</a>, <a href="../../../o/t/i/Otilio_Ulate_Blanco_9a8e.html" title="Otilio Ulate Blanco">Otilio Ulate Blanco</a>, <a href="../../../a/g/m/AGM-28_Hound_Dog_0ed1.html" title="AGM-28 Hound Dog">AGM-28 Hound Dog</a>. Should I follow CyberAnth's lead, that others have endorsed, and blank the content, or just AfD them and 500,000 similarly unreferenced articles? Editors should not be allowed to selectively apply a policy of Afd or blanking unreferenced content of articles whose subject matter they find distasteful. That would be like a traffic cop selectively giving speeding tickets to only those cars displaying bumper stickers they disagree with and letting the others pass. Selective enforcement of Wikipedia policy to only articles in one category is disruptive and harms the project. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 18:14, 6 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Once again, editors are <b>assuming</b> that CyberAnth is finding this material distasteful and <i>that</i> is why he is nominating them for deletion--when he has stated nothing to that effect and instead have given solid policy reasons for his actions. Instead of countering his nominations and his application of those policies, we are seeing a continued strawman fallacy being proprogated and blatant assumption of bad faith. This is incredible. <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a> 19:08, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, <i>obvious</i> is when a user states that they find such material distasteful or think that Wikipedia should be censor or something to that effect--nothing of which CyberAnth has proclaimed.

<li>Some editors get very agitated while trying to defend short Wikipedia articles about non-notable topics.....articles for which editors struggle to find verifiable and reliable sources. Let's keep our eyes on the ball. Either improve these short articles, merge what little useful content there is into meaningful larger articles, or expect that there will be honest attempts to delete them.--<a href="../../../j/w/s/User%7EJWSchmidt_1173.html" title="User:JWSchmidt">JWSchmidt</a> 20:03, 6 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>One point to mention is that it seems there's a mass, indiscriminate nomination of articles, almost as if just hoping that some will stick. The nominations are word-for-word the same, regardless of whether they're appropriate to the specific article. An extreme example is the citation of <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> in the AFD nomination for <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quim_%28slang%29.html" title="Quim (slang)">quim</a>. The article specifically cites <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Canterbury_Tales_0598.html" title="The Canterbury Tales">The Canterbury Tales</a>.

<li>With some reluctance, because I'm always reticent to support this sort of thing when I think the editor may be well-intentioned but misguided, I'm going to have to second this request. In the time since the efforts at communication listed above by Johntex occured, CyberAnth's contribution history is filled with things like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Wanker_%282nd_nomination%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=98853067" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Wanker_%282nd_nomination%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=98853067" rel="nofollow">this</a>.

<p>As much as I support a continual effort at adding refences and sources to articles, I find this effort to be disruptive, rather than collaborative or consensus driven. See related (lengthy) discussion at <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Incidents_947b.html#Numerous_articles_blanked.2C_or_large_portion_of_article_content_removed" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents">Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/Incidents#Numerous_articles_blanked.2C_or_large_portion_of_article_content_removed</a>. I think the editor, previously a fine contributor to Wikipedia, has gone overboard on a crusade to remove a set of terms that s/he finds unsavory or objectionable, largely sexuality related articles. If an effort, on an article by article basis had been made on many to gain consensus with the editors focusing on those articles to improve their quality, add better references and gain gain consensus with article contributors that would have been better. A wholesale listing of 40 or 50 articles for deletion, or removal of large chunks of an article without prior discussion, all within a few hours period is intended as an <i>attack</i> to make a <i>point</i>. There is a lengthy discussion by this editor at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Erotic_spanking_49a7.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Erotic spanking">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Erotic_spanking</a> (see referencing padding) that suggests one of the editors motivations. The editor is self-described as "a devoted Christian", a "bibliophile", and as such may view that sexual content of the type recommended by these many AfD's and article blanking would be a positive thing, and that others may feel similarly, not realizing that that view would not be a majority view by most editors. I believe that the editor is well intended, but there is a line between bold and aggressive editing, and intentional disruptive behavior to make a point. Despite the editors previous fine work, that line was clearly crossed here. <a href="../../../a/t/o/User%7EAtomaton_fe94.html" title="User:Atomaton">Atom</a> 12:33, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I oppose any block of CyberAnth at this time. I wonder what we have come to when applying existing policy in an attmept to improve Wikipedia becomes grounds for blocking. Unsourced information is being added to Wikipedia faster that it can be tagged with {{<a href="../../../u/n/s/Template%7EUnsourced_589d.html" title="Template:Unsourced">unsourced</a>}} or {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}}, let alone sourced or removed. As Jimbo said, we need to be more agressive about either sourcing or removing unsourced information. The burden of sourcing information still lies with anyone who wants to keep the information in Wikipedia. -- <b><a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalbury_e849.html" title="User talk:Dalbury"><font color="navy">Donald Albury</font></a></b> 12:58, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Massive deletion is disruptive and hurtful to Wikipedia. This is extremeism. Too much of almost anything is a bad thing. CyberAnth needs to source more and delete less. Sourcing takes time. We build the encyclopedia by volunteers adding what they can when they can as best they can and no one elected CyberAnth to establish deadlines for when things are to be sourced or deleted. CyberAnth should be required to add as much material as he deletes. Balance is good.

His vote may be in bad faith and worthy of an incident report because it evidences such apparent disregard or ignorance of plain WP policies.

<dd>I stand behind my comment above that the article had multiple sources at the time you nominated it. That is a simple fact, which you do not dispute. If you don't dispute the fact, then don't complain about me stating it as fact on AfD. If you didn't like those sources, you should have worked on them or discussed them rather than nominating for deletion everything that doesn't fit your tastes.</dd>
<dd>Furthermore, you continue today to be unrepententant and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ACyberAnth&amp;diff=98918566&amp;oldid=98902705" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ACyberAnth&amp;diff=98918566&amp;oldid=98902705" rel="nofollow">argumentative with other editors</a>.

<li>Can we refocus the converstation to talk about the line between when an article should be tagged as needing cites, and when it should be tagged for deletion. As practical consideration, it is much easier to tag something as needing citations. Consider all the effort by all the people arguing about deleting these articles, consider all the discussion here. If you simply tag something there is usually no argument, and hopefully it will lead to citations being added. So when should an article be tagged for deletion? When it seems blatantly obvious that there is no chance of a good article existing. Anything short of that and you are wasting everyone's time. -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuelWantman_9090.html" title="User:SamuelWantman">Samuel Wantman</a> 23:21, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I suggest we drop discussion, as the request has failed, de-facto, as no admin has issued a 24-hour block (or any other block), and although opinion weighs heavily towards a block, no consensus was reached.

<p>In situations like this, where it is not clear if there is any consensus developing here at WP:ANI, is there not an argument that a temporary injunction is needed? ie. Tell the editor in question to stop. If they do not stop, issue a block to prevent further disruption. Pass the case straight to ArbCom to seek a ruling on what sort of user conduct is acceptable in this case. The block would last as long as it takes to undo the disruption or for ArbCom to hand down a temporary injunction that would release the editor on 'bail' until the case was heard. An RfC would also seem to be in order, to get wider views on whether this sort of behaviour is acceptable. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 07:59, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I suspect I am the editor Tarinth is talking about. I did not check CyberAnth's contributions; I did not go looking for stuff to delete. I looked at his userpage, and he had linked to Prairie Muffins and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Pride_3059.html" title="Mary Pride">Mary Pride</a>, articles he was apparently proud of. The point of linking to such articles on one's userpage is to get others to click through, right? And I did. And what I found were horrible articles, unsourced, largely unverifiable, and probably unencyclopedic. Now, what was I supposed to do? I suppose could have put them on my watchlist and AfD'd them in a few weeks when tensions died down, but really, what's the point of that? Why wait? Or I could have back up and said to myself "well, if I nominate these for AfD it'll look tactless if not tasteless and rude, so I'll just pretend I never saw this article." That seems to me to be a poor choice if I care about the quality of this encyclopedia. I don't think that Wikipedia should function by wars of attrition, but what exactly should I have done instead? The articles can't be improved because they are non-notable to begin with. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">lk</span></a> — 01:54, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>I agree with Artw - I think people need to be careful about what they accuse others - the very nature of Wikipedia lends itself to one editor taking action that might <i>appear</i> to be "revenge" but is simple good practice. When I come across an editor a couple of times (and let's be honest some em.. short-term editors stand out a mile) or somewhere like here, the first thing I do is check their contributions. Not so long ago, this meant I removed/reverted every single contribution and article created by an editor (copyvios, nonsense etc). On the surface, this can look like wikistalking but what's a good faith editor suppose to do? say "oh well I deleted 50% of this rubbish - best to leave the rest!". --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesknight_2ce5.html" title="User:Charlesknight">Charlesknight</a> 11:29, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Mass showed up after an Arbcom-level edit dispute and jumped right into the middle, remaking some of the disputed changes. This is the first instance of Mass editing in related articles. Due to the highly suspicious nature of the edits and the sensitive topic, I have reverted Mass' changes and suggest discussion on the article talk page. I do not believe the claim that Massimamanno is a sockpuppet is clearly well supported - he's been editing other topics for some time. However, the behaviour could be argued to be meatpuppetry, or a sleeper sockpuppet. I don't know that either of those is true; I do think that this requires Mass to participate in the talk page in good faith and work within the existing mediated framework. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 08:44, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I am no sockpuppet nor meatpuppet, and the reason why I immediately made some relevant changes (writing my reasons on talk page) is that either they were discussed in the talk page with no negative opinions or they didn't seem to have been discussed at all and being new information (such as the European Union ban of Depleted Uranium weapons). <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> reverted everything indiscriminately offering no opposing view, as it seems some people has been doing from months on, which is the reason why, in my opinion, the article is very poor, biased, and blocked from progressing.

<dd>As far as I know, the 'don't self-block' rule comes from a couple of technical issues that have been resolved over the last year or two. The first was a server load issue—apparently at one point the servers checked the block list by going through each and every entry sequentially to determine whether or not an editor was blocked. Now, I believe that a more efficient algorithm is used to compare an editor's name and IP with the block list, essentially rendering this concern moot.</dd>
<dd>The second issue was related to collateral damage. Blocking an editor was also apt to cause autoblocks on that editor's IP(s). Now, (I think?) this is fixed if the blocking admin unchecks the 'Block anonymous users only' and the 'Automatically block the last IP address used by this user' check boxes.</dd>
<dd>Does anyone know of any other <i>technical</i> reasons why self-blocks or user-requested blocks should be disallowed? If not, that just leaves the question of policy. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 15:16, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not having much knowledge about the man himself or the background (purely Enforcing The Rules here, capitals intended, as it's better than the squabbling and edit warring that was going on around the article), I removed everything that wasn't referenced, and there was no references vis-a-vis the <a href="../../../b/c/_/BC_Legislature_Raids_9885.html" title="BC Legislature Raids">BC Legislature Raids</a>. If some exist, then I would add it, but that's a different sort of content issue. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></a></small> 12:53, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Given that the - now confirmed - socks all wanted to delete the article, it looks like closing the AFD as no consensus/keep/anything other than a delete was about right. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></a></small> 14:59, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">boldly</a> closed this investigation because based on the diffs provided there by the accused it was pretty clear this was a spurious investigation opened in retaliation.
