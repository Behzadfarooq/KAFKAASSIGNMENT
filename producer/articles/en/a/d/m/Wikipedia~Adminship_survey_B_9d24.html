<ul>
<li>If the bureaucrats were to stand for RfB again, would they make the cut today?</li>
<li>Do you agree with their judgments? At times of disagreement, do you accept their rationale/explanation(s)?</li>

<li>I can't say I would always agree with bureaucrat decisions, but at the same time, I've never seen a controversial case where the admin was actually bad. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">moo!</a></small> 15:18, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>True, but that was in the fall of 2005, an eternity ago in wiki-time, and the non-prescient bureaucrat who made that decision hasn't done an RfA promotion for months. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 17:21, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><s>Proof is in pudding. Pudding seems fine. Perhaps the bureaucrats could be a bit more agressive in ignoring people who are not contributing to consensus, but no serious complaint. <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 15:54, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</s> Bad pudding. <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - [[User talk:Hiplaquo;<small>Talk</small>»]] 12:09, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>The job of a bureaucrat is to interpret consensus, and I think they do a fine job of that. In the case of a bad admin, that's the fault of the people voting, per my comments above, not the crats. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDev920_f8f8.html" title="User:Dev920">Dev920</a> (Have a nice day!) 15:46, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Apart from Ryulong's RFA, yes. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a>&#160;<a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></a> 16:06, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yes. Even with Ryulong's RFA, I think what was done was something that <i>needs</i> to be done, but it was the wrong RFA to pick for it. Several users that everyone 100% completely and totally agrees are trusted users have failed to get promoted because they didn't jump through the right hoops. This is where the bureaucrats need to exercise their discretion. If someone is 60/40, but every single one of the opposes is for namespace balance reasons, then a bureaucrat needs to consider promoting that user. See <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Gay_Cdn_3945.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Gay Cdn">Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Gay Cdn</a>, for example. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 16:43, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I do have faith though I would prefer for a far greater discretionary range to be available. Again, its just a metric that itself doesn't make sense as the range is determined by a proportion without looking at the overall total. A higher total number is also an indicator and that is never considered by the proponents of a particular % figure. Perfectly happy with Ryulong. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 16:58, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm confident in the current set of 'crats, for the time being. I suspect most of them would fail RfB if renominated, but that would be due to shortcomings in RfB rather than with the current set of 'crats. --<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">ais523</a> 17:08, 16 February 2007 (<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">U</a><a href="../../../a/i/s/User_talk%7EAis523_6ca0.html" title="User talk:Ais523">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ais523_df26.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ais523">C</a>)</li>
<li>If anything, bureaucrats should be more willing to take specific arguments into consideration, not less. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChick_Bowen_2101.html" title="User:Chick Bowen">Chick Bowen</a> 17:31, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I have absolute confidence in the bureaucrats, and I want to express my opinion that I support their use of even more discretion than is currently used. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315">talk</a>) 17:37, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I trust the crats to make the right promotions, but (as below) don't think that has much to do with consensus. <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> <a href="../../../k/u/s/User_talk%7EKusma_087e.html" title="User talk:Kusma">(討論)</a> 17:56, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Put me here. AN and ANI have been on my watchlist for quite a while and I have not seen anyone criticize Carnildo's actions once that I can recall, so it seems as though the crats called that one right. Ryulong was promoted on a bad rationale but I think that one will turn out OK as well. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoreschi_31bb.html" title="User:Moreschi">Moreschi</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_recordings_a333.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested recordings">Request a recording?</a></sup> 19:25, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yes I trust them. However I think they should be more proactive in sheparding difficult disscussions toward consensus, rather than standing by while people become more and more entrenched. Determing consenssus should not simply mean reading a page after X number of days and making a choice.--<i><font color="#9966FF">Birgitte</font><font color="#CC99CC" size="2">SB</font></i> 20:07, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I do trust crats to make the right decision, which should be determined by consensus from discussion, not from merely numbers. Using percentages may have seemed like a good idea when it was first introduced, and probably still does, but we need to be weaned off of addiction to them. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGracenotes_686d.html" title="User:Gracenotes"><font color="#960">Grace</font><font color="#000">notes</font></a><sup><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGracenotes_98ea.html" title="User talk:Gracenotes"><font color="#960">T</font></a></sup> § 20:31, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I haven't seen any recent bad calls. The fact that the b'crats respected the lack of consensus on <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Gay_Cdn_3945.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Gay Cdn">Gay Cdn's RfA</a> is encouraging. I would not want the b'crats to participate in the discussion, except possibly to move replies to people's&#160;!votes onto the talk page. <span style="font-family:serif;font-size:120%"><b><a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">Αργυριου</a></b> <a href="../../../a/r/g/User_talk%7EArgyriou_e022.html" title="User talk:Argyriou">(talk)</a></span> 22:12, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Despite having been involved in one of the more infamous disputes regarding the closing of an RfA by a bureaucrat, I think they do a fine job. It's actually not as demanding as closing contentious AfDs. —<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Bell_8398.html" title="User:Doug Bell">Doug&#160;Bell</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoug_Bell_81b5.html" title="User talk:Doug Bell">talk</a></sup> 23:32, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The carnildo thing wasn't really addressed by the resultant arbcom case - other than to determine the independance of bureaucratship. They let us down there. The point is, if you get desyssoped - that's usually for a good reason, if the community make you come back 3, maybe 4 times to RFA to get your tools back, well that's just tough you should have minded your P's and Q's a little better.

<li>I do not trust the current system, which allows for single users with bureaucrat rights that have only been marginally active to step in and make a personal decision, which is essentially not reversible. However, most (if not all) of the bureaucrats actively performing bureaucrat duties are trustworthy. -- <a href="../../../r/e/n/User%7ERenesis13_6b6b.html" title="User:Renesis13">Renesis</a> (<a href="../../../r/e/n/User_talk%7ERenesis13_5466.html" title="User talk:Renesis13">talk</a>) 17:04, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>No. I do not believe that bureaucrats are doing what is necessary, as they should, such as weighing arguments. <a href="../../../s/t/4/User%7EST47_d0a2.html" title="User:ST47">ST47</a><small><a href="../../../s/t/4/User_talk%7EST47_ecf4.html" title="User talk:ST47">Talk</a></small> 18:12, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>No. Agree with above comments. It is also disturbing that they are making efforts to prevent other editors becoming bureaucrats for spurious reasons as in <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_bureaucratship_Nihonjoe_e320.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for bureaucratship/Nihonjoe">Wikipedia:Requests for bureaucratship/Nihonjoe</a>. <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatchpole_52c3.html" title="User:Catchpole">Catchpole</a> 19:17, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>No way. The Carnildo incident immediately strikes me as something the 'crats had poor judgement on and it only escalated from that point on resulting in poor behavior from editors and admins alike. — <a href="../../../m/o/e/User_talk%7EMoe_Epsilon_62b6.html" title="User talk:Moe Epsilon"><font color="#000000">Moe</font></a> 23:27, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I accpeted Danny's explantion for Sean Black's promotion but felt that Carnildo's was clearly against consensus (which is oddly enough the opposite of my own oppinions of the candidates). Bureaucrats should not use their own judgments on a candidates accetability but rather consider the feelings of the community. If a substantial minority feels that admins must have attribute X then they must have it to have the consensus support of the community. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 05:15, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Decisions should not be left to one bureaucrat. They should be discussed in a place such as the b-crat noticeboard, where multiple crats will determine a consensus of the consensus.</li>
<li>If I can't trust the system which they were spawned from the foul creatures&#160;;) (Kidding of course...) then how can I trust them? As I said above, 1 oppose vote should in theory be able to negate an army of support votes. This is not the case &amp; bureacrats are partly to blame. Why I say they are partly not to blame is becuase if they ended a RfA because of one really valid oppose despite the 100's of supports, then they'd be ousted from the community... Other wise yes I trust them, but overall I don't. They can't win basically... <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpawn_Man_fbc1.html" title="User:Spawn Man">Spawn Man</a> 01:33, 19 February 2007 (UTC) P.S. And after seeing the links Majorly gave, I trust them even less...</li>
<li>I totally agree with what the guy above is saying. Every time someone is made a bureaucrat, their screenname should be modified (all of them) so that anonymity might be maintained. Obviously, this shouldn't be complete anonymity - they should be held accountable, but they shouldn't be able to be dogged by 100s of users. Alternatively, my proposal shouldn't be enacted but something else done instead... --<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeans_Potato_Business_0fbe.html" title="User:Seans Potato Business">Seans</a> <b><a href="../../../s/e/a/User_talk%7ESeans_Potato_Business_5895.html" title="User talk:Seans Potato Business">Potato Business</a></b> 19:33, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>No. The high profile incidents mentioned above (Sean Black, Carnildo, Ryulong) suggest that determining community consensus is not always what is going on. <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBucketsofg_06fb.html" title="User:Bucketsofg"><font color="#DF0001"><b>Buck</b></font><b><font color="green">ets</font></b><font color="grey"><b>ofg</b></font></a> 00:13, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Sorry no. Sean Black and Carnildo promotions made a mockery of our bothering to vote in the first place.

<li>Absolutely not. Take a look at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_KyraVixen_d87b.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/KyraVixen">this RfA</a> - the closing bureaucrat did not promote the candidate, even though there were 41 votes in favour and only 14 against, making it a clear consensus. IMHO the current process gives bureaucrats too much dictatorial power - once SPAs and obvious trolls are discounted, the RfA <i>should</i> be decided on a majority vote. It's not the role of a bureaucrat to decide whether someone would make a good admin, or to disregard consensus. <font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89"><font color="purple"><b>Wal</b></font></a><a href="../../../w/a/l/User_talk%7EWalton_monarchist89_7ca3.html" title="User talk:Walton monarchist89"><font color="silver"><b>ton</b></font></a> <small><sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/WP%7EBRoy_e296.html" title="WP:BRoy"><font color="purple">Vivat Regina!</font></a></sup></small></font> 17:54, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>What do you mean by "consensus"? There is rarely consensus in non-unanimous RfAs these days. Bureaucrats often decide by supermajority, and only rarely dare to stray from the old 80% definition. I don't understand how people can believe a 73/27/7 RfA to be "no consensus" but a 165/35/27 RfA to have reached "consensus". In both cases, there is not really consensus to promote the candidate, as sizable minorities are opposing. However, what is important is not consensus, but whether the candidate should be promoted or not (which can be decided by taking into account the arguments provided). As there have been no complaints about Carnildo and Ryulong since their promotion, the bureucrats acted correctly in their decision to promote even though they ignored the supermajority requirements others think they should have used. Unfortunately the Carnildo promotion resulted in a lot of other bad things (none of which were related to Carnildo's admin actions since repromotion), which the closing crat might have anticipated better. Anyway, the bureaucrat's job in my opinion is not to determine whether consensus has been reached, but to make the decision whether to promote or not to promote in cases where there can't be any consensus due to the large number of participants in the debate. <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> <a href="../../../k/u/s/User_talk%7EKusma_087e.html" title="User talk:Kusma">(討論)</a> 16:10, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>It’s not a matter if I trust <i>them</i>; I accept the system how they became crats as long as there’s no system that’s considered to produce better crats. --<a href="../../../v/a/n/User%7EVan_helsing_c85b.html" title="User:Van helsing">Van helsing</a> 17:19, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I agree with that--I do not necessarily trust the way they are given the office, but the decisions made in RfA seem to be sensible, which means that we should not really tinker with this part. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 18:53, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>It's a tough job, as some of the other questions here demonstrate. I haven't seen a huge amount of decisions made where I disagree with the reading of the result, and as elsewhere we aren't constantly running to desysop (even in the cases I've disagreed), so they can't be going that far wrong. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 19:23, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>In view of the extremely idiosyncratic usage of 'consensus', then yes. Whether consensus can be measured by percentages, or what those percentages should be, is a question separate from that of whether to trust the bureaucrats as individuals. <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 05:26, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>In general, yes. My somewhat flawed first RfB notwithstanding, I wish there was a way to bring fresh new views to the bureaucrat staff. I'm starting to think there should be one-year terms for bureaucrats. No, it would be nowhere even <i>close</i> to causing the same problems as reconfirming administrators, so don't tell me it won't work for the reasons reconfirming administrators wouldn't work. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmasterka_6922.html" title="User:Grandmasterka"><font color="green">Grand</font></a><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrandmasterka_5f38.html" title="User talk:Grandmasterka"><font color="blue">master</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Grandmasterka_b497.html" title="Special:Contributions/Grandmasterka"><font color="purple">ka</font></a> 08:31, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I trust the crats, but I think that standards have gone up so high that an RfB is nearly impossible. I also believe that an exact measure for consensus is contradictory to what RfA is all about. <i><b><a href="../../../b/i/b/User%7EBibliomaniac15_4b0f.html" title="User:Bibliomaniac15"><font color="black">bibliomaniac</font></a><a href="../../../b/i/b/User_talk%7EBibliomaniac15_e27b.html" title="User talk:Bibliomaniac15"><font color="red">1</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bibliomaniac15_b1b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bibliomaniac15"><font color="blue">5</font></a></b></i> 22:40, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think that they generally do the best they can with the system in their hands. However, I'd like to see them take Neutral&#160;!votes into greater account, rather than discounting them. I'd also like to see them throw out&#160;!votes than are essentially meaningless such as Oppose/Support per X user.
