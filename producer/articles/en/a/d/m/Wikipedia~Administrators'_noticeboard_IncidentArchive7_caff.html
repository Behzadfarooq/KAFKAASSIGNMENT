This means that I will have to change some 30+ country pages in one sweep.

Regardless of this, and due to fear that Netoholic would just revert me if I made the edit again I asked for feedback in the Talk page. Nobody has so far opposed to me making this change, except of course Netoholic. Because I have the support of Jdforrester and only one opposition (Netoholic, who has a history of rejecting any change I make) I will be proceeding with this tiny change now, so I ask you to be weary with Netoholic if he begins reverting me.

<dd>The blocking policy says: "Sysops may also block new user accounts that make lots of disruptive edits, for any length of time or permanently, at their discretion." Dnagod did make a lot of disruptive edits and upset a lot of people in a very short space of time. It also says: "Blocks may be imposed in instances where threats have been made or actions performed . . . which expose other Wikipedia editors to political, religious or other persecution by government, their employer or any others. In such a case a ban for a period of time may be applied immediately by any sysop upon discovery." Dnagod spent his entire time at Wikipedia railing against editors he perceived to be Jewish, pointing out to other editors that they were Jewish or "lackeys" of Jews, as he put it, and in his parting comment referred to the Jewish editors as a "Jew infestation." I would say that falls within the category of "[exposing] Wikipedia editors to political, religious or other persecution by . . . any others." Whether that persecution occurred or not is irrelevant. The exposure to potential persecution took place, and it was deliberate and repeated. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> 15:01, Feb 12, 2005 (UTC)

<dd><i>"...and upset a lot of people..."</i> -- Is the mere act of upsetting people covered or addressed by the blocking policy? If not, what is the relevance of mentioning it regarding a decision to block? Also, the addition of the word "potential" in the phrase "exposure to persecution" is yours, not the policy's. One wonders how the word "exposed" should be interpreted. I would venture that the word "potential" is very vague and arbitrary and is not intended to be implied by "exposure". I have the <b>potential</b> for persecution, theft, murder, and death every day; I can't put someone else at fault because something <i>might</i> have happened to me. - <a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithTyler_1a57.html" title="User:KeithTyler">Keith D.

<p>The sorts of disruptions given as examples in the blocking policy all involve vandalism, like editing talk page comments, not the possession of a "disruptive" POV.

<dd>anti-semitism, or any similar hate-agenda is not a <i>personal</i> attack, it is simply and evidently unacceptable behaviour. We cannot include "racism" in the blocking policy because every editor involved in Israeli/Paliestinian disputes would come running here, saying they have been exposed to racism. That we have to protect ourselves from becoming flooded with confused suprematist hate-mongers is self-evident imho, and needs no further justification. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 15:07, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd>I'm now confused as to what Sam Spade is arguing. In response to me, he seems to be saying that the problem is that the ban was indefinite, while in response to SlimVirgin he seems to be saying that there shouldn't have been a ban at all. Also, the claim that Dnagod was “discriminated against“ is serious, and needs to be argued for carefully and coherently, not merely stated.<br />
Anyway, it's doubtless very fine and noble of him to spend so much time defending someone who was clearly, openly, and volubly racist (presumably following Voltaire's maxim), but aren't there articles to be written and improved? <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis (<font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 15:15, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, I'm not so much defending him (he probably won't ever use that acount again, unblocked or no) but wikipedians generally from being persecuted and blocked based on POV.

<dd>actually, polite nazis who don't rant against jews on talk pages, and who simply lovingly cultivate the articles about their idols, citing sources for every nazi position, would not be blocked. Nazi rants are an easy target. "who's next" is a valid question, and being vigilant is good for the project's sanity. We draw the line this side of nazi rants, and this side of goatse. We know that drawing a line is a difficult task, and I hope we are humble enough to acknowledge that, but drawing such lines is the noble duty of the community (which elects admins as housekeepers). <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 15:36, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd>Quite. The question is if expressing an objectionable POV is disruptive, and if so, is an indefinite block acceptable. Admins are housekeepers, not line drawers, and when they begin to violate policy in a manner reflective of their own POV, censoring those whom they disagree with, they need reigning in. Thats what this is about.

<dd>admins are line-drawers in a sense. If the policies could be applied mechanically, admins would be superfluous. If one admin, or a group of admins begins to work against the community, we have the paths of rfc and arbcom for the community to deal with it. the arbcom is more delicate, since the only way to appeal against them is to Jimbo personally. I appreciate that you come here rather than opening a full rfc about this, but either way, you must be clear that you are not likely to get much support if you argue against this block (my personal estimation, of course). It is good to have people watching what the admins are doing, so your being alert is appreciated, but in this case, it is clearly disruptive to leave ranting nazis loose on WP's talk pages. Such rants do nothing but instill flamewars, and some editors might leave WP in disgust. Ranting about "jew-infestation" is not a pov, Sam. It's something you just clean up, like goatse. I do not even disagree with such statements, since they do not deserve discussion. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 18:04, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<p>Words are weapons; we have to watch how we use them, and not just let stuff spew forth as though it has no consequence. Here's an example of the type of material Dnagod has posted on the Web. <a href="http://groups.google.ca/groups?selm=37816803.B131B215%40chesco.com&amp;output=gplain" class="external autonumber" title="http://groups.google.ca/groups?selm=37816803.B131B215%40chesco.com&amp;output=gplain" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> Drawing the line at providing a platform to a neo-Nazi is called editing, not censorship. Jimbo Wales has said time and again that what we're doing here is writing an encyclopedia, and that the process, though very important, is secondary to that. He wrote recently: "I will not ride the ship of openness to the bottom of the ocean." Dnagod lives at the bottom of the ocean. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> 17:53, Feb 12, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But why was the block indefinite? Where does it say in the policy that admins can block (other than for abusive username etc) indefinitely? I thought that was the job of arbcom. Incidently, 168 anon has posted far worse anti-Muslim remarks (including a claim on this <b>admin</b> board that Muslims took over Wikipedia). Where were you at that time?

I don't know about the others involved in this case, but I saw neither of the events to which you refer. Anyone can only respond to what they're aware of.

<dd>that's right, a block would have been justifiable in the cases OneGuy cites.

<dd>What other kind of incitement is there?

<dd>it is neither. Thank go*dness, we have the most divergent opinions here. Just keep it polite and in good faith. Sam, it's good to have a devil's advocate (I mean it), just try to keep it in perspective -- there's no need to call wolf in cases where you <i>know</i> there will be overwhelming consensus. There are enough cases that are indeed debatable, and it is healthy to debate them (for example, what about our polite self-declared "enemy of Islam"? Would we block similarly polite self-declared "enemies of Judaism"?

<p>I have noticed that the 2004 article has had the NPOV tag on it for quite a while. I have read the entire talk page and I've noticed that a suggestion to break the dispute was put on the table: split up the page into different articles to try to balance up the page and cut it down in size. However, it appears that those who want the NPOV tag to stay and not allow material to go into the article are unwilling to compromise. This has been going on since December 2004, with no resolution in sight. Hence, I have made a note that either a compromise is tried, or I lock the page. I have since removed the NPOV tag from the page. I will go ahead with my promise of locking this page for a time if it goes back on again as it is clear that certain editors are not trying to come to consensus. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 04:26, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am not pleased with this territoriality, expressed in a condescending offhand way, over the noticeboard. You venture to comment on my one-sentence question regarding why redirect to CoC versus Ethno. (at the admin's god-like whim, you seem to suggest, but naturally that is not subject for discussion here), but surely my more substantive question, which was not <i>content-related</i> and which your comment directly followed, warrants some consideration. At any rate, to recapsulate it: can any Administrator here review the table at <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Jewish_ethnocentrism_ccdc.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Jewish ethnocentrism">Jewish ethnocentrism VfD</a> and then please explain to me how, in the context of its results, can it be deemed acceptable for any Administrator to go around and turn it into redirect anyway.

<dd>Could an admin please explain what is the correct thing to do in a situation like this? There was an overwhelming majority in favour of deletion, with around 45 in favor; two wanting a redirect (as I recall to Ethnocentrism) and only a small number, including several socks, voting to keep. The aricle was then deleted. Sam Spade put it up for a VfU, which again was overwhelmingly rejected. Given that clear consensus, is one editor simply allowed to recreate the title regardless, redirecting it to a page no one wanted it to redirect to?

<p>Thanks for the offer of help, Ed, but I believe Andy L and Curps dealt with it by blanking it and protecting the blank page so it couldn't be recreated or redirected, as that was the consensus at the VfD. Mikkalai used his admin power to unprotect the page after Curps did that, I believe, but AndyL has redone it.

<p>Mikkalai, the article was deleted. The consensus was not to fix it or to NPOV it. The consensus was to delete it. That means no article. Creating a "new" Jewish Ethnocentrism article is NOT the appropriate thing to do in that situation. Deleting attempts to do it is. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 22:35, Feb 14, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is your private interpretation of the policy. Fortunately, not all agree with it. Besides, you are off mark: I was neither "fixing", nor "NPOVing" the old article. "No article" is your arbitrary treatments. Deletion means deletion of the particular objectionable and non-salvageable <b>content</b>. There is no policy in wikipedia against a NPOV article on a valid topic. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 23:40, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>agree with snowspinner. there is no point in deleting if a rewrite can fix things. (I do not see the harm in a redirect, though). In some cases, recreation is warranted, namely if there is a change in notability. Say I create a vanity article about myself. You guys justly delete it. Tomorrow, I go and shoot Rumsfeld: Then, of course, the article will be recreated as about the guy who shot Rumsfeld. No such change in notability applies here, though.) Mikkalai, you are mistaken. A vote for deletion means that the <i>topic</i> is not valid. Anybody can fix a bad article, we don't need to vote on that. People voted that there should be <i>no</i> article on "Jewish ethnocentrism" (why they did that, god knows), not even one from the npov. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 23:44, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</small>

<dd>Allow me to respectfully disagree with you. I am tired to repeat the same argument again and again as more and more people jump into this discussion.

<dd>Imagine that someone created an article called Russian genetic inferiority, which recounted the theories of people who were racist about Russians. A Vfd leads to the article being deleted, whereupon another user creates an article with the same name as a redirect to <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a> or <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genetics.html" title="Genetics">genetics</a>.

<dd>What is the difference from the case when someone makes <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a> into a redirect to <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shit.html" title="Shit">Shit</a>?. Unlike your and this my silly example, I was readdressing to the article which <b>actually</b> discusses, and what is most important, <b>criticizes</b> the concept.

<dd>A better example would be Serbian Catholics. The term is not inherently insulting. It's just that it is only notable for being used in context of ethnic hatred. If we have Jewish ethnocentrism, why not Rajput ethnocentrism, Alamanic ethnocentrism and Inuit ethnocentrism. Therefore, I understand the reasons for the decision on VfD. And even if I didn't understand them, I would hold that they should be honoured. I <b>still</b> don't see the harm in a redirect to Culture of Critique, though, since, say someone wants to know about this term that popped up somewhere, typos it into WP, and <i>voila</i> he is taken to an article that reveals the neo-nazi parentage of the term. reliable information served. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 00:13, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</small>
<dl>
<dd>I don't see why there cannot be an article Serbian Catholics that explains that the term is used by a certain category of people in the context of ethnic hatred or to have the corresponding subsection in a larger article, with Serbian Catholics redirecting there. Don't you see the similarity with the one existed like only 50 years ago, when you could not find a dictionary with the word <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shit.html" title="Shit">shit</a> (or at least could not <i>easily</i> find). We do have <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigger.html" title="Nigger">Nigger</a> article, don't we?... Let me check...Yes, we do. And <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Panthers_fe99.html" title="Black Panthers">Black Panthers</a> are not after our asses yet&#160;:-).

<dd>Again, you seem to feel that you are authorized to substitute your judgement about these matters for the consensus. If <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigger.html" title="Nigger">Nigger</a> were submitted to VfD and the consensus was to delete it, would you then proceed to recreate the article, with content you deemed "different", because you felt the VfD voters were misguided in deleting it?

<dd>Perhaps BM was quoting a previous post of yours when he placed inverted commas around "different". There are many reasons for doing this in English; it needn't denote sarcasm and this is another instance of you assuming the worst of people. As for indents, the "rule" (non-sarcastic use of inverted commas), insofar as there is one, is that the first person doesn't indent, the second indents once, the third twice; then when the first person replies, they don't indent, and the second sticks with one indent, and so on, so that at a glance, people can see who has written which comment. As you can see, few editors, if any, have stuck to this, yourself included. I find your personal attacks and aggressive tone quite depressing, and so I don't think I'll be responding to you again. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> 06:07, Feb 15, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>since this is a full-blown rfc with evidence collecting and all, by now, anyway, couldn't we as well move to rfc? At the core of this is a disagreement about the meaning of VfD. If we put all personal sensibilities to rest for a moment, we can discuss that: does a succeded vote for deletion mean that there should be no article, ever, at that title, or does it only refer to the content of the article that was deleted. I was of the impression that VfD's are about <i>article titles</i> exclusively, and <i>not</i> about article content (which can always be fixed without VfD). <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 18:33, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>Mikkalai, you keep hanging your hat on the word "content" in the speedy-deletion policy. However, it is clear to everybody but you (and I'm not sure you aren't just being argumentative) that the VfD/VfU policy and procedures make no sense at all if anybody can just recreate an article that has been VfD'ed simply by providing different content than was deleted. To dab, I would say that the VfD process isn't so much about 'titles' as it is about 'topics', although the difference may not be clear. If there was a VfD on an article under the title X, and it was deleted for not being encyclopedic by VfD, and someone came along and wrote another article under that title on a completely different topic (same name, different person, for example), I don't think people would object that deletion policy had been circumvented, although there might be some confusion initially. On the other hand, if some came along and tried to create an article on Jewish ethno-centrism (same topic, but not quite the same title), we would still be saying that this flouts the VfD vote. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 19:23, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<p>ok, there are two clear cases:</p>
<ol>
<li>VfD passes, somebody reposts the same article -- speedy delete.</li>
<li>VfD (or possibly nonsense-speedy-deletion, and example off the top of my head is <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle-axe.html" title="Battle-axe">battle-axe</a>) passes, somebody reposts completely different material, on a different <i>topic</i> (like, different person, same name) -- legitimate.</li>
</ol>
<p>now for the cases less clear:</p>
<ol>
<li>vfd passes. somebody reposts a slightly rephrased version.</li>
<li>vfd passes for non-notability. somebody reposts a much better, rephrased article about the same <i>topic</i>. Will the non-notable verdict not still apply?</li>
<li>this case: vfd passes, explicitly declining even a redirect not to give credibility to the term. rephrased article is reposted, linking to the articles for which the redirect was declined. Clearly a repost of the same <i>topic</i>, and clearly a repost of some of the rejected content.</li>

<dd>Please realize also that these policies went thru long and painful and heated processes in attempts to deliver better and clearer rules. They are not like some obscure articles about <a href="../../../b/a/b/Baba_Yaga_4ef1.html" title="Baba Yaga">Baba Yaga</a>. Of course, it does not preclude the possibility that one may propose a better solution, but it must be in the <i>policy</i>, not it its <i>interpretation</i>. When in doubt, the preferense is to allow rather than to forbid and in favor of creation rather than deletion. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 22:50, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC).

<dd>I understand this very well. I also understand that <i>policy</i> without <i>interpretation</i> goes nowhere. My interpretation of "deletion" is <i>delere</i>, annihilate, wipe off the face of Wikipedia. My interpretation of the VfD on "Jewish ethnocentrism" is that the community said, "we don't want no bloody Jewish ethnocentrism article". I claim that deletion policy could be clearer, because it does not unabmiguously differentiate <i>title</i>, <i>topic</i> and <i>content</i>, and I am pretty sure many people voting on VfD have no clear idea what they are voting on. This doesn't change the simple fact that people decided against a JE article. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 07:29, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

VfD means different things to different people, and sometimes even means different things to the same person. Sometimes an article is deleted because no good article can be written with that title. Sometimes the only problem is the content. Sometimes people want to delete everything of the category on which the article is written. In purely technical terms, I suppose you could say that VfD only sets a binding precedent on the actual content of the article (and even then, what happens when the content changes during the vote?) But VfD isn't a technical page, it's a discussion page. In the end each VfD vote means whatever the admins in charge want it to mean.

<p>I'm afraid I'm just not buying this. Mikkalai is basically saying that the VfD policy is that once an article is deleted, anybody can recreate an article of the same title and on the same topic, even minutes after the administrator has deleted the old one, and that as long the text is different from the text of the article that was deleted, the only thing that anybody can do is to submit if for VfD again, whereupon it gets another 5 days, and that a such a recreation action would be perfectly reasonable and within policy, and in fact any administrator who tried to stop it would be out of line, would be overstepping his authority, and would be subject to discipline himself. Mikkalai is pretending that anybody who disagrees with this interpretation is just a newbie who doesn't understand the delicate, solomonic, balancing process that the ur-members of Wikipedia (including him, of course) went through to arrive at the current set of rules. This is nonsense, and the fact is that nobody shares this interpretation of the policy, which Mikkalai knows perfectly well. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 01:02, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I truly don't think there is a hard and fast rule here. That's one of the reasons why VfD discussions usually include comments, not just votes. Sometimes it is simply about a title, and the article can be moved, intact, to an unobjectionable title. Sometimes it is about this being completely the wrong article to be at a title: for example, deleting an article about a non-notable individual doesn't mean we can't write an article about a more famous person with the same name. And certainly a deletion for failure to demonstrate notability doesn't preclude later demonstrating notability, especially in changed circumstances. For example, a typical deleted "band vanity" article becomes something very different if they get a major label contract and put out a generally distributed CD. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 01:23, Feb 16, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>That may well be, and I am not saying anything different. But that isn't what Mikkalai is saying. He is saying that the only case where the recreation of a VfD-ed article can be speedy-deleted is when the recreated article text is the same as the deleted article. (Compared to which version, and how different it has to be to be different -- he hasn't said) Otherwise, if anybody wants to delete it, he has to go back to VfD again, even if it is only minutes after the previous deletion. For example, if the Stormfront troopers came in right now and recreated the Jewish ethnocentrism article with different text -- lets say it was even worse -- Mikkalai wouldn't speedy-delete it as an administrator, and in fact, he would feel justified in undoing the speedy deletion of another administrator, as overstepping the CSD policy. Of course, with the current state of play the Stormfront guys couldn't do this because the article exists already in the blanked/protected state, and Mikkalai has had his wrists slapped a little for messing with this. But Mikkalai has been saying that this is wrong and a misinterpretation of policy. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 02:25, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are plenty of cases when "bad gyus" argument was invoked, but rejected; firearms and pornography, to name a few. At the same time, I agree that a community may impose its own. stricter, rules for what it wants to have. But this must be done by proposing the corresponding language in the relevant policy. Otherwise your interpretations are just as valid as mine. And your slapping my wrists is nothing but bullying me into your POV. I am repeating again and again. There are plenty of touchy topics in wikipedia, and to forbid them for the reason that they may become a playground for neonazis, islamic fundamentalists, KKK, white supremacists, purists etc., is not acceptable. All of them were dealt with pretty successfully so far. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 18:06, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>so at least it is obvious the policy needs a wording less ambiguous. It'll not do to have people disagreeing to such an extent over the meaning of a policy. Your "wrists were slapped" because you disregarded community 'consensus' (majority desicion rather, one I disagree with as much as you do), and especially for using admin powers to do so. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 18:58, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd>My admin powers were used solely to remove what I thought protection policy violation. It turned out that the problem was wikipedia database timing problem, recorded in the logs: I edited the article <b>between</b> the moments when Jnc blanked it and his protection was recorded/enacted. Therefore it appeared to me that
<ul>
<li>Jnc edited the page,</li>
<li>then I edited it,</li>
<li>then he protected the page,</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>which would be a clear violation of the policy. After careful investigation I detected my error and apologized before Jnc for false accusations. When AndyL protected the page again, I did not do anything, although formally he also violated this: he is one of the active editors of the deleted page. But I twisted the policy in <b>his</b> favor, since he did not edit the <b>new</b> version. So much for my abuse of admin powers. In my experience most complains about abuse of admin powers comes from people who are eager to censor, delete, forbid, and punish someone right away, on the spot. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 19:53, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>We aren't really talking your abuse of admin powers any more. I shouldn't have brought that up again with the wrist-slapping crack. Please answer the question: Is it not so that you consider that an article recreated after a VfD cannot be speedy-deleted as long as it is recreated with a different text than what was deleted, and must therefore go through VfD again? And, is there a single other person who agrees with this interpretation? --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 20:27, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>In my spare time I will strain my mind and present the case at the policy talk page. I want to do it without hurry, since I am not that eloquent in legalese. We shall see there how many are on both sides of the fense. As for "single other", there is at least one at this page and one at my "illegal" repeated vfd page. See you in the court:-) But as a courtesy I will say "yes, I consider so". Also, here is a preventive answer to the following natural sequel question: "What if this guy replaces the word "shit" by "crock" and reposts the piece?" Answer: That happened. Speedily deleted with no objections. Wikipedia is swarmed with crackpots. Every day I revert a dozen or two of vandals. But for some psychological reason they don't have ehough persistence to become really unbearable and unbeatable. Also, I remind you, there is an ultimate resource against really tough cases. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 23:49, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Andy L deleted it again. MIkkalai recreated it once more, and this time started rewriting it.

<li>VfD policy does not give you a power to forbid a page forever. New content must be voted separately.</li>
<li>VfD was not "fake". It was 100% real and explained.</li>
<li>An admin, who blanked my contribution, i.e., edited the article, blocked it in voilation of the policy. therefore I unblocked it (explained in Talk page and in comments). When another, independent admin re-blocked it, I didn't unblock.</li>

<dd>I'm afraid the blocking policy doesn't cover admin abuse of power.

</dl>
</dd>
<dd>In other words, we can all read what you have to say, and then indicate to another admin in words that we think they are not using their power properly, and hopefully they will listen to the rest of us.</dd>
<dd>However, if they choose not to listen, there's not anything we can do about it. Admins don't have any power, technical or in policy, to discipline other admins (except in cases of 3RR violation). In other words, if complaining here doesn't get any result, the next step is the formal route of either RFC or RFAr. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 21:50, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>All I know, Noel, is that if an ordinary editor had behaved like this, s/he would have been blocked, probably for vandalism. There's another discussion at 3RR about an admin being unblocked after a couple of hours for having violated 3RR. Reasons given for the unblock were that he didn't mean to do it, hadn't done it before, all of which I support. But I was blocked once for 3RR. I didn't mean to do it, hadn't realized I'd done it, had never done it before, and wasn't warned on my talk page. But my block was not undone, and I had to sit out the full 24 hours. As I recall, the context of your remarks about there being no problem, or it not being a serious problem (I don't recall where this discussion took place so can't look it up), was editors complaining about admins being treated one way by other admins, and ordinary editors being treated another. And here we have two classic examples of this, on two consecutive days. I also heard an admin refer to ordinary editors as "mundanes" recently, which doesn't exactly inspire confidence. I feel incredibly disheartened by this incident, and the lack of response to it. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> 22:23, Feb 13, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

If you think someone's displaying poor judgment, we have a mechanism to deal with that . . .

We can try to get rid of them, which I assume would require evidence of multiples abuses, but there's no fast way of dealing with one incidence of abuse, as there is with 3RR, yet surely admin abuse is a more serious problem than reversion. If you really are hearing "constant moaning about out of control sysops", then perhaps it is a serious issue. Admins really ought to have the power to block other admins briefly for abuses of the type Mikkalai has engaged in over the last 24 hours. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> 22:59, Feb 13, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I accepted being an admin because there are other admin-only tasks I do like doing, ones which I find a lot more congenial - deleting erroneous redirects, occasionally helping with holding-pen entries on TfD, etc. I have little (and declining all the time) interest in being involved in the behaviour enforcement end of it because no matter what you do, you get grief. Block someone for 24 hours for 3RR, you get grief for being too harsh. Block someone for less, and you get grief for that. You can't win.</dd>
<dd>Admins didn't create the system for dealing with admins who don't use their powers properly. It was created by a combination of the Wikimedia powers-that-be (originally, Jimbo, now the Board of Trustees) and the user community as a whole. If you think it needs an intermediate level (between the informal complaints here, and a full RFC/RFAr), the admins don't have the power to add that - that power lies elsewhere. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 01:36, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I realize admins didn't create the system and I should clarify that I wasn't intending to have a go at you with my "why do you want to be an admin then" question. I do think the power should be created for admins briefly to block other admins for examples of a clear abuse of power; and to extend that block if they unblock themselves, and I'm going to find out what would have to be done to get community consensus on that. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> 01:57, Feb 14, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

And the idea of censoring <b>article titles</b>, i.e., <b>terms</b>, attempted to promote here is uncivilized, nazist, communist, etc. It is against all spirit to forbid neutral articles of exsting topics.

<dd>(To Mel) <i>Helen Keller</i>: the page was judged by content. The article was a mere list of jokes, with no encyclopedic content.

<p>I, again, urge Mikkalai to tone down the heated rhetoric and avoid biting the newcomers, at least, generically, as a group. It is ironic that I agree with his position as for the need to have JE reinstated (I actually provided more scholarly references than eny other editor as to its notability: references are located <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:SlimVirgin/archive5#Jewish_ethnocentrism" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:SlimVirgin/archive5#Jewish_ethnocentrism" rel="nofollow">here</a> – I merely take issue over his methods). Now, Dbachmann has already made it clear his mild contempt for newcomers' involvement in this noticeboard, which I have taken him to task over, and I wish to prevent a reoccurance of such insinuations from other admins. If Mikkalai feels he was treated unfairly by not being informed of the discussion here, that's fine; but, I challenge that the heated rhetoric and personal comments are not appropriate. Of course, to many (but far from all) I am largely wasting my words here as I lack the sufficient status along the Wikipedia hierarchy, nonetheless, I still have the opportunity to make comments here (though possibly not for long), so I wish to make the most of it for the benefit of the community. Thanks for taking the time to read my comment, I do see issues, but I am still confident that goodfaith resolution can prevail. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 03:48, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>So, SlimVirgin has taken at face value that this is the page to complain about abuse of power by an administrator, and presumably to enlist the administrators to apply moral pressure on a colleague, without having to go through the RfAr process. I notice that people have dodged the issue of Mikkalai's behaviour. Aren't any of the esteemed administrators going to comment on their colleague's behaviour in this instance, or does it seem to the assembled administrators that his behaviour was beyond reproach? --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 01:09, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I believe it was poor judgment on Mikkalai's part, and mentioned it to him on his talk page. We did apply "moral pressure" as you say, and various people undid what he tried to do, and the dust seems to have settled. Now, if you are asking for penalties to applied against Mikkalai, well I don't think admins have the authority to do that. For editing (breaking the 3RR rule for instance), admins can be blocked like any other editor; but for re-creating a page? Official policy is pretty much entirely lacking... it's not a grey area, it's pitch black. So it's really up to SlimVirgin to take it to RfArb if he wants to take it any further.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Or anyone else</b> who wishes could do so. After all you don't need to be an admin to file an RfArb. Once again, various admins did counteract the re-creation of the page, but I don't think we have any policy authority to apply sanctions against Mikkalai (and I personally don't feel this is for me to judge). -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 04:20, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is unfair. I spend much, much more time than Mikkalai trying to prove the notability of the term to voters in that VfD, I do research, I engage in dialogue and try to persuade everyone to vote for redirect, and I fail. And then, here comes User:Mikkalai, and with zero effort, simply turns it into a redirect. What makes him so special that he does not need to go through normal consensus lengths (rhetorical: answer is administrative powers). If only he could approach it this way instead of being so defensive and seeing conspiracies everywhere.

<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia users who engage in re-insertion of original research which originated with Lyndon LaRouche and his movement or engage in edit wars regarding insertion of such material shall be subject to ban upon demonstration to the Arbitration Committee of the offense. <i>Passed with 5 of 6 active arbitrators on 2 August 2004.

<p>There is evidence that <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerschelkrustofsky_0973.html" title="User:Herschelkrustofsky">User:Herschelkrustofsky</a> (HK) has re-inserted verbatim text LaRouche into two unrelated articles since August. In both of those cases HK attacked the other editor, <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">user:Adam Carr</a> (AC), for removing the material.</p>
<p>This is in addition to numerous initial insertions of LaRouche theories, links, and verbatim text into unrelated articles since August that HK has not re-inserted when they have been deleted. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Lyndon_LaRouche_Part_Deux/Evidence#Evidence_presented_by_Willmcw" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Lyndon_LaRouche_Part_Deux/Evidence#Evidence_presented_by_Willmcw" rel="nofollow">[10]</a></p>

<p>I'd like to think that Willmcw is doing me a favor here, by demonstrating the somewhat obsessive nature of the Jihad being waged by the anti-LaRouche faction. The two items being contested in the King O'Malley article are a reference to the fact that O'Malley campaigned to elect James Garfield as President of the U.S., and a direct quote from O'Malley. These are presented as evidence of a vast conspiracy to insert LaRouche POV. This is probably Adam Carr's contention as well, although he has never taken the trouble to explain his deletion of this material. --<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerschelkrustofsky_0973.html" title="User:Herschelkrustofsky">HK</a> 15:49, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, HK, this is not about whether O'Malley campaigned for Garfield. This is about whether you've been violating the August 2004 prohibtion on edit wars over LaRouche material. You reproduced a purported O'Malley quote from an article in the Executive Information Review, including ellisions, with no reference as to the source, which appears to be an effort to hide the source. You copied other material as well, including O'Malley's supposed interest in the American System, some of which you paraphrased and some copied verbatim. And most importantly, when another editor removed it, you reinserted it again and again. Regarding O'Malley and Garfield, Google finds only two webpages that have both names in them - both are LaRouche sites. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22king+o%27malley%22+%22james+garfield%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22king+o%27malley%22+%22james+garfield%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=" rel="nofollow">Google search</a> Can you provide us with the non-LaRouche reference that you used to support your quotes and your Garfield factoid and if you can, why haven't you cited that material before? -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 19:17, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I tagged User:Anthony DiPierro/Shawn Mikula as a CSD, but I'd rather not delete it myself because I already banned Anthony for 24 hours for creating it as per his standing order. So I thought I'd peg it here and let someone else decide on it. Basically, the article was deleted. Anthony listed it as a history only undelete, insisting that no vote was necessary. This was inaccurate, and I removed it for that reason. (The article was deleted, but then created blank and protected to guard against recreation vandalism) He relisted. I removed and gave him a 24 hour troll ban. This went around a few more times before Dpbsmith was snookered into giving him the content. He then recreated the page in his userspace.

Use of it outside of dealing with vandalism is an abuse of that function, and also implicitely fails to fulfill the policy which states "<i><a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_revert_a_page_to_an_earlier_version_2f85.html#Admin-only_.22rollback.22_link" title="Wikipedia:How to revert a page to an earlier version">Always explain your reverts</a></i>". -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 04:42, 2005 Feb 15 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It may be inappropriate but it is pretty common. The line between extream/ultraminority pov and vanderlism is rather subjective so as long as an admin doesn't go over the top with it I don't care (heck even without rollback I can revert a page in under 10 seconds).<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 11:55, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The line is not that subjective - <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">vandalism</a> is pretty well defined. In this case, it is apparent that Chris73 reverted via normal means the first few times, and then resorted to using his rollback ability to push his version though. This all may be common, but it is highly harmful and should be discouraged actively. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 16:26, 2005 Feb 15 (UTC)</dd>

Chris 73 broke the 3rr per article, (mistake or not, everyone - after breaking the 3rr can say - "ups sorry it was only a mistake..") he should be banned.

<dd>I am very aware of this of course. However the mistaken revert was undone within a minute. Bluntly no harm no foul. It takes me ~10 minutes to cheack out a 3RR report in full if you can correct your error in that time then I'm not going to block you (obviously if you have reverted 5 times there is zilch you can do). I admit that getting into a situation where this could happen is worrying. Looking at the edit history I suggest an RFC or mediation.<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 14:05, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Good grief. How about a little common sense. There was no harm done. It was an accident. The technical transgression was recognized by the person who did the revert and then self-reported. There's no need to block for this. As for using rollback for something that is not vandalism--that can be pursued through an RFC, but it is a separate matter from the 3RR. Sheesh, people seem to be more interested in the uniform application of an arbitrary (blunt force) rule than in common decency, dialog, building networks of trust, etc., etc. This page (Szczecin) is a candidate for protection (yet again) -- there doesn't appear to be any dialog going on at all among the participants in this edit war. <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a><font color="blue"><b>≠</b></font><a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 17:27, Feb 15, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with you that the uniform application of the rule it unwise, but historically any attempt to apply it with discretion has met with extensive complaints (see, e.g. <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive1_8d95.html#Critique_of_Finno-Ugric_and_Uralic_language_groups_3RR_violation" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive1">this incident</a>). So it's no wonder that admins who do enforcement (I won't, any more, because I've have had it with taking grief from kibitzers) fall back on applying the rule in a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Procrustean.html" title="Procrustean">Procrustean</a> fashion.</dd>
<dd>As to not using roll-back except for true vandalism, I <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia_talk%7EAdministrators_5728.html#Reverting" title="Wikipedia talk:Administrators">originally</a> took the position that it didn't provide any end result that wasn't available to non-admins, so what was the problem? However, I have since changed my mind, and feel that the minimal extra work (a couple of extra clicks) makes it worth it simply to avoid the appearance of power abuse. I keep meaning to bring this up on <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a>, but I'm waiting until we have a quiet period (hah). <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 15:35, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> says anywhere that a user <i>must</i> be blocked for breaking the rule. My impression is that in practise it is nearly always exercised with great discretion; I've seen so many exchanges on user talk pages where someone has reminded someone else of the rule, and the user has simply said thanks and promised to watch his reverts in future. Nothing more comes of it, though sometimes it does. The threat of blocking hanging over edit warriors sometimes has a good effect, making them reform their editing behavior, but sometimes it leads to gaming the system--a practise which if kept up leads quite surely to arbitration. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 16:29, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Regrettably, I agree that she has gone too far. She has made it quite clear on the RfAr page that she does not have any respect for the Wikimedia Foundation, Jimbo, the arbitrators or the Wikipedia community generally. No-one is forcing her to edit this site, and if she does not like how it is run, she should go: I'm sure a hard ban would have wide support amongst the Wikipedia community, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 12:44, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree that she should be hard banned. I also will unblock any block put up against her while she is before the arbcom, because she has every right to defend herself.

<p>You should all be aware that I have blocked <a href="../../../n/s/m/User%7ENSM88_7f4e.html" title="User:NSM88">User:NSM88</a> for being a Nazi and having a picture of himself wearing a Nazi armband addressing a meeting.

If someone would like to desysop me for it, then please, by all means go ahead. In this case, I'm going to stand by my principles and oppose this user.

<p>His behaviour <i>after</i> being blocked is quite instructive. He appears to be very familier with wikiprocesses, he talks about our policies, he found vandalism in progress very quickly etc. In fact if you look at his editing behaviour as a whole it becomes crystal clear that this is not a new user, probably not actually a nazi and is in fact merely someone trolling.

<p>When there is a known campaign of vandalism and trolling against Wikipedia, which there is right now from Stormfront, when someone shows up with an offensive picture and a username that includes "Heil Hitler" (the 88), and/or when someone generally makes it clear that they're at Wikipedia to be a Nazi, I do not think a block is unwarranted. Even if they have good intentions, which seems a remote but existant possibility that we need to allow, the combination of factors will not allow that particular editor to edit effectively. They will not be able to edit without the perception of being a troll and a vandal. In essence, this amounts to a special case of offensive user names. We don't ban the person - we ban the account. In this case, the block applies to a username that says "Heil Hitler" and a profile that displays a wealth of offensive images. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 15:58, Feb 15, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Where a username is banned, I think it's good to invite the user to participate in a more appropriate manner (that is, we make it plain that we're not banning the person). Although this was a pretty clear troll, I think this should also probably be done in this case. Someone who trolls occasionally may yet be capable of contributing good edits. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 16:06, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think it is necessary to wait for this person to do an unacceptable POV edit to block him. Posting a picture of yourself in a Nazi uniform on the Wikipedia (even if it was on a User page) is an unacceptable edit of the Wikipedia. The picture announces, "I'm a troll", and "I don't care about your community norms", and "I am up to no good." It is a challenge. Time spent by admins and other editors following the guy around to make sure that he doesn't do any harm is time that might have been used on something useful. Block him. On the remote chance that he was well-intentioned, he will be back with a different user-name. He will probably be back anyway. We have to start acting a lot less like dupes when it comes to trolls. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 19:10, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am an african american and half jewish, and even I feel that this banning was way out of line. I've had my fair share of racism, and such actions are no different than those who called me a "n*gger" and "f*ggot." Banning a user for having a political opinion is no different than the time I was violently turned away from the voting booths because of the color of my skin. When you censor anyone for having an opinion or having beliefs that don't synergize with your own you are essentially becoming the bigot, not them. I am disgusted at such behavior and I wish that the administration can correct such corruption. --Iconoclast 23:51, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hear, hear! Intellectual honesty and full access to info is why I'm here on the wiki in the first place. We have many communists and anarchists and homosexuals and who knows what all that might offend someone or be considered disruptive by being themselves. When you ban somebody for being a nazi, your worse than they are. At least their making the gesture of wanting to become a part of our community, assumably to take part in learning and sharing knowledge. Your exclusion of them based on their politics and attire is repugnant and anti-wiki. I don't want gay users banned, I don't want communist users banned, and I don't want nazi-users banned. Lead by example, rather than stooping to the level of those you dislike. Prove them wrong with citations and logic, rather than proving them right by living up to their worst expectations. If you think their bad, be <b>better</b> than they are, not worse.

It seems they cannot grasp the situation in an ordered sequence and can only see the original reasoning as being the very last reasoning. The room seems to be full of people commiting ad-hominem attacks and mockery instead of any real discussion. It's pathetic. --Iconoclast 01:43, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

People with strong political opinions <i>are</i> not only tolerated, the are welcomed. No one will ever sucsessfully be hounded out because of thier beliefs or opinions.

<p>Greetings. In an effort to expand the Wikipedia, I began an entry for <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Kraft_b07f.html" title="Robert Kraft">Robert Kraft</a>. I cut and pasted a great deal of information from a site at the New England Revolution, which he owns, and on which the copyright notice prohibits use for commercial purposes only. As the Wikipedia is not commercial, I didn't think it was a big deal. Within seconds, the page had been flagged for copyright infringement. Obviously, this was done with a bot and there has never been a human review of this issue. Regardless, I've gone ahead and begun a stub at Robert Kraft/Temp. Could this stub please be moved to replace the ugly copyright infringement page? Thanks. Daniel Winter 17:22, 15 Feb 2005</p>

<dd>The only thing we could do would be to protect that page. But that would mean that non admins couldn't change the contents. There are many legit reasons for changing the content of recent changes- updating the requested articles as they get created, adding messages to inform people of wikimeets, important votes and so on. Protecting the page is overkill. The page is looked at very frequently, vandalism is reverted in less than a minute usually. Reverting and blocking the vandals seems to work pretty well. It's not 100% perfect but it's better than protecting the page IMO. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">(The snott rake)</a> 19:19, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm generally not an advocate of protecting pages, but the incident today demonstrates the damage that vandalism can cause. Recent Changes is not a page where you'd expect to see an objectionable image (or any image at all). As you said, Recent Changes is looked at very frequently. Thus, it is a target for vandals. Until today, I didn't realize that the page <i>wasn't</i> protected. Since admins are essentially janitors, shouldn't they be in charge of tasks such as maintaining Recent Changes? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarrp_dc22.html" title="User:Carrp">Carrp</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarrp_aa18.html" title="User talk:Carrp">Talk</a> 19:27, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I blocked <a href="../../../x/e/d/User%7EXed_07b7.html" title="User:Xed">user:Xed</a> for a single nasty remark. Now I'm thinking this may not actually be <b>allowed</b> under current Wikipedia policy.

<dl>
<dd>In this case, it's especially difficult, as I think it's fair to say that Xed has often been at the center of turmoil (and unpleasantness, on occasion). I would agree, though, that an unblock is a wise idea -- as much as I admire Slrubenstein, I think his remark about Xed's mind is itself a less confrontational personal attack (or at least a remark that he knew would incite Xed). Had Xed made the remark he did in response to, say, Slr editing an article in a way Xed didn't like, I think the block more justifiable, but since the attack was more retaliatory, I might simply warn both sternly and leave it at that. More fireworks from either side, and I'd say both need a little cooling off.

I <i>suspect</i> that egregious and repeated personal attacks would get a block that wouldn't be reversed by someone else - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 22:31, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Since he was responding to an insult, I don't see how a block could be justified. And as an aside in response to JW, I doubt blocks ever actually cool anybody off. I think they fuel flames. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 22:25, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In my experience the opposite happens - 24 hr blocks for gross personal attacks, particularly in edit summaries, do <i>wonders</i> to moderate some editors' conduct. I'm very annoyed the policy wasn't considered sharp enough to be ratified - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 22:31, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, they may improve outward conduct through fear, but they deepen animosity. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 22:33, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>You make a perceptive comment, Everyking. On the other hand, it could be argued that the rule of law does little to limit criminals' thoughts and desires, even though it may keep them from actually stealing/assaulting/cheating/etc. out of fear of being punished. This is not the fault of the rule of law, nor is it a wise reason to choose not to convict a criminal ("well, even if they get locked up and decide not to shoplift anymore, they'll be real unpleasant to me and all shopkeepers from now on..."). Personal attacks at Wikipedia, in that they are poisonous to community development, are essentially violations of the rule of law here. If we do not block the most egregious offenders, others will make similar attacks, and the discourse will degenerate into....well, just about every other bulletin board/chatroom/discussion area on the Web. That's my perspective. <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 22:42, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The vote, at 2/3, was a non-trivial amount of support, however, and other things (Notably the no personal attacks policy itself) do suggest to me that sometimes a personal attack block is warranted. This seems to me a case of this. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 22:35, Feb 15, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>In response to David Gerard - With Xed I'm afraid the opposite is true. Due to a mistake I blocked him some time ago for a 3rr violation, when in fact he he had not violated it explicitly. I apologized for my error, though other admins might still have blocked him for violating the rule in spirit. He nursed a grudge against me and "left" Wikipedia for a while in protest of my unfair block, so don't be surprised if he does so again, and if he returns shortly thereafter. — <a href="../../../r/d/s/User%7ERdsmith4_389f.html" title="User:Rdsmith4">Dan</a> | <a href="../../../r/d/s/User_talk%7ERdsmith4_959f.html" title="User talk:Rdsmith4">Talk</a> 22:44, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Neutrality blocked me recently for two or three days for a 3rr violation, which l hadn't violated. I didn't cause a scene at the time partly because I didn't have the energy, but also because I very little faith in Wikipedias rules and regulations. The admin driven processes seem not only corrupt, but also beyond reform. Once I realised this, these things tend to bother me less. - <a href="../../../x/e/d/User%7EXed_07b7.html" title="User:Xed"><small>XED</small></a>.<a href="../../../x/e/d/User_talk%7EXed_4a5e.html" title="User talk:Xed"><small>talk</small></a> 23:35, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wisdom trumps policy to my mind. Xed is, frankly, a continual cycle of aggravation. It was a personal attack. Xed has a history of causing problems. Calling him on that is reasonable. Keep the block up. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 22:35, Feb 15, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Blankfaze unblocked Xed's user name, moments later I unblocked his IP and told him so via private e-mail. *sigh* Live and learn. <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">-- Uncle Ed</a> <a href="../../../e/d/_/User_talk%7EEd_Poor_6f26.html" title="User talk:Ed Poor">(talk)</a> 22:38, Feb 15, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I want to thank Ed and others for responding to Xed's comments on my talk page. I admit that I started the exchange by saying he has "a small and petty mind," although I do think that his response "Fuck off you little shit" was disproportionate. In any event, I didn't think it was worth bringing up here. However, I just got a personal e-mail from him which might call for some action; I forwarded it to the listserve. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 22:51, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Anyone capable of making both humorous (mirth-provoking) and insulting (anger-provoking) remarks, can learn to get along with others - if they're willing to make the effort. My communication skills have improved vastly in the last three years, thanks to my involvement with Wikipedia. Our project is really a combination of a Product (the articles) and a Process (the art of working together). I'll do whatever it takes to improve either of these. I appreciate everyone's guidance. <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">-- Uncle Ed</a> <a href="../../../e/d/_/User_talk%7EEd_Poor_6f26.html" title="User talk:Ed Poor">(talk)</a> 14:37, Feb 16, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
