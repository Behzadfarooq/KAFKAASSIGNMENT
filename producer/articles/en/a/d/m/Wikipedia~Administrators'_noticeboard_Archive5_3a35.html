<p>I just voted on User:Linuxbeak's RfA. I hd a comment to make:</p>
<p><b>Comment: On principle, I will refuse to vote on any more RfAs until a formal study has been conducted between the correlation of the people hanging out in IRC://Freenode.net/#wikipedia and the people RfA'd in the past 12 months.</b></p>
<p>This is an official request for a study to determine how many regulars in #wikipedia have been RfA'd in the pas 12 months. My hypothesis (which can be either true or false0 is that there's a number of popele who get rfa'd mostly because they are regulars in #wikipedia, and not based on their meritocrasy status, as a free software project should be.</p>

<dd>To all: I hang around on the wikipedia channel on <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freenode.html" title="Freenode">Freenode</a> ( irc.freenode.net , channel #wikipedia for those interested in joining) during the 6-8 months since I got a user account. I have noticed that people who hang around the <a href="../../../i/r/c/IRC_b274.html" title="IRC">IRC</a> channel tend to get adminship easier than anybody else. mind you: this is an objection against the process of RfA, not the people, not the channel and not the admins. Free (as in liberty) software projects hold esteem because of the meritocrasy status of the project and not on a who-knows-the-people-that-know-the-people status.

<dd>I don't understand; are you asking for advice on how to conduct the study or are you saying you want someone to conduct a study for you? I don't really know how IRC works. If there are logs, you can go through those; if not, you'll have to spend time there and take notes (and it'd have to be a prospective, not retroactive, study). You'll also have to come up with some criteria for determining who is a regular and who isn't. Also, as this isn't a randomized, controlled study, even if you were to find a correlation it wouldn't imply causation. It could be that people who spend a lot of time on Wikipedia, get to know other contributors, and enjoy working with others are the kinds of people who spend time on IRC and who also make good administrators. — <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledge_Seeker_08dc.html" title="User:Knowledge Seeker">Knowledge Seeker</a> <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">দ</a> 06:26, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I must be fairly unusual in that I do know about the IRC channel, but in the nearly 2 years I've been an admin I've rarely used it - usually only when the 'pedia's fallen over and I want to find out how long it's going to take to come back... oh, and there was the time a few months ago when a user in Belgrade and I kept up a live conversation on that night's <a href="../../../u/e/f/UEFA_Cup_38a7.html" title="UEFA Cup">UEFA Cup</a> matches, which no doubt confused many followers of the odd-shaped ball in the west!&#160;:) -- <a href="../../../a/r/w/User%7EArwel_Parry_70fd.html" title="User:Arwel Parry">Arwel</a> 00:47, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I suppose the easiest thing to do would be to visit <a href="../../../r/e/c/Wikipedia%7ERecently_created_admins_768f.html" title="Wikipedia:Recently created admins">Wikipedia:Recently created admins</a>, make a list of them, and ask all of them on their talk page whether they frequent IRC or not. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 08:29, Jun 1, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>If you have moderate programming skills, and time and a minimum of bandwidth to waste, you could write a script that checks wether newly created admins were on freenode during a set period of time before their promotion. Once you have that basic functionality (you could probably do a lot of cut&amp;paste job, since there is so much IRC scripting code available around), you could easily extend it to count the number of votes and compare it with time spent on IRC, etc. However, that would probably be overkill. As for myself, I had been on the IRC channel a grand total of 20minutes or so before I was made an admin, so I don't think it made a difference. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhils_21fd.html" title="User:Phils">Phil</a><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhils_0f89.html" title="User talk:Phils">s</a></span> 09:12, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I've visited wikipedia on IRC only 3 or 4 times since becoming an admin, so I'd also be on the list of the ignorant. Anyway, don't most IRC-names not correspond to wikipedia usernames? I can remember asking people who they were on wikipedia, because I didn't recognize their names. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 22:37, Jun 1, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm on IRC somewhat regularly, generally for short periods of time, but almost entirely after I became an admin (last October). <a href="http://fennec.homedns.org/stats/wikipedia.html" class="external text" title="http://fennec.homedns.org/stats/wikipedia.html" rel="nofollow">This</a> will give you some idea of the most active IRC-ers. — <a href="../../../r/d/s/User%7ERdsmith4_389f.html" title="User:Rdsmith4">Dan</a> | <a href="../../../r/d/s/User_talk%7ERdsmith4_959f.html" title="User talk:Rdsmith4">Talk</a> 03:27, Jun 3, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm sure there's correlation between IRC regulars and people who become admins, but it's not a terribly big deal. People vote for people they know and trust, and IRC is one place where you might get to know and trust someone. As for me, I've been an admin for well over a year, and have never used IRC. <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsomorphic_e88d.html" title="User:Isomorphic">Isomorphic</a> 03:55, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"People vote for people they know and trust". I don't vote for people whose names I don't recognise. As they and I are active in different places, I have no idea whether or not they would make a good admin or not. For example I viewed the <a href="../../../s/a/w/Saw.html" title="Saw">Saw</a> article for the first time yesterday, and in the entire history the only name that I've seen anywhere on Wikipedia before is <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">RickK</a> whose only contribution was a disambig link to <a href="../../../s/a/w/Saw_%28movie%29.html" title="Saw (movie)">Saw (movie)</a> which he presumably worked on. Whether any of the other editors there would make good admins I wouldn't have a clue. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 08:39, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>How can you tell the difference between a page protected against editing and a page protected against page moves only? The clues of "view source" versus "edit this page" and the disappearance of the move button don't appear on the admin interface, and the logs don't help either. (In particular, <a href="../../../t/f/d/WP%7ETFD_eab7.html" title="WP:TFD">WP:TFD</a> seems to be protected against page moves only, but I only know it because the log says the protection is old and I've seen it being edited recently.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Good point. I don't think there is one yet for admins. The separation of protection between the article itself and just moving it is fairly new I think. (I don't do a lot of page protections). Your option now is to log out, and if the move option is not there, but non admins can still edit the article, then it is only protected from page moves.&#160;:) You are correct, that is the case with TFD for ex. The protection from moves only is a good idea though, and I'd think a large amount of pages in the Wikipedia space such as FAC, etc. should have that. There is no reason to move those. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 14:15, Jun 3, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think a "protected against page moves" note at the top of pages so protected would be a good idea. Do others think it worth a feature request or not? <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 11:52, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes certainly, non admins can tell if a page is protected from moves, we should be able to also. But it wouldn't need to be that much of a note. Even a simple (p) next to the move tab would be enough to let you know it was protected from moves. So the move tab would appear as <i>move (p)</i> instead. The same could be done for editing, to make it really clear what is protected and what is not. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 15:21, Jun 6, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The point is that someone could sign half way up the page, and you wouldn't notice it had added you there instead of them if you were editing towards the base of the article. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 22:31, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Since I'm still not perfectly sure how you're doing this, it would be greatly appreciated if you <a href="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org" class="external text" title="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org" rel="nofollow">filed a bug report</a> or provided the link here if you've already done so. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 22:35, 2005 Jun 4 (UTC)</p>
<p>Basically, just set your signature (via preferences) to four tildes. That simple. When you save the page, it replaces the three/four tildes you add with the four tildes from your signature, so the next user will be signing instead. I am extremely surprised no-one thought of this before. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">-Ril-</a> (<a href="../../../-/r/i/User_talk%7E-Ril-_f6e9.html" title="User talk:-Ril-">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_-Ril-_199a.html" title="Special:Contributions/-Ril-">contribs</a>) 22:48, 4 Jun 2005.</small>.

<dd>Yes, but then again you could also just fake the other user's signature. Both will show up as forgeries if you diff a single version.

<dd>Actually, if you do the diffs, it is, for example, Smoddy, who is marked as having signed the relevant sections above, even though it was me, utilising the bug, and Smoddy signed elsewhere.

<dd>I agree I have a tough time with that concept. I don't consider it a simple thing. A person can be disruptive, but there are varying degrees of it, and moreover one might have some good work to one's credit which outweighs it. For example, Calton's frequent snide and insulting comments on various matters could be considered disruptive, but I don't think that alone is sufficient to ban him. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 22:15, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Exactly. Snarkiness and smartassedness per se are not disruption -- they are, rather, annoyance. Disruption is when snarkiness and smartassedness (not to mention malice) pour over into the mainspace. It's pretty easy for most people to make the distinction. Those people that can't learn the distinction or refuse to make the distinction are the ones that are made officially unwelcome. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 03:05, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<p>Hi all; please be on the lookout for changes in the wikipedia sandbox. We've got a bunch of spammers advertising this site called "matchstickcats.com".

<p>Hey, I own newsburp.com (formerly matchstickcats.com) and I've just found this page accidentally through google. It appears you people, whoever you are, have been talking about me here for some time and alleging that I or someone associated with my site is a "spammer". If I had seen this before I might have been in a postition to contribute to this debate and defend myself against these outgrageous and mis-informed accusations, which you have made in public and without my knowledge. However it appears to be too late as your comments have been up here since June of last year, and any damage you have done to my reputation is presumabely now irreversible, despite the full story not having been told. In future if there is some issue about me or my site that arises, kindly do me the courtesy of lettimg me know, rather than letting me come accross it accidentally on a search engine seven months later.

<dd>I've been seeing this error message on and off with all sorts of operations: edits, histories, what-links, etc. I had a case a couple of days ago with an undelete operation - I just couldn't get it to go through, even though I kept trying. It's definitely load-related (i.e. happens more when the system is loaded), but it seems to occur even at times of low load (e.g. I saw it at 3AM East Coast time). It's strange, because it seems like operations either finish quickly, or take forever and timeout, and they are intermixed like that - a failure is followed right away by an instant success. Which makes it seem like what's happening is the Apaches are losing the request, or perhaps the Squids are sending the request to an Apache which is hung, or busy, or something. We should try and get a better characterization of the symptoms, and let the developers know.

<dd>I think part of the issue is there is a 25 step process for closing a VFD. If it weren't so work intensive, it might not get so backlogged.

<p>I've run over the deletion process with a weedwhacker. I did away with the redundant archiving of the day logs, which are by far the least easily searched VfD archives, in favor of keeping the deletion pages themselves and the standard posting to talk pages. This let me do away with the templates. The result is a six step process with no substeps. Much less instructionally creepy. I look forward to being reverted for undoing a bunch of changes that were made without gathering consensus prior to gathering consensus. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 01:40, Jun 18, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good work, this brings the system back to more like it was a year ago. I'm not sure how it happened, but in the same period that VfD tripled in size we also tripled the amount of work it took to deal with each vote. All we seem to have lost in your changes are the not very useful daily log pages. Something I would also like to see is going back to the old system of moving the votes directly to the talk page. It was impossible to do this and to keep the log pages, but now that the log pages are gone we are free to go back to the old system. Moving the templates would eliminate the linking to the closed debate, which is one of the more time consuming parts of the processes. Returning the closed votes to a more prominent position on the talk page is also a good idea as editors should generally read through them before working on the article. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 02:16, Jun 18, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Years ago, I was on holiday in the UK, and we rented a car and drove on the divided highway from London to Dover. Near Dover, where the cross-channel ferry docked and let off European drivers who were used to driving on the right instead of the left, we passed several highway signs facing the other direction. The reversed signs, it turned out, warned drivers -- in 4 languages -- that they were driving in the wrong direction and should immediately turn around. The furthest out, as I recall, was at least <i>ten miles</i> away from Dover. I don't see why Wikipedia can't be at least as cautious as the Ministry of Transport. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 03:59, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Raul, could I ask what rule you are referring to? You should be aware that we don't currently have a blocking rule that immediately blocks personal attacks, nor should we. People must get a warning. However, on certain controversial articles, such as <a href="../../../j/i/h/Jihad.html" title="Jihad">Jihad</a>, there are editors who create sock puppets and edit anonymously - all done on purpose. They target these articles and therefore I feel that a specific warning should be added to the article that we won't accept personal attacks in the article. This would be the warning that editors are given, and will mean that they have no excuse for making personal attacks - excuses like "But you never warned me!". - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 02:13, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Can't we just ignore them? Remove the attacks if you want and just move on. What purpose does it serve to block users and then have them abuse you? What is likely to happen is that someone says something to an admin that they don't like, they call in a buddy, and the person who disagrees with them is blocked. Meanwhile, the admins will have absolute impunity, because no one will block them, and in those cases that they do, they will have others who unblock them for some reason or other. There are damned good reasons for not making "personal attacks" a blockable offence. We are all surely aware of them. Ultimately, why don't you just leave <a href="../../../j/i/h/Jihad.html" title="Jihad">Jihad</a> alone, Ta bu? Do you know anything about it? Do you actually have anything to add? Given your POV on religion, which you've often expressed, you'd probably be better advised not to work on that article anyway. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 02:22, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've removed the "should not be construed..." as I feel it is superfluous, since I can't see any honest editor imagining the policies only apply to controversial issues and I can't see the dishonest ones being deterred by it. Also, I'm not sure about the virtue of saying notices will appear at WP:AN. Seems to me that you put it on the user's talk page and potentially the talk page for the subject in the dispute and after that the user wouldn't care where else you put it. Most of the other edits reflect my desire to frame this as a more general admonition towards good behavior. Obviously, changes to the blocking policy would still be needed to address things in the way Tu bu shi da yu intends. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 03:41, Jun 18, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>We seem to have a lot of nationalist edit wars over placenames. I'm sure not many people will have forgotten the <a href="../../../g/d/a/Gdansk.html" title="Gdansk">Gdansk</a>/<a href="../../../d/a/n/Danzig.html" title="Danzig">Danzig</a> fiasco. A similar row is going on at <a href="../../../m/a/c/Talk%7EMacedonian_Slavs_b999.html" title="Talk:Macedonian Slavs">Talk:Macedonian Slavs</a> (Greeks and ex-Yugoslavs fighting over names, again). I'm sure we'll have similar arguments about other disputed names in future.</p>
<p>I believe that what we need is a consistent approach to dealing with such issues. I've put together a proposal at User:ChrisO/Naming disputes which sets out some criteria for resolving naming disputes. These boil down to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The most common use in English of a name takes precedence;</li>
<li>If the common name conflicts with the official name, use the common name <i>except</i> for conflicting scientific and dialect names;</li>
<li>If neither the common name nor the official name is prevalent, use the name (or a translation thereof) that the subject uses to describe itself or themselves.</li>
</ul>
<p>Objective criteria that should be considered are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the name in common usage in English?</li>
<li>Is it the official current name of the subject (official in terms of being used in a legal context, e.g. a constitution?)</li>
<li>Is it the name used by the subject to describe itself or themselves?</li>
<li>If an historic name is mentioned in the article, is it in an accurate context?</li>
</ul>
<p>Subjective criteria that should not be used are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the subject have a moral right to use the name?</li>
<li>Does the subject have a legal right to use the name?</li>
<li>Does the name infringe on someone else's legal or moral rights?</li>
<li>Is the use of the name politically unacceptable?</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, there's more to it than that - notably that really intractable disputes should be resolved by a neutral committee of administrators (not the ArbCom), rather than being put to votes which will just end up being pissing contests between rival partisans.</p>

<p>Okay, seriously, we are really doing something entirely wrong here.

<dd>Having pondered an extended wikibreak over the weekend myself, my interim view is that we (by we I mean the admins and most especially the active ones) are becoming overly legalistic and confrontational and more concerned with process than with product. I think the whole range of admin tools needs to be looked at closely. Specifically, I believe A) that the 3RR rule as currently constituted needs major overhauling to encourage discussion and common sense and discourage calls for banning as the court of first appeal. B) that all substantive discussion of major issues and presentation of "evidence" must happen on Wikipedia and not on IRC and the mailing list. Many of us do not use these fora at all. C) All of us (and I am specifically including myself) need to become much more reflective and much less given to the knee-jerk reaction when dealing with what we see as attacks, either on ourselves or on the project; fighting fire with fire will just burn the whole house down. <a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFiliocht_c3e2.html" title="User:Filiocht">Filiocht</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/l/User_talk%7EFiliocht_11a7.html" title="User talk:Filiocht">Blarneyman</a> 09:10, Jun 22, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Prevention is the best way to address the problem. Make it clear up front that volunteering to work on behalf of the community is just that -- volunteering.

<p>One problem is that admins are increasingly being targeted for attack by various trolls, vandals, and fellow-travellers; that inevitably makes admins more defensive, and that leads to more confrontations. The attacks are usually petty and made in transparently bad faith, but there are enough editors who enjoy piling into such matters (on both sides) that the result drags on, and becomes more and more Byzantine and acrimonious. I've no idea how to deal with that; making it more difficult to criticise admins is clearly not the way to god, but is another layer of bureacracy in the form of some sort of panel that assesses criticisms any better? Perhaps. I've recently been the target of a a number of apparently unconnected attacks, in which I've been accused (vaguely, and with no evidence or even details) of abusing my admin powers. It would be nice to to be able to say: "Go to such-and-such a page, and complain there; they'll decide whether I've any case to answer". At the moment, the only such place is this, and this is just a free for all, which often serves merely to muddy the water as I described above.</p>
<p>Another problem is that Wikipedia is seeing a gradual increase in the number of editors with personal agendas and very narrow interests; that affects us all, admins and non-admins alike, and it can be intensely wearing, but it's even less clear what can be done about that (or even whether anything <i>should</i> be done about it). <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 12:11, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I can think of two solutions to Mel's problem... first, sockchecking. Some new accounts are obviously role accounts, which is ok except if they're abusive. As generally agreed on Wikipedia:Sockpuppet/Proposal, if an account is permablocked it may be worthwhile to check if it happens to be a sock, and if so, to censure the <s>foot</s> owner. The main problem here is that David Gerard and Tim Starling have better things to do.</li>
<li>Second, new users are generally good, but sometimes trouble (e.g. trolling, deliberate vandalism, petty revenge role accounts, etc). While we should be very careful about blocking valuable editors, it may be worthwhile to create some policy that makes it easier and not controversial to permablock a new user, within certain specific limits. I'll think on the entire issue some more though. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 12:23, Jun 22, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>yes, we need access to the IPs. No editor in good faith has reason to hide his IP, and many in bad faith positively refuse to hide their IP. That's absurd. As it is stated on <a href="../../../b/l/o/Template%7EBlocked_proxy_088b.html" title="Template:Blocked proxy">Template:blocked proxy</a>, <i>If you have such a severe personal situation that editing Wikipedia with the level of anonymity provided by an IP number is dangerous to you, then we recommend that you refrain from editing Wikipedia.</i> There. I have no opinion if <i>all</i> editor should be able to view IPs, or only admins. But I insist that your IP is not part of your privacy. You give away your IP to every site you visit, and the site maintainers are under <i>no</i> obligation not to publish their logs (many sites have them public). I think this sockpuppetry circus consumes just too much energy, and we are positively encouraging it by this exaggerated secrecy about contributers' IPs. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 12:40, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Sockchecking is more complicated than IP checking. Presently, a small subsection of admins can do sockchecks. It may be worthwhile to increase that subsection from two users to about five. Giving all admins sockchecking rights is probably more trouble than it's worth. The whole point is - presently it's <i>too easy</i> to create a sock. If we add some levels of security, we will likely have a couple of socks that fall through anyway (as Geni claims). However, it will result in <i>far fewer</i> socks. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 13:00, Jun 22, 2005 (UTC)

<li>yes. I don't think it is a cure-all. I think it is a way to take away some stress, we are at the moment needlessly creating for ourselves. People will leave for overall wikistress, not because of one particular issue. Sockchecks are impossible without the IPs. Yes, you need to include the editing pattern, and the browser string. But that's all information we get. The IP. The browser string. The time. The edit itself. All "sockchecks" will be based on this. But ok, the problem may lie deeper. It's all about making life harder for bad faith editors, easier for good faith editors, without creating bureaucracy or benevolent dictators. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 13:29, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The original post here was to do with what we are doing that is driving away good editors. If you check on the 3 names mentioned, none of them cited socks as a reason, as far as I can see. So why are we suddenly talking about socks? The question is "What are <b>we</b> doing wrong?" "<b>We'</b>re not. It's <b>them</b>." is the wrong answer. Maybe we should do away with user names and have everybody identified by their IP, then we could talk about other things. <a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFiliocht_c3e2.html" title="User:Filiocht">Filiocht</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/l/User_talk%7EFiliocht_11a7.html" title="User talk:Filiocht">Blarneyman</a> 13:16, Jun 22, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>if we want to remain "the encyclopedia anyone can edit", we'll have to put up with people as they come. I.e. there will be jerks, hatemonger, and simply immature, whiny, aggressive, arrogant and reckless editors. As we grow, they become more. Ergo, we cannot afford to put each of them through months of evidence collecting, rfc'ing, arbitrating, appealing, injunctioning and, babysitting them all. We need clear guidelines on how to deal with people who cannot behave, without scaring away people who do, and without draconian measures against perfectly good users who maybe say "you are an idiot" sometimes when they disagree with you. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 13:35, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Volunteer wikipedians are facing a reality that professional journalists have faced for a long time - it's unpleasant to hear loud criticism from strangers about your work - except that it's exaggerated by wiki-editing. This is where wikipedia will either fizzle, because the stress will fatally harm participation, or bloom, because it will develop new ways to cope that were never developed by people who can take solace in a paycheck. The only ideas I have, alas, are to make us more of a traditional, hierarchical, top-down information-processing organization, but I don't think that's the right approach.

<p>I don't know if this is a solution or anything, but I think we should keep in mind what this project is supposed to be. We're supposed to be a free encyclopedia, providing information for people who wish to learn about <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stuff.html" title="Stuff">stuff</a>. The last few days, I've been reading more than editing, and it's giving me some insight as a user rather than a Wikipedian. <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">Jguk</a>'s case, for example, involved the dates changed from BC/AD and BC/BCE. Will the user prefer BC/AD over BC/BCE? Is the primary function of Wikipedia to educate in a responsible manner, or to <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_correctness.html" title="Political correctness">not offend</a> anyone? We need balance, and we certainly need to be correct, but I don't think we need to carry this to extremes such that we detract from the value of the encyclopedia as a whole. For example, <a href="../../../t/e/c/Technical_communication.html" title="Technical communication">technical communicators</a> try to write documentation as they feel the end-user will want to read it (they usually focus on task-based documentation), not as the engineers or product developers want to write it (they usually focus on feature-based documentaion). I guess what I'm trying to say is that we should focus on what the end-user would want to see in an encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 14:56, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>Vide</i> "professional detachment". While sound advice, it doesn't really work as advice, because problems arise exactly when people forget this. They sink not just their pride but their whole ego into the encyclopedia, and whatever is done unto their edits is done unto them. When a group of such people disagree, that's when the trouble really starts. Wiki's open nature is ideal for perfectly mirroring arguments: you edit "me", I edit "you" right back. Now mix in administrators: when I'm an administrator, this also means my judgement is better than yours because the community said so, so you will automatically lose the argument if I keep it up long enough. Unless the community stabs me in the back by disagreeing with me, of course—but that's what we have friends for... Etcetera. Now apply some external heat in the form of a rapidly growing user base and a rapidly improving article base (leaving that much more room for behavior that actually hurts), let it simmer, and behold Wikipedia as it is today.

<dd>I agree entirely with Deathphoenix. The biggest problem I have with Wikipedia is the large number of people who have lost sight of (or were completely unaware to begin with of) the fact that we are here above all else to write an encyclopaedia. Anything that stops us doing this or makes Wikipedia a worse encyclopaedia is inherently bad. We've become both increasingly bureaucratic and increasingly politically correct, and neither of these helps us to be a better encyclopaedia — bureaucracy means that the editors with the most experience and available time spend their time here writing and enforcing rules and debating policy rather than writing articles; and political correctness is not our job to enforce, as we're not here to decide on whether things are offensive or not, merely to reflect common usage (the BC/AD/BCE/CE debate is a prime example of us doing precisely the wrong thing in this regard, with editors openly saying that they want to ignore common usage to promote something they find preferable). I sympathise completely with jguk, and I wish I could plead with him to come back, but I can't. All the faults he points out are true, and he has been so unfairly treated as to justify completely his departure from the project. We don't deserve to have him here. I wish I could tell him it will get better, but it just seems to be getting worse, and unless something serious happens to change the way we do things, all I can see in the future is the departure of yet more dedicated editors who can no longer cope with what Wikipedia has become. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProteus_e939.html" title="User:Proteus">Proteus</a> <a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProteus_c830.html" title="User talk:Proteus">(Talk)</a> 16:34, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I actually started out as just a reader, so I suppose that's why I'm trying to keep the reader in mind. There are some excellent points above. It's okay for people to take pride in their work, but I try to ignore my own contributions and focus on whether someone adds value to an article. I've seem some people change my edits with insulting (or insulted) edit summaries questioning the quality of the article (whether it's my own edits or not). I don't take such things personally because I see my work edited and disparaged all the time. I'm not saying we should just lie down and give in to anyone that comes and changes our work. I'm just saying that we should look at people's edits and see if it adds value to the article from the end-user's point of view. Will the end-user reading both versions of the article think that the current version is better? Can I edit the current version so the end-user will think that the newest version is even better? If I can, I do it.

<dd>I agree with Filiocht that we're becoming too legalistic and too focused on process rather than the end result. That leads to a number of problems, the most painful one is the constant bickering. What people don't reallize is there are ways to diffuse disagreements instead of escalating them. It's easier to escalate them so people do. Focusing on the end result, and what is in the best interests of the project tends to limit the bad feelings, and we need a rebirth of that. The legalistic issue arises because we are a growing (in popularity, traffic, content, etc.) and increasingly high quality site that allows anyone to edit. That is going to attract people who want to do good, and people who don't. So increasingly, in order to be fair, we follow policy down to the wire to make sure we do the right thing in sanctioning users. That's great and we should always do our best, but it also leads to ever increasing policy requirements to try to plug all the loopholes. We are witnessing a legal system growing organically. Maybe we should simplify the ban policy to "if a consensus of administrators thinks you are not editing in good faith you may be banned for a period of time or indefinitely."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For various reasons, people will leave the project, but I'm not sure it's something we should lament too much. Don't get me wrong, we'd of course rather keep every good user, and from a personal standpoint I'd rather they stay, but that's not ever realistic. There will always be editors that for various reasons will move on to other things, and we'll still have the good contributions they made. They can of course always come back, and many do.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So in the end, what are we doing wrong? Lots of things, every day. But as long as we do our best, and keep trying to further the aims of Wikipedia, we'll be ok, and we'll probably end up somewhere remarkable. In the end, that's more important than any one of us, so we should worry as much about the small things now. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 19:50, Jun 22, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Two comments on the subject: 1) Wikipedia should be content-centered, not people centered. If you look at the contribution history of the people who get "burnt-out" and leave, their own attitude is often a big part of the problem. They take things too seriously, and get involved into huge personal disputes and discussions instead of staying cool and focusing on content. It's always sad to lose an excellent contributor, but as Taxman said, the project comes first. This is not about the people, or else we would all get credit at the end of each article; it's about the grand project of making knowledge available to all. Like in any projects, some people can't take the pressure and the criticism; people come, go, come back again, and leave again; that flow isn't necessarily bad, because wikibreaks allow contributors to lay back and think about how they relate to the project, and work even better when they come back. 2) Clique behavior, and side-channel discussions (IRC, etc...) do a great deal to undermine the community (which could be a great 'side effect' of Wikipedia) and the working behavior. This is why I am in favor of rotating privileged positions, <b>while still maintaining authoritative bodies like ArbCom for non-content disputes only</b>. These bodies are the only way to avoid clique-driven lynch mobs, and large groups of users cracking down on single users for sometimes harmless mistakes. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhils_21fd.html" title="User:Phils">Phil</a><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhils_0f89.html" title="User talk:Phils">s</a></span> 20:03, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Destroy cliques by rotating adminship among editors with 1000+ edits. Give rollback to all editors with 1000+ edits. Rotate members of a deletion panel and get rid of VfD. Discourage "sockhunting". It doesn't matter who is who's sockpuppet: it's what they do that counts. Ignore trolls. Revert vandals. Encourage real welcomes for newcomers, even if they are going wrong. Make the 3RR a 1RR, and tighten up the definition so that abusers cannot say "that wasn't a revert". Make arbcom proceedings less formal, less legalistic and keep them out of content altogether. Make it absolutely clear to admins that they can block for vandalism and breaking the 1RR but not for any other reason that does not have arbcom sanction. Make a personal attack parole a condition of anonymity.

<dd>Rotating adminship is a novel idea that will probably not overcome the social inertia, but I like it. It's an attractive solution. Alternatively, since MediaWiki 1.5 will allow assigning user rights more discriminatorily than just "here's the mop, the bucket, and the double-barreled shotgun", we can make everyone with 1000+ edits an admin. Just like that. Whoever is found to abuse any specific administrative power gets it stripped.</dd>
<dd>Making the 3RR a 1RR, now that I really don't know about. I abide by the 1RR voluntarily, but is it going to help making it a formal rule? <i>Especially</i> if you're going the route of "tighten up the definition". Forget it. The tighter the definition, the easier it is to game it. But the looser it is, the less appropriate shooting people for two reverts becomes. The current 3RR implementation is a circus, but a workable one. We can't <i>force</i> anyone to act sensibly and discuss instead of reverting; the 3RR is just there to prevent them from continuing the state of war indefinitely, which is harmful to the article(s) involved.</dd>
<dd>Keeping the ArbCom out of content? Some problems really will fester forever if you do that. Some things never resolve through discussion. If admins can't block for persistent POV pushing and being an all-round jerk, and the ArbCom can no longer pass judgement on content, what's the recourse? Accept that Wikipedia is screwed where a particular article is concerned?</dd>
<dd><i>Encourage editors to edit, create content, instead of politicking.</i> Yes, this is the heart of the matter, isn't it? It's when people start to disagree over what content should be created how that the politicking starts. You can try to minimize politicking, but it will never go away, because being bold cannot solve everything.

<dd>By tighten up the definition, I simply mean to define <i>more things</i> as reverts, rather than fewer as you have inferred. We all know what one is and yet the rules lawyer will say "that first one wasn't a revert because I didn't click on a previous version and save it" or some such. I think the notion that it's okay to revert up to a point is what's problematic in that particular area. A concept that was something like "have your say but don't keep pushing the point" might be better.</dd>
<dd>The ArbCom are quite happy to decide who the jerks are and at least they have a process. I'm not so keen on someone who five people okayed three years ago deciding for themselves who ought to be banned. If adminship were rotated, so that there were no permanent powerholders, I think it would be much more reasonable for them to have broader powers, or as you suggest, if all 1000+ editors were made admins and deadminning became less of a big deal. Most blocking of dickheads isn't all that controversial anyway -- it tends to be cases where those involved are all working on the same article that cause heatedness.</dd>
<dd>The ArbCom should definitely not decide issues of content. That's what the wiki is <b>for</b>. It's behaviour that is generally the problem. Where they <i>have</i> involved themselves in content, they've tended to be partisan, and that's caused more ill-feeling than it's prevented.<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 04:21, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>While your observation is correct, I'm afraid it's not a very practical remedy to state that there wouldn't be any problem if people didn't take things so seriously.

People aren't going to change their behavior en masse. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 11:57, Jun 24, 2005 (UTC)

<p>Why do I contribute to Wikipedia? Because I have information that I want others to see. Why else would I write about a topic like <a href="../../../b/t/r/Btrieve.html" title="Btrieve">Btrieve</a> or <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_Unix_Printing_System_4dba.html" title="Common Unix Printing System">Common Unix Printing System</a>? Because I wanted others to know about these topics, from a source that is as neutral and as factual as possible. This site gives me the chance to inform others. I have a friend, for instance, who found the CUPS article very useful. This is what drives me on: that someone, somewhere, will find the information in Wikipedia <i>useful</i> and give them an understanding of a topic I know something about! Why do you think I keep asking for sources in articles like Zoroastrianism? It's because I want the quality of the article to improve, to address any potential issues with neutrality and factuality and to improve the comprehensiveness of the article. Many see me as trying to push a POV: I see myself asking for better information so that people gain greater understanding of a topic. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 04:24, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>It appears to me that the general level of user-to-user interaction is becoming increasingly confrontational. This goes hand-in-hand with a growing suspicion of new users and a willingness to ignore the "Don't bite the newbie" principle. This may well stem from bitter experience of encountering disruptive newbies, but also seems to contain at least an element of possessibeness on the part of more established users like myself. I have no idea what to do about this, other than remind ourselves of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiLove_dbab.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiLove">Wikilove</a> as often as possible, and to be sure to take deep breaths before hitting the keyboard. <a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFiliocht_c3e2.html" title="User:Filiocht">Filiocht</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/l/User_talk%7EFiliocht_11a7.html" title="User talk:Filiocht">Talk</a> 11:40, Jun 24, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think the main point being made here is that we've gotten away from the content–we're building an encyclopedia. We aren't here as a vehicle for social change or advocacy. We aren't here as an experiment in web-democracy, web-anarchy, or even web-aristocracy (sadly). We aren't here to win final victory for someone's pet political persuasion. We're here to build a encyclopedia written in the English language for the benefit of humankind. Our first principle should be this: the content comes first. Our second? Anyone who works against the first principle stands in opposition to the encyclopedia and its aims.</p>
<p>There's a lot of rules-lawyering on this encyclopedia, centered around the points I mentioned above. It's sheer waste. If pages of talk are generated without solving the content problem, then the problem has grown worse. If the problem wasn't content-centric in the first place, then someone is wasting our time and needs to get his or her crap together. Anyone who has to be brought before the Arbitration Committee, after at least one RFC, because of behavioral problems, is taking up the valuable time and energy of dozens of contributors.</p>
<p>The problem, as I see it, is that there exists no simple mechanism for defusing these content debates and allowing editors to get back to work. This shouldn't be a serious problem. When writing for a Neutral Point of View, it should be taken for granted that the view point you write is not your own. Given that, the most important thing for Wikipedia is to establish what the Neutral Point of View is on a given issue so that editors <b>know what that POV is</b> and can write accordingly. This happens hundreds of times everyday, and usually without incident. Those times don't concern us. The problems tend to occur where multiple editors representing divergent points of view collide. The serious problem of <a href="../../../g/d/a/Gdansk.html" title="Gdansk">Gdansk</a> comes to mind. It took months (arguably a year) to settle the matter, and caused much acrimony on all sides. This is not a viable model.</p>
<p>I have a suggestion, however. I confess that it involves more bureaucracy, but the goal is to ultimately reduce the amount of time spent edit-warring. We already have an Arbitration Committee, but its bailiwick specifically excludes content-disputes. I would propose the creation of an Content Committee, or some such, staffed by Wikipedians known for the following traits: educational depth, scrupulous honesty, and commitment to a neutral point of view. If something like Gdansk, or the BC/BCE dispute arose, it could be brought before this committee. Evidence backing each POV would be presented, and an opinion rendered. Barring the development of new information, this opinion would stand. Editors who violated the ruling repeatedly would be warned and then blocked.</p>
<p>This seems harsh, but the alternative, I think, is to wage a losing battle against POV-pushers and revert-warriors. I've watched disputes go back and forth for months, with nothing new being said. These battles are tiring for all involved, and ought to be unnecessary. Once a difficult issue is settled, it should be settled, and settled quickly. That way, we can all get back to writing the encyclopedia. We shouldn't have to waste hours upon hours with people who won't abide by our standards and work with us towards the common goals of the project. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 00:04, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The "neutral point of view"? I suggest you read the policy, which much more clearly understands there to be no such thing. You are suggesting there should be a committee to decide which POV should win! But the NPOV policy, which is fundamental to Wikipedia, says that <b>all</b> POVs must be presented fairly.

<p>The recent discussions here and at AN/I got me thinking about personal attacks. If people sometimes leave our project, then the overall atmosphere is a plausible reason for their departure, and the most obvious poisoning of the atmosphere is childish namecalling and the like. On a related note, we have a huge backlog on <a href="../../../v/i/p/WP%7EVIP_552d.html" title="WP:VIP">WP:VIP</a>. It seems most admins prefer not to work at there. And a plausible reason for that would be retaliation if they block a vandal - again in the form of personal attacks9 e.g. Marmots immature reaction to Linuxbeak on AN/I). This leads to the age-old question, <b>why do we tolerate personal attacks in the first place?</b>.</p>
<p>I believe the answer to that is, simply, because we haven't seen a suitable wording of such a policy yet, that would not lead to abuse (such as calling a mere disagreement an attack, and blocking concurrently). However, it would be in our best benefit to create such. First, I don't believe that any right-thinking person would want personal attacks here. Second, the sheer fact that <i>people get away with it</i> encourages other people to behave similarly. On the contrary, if we had a policy that allowed blocking in such a way that it rarely occured, then still the threat of that policy would discourage people from making personal attacks. Psychology works.</p>
<p>Thus, I'd like to have some people join me in brainstorming on <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_Personal_attacks_ec18.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy/Personal attacks">Wikipedia:Blocking policy/Personal attacks</a>. The first thing that comes to mind would be some sort of warning template that can be sent to the attacker <i>but not by the victim</i>, and if a person has received a number of those <i>for separate occasions and by separate people</i> within a week or so, he can be blocked.</p>

<li>"I didn't know this either, but I've asked User:Brion VIBBER, and he knew the answer. To wit, this is unrelated to SORBS. These entries are created, when one of the developers uses a shell script to block addresses directly from the server (Brion calls this a crude hack). This is done when the developers learn of addresses that are primarily used as proxy by vandals. The addresses are hand-entered; they're not from the SORBS or any other data bank. When a good reason exists, any admin can unblock these addresses. It would probably be good if such blocks would be attributed to a 'pseudo-user', so that there would be a location where this all can be documented.

(Although I can still rollback if I go to the user contributions log.) Anybody else having this problem? I can't figure out if it's related to what Geni mentions above or not. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 28 June 2005 08:54 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I really dislike that it's necessary to choose the expire time from a list. It often made sense to block for 6 or 12 hours and that now seems to be impossible. In fact, there's only one choice (2 hours) that's less than 24 hours. I'd highly recommend allowing admins to specify any expire time, as in the previous version. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 28 June 2005 12:04 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The block length examples are also incorrect: <i>"e.g. "1 hour", "2 days", "next Wednesday", "1 January 2017". "Indefinite" or "infinite" also worked."</i> The only one of those choices that's still available is "infinite". I'm hoping that the previous functionality will return shortly. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 28 June 2005 12:09 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I quite agree with Carbonite on this one. The length of a block should not be fixed by what can be selected in a menu. Many times I think it is appropriate to block for something between 2 and 24 hours. Radiant is also correct that the possibility for short blocks to AOL should be reinstated. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 28 June 2005 12:10 (UTC)

<dd>I also agree, the drop-down list is a complete misfeature. I just had to do a 2 hours range block while half an hour would likely have been sufficient.

<dd>I kinda figure if you're gonna block somebody, you either do it or don't. Anytime I do a vandal block I just set it at 24 hours. Blocking somebody is a pretty serious insult; I don't think of it in increments. The very fact of the block is serious enough and should be restricted to extreme cases. I think if somebody hasn't done something bad enough to warrant 24 hours, they probably don't deserve to be blocked at all. I mean you have special short blocks to accommodate range IPs and that kind of thing, but there's no sense in 3 hour blocks, 5 hours, 9, 13, 18... <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 28 June 2005 12:45 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I often used less than 24 hours when blocking school IPs in the hope of limiting damage to innocent users. Also the AOL IPs should not be blocked for long periods of time at all. But otherwise I agree that 24 hours is the default for someone vandalizing from a private IP at a home computer. Anyway, keep up the good work at RC Patrol! <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 28 June 2005 12:55 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What about dynamic IPs? What if someone with a dynamic IP does something serious enough, but you don't want to block every from AOL or a university for an entire day? The point is that the tools should serve the admins, not restrict them. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 28 June 2005 12:55 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I was thinking that in those cases you wouldn't want to block for more than an hour anyway...most likely the kid will have long since given up by the time the hour's over. Besides, they have classes and things to do, I don't think they can just sit around vandalizing on a school IP for very long. It's not that I can't conceive of cases where there'd be exceptions, it's just that I don't know if it's a big deal and I also figure maybe there was a good reason for making it that way. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 28 June 2005 13:04 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, to their credit things have improved greatly as of today. Personally I don't believe we should have left things editable when the system was so buggy.

<dd>Could have been. I lost track of it after a while. The GNAA will love it if we submit it to VfD again.

<dd>(via edit conflict) Actualy i think it's more like 4 or 5 (maybe?). But yes. I don't think anyone wants to do this again.

<li>Yeah, I believe it took a gathering storm of community outrage to save Jguk from being sentenced to wiki-death. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 1 July 2005 04:49 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My impression from speaking to arbitrators is that it didn't take community outrage so much as for more than one or two arbitrators to get around to looking at the case. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> July 6, 2005 01:34 (UTC)</li>
<li>So, what you're basically saying is that the ArbCom listens to community consensus? That would be a good thing, no? <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> July 1, 2005 07:33 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That is a good thing. However, it also means that the ArbCom has a set path of punishing people harshly regardless of the situation which it only deviated from in this case because people got worked up about it. My view is that ArbCom decisions should be subject to a kind of community review on a standard basis. Penalties should, if challenged, be required to get a majority vote in approval from the community to be valid. Otherwise people will continue to be routinely mistreated and only occasionally will enough outrage be generated to abort the penalties in advance. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 1 July 2005 08:48 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Isn't that precisely what the old Quickpolls mechanism did? As a side point, ArbCom members are elected by community for a set period of time, and can (and have) fail to be re-elected. Could you please provide evidence of <i>a set path of punishing people harshly</i> and <i>people being routinely mistreated</i>? <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> July 1, 2005 09:03 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I see no evidence whatsoever for your assertion; if anything, the concerns expressed by ArbCom members themselves were greater than any expressed by the user community. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 1 July 2005 07:36 (UTC)</li>
