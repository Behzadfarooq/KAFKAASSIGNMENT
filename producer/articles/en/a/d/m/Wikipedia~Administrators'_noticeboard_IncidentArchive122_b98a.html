<dd>I agree with SCZenz: a block isn't appropriate <i>at this time.</i> There is a difference between re-adding because he's in a fight and re-adding after he's gotten multiple sets of administrative eyes. In the former case, the slow-ish dispute resolution process would need to take place. In the latter case, it's sort of a different set of offenses that can justify a block more quickly.

<p>The notability of the site is still being debated after the issue was first raised a day or two ago, and this deletion was immediately forced through after editors complained about perceived bias (almost immediately after). Admins do a good job, but this does feel like a retaliatory nomination, especially given the ferocity of people to "get rid of it". This nomination so far is heading based on votes to either a weak to solid keep, or a no concensus. If that happens, the article should remain while it gets worked out further on the page itself.</p>
<p>If the vote and discussion from the article is a "keep" or no concensus, I am concerned that some action may be unilaterally taken vs. this article after the vote possibly, going against concensus. Questions in regards to this have been ignored on the vote page, while every other question/comment from parties opposed to the article's existence have been met with swiftness. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> 00:37, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually no, almost any AFD nom is a "premediated attempt to destroy an article". That is, after all, the point of nominating something for AFD - to remove something that the nominator believes is unsuitable for Wikipedia. I would <i>hope</i> that AFD noms are premeditated - I would <i>hate</i> to think that people would nominate articles for deletion on the spur of the moment. Calling an AFD nom "a premeditated attempt to destroy an article" is like calling article creation a "premeditated attempt to create an article". It <i>is</i> rather impolite to <i>phrase</i> it that way, trying to spin a perfectly normal action into something sinister. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 06:59, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>The actions and comments from certain members of the <i>keep</i> side of the debate are really quite shameful. If anyone wonders why admins burn out or get upset occasionally, one need only look at the onslaught of willful ignorance and the completely undeserved sense of entitlement being utilized by certain members of that debate, threatening current editors who have had the courage to speak their mind, and even against anyone who would potentially enforce policy in regards to this debate. --Jeffrey O.

<dd>A deletion review that was not consensus. My article was a professionally-writen, complete and thoroughly-cited biography. A few attackers kept stating over and over the sources weren't verifiable, which is incorrect. Every source I used for the statements is verifiable and previously published in a reliable source. The deletion *review* came to an incorrect conclusion and there is no reason I should be penalized for trying to expand, valid and useful content on wikipedia. All the sources I used were posted to the article, and the quality was far superior, in my opinion, to the majority of biographies on here.

I go to bed with KEEP, I wake up and everything I worked on for the past week — every single quote, every reference to this very notable person has been wiped by Deathphoenix. The sources are on wikisource, a sister project, and have been accepted there as documents of historical interest. Aside from that, I have posted portions of those quotes to various genealogical and history boards for the various communities and names mentioned, and each has expressed great interest in this source. And yet, one of the remarks on the review is that this person is not notable. It's relatively hard to reconcile the two positions. One person, a descendent of <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chief_Joseph_4ce0.html" title="Chief Joseph">Chief Joseph</a> wrote with profuse thanks that there is yet another source on her ancestor. The mere fact that a person is not universally known, is not a sufficient reason for stating that person is not *notable*. The notability page I would add, states that a person is also notable if they *should* be more widely known. If nothing else, this person should pass on that criteria. <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 20:03, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please review and get him to stop. This article is locked, is under AfD, and the crux of half the arguments revolved around perceived admin bias based on the fact an admin was attacked on the 3rd party site the article in question is about. Why is this admin being allowed to edit a protected article under AfD condtion? It needs to be immediately reverted back to this version:</p>

<p>Back on topic, this abusive admin continues to make unchallenged, undiscussed, unilateral edits on a protected page being discussed for AfD.

<dd>Are we saying that admins get final say on content then? They can unilaterally change ANYTHING on an article, and if a 'regular' editor doesn't like it, protection can be used as empowerment of the admin's viewpoints on what that featured content should be? Because to be frank, his breathless "the edits stay" can be construed by anyone as saying "I'm not changing it and you can't do a damn thing about" due to the protection in place. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> 15:44, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It looks to me like the "be cautious" part applies to indefinately-protected pages, such as the main page or templates; the page in question is a "temporarily protected page", which falls under the section above the one you were reading. That says, in an extremely straightforward fashion:
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Do not edit or revert a temporarily protected page, except to add a protected page notice, a link to Wikipedia:Accuracy dispute or Wikipedia:NPOV dispute, or a similar disclaimer about the current state of an article, unless there is widespread agreement that the page was protected in violation of these policies.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Of course, common sense should also be applied, and I don't think these edits were really such a big deal; but they weren't direly needed, either. Part of the purpose of protection is to force people to come to the talk page and participate in discussions about the article's direction; if admins start handling seemingly trivial maintenance edits on temporarily protected pages, that encourages people to leave the page protected longer, and increases the chance that editors who are generally happy with the protected version will stay out of discussions. The annoyance of being unable to make small corrections like these is part of what makes protection work the way it does. --<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 16:15, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, not sure exactly what to do here, this is a new problem for me. One of my subpages was being considered for deletion, see <a href="../../../m/i/s/Wikipedia%7EMiscellany_for_deletion_User%7EKarwynn_Compiling_Evidence_data_dump_to_be_sorted_b0c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/User:Karwynn/Compiling Evidence/data dump to be sorted">Wikipedia:Miscellany_for_deletion/User:Karwynn/Compiling_Evidence/data_dump_to_be_sorted</a>.

THe reason, "attack page", was the subject on ongoing discussion on the MfD page.

<dd>Tony acted properly; the top of the page begins with "Below are links to edits by multiple users. Because these users are administrators, they will likely use the article delete power to hide them." and Karwynn, on occasion in the page, is trying to figure out the ISP of one admin, MONGO. This is a form of harrasment and Tony acted properly to have this deleted before the MFD is finished. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">User:Zscout370</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Return Fire)</a></sup></small> 19:37, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>People, in the past, have allowed to keep evidence for related issues, RFC's and RFAr's; but anything that is trying to "out" an editor usually gets deleted for being an attack page. An example of outing is trying to figure out the ISP of a person, real name of a person, real location and their real job (unless, of course, the subject of the investigation gives it out willing). But since MONGO and others have not, then it is considered harrasment. It doesn't matter where it came from, nor if you were the original posted, the reason why we have pointed it to you is that the page is in your userspace. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">User:Zscout370</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Return Fire)</a></sup></small> 19:45, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Look at every one of my my edits before this ED disaster pulled me in. NOTHING to do with it. I worked on my own little baby project, and a bunch of comics/TV related stuff. We'll have to just agree to disagree in good faith that this sad mess is littered with bias on both sides--possible bias on some staff/admin/whatever pro-MONGO, some editors/admins pro-ED. I'm done with this and am going back to my old stuff. I kept trying to argue that everyone stay neutral but the attacks just kept swirling from *both* sides (fact).

<dd>IMO, if the discussion lasted longer than 5 minutes on this topic than it was too long. We aren't a internet hosting service.

<p>Neither User:NYTheaterHistorian, nor his sock puppet User:OffOffBroadway behave like legitimate Wikipedia editors.

<p>The information posted on my discussion page is all relevent in explaining edits that were done in trying to work towards truth on two pages, which have now been deleted due to being seen as self promotion and of being not worthy of having pages. There are no derogatory statements that I have posted; simly truths in explaining my actions. Information that she says is personal is information that was relevant and specific to the pages she created. No contact information such as phone numbers or addresses have been given; simply information relevant to the page, and available with a simple google search. user:missmajesty has been noted as puppet master of numerous logins and has been threatening me with legal threats. This user is selectively removing information off of my discussion page, yet leaving the numerous 'warnings' that she left for me in hopes that I would not make legitimate and factual edits to the pages she created, at the same time mistakenly leaving the same warnings for an administrative editior. She is also incorrect in stating that user:offoffbroadway is a sockpuppet of mine; that is a completely seperate person and I encourage any administrative research to see that this is so.

<p>Hi, I have a problem which encompasses a question on policy. As you'll see here, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Martinp23#stop" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Martinp23#stop" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>, <a href="../../../h/u/n/User%7EHunter91_add3.html" title="User:Hunter91">Hunter91</a> (<a href="../../../h/u/n/User_talk%7EHunter91_094e.html" title="User talk:Hunter91">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Hunter91_d72d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Hunter91">contribs</a>) feels that I'm incorrect in some of my advice to him and my actions in an AfD (all of my correspondance has been deleted from his talk page, but with history: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Hunter91&amp;oldid=64885919" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Hunter91&amp;oldid=64885919" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>). He's removed votes from an AfD, claiming that they were by sockpuppets and he left no comment on the AfD discussion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FBattle_Field_2&amp;diff=64900285&amp;oldid=64886147" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FBattle_Field_2&amp;diff=64900285&amp;oldid=64886147" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>. He also changed my nomination, leaving no comment. The users he has labelled as sockpuppets have no warnings for sockpuppetry on their talk pages. From what I can see, the user has a history of removing comments which conflict with his beliefs on the article talk page <a href="../../../b/a/t/Talk%7EBattle_Field_2_dbb2.html" title="Talk:Battle Field 2">Talk:Battle_Field_2</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABattle_Field_2&amp;diff=64899863&amp;oldid=64885993" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABattle_Field_2&amp;diff=64899863&amp;oldid=64885993" rel="nofollow">like here</a>. I feel that this user is distrupting wikipedia (to an extent), and am trying to get in contact with an admin to see if they can/will do anything about it. The response I'm hoping for is a kind word to Hunter91 and a revert of his edits to the afd page (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Battle_Field_2_98cc.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Battle Field 2">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Battle_Field_2</a>).

<li>Do not alter other people's comments. If he thinks they belong to sockpuppets, he should add a note to the discussion for the closing admin, but removing AFD comments or nominations without leaving comments is not acceptable. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 22:43, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I am with Martin. I voted for the 'Delete' of the article, and then he comments saying that the vote was done by a sock puppet! I am most certainly not a sock puppet! I also commented against the article in the discussion page, but he deleted my comment. He's then accusing everyone of being vandals. If you compare the article of Battle Field 2 to Battlefield 2: Modern Combat, there's a huge difference. You gotta help. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeriphyn_66c2.html" title="User:Seriphyn">Seriphyn</a> 20:07, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I re-added a delete vote that he had removed and then he accused me of being a "sockpuppet and a vandal" - someone might want to have a polite word. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesknight_2ce5.html" title="User:Charlesknight">Charlesknight</a> 21:28, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Di Biase had three consecutive traffic tickets 'misplaced' by the police, and this was suspicious enough for the Toronto Star and the local newspaper to report. How does a ticket just vanish? This would be a lucky coincidence for most people, but when it involves the allegedly corrupt Mayor of the allegedly most corrupt council in Canada, luck may not be involved. <a href="../../../e/n/e/User%7EEnergyblue_d12f.html" title="User:Energyblue">Energyblue</a> 17:53, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also where is this so called "community consensus"? If you go to the [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Michael_Di_Biase|article" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Michael_Di_Biase|article" rel="nofollow">talk page</a>], you'll see that only one person agrees with Pm_shef, and that's JamesTeterenko. Bearcat says that he has "no strong opinion about whether the traffic incidents belong in the article" and CJCurrie writes "I don't have any strong opinions about Michael Di Biase, and I'm willing to grant that the information could perhaps be presented in a neutral and encyclopedic manner." The question is, is pm_shef, the son on Vaughan Councillor Alan Shefman, capable of writing objectively about City Hall? <a href="../../../e/n/e/User%7EEnergyblue_d12f.html" title="User:Energyblue">Energyblue</a> 17:53, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Another question, and an important one: Zereshk has now vowed to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASa.vakilian&amp;diff=64968767&amp;oldid=64968053" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASa.vakilian&amp;diff=64968767&amp;oldid=64968053" rel="nofollow">continue spamming off-site</a>, which of course he can't be caught in the act as easily.

<dd>I'm pretty certain he's been doing just that anyway, in similar earlier cases too. And his behaviour is being rewarded: there are in fact around a dozen new keep votes on that AfD by now, almost all from Iranian users. It's exactly this sort of behaviour that has made pages like <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misconceptions_about_the_Shi%27a_8f7f.html" title="Misconceptions about the Shi'a">Misconceptions about the Shi'a</a> (even worse piece of POV writing) survive up to three successive AfD's, apparently.

<p><b>Aminz Request</b> :</p>
<p><b>Aleged Injustice</b>: Can other admins please have a look into this: ** Is 48 Hours block appropriate for such violation of policies? ** I seriously doubt! Zereshk has remained civil and hasn't done any vandalism. He has spammed some pages and this was <b>his first time.</b> Later, he has said to a <b>particular user</b> that he will inform him next time via email (please note his tone in that comment which seems not to be serious though it was very improper). I have seen all the relevant evidences &amp; I personally find this block as it stands to be injustice (48 hours! for doing something once!). --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 01:06, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Another evidence: One reason that I like another admin to look into this is that when InShaneee <b>first</b> warned Zereshk of not spamming, InShaneee warned Zereshk of getting blocked. I was completely surprised when I saw that. I've been around in wikipedia for awhile and have got a sense of the warnings. Nobody gives a {{test4}} to a person who has done vandalism for his first time. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 01:21, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am requesting again. Can any other admin for the sake of God have a look into this case. Thanks --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 07:11, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Another evidence&#160;: User InShaneee believes: "As I said, policy is policy and if you break it, it's broken. Sure, he didn't vandalize, but spamming is a policy too, and such flagrant disregard cannot go unnoticed... Showing such disregard for policy is the mark of a troll, and users who show no willingness to follow policy are often blocked indefinatly."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I personally think InShaneee is not taking the required steps one by one in dealing with user Zereshk. Blocking a user (particularly for 48 hours) should be only taken as the last resort. InShaneee, on the other hand, is trying to identify Zereshk's comment as a mark of being a troll. This is a very quick judgment based on a single comment and I believe InShaneee is over-generalizing the situation. Furthermore, this block doesn't serve in a constructive manner. I am still confused why InShaneee didn't warn Zereshk of not showing disregard for the policy. Much worst things happen in wikipedia all the times, but the admins are much more tolerant (and they are supposed to be). Just put yourself in Zereshk's shoes: He is going to be accused of having the mark of a troll and getting banned for 48 hours in his first violation of a policy!!!!! (well! two policies) --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 07:29, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

He also added an 'autosig' which also needed reverting, as sometimes extra commentary can be inserted after templates - I could almost swear that he's been reverted and warned about adding autosigs before, but perhaps that was someone else.</p>
<p>If it needs to be said, and I really hope it doesn't, this is a <i>completely</i> inappropriate edit to a high-visibility template which regards a very sensitive issue - blocking users indefinitely who may not have been expecting it. It turns a rational and clear explanation into a statement that we don't take permanent blocking of users who may be editing in good faith seriously. The edit stood for several hours until I used the template on a user's talk page, had to edit my own edit to remove Myrtone's crap, and then revert him. For all we know some editors used it without noticing (the template is designed to be substed so whatlinkshere won't be any use in checking). Silly edits to templatespace are many times more damaging than silly edits to article, user or projectspace.</p>
<p>My block of a week takes into account Myrtone's 5 previous blocks, albeit two were later undone. Given Myrtone86's history of silly edits which have got him blocked several times in the past, I don't feel any more such edits from this user should be tolerated. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 16:23, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Got a page of a living person, with two editors with very strong views holding an edit war over the page. One pro-Kennedy, one anti-Kennedy. The page was semi-protected a few days back, at the request of the pro side warrior (User:617USA). On the anti side, there had been several IPs followed by a user account, (User:Suture). I'm pretty sure this is all one person. The anti warrior has been pushing to have some serious derogatory claims included in the article. I've been trying to reason with him on the talk page about the need for <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. His account appears to have just passed the age for getting around the semi-protection, and the fight is on again. And I'm about done for much of the weekend, with little time to deal with things.

<dd>Next time, I suggest following the procedure at <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_problems_b9ab.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright problems">Wikipedia:Copyright problems</a>. These things usually are not an emergency. Basically, you blank the page, use the {{<a href="../../../c/o/p/Template%7ECopyvio_c034.html" title="Template:Copyvio">copyvio</a>}} template and then list the page at the copyright problems subpage that is on the template after you save the page. Anyway, I deleted User:Easyrider roo/AScannerDarkly, since it does not have much purpose now that the text is deleted. It is not necessary to remove copyright violations from the history unless there is a complaint. Therefore, I would have saved the user page, except for the fact that there is a good chance that he or she is not coming back based upon my experience with copyright violators - all of the edits were copyright violations, they were all made on the same day and no edits have been made since, which is classic copyright violator style, at least for text (as opposed to images). -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 08:06, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It doesn't appear that Wizkid357 was trying to impersonate Ral315.

Wizkid probably should have made more of an effort to set off his remark as a quotation, but he did sign the edit with his own signature. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 05:08, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>These two were edit warring over articles that concerned Poles in Germany or similar things. If you check this diff: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=German_Empire&amp;diff=60238116&amp;oldid=60236755" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=German_Empire&amp;diff=60238116&amp;oldid=60236755" rel="nofollow">[51]</a>, you will see that both versions are sort of biased, Molobos was at least sourced. The blocking admin (Dmcdevit) said he was tired etc. and wouldn't do the same thing (evidence collecting) for Sciurinae, but that probably someone should do it, because it was always him who pursued molobos edits and warred over them. However, Sciurinae was blocked for 72 hours, (despite warning for months), and Molobo for 1 year. I don't think that Molobo should be unblocked, he surely did what he shouldnt have done, but why is his sparing partner only blocked for 72 hours? Azmoc 07:19, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps Dmcdevit thought that there was still hope for Sciurinae, and that a shorter block might drive home the point that we're serious about not tolerating edit warring. Checking the block log, I note that this is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Sciurin%C3%A6" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Sciurin%C3%A6" rel="nofollow">Sciurinae's first block</a>, whereas Molobo has been blocked <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Molobo" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Molobo" rel="nofollow">many times over the last nine months</a> for edit warring.</dd>
<dd>Molobo was nearly blocked indefinitely a couple of months ago – see <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive89_05ea.html#Molobo_blocked_for_disruptive_edit_warring" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive89">Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/IncidentArchive89#Molobo_blocked_for_disruptive_edit_warring</a> – and was only allowed to return after a shorter (1 month) block on the condition that he refrain from the edit warring conduct that got him in trouble in the first place. Molobo has had ample opportunities to reform his behaviour, and has failed to avail himself of those opportunities.</dd>
<dd>I assume and expect that should Sciurinae fail to modify his behaviour, he too will face additional warnings and escalating blocks—however I hope that this 72-hour block (which, for a first block, is far from short) will discourage further edit warring. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 18:07, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As a non-admin, I posted a couple denials:
<ol>
<li>Case 1: Vandal continued to vandalize articles, after test4, I requested an admin to block, and I posted the blockmessage. When the user requested an unblock, I contacted the admin who performed the block and decided to deny the unblock, so I responded to the unblock request.</li>
<li>Case 2: User requests unblock multiple time while I and admins are on rcpatrol. I report the unblock request reason, they deny it, and I post the unblock deny on that user's talkpage on behalf of the admins. This case was brought up in my RfA.</li>
</ol>

<p>It's not self-published, but was brought out by Praeger, an imprint of Greenwood. This is an academic press that provides initial expert review, developmental review, and professional editing services. Jacket comments were provided by Elizabeth Loftus and Frederick Crews, and there is a series forward by Hiram Fitzgerald of the World Association for Infant Mental Health (the series was Child Psychology and Mental Health). This book was cited by the APSAC task force in 2006 with respect to the use of Attachment Therapy. However, as is the case for many serious books, the royalties have been very small-- I would suppose each author has realized no more than $200 from the book in the three years it has been out, rather less than it took to prepare the ms.. This is in fact the only single publication that gives a thorough analysis of the topic, and that is why I cite it.</p>
<p>I could, of course, avoid being the subject of such complaints if I did not reveal my identity, but I consider it important for people to know who is speaking about a subject so relevant to the well-being of children and families.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I applaud the distinction made by InShanee between self-published and other material, but I'd like to take this opportunity to point out that today there are a number of what one might call "printer-ready publishers" who provide none of the services of a company like Praeger, but permit authors to avoid having their work tagged "self-published." Such publishers add complexity to the existing problem of identifying authoritative information without careful reading and analysis.Jean Mercer 13:25, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Very nasty business, though inevitable - after all, it was nominated by a Wikipedia user with some sort of previous personal dispute with some (possibly many) of the forum members (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tribalwar&amp;oldid=32713833#.5EBuGs.5E_gets_fired" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tribalwar&amp;oldid=32713833#.5EBuGs.5E_gets_fired" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Consumed_Crustacean#Re:_Tribalwar" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Consumed_Crustacean#Re:_Tribalwar" rel="nofollow">here</a>). Nothing good was ever going to come of this - in fact, I suspect the only reason the AfD hasn't been closed as bad-faith is either that the editor is sufficiently well-established to get away with it, that the admins reckon a reasonably proper AfD process can still be salvaged from this mess (and I hope it's this one), or that no-one has noticed yet. - <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakomk_1f87.html" title="User:Makomk">makomk</a> 20:13, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Every one of the SEVEN tagged articles are minor ones that warrent PROD and all fail a variety of things. Some of them have support from others to delete. What disruption?

<dd>Rotology's words, "I'm trying to demonstrate that the WP:WEB for wikis overall are valid to keep". Tagging article after article for deletion to illustrate your point is not the way to do things. You're just going to cause problems and anger folks who in seeing your POINTed behavior are likely to start editing in retaliatory ways relative to yourself and further disrupt Wikipedia. <i>(<a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetscott_c779.html" title="User talk:Netscott">→</a><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott"><span class="pBody" style="border: 0; color: gray; padding: 0; font-size: 100%;">Netscott</span></a>)</i> 04:20, 23 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think it's okay for people to make points while NOT disrupting Wikipedia. I don't see how those articles are inappropriate to nominate, nor how the AfD debates that might result (if the PRODs don't go through) would be disruptive any more than any other debate. To me, <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> use of deletion process involves either (1) tagging of articles that are clearly worthwhile, or (2) tagging of articles for disingenuous reasons (such as, because they are edited by an editor someone else is in a dispute with). <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 04:28, 23 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>Mass AfDing/PRODing is going to rile folks up especially given the environment it's been done in.

<p>Netscott, I'm actually not trolling. I am expressing myself. I am inclined to think you are the one trolling: following root around, personal attacks on me here, and stirring up trouble. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHardvice_3fe9.html" title="User:Hardvice">Hardvice</a> 05:37, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have to say that if the only way we can reference an article is by it's homepage, then that may indeed not qualify it as an encyclopedia entry under <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. Though that is just a guideline, not policy, if we are not able to find reliable secondary sources about the subject, it may not be notable for inclusion.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 05:47, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

Netscott also posted (I believe to Tony's Talk page) that we should have an official WP policy against articles on subjects that criticize Wikipedia. I don't think I should be banned for anything. Look at the replies to WP:WEB on my post. Compliments, civil discussion. "Good job on the PRODS". Hipocrite and Netscott are e-stalking my activities I think, given I stood up against them in good faith. ED is gone from WP. They can come back when they eventually get more notable, and when they do should be welcomed back the same as any other "notable" subject. I prod'd articles that are lacking. Would it be not disruptive if I did "one"? Or is seven too much? If I find 5,492 articles merit deletion per policy, am I not allowed to PROD? If I find (somehow) 15000 or 100000, should they not go because it's a big number? I don't understand this. I never wandered into any of this admin stuff before. I edited my cheerful little projects, and while digging around for the one baby project I started, I found Habbo Hotels mess. That led to this. If I get banned, ban. I'll appeal to ArbCom if I have to. This is absurd. Thanks, I'm done and am unwatching this page now. Apparently only people popular in the right cliques can "be bold". <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> 06:27, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Leaving aside for a moment the evidence of disruption, nominating those articles is, on the whole, uncontentious: none of them appear to have reliable secondary sources, and most can easily be dealt with in a single sentence in some other article. MONGO is right - if the only source is the site itself we really can't cover it per policy. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 12:22, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This is too complex for me to feel comfortable doing anything about, since I have no previous knowledge of this issue. However, a quick glance at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:SPUI" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:SPUI" rel="nofollow">block log</a> shows quite a colorful history.

<dd>I endorse the block of William Allen Simpson. He is clearly out of control on this issue (unlike SPUI) and needs a breather. If he doesn't tone down the unwarranted rhetoric, he will find himself getting longer blocks. SPUI has a checkered history on Wikipedia but that doesn't mean he's fair game. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 23:53, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>None of SPUI's blocks are for vandalism, so yes, referring to him as a vandal is <i>entirely</i> unreasonable. SPUI may have some problems dealing with content disputes, but he does a lot of good work and he's certainly no vandal, and I know he doesn't appreciate being called one. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><span style="color:#ff66ff;cursor:w-resize;"><b>Cyde↔Weys</b></span></a> 02:50, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

A list of categories different to the ones being voted on was added to <i>during</i> a vote after quite a few voters had already voted on the original list. He chose to include votes cast for deletion prior to their late addition as block votes for deletion of the late added categories too, even though the original list was of people who speak universal or majority national languages like English (hardly a topic worth a category), while the late additions were of small languages with so small a usage that the ability to speak it <i>was</i> notable (for example, Welsh). His cock-up in counting and in misrepresenting votes led to a decision at deletion review to undelete the categories added in and re-list them, something he grudgingly did, while refusing to accept any responsibility for the screw-up.</p>
<p>In the relist he added in a false explanation (how it was merely that they had not been listed for a full seven days, not that they had been suspiciously added in when a votes had been cast on other categories). He then corrupted the second vote by canvassing users, asking them if their original votes had been to delete the categories.</p>

<p>Prior to the deletion review, his attention to the error had been drawn by a Welsh user. Instead of paying any attention he attacked her in a manner that suggested he was hardly a neutral observer of the debate. She discovered that he had added in the loaded (and completely) misleading supposed explanation for the revote and that he was canvassing support, and informed the users on their pages that the issue was more complex, to try to undo the damage he was doing to the second vote.</p>
<p>To make a mess of counting the first time could be excused (even if his comments suggested he was hardly a neutral observer fit to interpret the results). To deliberately corrupt the revote through a misleading explanation and canvassing, is unacceptable. At this stage it is impossible to work out how many genuine voters are voting, or whether others were canvassed by other means (email, etc). What do we do now? Wait until they are deleted a second time and then relist a third time? At this stage any chance of a balanced debate had been destroyed by Mr Simpson's conduct. A glance at his edits suggests that this is not the first time that he has been engaged in widespread canvassing on issues he feels strongly about. He is making a mockery, and a mess, of the whole deletion system. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">User:Jtdirl</a> 01:01, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually Jtdirl, if you had bothered looking at my talk you would have seen that he most certianly did not canvass me for votes. <a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDeb_5525.html" title="User:Deb">User:Deb</a> made the same erroneous assumption and then deleted her comment off my talk page when she realized her error. He asked me to do two things: do an unreleated history only undeletion that had sat around for ~20 days on DRV (IIRC), and to undelete the cats relative to the relisted CFD because people in a froth about it had re-added items back to the deleted cats and he didn't want to see relinked categories in articles while it was sorted out. I'm going to go check the other edits listed by you to verify that you haven't misrepresented them as well. Asking users who have participated before in a discussion to weigh in is perfectly reasonable, especially if perhaps he felt he was in error in the original closing...as long as all of them are notified and there isn't any attempt to sway the debate ("its up for discussion again please vote KEEP"). <a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 11:33, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Asking users if they intended their vote to be "to delete" is an non-too-subtle way of canvassing. If he had asked then what their vote was meant to would be somewhat neutral. But asking them to deny his interpretation that their vote to delete, at a time when the he wants people to come to a page to vote to delete, is blatent fixing. Deb caught him up to his usual tricks and simply pointed out that the issue wasn't straightforward and showed them a link to a debate. He has blatently now corrupted two votes on the issue.

<p>A list of categories of people by language spoken was put up for deletion. The list was all of national dominant languages (eg, Danish, given that practically 100% of Danes speak Danish, Dutch, given that practically 100% of Dutch people speak Dutch, etc) and mass international languages like English, French, and Spanish. Categorising people by such languages is pointless — its a bit by listing people per having two eyes, etc. In other words it is the natural default that one would expect and in no way notable. Well into the vote a <i>different</i> type of languages, small use languages where the ability to speak it is so rare as to be notable, for example, Welsh (which few Welsh people can speak), Latin (which few Catholic clergy can speak anymore) etc were sneaked in unto the list even though they are fundamentally different. (For example, the fact that Prince Charles can speak English isn't notable. The fact that he can speak Welsh is notable and made headlines when he studied it. The fact that George Bush can (sort of) speak English is not notable. It is to be expected. If he could speak Latin or Welsh, that would be notable, putting him in a very small elite.) Simpson counted votes cast to delete the first block of widely spoken languages which had been caste <i>before</i> not small minority languages were sneaked onto the list, as votes to delete the <i>entire</i> list. When he was informed by users, who presumed he had not noticed the mistake, of the error, he turned on users and attacked them. A deletion review relisted the rarely spoken languages, amid much moaning from Simpson. He got them relisted (grudlingly), put a misleading explanation for the reason of the vote at the top, placed the relist back with the earlier vote (meaning that new users had to dig around in all the archives to try and track it down) and then to rig it more contacted users in a none-too-subtle attempt to canvass them. So having mishandled one vote, he then tried to set up the second to deliver the result he had announced his support for. But then, as Cyde noted, Simpson seems to be acting like judge, jury and executioner far too often, rather than standing back and letting independent people not committed to one side, to analyse the results, reach a conclusion and implement it. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:green; background-color:pink"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 07:06, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>He seems to have been originally upset by an image which was at Wikipedia:Long term abuse/The Doppleganger, which was quickly removed when the issue was brought up. In response to this he created Wikipedia:Racism, attempting to outline the incident (somewhat incoherently), and seemed to be upset that a project of this sort did not already exist, implying that no one on Wikipedia cared about issues regarding to racism etc. (which I personally found somewhat insulting, but whatev.) I tried to inform him of both the two projects noted above, at which point he proceeded to copy and paste his grievances in multiple places, in a format which is very difficult to understand or read (perhaps because of disabilities). As Geogre says, frustrating, but Good faith nevertheless. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a> <a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a> 17:59, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would VERY much like someone to take a look at this and respond.

<dd>Looks good to me. "Actual Reality" is mentioned VERY breifly an almost inconsequentially in the article. The link that was readded was to a site with what appears to be a particular company's laser sensor (and possibly equipment). Its almost useless to the reader of the article. Also one of the diffs I checked with a brief arguement by the anon is a straw man arguement ("the other links are still there" and its relatives). Last, the other diff I saw with 5 or so links added is clearly not a good idea. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Breitenstein_8775.html" title="User:Kevin Breitenstein">Kevin_b_er</a> 00:55, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm an administrator but I'm a little biased so I figured I'd ask for an impartial ear. Isn't there some unwritten rule about nominating categories for deletion over and over?</p>

</ul>
<p>If they were whacked on the first or even second attempt, I wouldn't say much ---- but FOUR now?! All within an eight-month span.</p>
<p>Moreover, this time, the categories weren't even tagged until three days after the CFD was started so if you're like me and don't keep close tabs on <a href="../../../c/f/d/WP%7ECFD_d190.html" title="WP:CFD">WP:CFD</a>, then you end up only being the fourth or fifth vote which is clearly a disadvantage.</p>

<p>They appear to each be nominated by different editors, who presumably all independently thought they should be deleted and didn't know there had already been a discussion about it, as most of the talk pages don't mention the previous CfDs. The two recent ones are also several months apart from the others and each other. Tagging them incorrectly is bad, but I think it is pretty likely that these users just all thought they should be deleted. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 08:38, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Don't call it vandalism? Do you use more user names since you come from no where and call it vandalism?</p>
<p><a href="../../../r/a/g/Ragnarok.html" title="Ragnarok">Ragnarok</a> is the English word, and this a English wikipedia right? <a href="../../../r/a/g/Ragnar%C3%B6k.html" title="Ragnarök">Ragnarök</a> is not the old Norse word. But the Icelandic. Look at how the article <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midgard.html" title="Midgard">Midgard</a> looks like. On that way this article should be. Or do you also think that we should change that article to "Miðgarðr"</p>
<p>The letter "ö" is not in the English alphabet. --Comanche cph 10:22, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The correct approach is to move the article from one name to the other. Copy-pasting it destroys the history (essentially, it makes it look like you wrote the entire current article by yourself in one sitting.) If the move can not be made because something already exists at the old name and the system will not permit the move, you should list is at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_page_moves_45aa.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested page moves">Wikipedia:Requested page moves</a> for an admin to do it properly. If the move is contested, you should have a discussion first on both talk pages. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 10:56, 23 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Just because the letter "ö" is not in the English alphabet does not mean the article should be named without the ö. There are plenty of articles on the English Wikipedia about non-English topics that are named with special characters in the title. WP:MoS-JA will rename articles so they are named with Hepburn Romaji and use characters such as ā, ō, and ū. The move is also contended at <a href="../../../r/a/g/Talk%7ERagnar%C3%B6k_b2a7.html" title="Talk:Ragnarök">Talk:Ragnarök</a>, partly because "Ragnarök" is the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Norse_cc89.html" title="Old Norse">Old Norse</a> spelling of the work, and that spelling is used in the modern <a href="../../../s/w/e/Swedish_language.html" title="Swedish language">Swedish language</a>, as well as on other non-English Wikipedias (off the top of my head, the French Wikipedia uses ö in their spelling of "Ragnarök"). And what does the "Do you use more user names since you come from no where and call it vandalism?" accusation mean? <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryūlóng</a> 21:32, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This user has in the last few minutes done a long series of bot-like edits, wikilinking one word on a many pages. Many of these are very dubious--<a href="../../../c/e/d/Ceded.html" title="Ceded">ceded</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/g/High.html" title="High">high</a>, etc., links to disambig pages or redirects. It's not vandalism, but I don't know how to communicate with him about this clearly. I would like him to slow down and do what he's doing more carefully, since a lot of these will end up being reverted if he keeps going as is. Can someone look at his contribs please?

<p>Can someone take a look at his recent contributions? They seem like calculated disruption of the sort I am often accused of.

<dd>I'll admit that Pink fuzzy bunnies was a mistake borne out of frustration of this situation. As for the rest... well, let's just say that I'm off the Minnesota State Highways project. I'm not sure why I ever got involved in the highways project in the first place.</dd>
<dd>Basically, since I've created and/or modified a number of articles under the wrong title ("Minnesota State Highway (x)" instead of "State Highway x (Minnesota)"), that means <i>I did something wrong</i>. That, in itself, is a blockable offense. So I won't argue about the blocks being applied.

<dd>I did not request the mediation be closed: on the contrary. Zeraeph is pointing to a copy of my post here, on AN/I. I have suggested that this be taken to proper channels, which *is* mediation.

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have reminded another editor that if he continually characterized legitimate edits as vandalism, that could be interpreted as a personal attack.</dd>

<dd>Hi, his talk page seems to serve only or almost entirely as an outlet for personal attacks against me.

<dd>This is actually the first time I noticed the comment. I don't understand Chinese, by the way. It was added as part of vandalism that I mostly reverted, but I didn't notice this part. I'm going to remove it from my talk page now.

<dd>Wikipedia is not the mundane world. See WP:Consensus and the talk page for the many ways in which "consensus" in Wikipedia has been redefined, sometimes in stark contrast to the common understanding of the term.

<dd>Yup, I agree, it's a mess.&#160;:-) We generally use "no objections" as our *test* if consensus exists. If there's an objection, we then go around the circle. (see: <a href="../../../b/o/l/Wikipedia%7EBOLD%2C_revert%2C_discuss_cycle_e770.html" title="Wikipedia:BOLD, revert, discuss cycle">Wikipedia:BOLD, revert, discuss cycle</a> for an example of such a method, thought that particular application is fairly heavy duty) We've also used straw polls to test if we need to go around the circle again. In some situations, people have failed to learn how consensus works, and are skipping the "go around the circle" bit. Oops. Especially polls are vulnerable to this problem, since they look a lot like votes to people who aren't used to them. I recently got told off for agressively pursuing consensus at Requests for adminship. I'm still busy resolving that and convincing all the new people that *yes* I may actually pursue consensus and have been allowed to since 2001&#160;;-) . <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> 08:01, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Its a deletion discussion, not a 'Separate activities to do to namespace discussion'. TfD and RfD don't have their templates automatically treat it like a vote and put "* '''Do this'''" in the created text. Only 10 people probably saw it because I would hope such a change occurs thourgh larger discussion. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Breitenstein_8775.html" title="User:Kevin Breitenstein">Kevin_b_er</a> 02:46, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is <i>not</i> and has never been about deletion only. Merging and renaming are both extremely common, both as proposals and as outcomes, and there are other possibilities as well. Complaints about the inappropriateness of the old name were aired on several occasions over at least a year. <a href="../../../o/s/o/User%7EOsomec_c7d4.html" title="User:Osomec">Osomec</a> 07:41, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'd like to second this. Because of the vagaries of the category system, CFD tends to work in a very different way to the other deletion pages. There tend to be more complicated discussions, often involving blanket changes over several categories, and there are a wide range of possible outcomes. This is the reasoning behind the recent name change. However as far as I can tell these templates are intended for cases which the nominator believes can be resolved simply, and in those cases these templates are a time saving measure. This does NOT in any way prevent anyone else from suggesting alternatives, at any stage in the process. Nor does it prevent the nominator from using a more "customised" nomination message if it is felt appropriate. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_wub_6388.html" title="User:The wub">the wub</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_wub_1807.html" title="User talk:The wub"><font color="green">"?!"</font></a> 22:08, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'd appreciate another administrator stepping in here. Ever since I took a hard line against <a href="../../../i/s/r/User%7EIsraelbeach_1341.html" title="User:Israelbeach">User:Israelbeach</a>, I have been targetted by his sockpuppets and friends both on and off the wiki.

I know I have a part in this too, but I'd like to point out Bonnieisrael's history. She was blocked by Slimvirgin as a suspected sockpuppet of Israelbeach, for this sort of behavior and worse. She was unblocked by Jredmond. Jredmond promised Slimvirgin to keep an eye out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jredmond&amp;diff=51696658&amp;oldid=51693236" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jredmond&amp;diff=51696658&amp;oldid=51693236" rel="nofollow">[120]</a>, Slimvirgin said she would reblock Bonnieisrael for continuing this kind of behavior [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jredmond&amp;diff=51698939&amp;oldid=51696658" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jredmond&amp;diff=51698939&amp;oldid=51696658" rel="nofollow">[121]</a>. Bonnieisrael has since contributed almost <b>nothing</b> but more Israelbeach-type edits. Jredmond has ignored my protests about Bonnieisrael's continued disruptive editing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jredmond&amp;diff=56787500&amp;oldid=53749109" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jredmond&amp;diff=56787500&amp;oldid=53749109" rel="nofollow">[122]</a>.

I count on other administrators to use clearer judgment. But mostly I think other administrators <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_checkuser_Case_Israelbeach_7e5b.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Israelbeach">can't be bothered to check</a> what these sock/meatpuppets are up to. --<a href="../../../w/o/g/User%7EWoggly_b7b8.html" title="User:Woggly">woggly</a> 05:51, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You have been talked to again and again and again. There was an arbitration case which ended in the very clear result that you are allowed <b>one</b> account, <b>either PoolGuy or a new account</b>. GoldToeMarionette <b>will not be unblocked</b>, and since you can't behave like a sensible adult, PoolGuy will not be unblocked either. If you want to create a new account, edit Wikipedia articles, and drop all this infantile crap, that route is open to you. Given your history as PoolGuy, however, it's pretty clear you have no real interest in contributing to Wikipedia.

<dd>In an open-and-shut case, arbitration is deprecated as a waste of time. Arbitration doesn't scale. We still have only 14 arbitrators (of whom 10-12 are normally active at any one time) whereas we're getting new administrators every day and community bans are easily administered. If there isn't community agreement on such a ban, <i>then</i> we can go to arbitration. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 14:59, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Tony is right here, admins should ban away according to their understanding of policy, <i>as long as they don't wheel-war</i>. How many <i>active</i> admins do we have at this point? I predict that as soon as we have significantly more than 1,000 active admins, the "mature editor consensus system" will break down (meaning almost nothing will get done by admin-consensus) and we'll need a whole new layer of bureaucracy for interaction between admins. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 15:14, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Arbitration already provides something called "General probation", a remedy enabling an editor to be banned from Wikipedia for reasonable cause on the agreement of any three administrators. This is already very close to our more informal community ban system, and as administrator numbers grow I don't anticipate any scaling problems. Administrators who persistently stick a spoke in the wheels (Everyking springs to mind) tend not to fare well. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 15:22, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
