<dd>Is this some strange attempt to test the limits of the 'all are welcome regardless of their views' policy which is one of the fundamental aspects of Wikipedia? Or can you actually point to the section in the <a href="../../../b/p/_/WP%7EBP_c8aa.html" title="WP:BP">blocking policy</a> which justifies this? <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 14:49, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is an application of common sense. There is universal condemnation of pedophiles (and rightly so). Allowing known pedophiles to edit could also endanger younger users. I'd support adding language to the blocking policy to formally justify the blocking of self-identified pedophiles. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 14:56, 5 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Only three small problems with that.
<ol>
<li>Allowing unknown pedophiles to edit (which we already do) is at least as dangerous as allowing known pedophiles to edit, and probably more so.</li>
<li>Allowing pedophiles to edit at all is not dangerous. Or perhaps the missing apostrophe added by a pedophile will cause harm to your children?</li>
<li>Having condemned pedophiles, will we next move onto terrorists? How about drug dealers? Islamic fundamentalists?

<dd>There aren't any private chat areas on Wikipedia, and we keep all edits. Have you considered the possibility that (a) people who include the template may not actually be paedophiles but just including it to inflame other people, (b) Wikipedia may have users who are paedophiles but don't want to include the template and identify themselves as such for fairly obvious reasons? If the problem is the template, then delete it. But Wikipedia does not ban people merely because they have committed crimes, not even if the crime was murder or treason. So I don't see that this blanket ban is justified. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 14:58, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm thinking of the safety of the younger Wikipedians (as in the chatroom incidents), not the fact that a user is a criminal or not.

<dd>Note that Joeyramoney also indicates that he is a mutant, that his user page is BS, and that he is 16. Under the standard definition of the term he <b>can't</b> be a pedophile because he isn't an adult yet.

<dd>Even at 16, I think he'd put a little thought into putting a "pedophilia" template on his user page. If he placed it there in error or as a joke, he can explain this on his talk page. If it is a joke, it's about as funny as identifying oneself as a member of the KKK or a Nazi. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 15:02, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Do we automatically block self-identified KKK or Nazis? Anyway, blocking for use of a template seems pointless — in this case, it's almost certainly a joke, and the kind of pedophiles that are actually going to be stalking children aren't going to advertise their problem on the userpage. —<a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleared_as_filed_a7db.html" title="User:Cleared as filed">Cleared as filed.</a> 15:10, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If it is a joke, then the user should be unblocked, with a warning to use better judgement in the future. I'm sure it <i>will</i> be a rare occasion when someone identifies themself as a pedophile, but should that happen, that person will be blocked. If another admin believes that pedophiles should be editing, they may unblock and I won't reblock. I'm not going to wheel war over this, but I do think it's just common sense. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 15:19, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Funny, that analogy. Last I checked, people aren't blocked for being members of the KKK or being Nazis. Nor are they blocked for believing the Holocaust didn't happen, or being murderers, being rapists, being convicted fraudsters. They <i>are</i> blocked when they actually go and do something grossly inappropriate - like writing about how lynchings are a good way to keep the race pure, or how the Jewish conspiracy controls wikipedia, or threatening to hunt someone down and stab them - but, traditionally, we wait until they <b>actually do that</b>.</dd>
<dd>And, on a more pragmatic note, as many people have noted - I really doubt hunkering by {{User pedophile}} is going to be a productive way to actually find the people we might have to worry about... <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimgray_a1bc.html" title="User:Shimgray">Shimgray</a> | <a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShimgray_87de.html" title="User talk:Shimgray">talk</a> | 15:13, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, all those hideously deviant views he has expressed about, er, obscure songs by the Who. To the best of my knowledge, we already <i>do</i> have self-identified (by actual words, and everything) paedophiles on wikipedia; I'm sure I remember someone screaming about it before. If you feel so strongly about this issue, dealing with them would surely be more productive than blocking someone who seems to be playing with userboxes. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimgray_a1bc.html" title="User:Shimgray">Shimgray</a> | <a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShimgray_87de.html" title="User talk:Shimgray">talk</a> | 15:00, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Joeyramoney is a very silly boy <s>troll</s>, not a paedophile; <s>I've no objection to blocking him for the former. But</s> We don't block people for their sexual orientations.

<dd>There was an article about pedophiles on Wikipedia a couple of months ago: "<a href="http://news.baou.com/main.php?action=recent&amp;msg_recent=&amp;rid=20679" class="external text" title="http://news.baou.com/main.php?action=recent&amp;msg_recent=&amp;rid=20679" rel="nofollow">Online Encyclopedia Is a Gathering for Internet Predators: Who Is Editing Your Children's Encyclopedia?</a>". Apparently, one of the leaders of the movement for "pedophile rights" has an account and edits pedophilia-related articles (<a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophilia.html" title="Pedophilia">pedophilia</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/i/Childlove_movement.html" title="Childlove movement">childlove movement</a>) to ensure that they are NPOV (as in, take into account the pedophiles' rights POV). It's a typical piece of sensational journalism, but it's interesting that no news agency picked up the story and ran with it. It was right around the whole Seigenthaler thing, so it's possible that story acted a smokescreen. Who knows what would happen if it were a slow news day and someone at CNN or ABC discovered this now. — <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 15:13, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I'm inclined to unblock. The kid's page is perhaps a good argument for banning non-encyclopedic userboxes, and maybe a good argument for banning 16-year-olds, and possibly a good argument for banning twits, but we really need to differentiate between banning people for who they are and banning people for what they do. Much as I loathe (for example) Holocaust deniers, until they start putting their crap on article pages, they're just people with stupid ideas. Since most teenagers are pedophiles by definition (since the law considers adolescents to be children), as already pointed out, he can't be one. So, if I were the sort of admin willing to unilaterally start block/unblock wars rather than discussing the issue, the kid would already have been (a) unblocked and (b) told in no uncertain terms his user page makes him have zero credibility and destroys any possible assumption of good faith. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 15:39, 5 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>OK. Calm down everyone. The user in question was just trolling. Even if he did put that box up there to be serious, we would not know if he just was attracted to children (of some young or very young age, who knows...) or if he also tries to trick them into getting into his grasp. Also note that attraction to younger aged people was tolerated long ago, so an <i>attraction</i> alone is not <i>strictly</i> immoral, like Nazism. Although a serious age difference and the possible connotations of such a template do disturb me greatly. I don't mind if a racist or a zoophile or a person who is attracted to girls edits articles constructively. As long as they do not actually try to do anything. And as someone pointed out, active Pedos will likely act like normal people until it is too late. I do consider the context of such templates to be questionable, and like most userbox templates that get people angry, it was just an inflamatory, uncontructive peice of garbage. Nevertheless, it does not warrant an indef. block.

<dd>Less than a generation ago homosexuals were persecuted in small towns because it was assumed they were after little boys - which was rubbish.

<dd>Indeed...While agree with TfD'ing the template, I do not agree with over the top comparisons like "If it is a joke, it's about as funny as identifying oneself as a member of the KKK or a Nazi". Having an attraction is not the same as actually doing anything. I can not stress these points enough. It seems as if there is little sense of moral priority here: some of the comments here seem to suggest that people think that either you are a Pedo and the Nazis or good person.

<p>As far as I am concerned, convicted paedophiles should be blocked on sight from editing Wikipedia. I believe in the rights of people irrespective of class, creed, orientation, gender, etc but morally I draw the line at criminal acts, and potentially criminal acts, involving the sexual exploitation of young people. Many Wikipedia users are themselves children. Many registered users are children. The claim that everything is above board and open is patent nonsense. Paedophiles groom children for exploitation. A paedophile here would have no difficulty in doing that. All they need to do is to target people they know are underage children here through dishonest friendships on talk pages, then use the private emails to make direct contact and use their status as a registered user, or even an admin, to gain the trust of the young user. We already have claims of users tracing private telephone numbers of other users. One user was subject to verbal abuse from someone who stalked them through tracing their whereabouts. In those cases both the victim and the stalker were adults. The idea of what could have happened if one of them was a child and one a paedohile who used Wikipedia to get in contact with them is too horrifying to contemplate. One such scandal if it happened and became public in the media or a court case would destroy's WP's reputation and lead to boycotts by schools, bans by parents, media condemnation, and a host of other problems.</p>
<p>I'll be quite blunt: if I find a paedophile on Wikipedia who <b>in any way</b> abuses their position for sexual reasons with another user, I will block them indefinitely immediately and report them <i>immediately</i> to the police. IMHO paedophiles have no place on this encyclopaedia and should leave or be banned.

<p>Before I start I want to say that I've not bothered to read the entire discussion. I don't understand why a self-identified paedophile would be unable to edit an encyclopaedia or engage in a community. Since someone has already used the dubious term "deviant", I think it is important to distinguish firstly between child molesters/rapists and paedophiles. It is not against the law to be a paedophile (that is, having a sexual preference for minors), it is against the law to rape and sexually harass (the physical expression of paedophilia).</p>
<p>Secondly, why is it sensible to block according to peoples' non-voluntary sexual preferences. As was said early on, we wouldn't block someone because they held racist views - we would block a user if they inserted racist POV into an article. Also, we have, and do have, plenty of users who are paedophiles and who edit Wikipedia but do not put a box on their user page. In the 1960s homosexuality, like paedophilia and bestiality, was considered a mental illness. Would it therefore have been justified to succumb to a sensational hysteria and block all homosexuals (being that deviants are unable to edit rationally)?</p>
<p>Finally, I don't use userboxes myself. I don't personally elect to express myself through a combination of templates. Whether it is a good idea to have an infobox stating a sexual preference for minors is another issue. It is something that should be discussed by the community, not acted upon by those users who are undefiable and unquestionable. --<a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldakQuill_3b15.html" title="User:OldakQuill">Oldak</a> <a href="../../../o/l/d/User_talk%7EOldakQuill_6507.html" title="User talk:OldakQuill">Quill</a> 19:28, 6 February 2006 (UTC) PS. I almost forgot to reiterate that there are no provisos in our blocking policy to allow such blockings.</p>

<dd>Your statement is somewhat inflammatory, since many people believe pedophilia is not "involuntary" (in fact, many people even believe homosexuality is voluntary), but this doesn't change the thrust of the idea, that the ability of a user to contribute usefully to Wikipedia does not depend on their sexual preference, morality, or even past criminal history (not to equate this things with pedophilia). Hell, a while ago we heard of a project where inmates were contributing <i>from prison</i> as part of a rehabilitation program, and it was received quite positively! As long as their contributions are positive and they do not threaten other users, I think we should accept anyone. Also, we wouldn't necessarily block if a user inserted racist POV - eventually, maybe, but assuming the edits were in good faith we'd first go through the less drastic channels of revert, discussion, RFC, etc. <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeco_20f6.html" title="User:Deco">Deco</a> 19:49, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I see nothing against WP policy in blocking someone who posts a userbox like that because it's intrinsically disruptive. Same for a Holocaust denier, not because they have any particular belief, but because throwing up a user box with an assertion like that is disruptive. However, I'd suggest that any block be preceded by a warning to remove the userbox. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 21:39, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think it is perfectly legitimate to block SIPs without adopting a specific policy. They are not good for Wikipedia. Block them. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrainhell_3ced.html" title="User:Brainhell">Brainhell</a> 02:33, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm curious to the rationale of those who wish to ban an entire class of people (who haven't necessarily done anything wrong in wikipedia) to protect kids, but then claim we don't censor wikipedia for the protection of minors. (That isn't to say I'm fond of pedos, just playing devil's advocate... well I guess pedo's advocate, but I digress). -- <a href="../../../j/b/a/User%7EJbamb_757a.html" title="User:Jbamb">Jbamb</a> 17:44, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Am I right in thinking that the issue of whether pedophiles should be blocked won't/cannot be decided by the ArbCom case? ArbCom can't end up establishing some sort of policy on blocking pedophiles if, for example, it considers the block of Joeyramoney made by Carbonite, right? (I'm a little afraid ArbCom might assume there's a consensus some way where there isn't one, which would be bad.) --<a href="../../../a/y/s/User%7EAySz88_15e3.html" title="User:AySz88">AySz88</a><a href="../../../a/y/s/User_talk%7EAySz88_f90d.html" title="User talk:AySz88"><font color="#FF9966">^</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AySz88_57ae.html" title="Special:Contributions/AySz88"><font color="#FF6633">-</font></a><a href="../../../a/y/s/User_talk%7EAySz88_f90d.html" title="User talk:AySz88"><font color="#FF3300">^</font></a> 07:01, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well unblocking without agreement from the blocking admin usually is to be avoided, especially in a wheel-waring environment. However, I no longer agree with the 1 week block. The newbie in question was mainly adding good faith edits (albiet he has a short edit history), and the Pedofile thing was a joke as he was 16 (not a funny joke though). Also, people need realize that "pedophile", by definition, is not a inherently "rapists" just like heterosexuals are not inherent rapist of the opposite sex...Yes, the template could easily be interpreted to refer to "rape", but it at least deserved <i>some</i> minimal discussion, such as the TfD. I wish people would actually know the definitions of words they through around and start using to bash other people. People <i>just love</i> any excuse to bash criminals, most likely to fluff up their own ego while ignoring their own faults. If people put reason, common sense, and process over emotion and blind, incorrect, and uncivil statements...none of this would have happened. Jimbo appears to not even have researched the newbie's edit history.

<dd>While I don't agree with everything else in Voice of All's note, I agree that a one-week block is quite excessive. An otherwise decent new user who makes one stupid userbox should have been let off with a warning not to create sophomoric templates. He shouldn't be punished for the fact that admins weren't mature enough to handle the situation without wheel warring, multiple desysoppings, wikidepartures, et cetera.

<p>It's an unfortunate symptom of leaders these days, both with Dubya, and apparently with Jimbo... the ends justify the means. You've likely already seen the contribs, so I won't bother with that.</p>
<p>The Pedophilia Userbox issue has shown just how dysfunctional, hotheaded and lawless our community has become.</p>
<p>Here's what I saw...</p>
<ul>
<li>Carbonite said he'd block any Pedophiles, basically just for being Pedophiles rather than any rule or guideline.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard&amp;diff=38313867&amp;oldid=38313256" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard&amp;diff=38313867&amp;oldid=38313256" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The only person who fit this was <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeyramoney_c5cb.html" title="User:Joeyramoney">Joeyramoney</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/e/User_talk%7EJoeyramoney_ced2.html" title="User talk:Joeyramoney">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Joeyramoney_8324.html" title="Special:Contributions/Joeyramoney">contribs</a>), who had less than 100 edits, making Carbonite a <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a>/<a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> violator, putting Ashibaka in the right here, trying to stem a huge knee jerk reaction.</p>
<ul>
<li>After being unblocked, Joeyramoney voted on the TFD regarding the userbox, in a fairly repentent tone, likely from a self <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victim_blaming.html" title="Victim blaming">Victim blaming</a> after his treatment from Carbonite. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion/Log/2006_February_5&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=38350734" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion/Log/2006_February_5&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=38350734" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></li>
<li>Jimbo, likely wanting to sweep this under the rug before any major media got wind of it, but forgetting that these things seem to happen just about once a month or so now (Kelly Martin, The No Ads Project, Wikipedians for Decency, Siegenthaler, Fair Use, etc.), <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">IARed</a> and Wheel Warred to block Joeyramoney for a week, like Carbonite, violating <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a> and <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, but that's no big deal since he's violated <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> multiple times, despite the fact that he said it was a faux pas to do so.</li>
<li>Me, wanting desperately to believe that there is some rule of law on Wikipedia, unblocked Joeyramoney since he hadn't really done anything wrong other than being a silly teenager (which we have to AGF since that's what he says on his talk page) and wandering into this mine field.</li>
</ul>
<p>Like i've tried to say, at the top of my lungs, for the past several months, this is a <a href="../../../s/l/i/Slippery_slope.html" title="Slippery slope">slippery slope</a>. If we block people just for being pedophiles, a perception will arise that we are biased against them, and <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophilia.html" title="Pedophilia">Pedophilia</a>, as well as any other related article will be seen as automatically POV by outsiders since the people "running" Wikipedia don't allow Pedophiles to add their side. Today it's Pedophilia, what will be next tomorrow?</p>
<p>Hell, <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimbo_Wales_1525.html" title="Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> is about as POV as <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Gates_65fa.html" title="Bill Gates">Bill Gates</a> is on Encarta<a href="http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761565404/Gates_William_Henry_III.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761565404/Gates_William_Henry_III.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, if someone were to add a "criticisms" section, let me ask you, how quickly would that be reverted? Even if it was NPOV and properly referenced, I could almost guarantee you that given the current state of things here, an accolyte, if not Jimbo himself, would get rid of it almost immediately.</p>

<p>I had hoped that the community would eventually address this, and it seems to be slowly creeping towards it, but there are two roads we can take from here.</p>
<p><b>The High Road</b><br />
Everyone, even Jimbo and the Arbcom, is bound by the laws of Wikipedia, because the laws are the only thing holding in place the ideals of Wikipedia -- an encyclopedic collection of all human knowledge.<br /></p>
<p><b>The Low Road</b><br />
Wikipedia becomes an <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autocracy.html" title="Autocracy">autocracy</a>, and eventually, one of the people hurt by the autocracy will strike back, likely in a smear campaign(see <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swift_Vets_and_POWs_for_Truth_e06f.html" title="Swift Vets and POWs for Truth">Swift Vets and POWs for Truth</a>), or in something even bigger. Remember, we've blocked all of the IPs of Congress before, and we are quickly becoming the top source of information on the internet, and we become discredited as an encyclopedic collection of human knowledge that fits a certain point of view that benefits the Wikimedia Foundation's public persona.</p>
<p>It's up to you all to choose which way we go, I hope you take the high road, but if you do take the low road, i'll still be around welcoming people(at the current rate, I will hit 2000 around mid month)until that autocracy gets rid of me(likely with no real justification under rules and guidelines), sitting back and laughing at the next crisis to come down the pike, and likely being someone those who want to discredit Wikipedia will come to. I have a clear conscience either way, i've done nothing wrong. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist"><font color="#4682B4">Karm</font></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_03e8.html" title="WP:ESP"><font color="#00FF00">a</font></a><a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKarmafist_6c43.html" title="User talk:Karmafist"><font color="#E32636">fist</font></a> 16:32, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If we would all remember to avoid hysteria and take short breaks when angry, we could let things cool down instead of escalating. If I was the troll who'd created the template, I would be very pleased with myself seeing the uproar it has caused. "Slippery slope" arguments are almost always fallacious. <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penguin.html" title="Penguin">Penguin</a> is not edited by penguins, so why should it be desireable that <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophilia.html" title="Pedophilia">Pedophilia</a> is edited by pedophiles?

<li>There is a strength to having a final arbiter of content and policy (that being Jimbo in this case), in that it means that at the top, instead of rules, there is common sense, and that can be used to put an end to people gaming the rules. We are fortunate to have someone who has proven to be both disinclined to get involved in every small dispute and has exercised overall good judgement when he does get involved. The system works because it is pretty open, and because we have had good people at the top (that being Arbcom, Bureaucrats, Jimbo, etc). Wikipedia has never been simply a democracy, nor has it been a pure autocracy -- it mixes elements of both. So long as one doesn't feel the need to be a purist about either, one can deal with the mess of a mixed system and find it to be pretty good at avoiding the faults of both. Jimbo has a lot tied up in Wikipedia, including time, reputation, and presumably finances. Given these things and that he's been around longer than almost anyone else here, I think we can learn to trust his judgement as to what's needed for the good of the project (even if it ruffles a few feathers in the meantime). --<a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImprov_b282.html" title="User:Improv">Improv</a> 19:11, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Jimbo's status isn't revered because he founded Wikipedia; it's because he's taken a position of common sense on every issue presented to him, and thus made himself a good leader for the project. But even so, he is still human and can make mistakes, and people should be allowed to point out those mistakes. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> <small><a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">tock</a></small> 23:16, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>A quick glance at the userpages indicates this is the same person. Looking at contrib's, Fplay appears to be a bot (I'm no expert on identifying one). This may well be an interested person who didn't know what a sockpuppet is (or the extent to which they're frowned upon) and decided to set up a couple of accounts and I wouldn't normally care... But...</p>
<p>Pinktulip ("the person" I've dealt with) is extremely troublesome. Not trolling (insofar as disruption doesn't appear to be the main goal) but a really bad pattern of talk posts. I've noticed (on <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terri_Schiavo_eb3a.html" title="Terri Schiavo">Terri Schiavo</a>, God help us):</p>

</ul>
<p>So, click on his talk contributions (as I did having been put off on one talk page). It's a pile of conceited, assume-bad-faith crap. I don't know what to do with this editor. I'm hoping a truly disinterested third-party might offer to mentor. He obviously wants to edit articles but he appears absolutely unable to do so while dealing with others constructively.

<dd>I have to agree with Marskell. Pinktulip does some good writing, but can come across as hostile and belligerent on talk pages, to the point of causing disruption.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ASeptember_11%2C_2001_attacks&amp;diff=36206272&amp;oldid=36169177" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ASeptember_11%2C_2001_attacks&amp;diff=36206272&amp;oldid=36169177" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> I am not aware that he has misused his multiple accounts to violate policy. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 23:35, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Whilst not wanting to disagree too much with Marskell, who I firmly believe is some kind of superhero (he nommed me for RFA after all), I feel the need to poke my nose in. Whilst Pinktulip can be obstreporous, rambling, and too quick to refer to his own work elsewhere (back to the <a href="../../../t/e/r/Talk%7ETerri_Schiavo_fd37.html" title="Talk:Terri Schiavo">Terri Schiavo talk page</a> again), his intentions are good, he doesn't edit war, and he is willing to participate in attempts to find compromise. Probably his main offense is using rather colorful and (occasionally) misjudged similies, synonyms and metaphors to try and make his point. I think this is more a case of the guy need to have his sharp edges rubbed off, rather than telling him he doesn't fit in the community and singling him out. I always think formal mentoring is a backwards step, and suggests that the person is either incompetent, or incapable of applying good judgement. This is sometimes the case, but is usually only a suitable solution following some kind of request for mediation/arbitration. I don't think mentorship would be the best route to go down; being civil and polite with Pinktulip has worked for me so far, and he's done nothing but respond in the same manner - if his views on what an article should be differ greatly from yours, then that's what a talk page is for. He's obviously more than willing to use them. I don't know anything about the <a href="../../../f/p/l/User%7EFplay_2ef0.html" title="User:Fplay">User:Fplay</a> thing though. A quick look suggests that Marskell is right about the user being a sock of Pinktulip. Perhaps someone wiser and, um, sager could confirm this and have a quiet word with Pinktulip on his talk page about sockpuppets? <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none"><span style="text-underline:none"><font color="#66AA00">P</font><font color="#5C8800">r</font><font color="#326600">o</font><font color="#184400">t</font><font color="#002200">o</font></span></span></a><font color="#888800"><b>||</b></font><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none"><span style="text-underline:none"><font color="#002200">t</font><font color="#224400">y</font><font color="#446600">p</font><font color="#668800">e</font></span></span></a></small> 14:44, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I KNEW I could count on dear, sweet Zoe to never forget a slight. You go girl!</p>
<p>I have never denied that Amorrow=Fplay=Emact=Pinktulip=A_bunch_of_anonymous_work . However, I have mostly tried to avoid the cesspool of the Wikipeia "talk" pages which always degenerate into popularity contests. I am SO sorry for chosing to work on Articles that are "difficult" and usualy deal with real events and living people and current Law and getting the fact straight and getting the details. I am sure that you would prefer that I work on something REALLY important, like the exact and correct categorization of musical garage bands or something relaly important like that.</p>
<p>User:Marskell's exact words when he detected that I had added some new articles to the "Terri Schiavo" category were:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>I'll be expunging most of these. Marskell 14:07, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Based on that, who really thinks that he has the Judgement and Charater to undo my work (which is what he is doing right now) in a fair and balance manner? Would you like him to work on what YOU have created? Any of you?</p>
<p>Terri Shiavo is a big story about laws and people with power. If you have bothered to look at the infomation in <a href="../../../t/e/r/Category%7ETerri_Schiavo_ae74.html" title="Category:Terri Schiavo">Category:Terri Schiavo</a> you will see that relationship are not so trivial as parent-child. While a big powerful politician does a little thing about Terri Schiavo, it matters. OK, <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triple_H_d1db.html" title="Triple H">Triple H</a> merely got converage on national television about his parodies of TS. I can conceed that one, despite the fact that he went on and on about it and millions and millions of people saw him do it. But does it really ruin the rest of the information browsing value by just throwing him in anyway. I did include Dubya or Jeb becuase they are in too many categories already. But oooh... Marskell really, really does not LIKE Triple H now, does he? Oooh.. he trivializes Terri and makes fun of her. Now tell me: does having Triple H in there, despite the fact that he is an entertainment imbecile, really destroy all of the rest of the information that category? I am not going to fight to keep Triple H in the category because he does not matter much. He is much more like a canary in mine: If he is not notable by going on national TV, who else is not notable? Powerful politicians? Huh?</p>
<p>What is the percentage? How deeply does somebody have to be involved in TS before it sticks them? I am not going to fight with "Terri's defenders" to trying and shove all of the power players (and there are dozens of them) into her page or a subpage. I say: if the powerful politician was stupid enough to open his mouth even a little bit about Terri, he gets to join the club. Take a look at Bill Frist. Board-certified physician. Does he know enough not to try and publicly diagnose Terri Schiavo, effectively invoking his valid medical license, based on a video provided by her parents? He does not. That is worth remembering. It is not trivial. Do you want a man of so little judgement to be operating on YOU? Should a man of so little judgement remain Majority Leader in the U.S. Senate. We cannot answer these questions here, but we can do our best to provide the information and make it easy to find. But Marskell, choising to live a coutnry that has NEVER known Democrary, wants it all covered up. He likes it that way it was a few days ago. All hidden away. All that mess and fuss out of the way so that he can defend his precious Terri and keep her pre-1990 pretty, slender young face as the ONLY face you will have to think about. Now, run along children, and do not think about anything but that very pretty (and entirely irrelevant, except for its propaganda value) face.</p>

<dd>I see everyone is having a good time in my honor. Good to see you again, Doc. I understand that there is some concern that I created this template in an effort to make a point. This appears to be a failure to assume good faith. The template was created for my personal use, and was not added to any other pages. I did not recreate a deleted template, and intentionally crafted the template to not be offensive or disruptive. Unfortunately, I have been drawn into a tar pit here, and it seems unlikely that a fair hearing is possible given the prejudice voiced above. I have been blocked before, but I consider myself to have been unfairly targeted due to my unpopular opinions and outspoken nature. I have to say, I am beginning to think that Doc is on a personal crusade against me, based on his comments above, and his previous interactions with me. I hope that this is not the case. --<a href="../../../d/s/c/User%7EDschor_7a19.html" title="User:Dschor">Dschor</a> 13:40, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dschor, being the user who gave notice of the creation of the template in question by you after seeing it at RC, and without any previous contact with you prior to this very message, I must tell you that your assertion of being targeted for your previous activities is completely out of the question, at least when it comes to my public denounce.

Yet, not my personal opinion, or anyone else's here matter anyway, as the whole issue is now in the hands of the ArbCom.

<p>I was on the channel at the time (Sunday evening UTC). It wasn't a policy decision made on IRC - it was a pile of us discussing the {user pedophile} template and finding others to sanity-check our initial "wtf. DIE." reactions to it. (IRC is very good for really quick sanity-checks.) I should note that IRC was very good for calming the forest fire as it occurred - specifically <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Land_1a6c.html" title="User:The Land">The Land</a> running around various talk pages and IRC trying to calm people down. I was unspeakably pissed off by the whole incident and he did a great job calming me down too&#160;;-)</p>
<p>Anyway, using IRC for sanity-checking is IMO quite different from 'making up policy on IRC'. Of course, waiting would be more ideal. Mind you, I still don't see why a blatant trolling disruption template like that wouldn't warrant speedy deletion on sight and why anyone would think keeping it on TFD for seven days was actually a better idea. c.f.

Problem is, the vast majority of the edits from that IP is vandalism, and it deserves a block.

<dd>You're suggesting that some IP ranges could be somehow marked as badlands? Not completely banned, but less trusted than most? Eg, can't create new accounts, no anon-editing from those addresses? It'd be subject to the same sort of scope creep that semi-protect is, but it's a real problem and absent any better ideas, I'd be inclined to look on something like that as a necessary evil.

<p>550 is pretty much as above - a flag on IP blocks to say if they block everything, block anon editing, or block anon editing and account creation. 3706 is different, but not all that different. It proposes a flag on accounts to allow them to edit through IP blocks.

<dd>"this isn't a magic bullet, it doesn't solve all vandalism and it doesn't totally eliminate collateral damage, it isn't any *worse* than the situation at present. It does permit us to deal with a widespread class of vandalism, by non-logged-in editors, in a manner that causes less disruption to other editors than at present. And there is no instance in which an editor who would not find himself wrongly blocked in the current scheme, would find himself blocked"</dd>

<dd>David, my good man. I think of you often and the admin bit that is set on your corresponding user record in the MySQL database that Wikipedia is based upon. You know that I like to highlight the subtle differences between our two countries, especially the rather dull legal differences which, it seems to me quite conclusively, esacpe you attention. I do this because I know how much it annoys you to face the reality of the tragically Lost Empire that you live within, but I am just doing it for your own good and to enhance your grasp of that same reality. Please also keep trying to diagnose my mental illness from your little island. You might want to ask for a few pointers from <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Frist_4763.html" title="Bill Frist">Bill Frist</a>. Go contact him. I find that he is a likable guy. If he files an effective restaining order against me someday, well, maybe I will change my mind about that. But until then, go for it! (You might getting a nicer reception from him if you did NOT mention my name, but do as you see fit) I breathe the fresh clean air and walk in the sunshine of my beloved native land, marveling at my good fortune to be born here and also at how far it is away from where you are.

<dd>Folks: Please get a grip on yourselves. That man is so far away from you Brits. You are in the U.K. and he has only concerned himself about strcitly internal affairs of the United States of American which, after killing a whole bunch of you, threw you royalist British people out over 200 years ago. Really, you are attempting to meddle with the internal affairs of a foriegn country. That does not make diplomatic sense. I have always heard such fine things about you British people and your high sense of diplomacy! He has only concerned himself with the Laws of the USA and your attempts to tell the USA what to do via your remote control is very inappropriate. Please: just go back to concerning yourselves with U.K.-specific matters of which you have some expertise and things will be so much more simple and quite and copacetic. You know what I mean: You Brits concern yourself with <a href="../../../p/r/i/Private_bill.html" title="Private bill">private bill</a> and us Americans will concern ourselves with <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_of_attainder.html" title="Bill of attainder">bill of attainder</a>. But you Brits who used to rule the world when the sun never sat on Britsh Empire and have now you have watched your sun set finally and fotever on your so-called Empire. Again: you Brits just concern yourselves with your internal affairs, and we Americans (and few meddlesome and highly disgruntled Canadians) will concern ourselves with our internal affaris. Always, always remember: Good fences make good neighbors. Even a whole Atlantic Ocean is not quite good enough for you Brits. I will strive to construct a more substantial barrier for you silly English persons real soon now. -- <a href="../../../6/7/2E/User%7E67.127.58.57.html" title="User:67.127.58.57">67.127.58.57</a> 06:16, 9 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>I think some people have found a way to make Wikipedia act in a hasty, potentially irrational manner. Utter the word "Pedophilia" now and you're just as likely to be attacked as not. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 16:23, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I think people got in a huff about SPUI's satire and sarcasm and went on a rampage. As usual, blame isn't 100% one side or the other. SPUI acted foolishly in some cases, but so did some of the people responding to his actions. I decry the recent trend towards deleting entire pages rather than the troublesome content. This is hardly a defensible action. We don't delete entire articles for having vandalism on them, or copyrighted images. Similarly, we should not be deleting entire user pages because of an aspect of it that is objectionable. SPUI reverting blanking of his own userpage was <i>not</i> vandalism. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 16:23, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>There are some hasty statements in the above. Nobody went on a rampage, and this had nothing to do with moral panic. I deleted the page and protected it from recreation, then submitted this action to review. The reason was that the page, as a whole, was deliberately and avowedly being used for purposes incompatible with the project. There were several personal attacks in the history, many incivil edit summaries, as well as incitements to vandalism and attacks on the project. I strongly disagree with the resurrection of the page's entire history and suggest that a more sensible approach would be to selectively delete revisions, so as to discourage SPUI from further activities incompatible with the project to produce a high quality encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 19:00, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've been having some trouble with the user <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobbydoop_8d18.html" title="User:Bobbydoop">Bobbydoop</a> over the past week or so, with him insisting upon reverting to a previous version of the page that contains a link he insist on keeping in the page, but which also contains a number of grammatical and typographical errors. After a number of reversions by myself and some others, he began reverting from several anon IPs, apparently to try to avoid 3RR. Eventually, it came to my attention this this user (and his IPs) have been engaging in this form of disruption - and worse - in school articles since his first edit about two months ago, and has been warned and blocked for it in the past. I placed this text on <a href="../../../b/o/b/User_talk%7EBobbydoop_8971.html" title="User talk:Bobbydoop">his talk page</a> and <a href="../../../6/9/2E/User_talk%7E69.86.130.215.html" title="User talk:69.86.130.215">that of his primary anon IP address</a>, indicating that I blocked both accounts for a period of a week, for the reasons detailed therein:</p>

<p>For what it's worth, there are a <i>lot</i> of AOL proxy blocks going on. Just about every other night, I find that I'm "blocked" because this or that vandal had used the IP. The reason, just so everyone passing by knows, that you don't block for longer than&#160;:15 is that AOL proxies aren't just dynamic: they're shifting. Hence,&#160;:15 is about as long as a person is at a given IP. Blocking for longer than that <i>doesn't block the vandal.</i> It blocks the next poor schmo who gets the address. This is why blocking AOL (and therefore my own poison: Netscape ISP) IP's is very bad juju. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 20:56, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>NOTE: From Theodore7</b>: My experience as a newcomer to Wikipedia has been horrible. Recently, I lost a good friend in a car accident and had to bury him. My heart is broken. That is why I was away. When I returned, I was surprised to find out that I had been blocked for a week. I did not know this, so had to wait until today to write. After careful consideration due to the bad experiences I've had since joining Wikipedia in December: I am leaving Wikipedia. I apologize to all who have had to spend considerable time on what I believe has been attempts at censorship and a witch-hunt. I also apologize to anyone who has taken offense to me. I did not join Wikipedia to be mean, spiteful, nor to fight with anyone. However, I apologize for my mistakes, and for my comments. They were not meant to do harm to anyone. I thought with my experience, and knowledge that I could be a positive member of the Wikipedia community. I cannot say my experience as a newcomer has been positive, it has not. I don't know why I was attacked, but having seen a good friend suddenly lose his life so horribly, I'm sorry, my heart is just so broken. Please forgive me. I am an experienced journalist &amp; editor, and above all, a kind human being. I do know, however, when I am not wanted. So, I will leave Wikipedia. I am sorry for taking the time of others who have had to spend so much time on the RFC and Arbitration. I did not intend to be such trouble for anyone.

<p>Thank you for your kind words. From my experience, what seems to be the problem is that some Wikipedians think a revert is an "attack" on them. How is this possible since all pages are saved after adding information, sources, and common editing? As a professional writer &amp; editor it seems that some Wikipedia members have a problem thinking that anyone's edit is some kind of attack on them. Others have "claimed" particular topics as their own, and act violently through words, threats, etc. Moreover, Wikipedia is going to have to make some rather serious changes to stop the accusations of, and the real "revert wars" which seem to orignate from the confusion that a editor working on any Wikipedia topic is "reverting" - thus, threatening another. How is this so? When the "Save" button is clicked after a Wikipedia editor completes an edit, or addition on any Wiki topic - it <i>automatically</i> reverts. Now, how is this an attack on anyone? Wikipedia has some <i>serious issues</i> to deal with here since this problem affects all users - especially newcomers who are urged by Jimbo Wales to "be bold." There are many Wikipedians who do not take this advice, and rather, claim topics to the point of being hostile to other Wikipedians. These "wars" threaten Wikipedia's reputation. I know. In fact, my newspaper editors refuse to cite Wikipediabecause of their own experiences, and advise reporters to use great caution in using Wikipedia as a honest resource because of the actions, words, and behaviors of administrators who seem not to follow Wales' principles except when it suits them to enforce matters on Wikipedia editors they don't like, or those who add information that they personally disagree with. Newcomers often arrive at Wikipedia with fresh eyes, so it would not be wise to discount their wisdom. It could help to save Wikipedia, and its reputation in the near future. I joined to see if what newspaper editors were saying was true, and sadly, I discovered that it was. I am a fan of Wikipedia, and Jimbo Wales. However, I state that if Wikipedia's leaders don't get their act together soon, and fix these internal issues with some Wikipedia members and administrators, ArbCom, RFCs, etc., that the problem will become larger, and much more difficult to resolve. Already, there are newcomers with some experience on Wikipedia really citing true problems that are similiar - yet, the "biting of newcomers" continues. I would suggest that more "bite" be put into enforcing not "biting the newcomers" because Wikipedia wants to grow - not contract. And, right now, like in my arbitration case (I've been a Wikipedian only since December) as a newcomer, there really isn't much help for us, and there is a "gang-mentality" in Wikipedia that is not a community. There are too many misconceptions about the Wikipedia "community" that is not positive at all, but hostile:- what I have found: personal attacks, and not much <a href="../../../g/o/o/Good_faith.html" title="Good faith">good faith</a> taking place, and an Inquisition-like mentality that borders on censorship. This is not positive for Wikipedia whatsoever, and the word is spreading fast - particularly over the Internet and within professional newsrooms, schools, and universities. There is a serious problem with administrators, Arbitration Coms, etc., and their judgements are turning many newcomers off Wikipedia. This is not good. Not at all. One of the key reasons for this is that many consider a "revert" - which is automatic to any edit - to be an attack on another. This is going to ruin Wikipedia, from my perspective as a newcomer. It has to be fixed. Many longer-term Wikipedians think a newcomer is a "threat" - when they are not. This is going to destroy Wikipedia if things are not changed, and order restored - especially on the subject of what a "revert" really is, and that it should not be taken as an attack on another Wikipedian. Just my two cents, but sometimes, even two shiny pennies can show some wisdom of their own.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheodore7_f3d4.html" title="User:Theodore7">Theo</a> 12:41, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've always thought that one cannot take a copyrighted or trademarked logo, modify it, and release it as public domain or free, as has been done here. I removed the image from the userbox template and nominated it for deletion as a copyright violation. <a href="../../../n/r/c/User%7ENrcprm2026_854a.html" title="User:Nrcprm2026">User:Nrcprm2026</a> immediately grilled me with a list of question at my talk page (<a href="../../../r/e/b/User_talk%7ERebelguys2_747e.html" title="User talk:Rebelguys2">User talk:Rebelguys2</a>) insinuating that my nomination was done in bad faith. He removed all deletion tags and struck my comments on the Images and media for deletion page, the latter of which isn't good Wiki etiquette.</p>
<p>The policy at <a href="../../../l/o/g/Wikipedia%7ELogo_9282.html" title="Wikipedia:Logo">Wikipedia:Logo</a> states that: <i>"Defaced logos or logo parodies should be used with care and not given undue prominence. Parodies of logos can be used in under fair use in an article about a parody site or campaign against some aspect of the operations of the company, but in an article about the company itself, a parody is less likely to be as important or likely to be fair use."</i> This parody has been released as public domain and is used solely in user pages and templates.</p>
<p>I'm not concerned with the content of the userbox, nor am I concerned with his incivility. However, does this image need to be deleted as a copyright violation? I'm leaning towards yes, but I hesitate to revert my changes and have this degrade into an edit war. — <b><a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebelguys2_63db.html" title="User:Rebelguys2">Rebelguys2</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../r/e/b/User_talk%7ERebelguys2_747e.html" title="User talk:Rebelguys2"><font color="#CC5500">talk</font></a></sup> 08:14, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>U.S. law protects the use of trademarks by nonowners for purposes of criticism and commentary. First Amendment considerations override any expressive, noncommercial use of trademarks. "The Constitution is not offended when the [Maine] antidilution statute is applied to prevent a defendant from using a trademark without permission in order to merchandise dissimilar products or services. ... <b>The Constitution does not, however, permit the range of the antidilution statute to encompass the unauthorized use of a trademark in a noncommercial setting such as an editorial or artistic context.</b>" (emphasis added) <i>L.L. Bean, Inc. v. Drake Pubs., Inc.,</i> 811 F.2d 26, 31, 33 (1st Cir. 1987).</p>
<p>Similarly, the Federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995 does not apply to the "noncommercial use" of a famous mark. <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode15/usc_sec_15_00001125----000-.html" class="external text" title="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode15/usc_sec_15_00001125----000-.html" rel="nofollow">15 U.S.C. 1125(c)(4)(B)</a>.

Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc.,</i> 425 U.S. 748, 762 (1976).</p>
<p>The only limit on that right is whether someone might think that the commentary was produced by the trademark owner, and this limit is explicity defined in reference to Boy Scouts. "[A]n author certainly would have a First Amendment right to write about the subject of the Boy Scouts and/or Girl Scouts. However, this right is diluted by trademark law insofar as that author cannot present her subject in a manner that confuses or misleads the public into believing, through the use of one or more trademarks, that those organizations have produced or sponsored the work in question." <i>Girl Scouts of the United States v.

<p>I may have acted under a conflict of interests with regard to this user, so I am listing the details here for review.</p>
<ul>
<li>Nicodemus had a long history of aggression an incivility on afd's. The result was an <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Nicodemus75_56e4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Nicodemus75">RfC</a> filed against him in November 2005. Although I didn't file the RfC, (and Nicodemus has never been uncivil to me), I certified it, as I had reproached him for his incivility <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nicodemus75&amp;diff=28215182&amp;oldid=28100852" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nicodemus75&amp;diff=28215182&amp;oldid=28100852" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> and one various occasions and he had refused to mend his ways <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Doc_glasgow&amp;diff=28215578&amp;oldid=28215426" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Doc_glasgow&amp;diff=28215578&amp;oldid=28215426" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>. Nicodemus refused to respond to the RfC, and indicated that he had left Wikipedia and no longer wished to correspond with any wikipedians <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Nicodemus75&amp;diff=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Nicodemus75&amp;diff=0" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>. I said at the time, his decision was a loss, as civility issues aside, he was good contrubutor - and we had actually got on personally.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Nicodemus, however, returned this week to oppose Brennemans's RfA (having previously done the same for Phroziac’s Arbcom nomination). I felt this was wrong, since he was longer a contributor, and his talk page declined any interaction. I left a note inviting the closing 'crat to consider the vote, and at the same time I removed the 'don't leave messages' note from his talk page, and substituted a welcome back greeting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nicodemus75&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=38513748" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nicodemus75&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=38513748" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>. His response was a blatant 'eat shit' personal attack on myself and Brenneman <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Doc_glasgow&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=38585658" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Doc_glasgow&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=38585658" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>. (There has been continued incivility and personal attacks on his talk page.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Feeling that it was unacceptable for a non-contributor, who was indicating a continued unwillingness to communicate with any wikipedians, to return at will to oppose community elections and abuse other wikipedians, I blocked him indefinitely. Although I stand by my belief that he should be blocked, <i>I realise that I should probably not have been the once to do it</i>. I apologise for this. I am thus removing the block, and requesting other admins to decide what action should be taken.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><small><sup>ask?</sup></small></a> 21:52, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>If everyone would re-read the blocking policy, there's actually nothing in it preventing a necessary block by an involved admin. It's just not a good idea in case your judgement in clouded, and someone else can always do it. But point is, there's no problem where a user can't be blocked because everyone's involved. But from the description above I don't see under what criteria the user was blocked for. One personal attack and a couple bad faith votes barely accounts for disruption, but even then, it's not all that disruptive, just make a note by the votes and that can be taken into account. Done deal, walk away happy. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 03:06, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree that he's been chronically uncivil, and his latest responses are completely unacceptable. However up to December he did make useful contributions, and given the recentness of his latest editing activity (less than two months) I cannot but think that Doc's actions here were needlessly provocative.</p>
<p>The block is merited, but I'd prefer to see a fixed term block in case he should choose to resume his editing. If he comes back and engages in further attacks, the nature of his targets (nearly all administrators) means that we're quite capable of dealing with him at that date, and if necessary we can get the arbitration committee to put him on an official personal attack parole, which would stil enable him to do useful work.</p>
<p>Duration of the block? Oh perhaps one calendar month. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 17:01, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The fact that El C was "wronged" (whether or not he was) has nothing to do with whether you should continue to use your admin powers. Who are you expressing your opinion to and why?

<p>It's your prerogative to do what you think is best, but this does really seem like a childish way of registering disagreement. In a sense it's also a bit arrogant to presume that one's own presence is so integral to the operation of the wiki that one's departure (or abstention from administrating) will have any effect on unrelated processes. This may, of course, just be a reflection of my bias against excessive drama, which I realize is not universal, though I have little respect for those who would rather make a point than get on with encyclopedia-building. — <a href="../../../r/d/s/User%7ERdsmith4_389f.html" title="User:Rdsmith4">Dan</a> | <a href="../../../r/d/s/User_talk%7ERdsmith4_959f.html" title="User talk:Rdsmith4">talk</a> 03:07, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I actually get this fairly often. I just hit the back button and resubmit, the vast majority of the time it goes through with no problems on the second try. Once in a grea while I have to copy my changes, go back to the article, hit edit again, and put the changes back in. I've never had to purge cookies/reload browser/restart computer etc. to get it working again.

<p>I've just removed speedy tags from Template:User UN useless and Template:User Antipope not because I think that the templates are doing anything for the encyclopedia but because they were stretching the new CSD as well an not actually going towards solving the underlying problem.</p>
<p><b>Note 1</b> - A quick look shows that about 2% of existing boxen are actually useful. About .001% appear to cleanly fall under <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html#Templates" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">"clearly divisive"</a>. The vast majority are humorous, attempt to be humorous, or are Dada-esque.</p>
<p><b>Note 2</b> - Every other speedy deletion criteria is for things that would have no chance at passing their respective XfD. The new one is being used for things that would probably pass TfD in the current climate. We've had a few examples of gaming the system by deleting things "out of process" and then taking them to deletion review because DRV is conservative in restoration. This simply <i>codifies</i> said gaming into the rules.</p>
<p>Unless it's only applied to the .001% using this CSD is never going to work. You can't change behavior with rules, you can only enforce it. Especially not when those rules are applied arbitrarily, and without communication to those affected.</p>
<p>The big problem is that it's dead easy for new users to find and place boxen. Some of them have ten boxes before they've made ten article edits, because we've got massive <a href="../../../w/p/3A/Template%7EWP%7EUBS_d89f.html" title="Template:WP:UBS">menu</a> for them to choose from. Rather than throwing our weight around and playing <a href="../../../g/n/o/Gnomic.html" title="Gnomic">gnomic</a> we'd be better served by doing a bit more thought and a bit less action.</p>

The problem, as Aaron rightly recognises, is that if two admins disagree on a speedy on any other criteria, the sollution is to send to xfd, as the criteria are designed to delete those thing that would always be shot after a debate. T1, however, seems designed to give a different result to TfD, and so there is no mechanism to solve any admin disputes. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><small><sup>ask?</sup></small></a> 01:39, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I cannot and have not disagreed with this. I think that userboxen are a total waste of time and effort and every method available to us should be taken to root them out and destroy them. Even the ones that are "harmless" are taking up space, and when the <b>first thing</b> new users do is hang curtains on their user page it starts them off on totally the wrong track. They are here to support the encyclopedia, not the other way around.</li>
<li>The thing is that we've tried the brute force approach, and that was a complete failure. In fact, trying the brute force approach <i>first</i> is why TfD is a no fly zone right now when it comes to "harmless" user boxen. I'm simply suggeting that we attempt to use less bullying, more tact.</li>

<p>The new T1 speedy seems to work reasonably well. It's easy to get the wrong impression of the prevalence of userboxes--in my sampling of over 200 active editors, only around 10% had political, polemical or religious boxes, but the reason you often see lots of votes on TfD is that a small number of editors pay a lot of attention to their user pages and will notice if a template is listed for deletion. Outrage and freedom of speech rhetoric do the rest. So a TfD debate about userboxes cannot be taken as representative of Wikipedia consensus.</p>
<p>I think Jimbo has made statements about userboxes with which I'm sure the vast majority can agree. We shouldn't feel afraid to get rid of rubbish that a few people, many of whom are evidently not interested in using Wikipedia to produce a high quality encyclopedia, want to keep. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 09:59, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Can we, just for once, be pragmatic: the top down "admin-powers" approach simply is not working. I haven't checked in a few hours, but nominating a whole swag of things for TfD doesn't seem to have worked, repeatedly deleting and re-deleting things like GWB2 doesn't seem to have worked, and stretching the new CSD isn't going to work either. This whole "us against them" pissing contest is severly disruptive not because of the boxen but because of the continued quasi-hysterical heavy-handed response to the userboxen. Part of being an admin is supposed to be the ability to <i>resolve</i> disputes, not cause them. Quit playing with the buttons, get off the "stupid newbies" high horse and start talking to people. Shave a monkey and call him dad, the <b>second person</b> I asked nicely to remove a boxen did so.<br />

The questions remains, however: would that project have a corresponding userbox template? – <a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7EClockworkSoul_d5aa.html" title="User:ClockworkSoul">Clockwork</a><a href="../../../c/l/o/User_talk%7EClockworkSoul_028f.html" title="User talk:ClockworkSoul"><b>Soul</b></a> 16:01, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Tony, can you provide links, for the rushed and lazy? Personally I think the antipope template is clearly harmless, and the UN one I would probably count for myself in the 'inflammatory and divisive' category. If there are people who are on this website who are here to make userboxes, rather than an encyclopedia, then I am very worried indeed. However, I would point out that some newbies will find playing with userboxes a fun way to learn how to work the wiki while they are stil finding their feet with articles: we have to watch out about <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a>. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Land_1a6c.html" title="User:The Land">The Land</a> 20:03, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I will back Ec5618 up on this. Attempts at engaging in a civil dialogue with User:JarlaxleArtemis in regard to editing disagreements have been unproductive.<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobbstrd_a943.html" title="User:Robbstrd">Robbstrd</a> 16:18, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>In Jarlaxle's defense, his version IS grammatically more correct than Ec's as per the current reversion. Furthermore, Ec's original comments on his talk page appear to be in response to his "Learn to write" edit summary, which, while not exactly appropriate, isn't offensive to anyone except the thinnest skins around. Jarlaxle told him it wasn't meant to be offensive, and from my view, appeared to be done with the matter, but Ec apparently kept talking about it on Jarlaxle's talk. If I were him, I'd be a little pissed about that too, and delete those comments. Jarlaxle has every right to delete them, as none of them are a warning. I think it all sums up in this, Ec's comment "Please consider discussing this matter. Please consider changing your stance too. and your attitude, perhaps. I have tried to reason with you, please don't force me to file an official complaint.". Ec feels he'd been trying to reason, but Jarlaxle feels that he's an unwelcome presence on the talk page. As an outside observer, I can't say I disagree with Jarlaxle about that. Now I'm not saying Jarlaxle isn't to blame, he obviously violated 3RR. But what I AM saying is that I think there's been far less attempt at engaging him in dialogue to reason with him than there is mentioned here.<a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">⇒</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Iceland.svg_bd47.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/ce/Flag_of_Iceland.svg/18px-Flag_of_Iceland.svg.png" alt="" width="18" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Iceland.svg_bd47.html" /></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Swatjester_088b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Swatjester"><small><sup>Ready</sup></small></a> <a href="../../../r/s/t/RSTA_5dcc.html" title="RSTA"><small>Aim</small></a> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Terrorism_01a1.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Terrorism"><small><sub>Fire!</sub></small></a> 17:24, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And I'm saying your attempts at discussion weren't necessarily well done on his talk page. He answered you, multiple times. You kept pressing the issue. I fail to see where there was a "failure to bother to talk to you or anyone else involved". Look back at the history, he answered you multiple times.

<dd>So help me understand this, Swatjester. The complaint is simultanously that people attempt discussion ("kept talking about it on Jarlaxle's talk", "he's an unwelcome presence on the talk page") and that people do not attempt discussion ("I think there's been far less attempt at engaging him in dialogue to reason with him")? 66.101.59.18 19:38, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>No, and please don't build a strawman. The complaint is that he had every right to delete comments on his talk page, especially if he felt annoyed by the unwelcome presence. AND, that the attempts to "reason" with him were not very well done, and more aggressive than they should have been. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">⇒</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Iceland.svg_bd47.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/ce/Flag_of_Iceland.svg/18px-Flag_of_Iceland.svg.png" alt="" width="18" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Iceland.svg_bd47.html" /></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Swatjester_088b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Swatjester"><small><sup>Ready</sup></small></a> <a href="../../../r/s/t/RSTA_5dcc.html" title="RSTA"><small>Aim</small></a> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Terrorism_01a1.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Terrorism"><small><sub>Fire!</sub></small></a> 19:55, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm sorry, but this is quite an odd thing to say. His 'responses' (the ones I didn't agree with, or tried to discuss) were, in order:
<ul>
<li>Following the assertion that 'my version' was grammatically incorrect: "there isn't anything grammatically wrong. My version is just grammatically better."</li>
<li>In response to a suggestion to refer to the Manual of Style, and the relevant Style subpage: "Anyway, I already have looked at it, but I don't agree with it."</li>
<li>In response, again, to the assertion of grammatical incorrectness: "Sorry, but I can't explain intuition."</li>
<li>Following a comment regarding his own verbal skills: "Whatever." He went on to remove one of my comments.</li>
</ul>

<dd>Following these were another number of attempts at communication, none of which were acknowledged. Note that his responses were brief, at best, and wholly useless at times.

<p>Hello, and thanks in advance for your reply(ies). My classmates created a page on WP called "Colonel Xu." It was mocking our Mandarin teacher. She took it in stride, being the cool person she is. However, they didn't preserve any copies of it, and knowing I was a WP junkie, requested that I help them try to get a copy of it. Could an administrator please let me view it, and then print it out, or to move the "article" to my userspace? I'll be checking here and on my Talk page every couple mins.

<p>Honestly, I don't know what's happened, other than I was auto-blocked and banned for two days. The user <a href="../../../b/e/o/User%7EBeowulph_51f6.html" title="User:Beowulph">Beowulph</a> suggested I get an official account after noting I'd made good edits for a while under my anonymous IP of 24.162.17.96, so I created <a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoice_of_Treason_ae0c.html" title="User:Voice of Treason">Voice of Treason</a>. Now I don't know if it was a previously banned account or what happened, but after leaving a messaqge on my old talk page and going to my new I get the messsage that I'm blocked until the 13th and "I'll be sued in Trenton, New Jersey". Now, I do seem to be able to edit and not be read-only now (though I haven't done anything yet) but can anyone explain what the heck just happened?!? <a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoice_of_Treason_ae0c.html" title="User:Voice of Treason">Voice of Treason</a> 04:10, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Basically, what happened is that your nickname was too similar to one of an infamous banned user, Mr. Treason, which used to utter those words, "I'll sue you in a court of law in Trenton, New Jersey!". One administrator blocked you, and another one unblocked you. Everything should be all right now. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">xd</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a> - <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_edit_counters_Flcelloguy%27s_Tool_0e9a.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject edit counters/Flcelloguy's Tool">help us</a>)</sup> 04:13, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for the clarification. I had a feeling that might of been what it was.<a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoice_of_Treason_ae0c.html" title="User:Voice of Treason">Voice of Treason</a> 04:19, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This user was indefinitely blocked by Jtkiefer a little over a month ago. OceanSplash recently contacted me via e-mail and asked to have his block lifted. We discussed some of his problematic behavior, and he agreed to a sort of informal "mentoring" arrangement whereby I would try to coach him should I see signs of that behavior resuming. I asked Jtkiefer for his thoughts on this, and he said he had no objections to my unblocking OceanSplash so long as I tried to help him avoid the sort of behavior that led to his block. I'm going to give it a crack, and we'll see how it goes. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 06:07, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As Babajobu has summarized above I have no issues with this but as I have told him, I have no qualms about reblocking if OceanSplash continues his previous behavior though hopefully OceanSplash will take advantage of having someone to mentor him. <small><a href="../../../j/t/k/User%7EJtkiefer_5ea4.html" title="User:Jtkiefer"><font color="red">Jtkiefer</font></a><sup><a href="../../../j/t/k/User_talk%7EJtkiefer_123b.html" title="User talk:Jtkiefer"><font color="orange">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jtkiefer_4fd4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jtkiefer"><font color="green">C</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jtkiefer_1273.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jtkiefer"><font color="blue">@</font></a></sup></small> ---- 06:12, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
