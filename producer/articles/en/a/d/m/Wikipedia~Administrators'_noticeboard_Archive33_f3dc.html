<dd>No I am not. It is not required to post here before you put up a RfM. What is on that template are suggestions for how to list the request. And besides Deng, even if you were required to follow it, you posted in the wrong place anyway. The template says WP:AN/I. This is WP:AN. The steps you want to follow are on the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDispute_resolution_d69e.html" title="Wikipedia:Dispute resolution">Wikipedia:Dispute resolution</a> page. First step is to talk and there's been alot of that. Next is one of 5 choices: Informal mediation, discuss with third parties, conduct a survey, mediation and requesting an advocate. The dispute resolution page clearly states that any of them can be picked. There is no required order. I suggestion informal or formal mediation because I'm not sure that the other choices would help here. Both sides are very entrenched. Do me a favor and don't tell me I'm wrong with policy. I've been doing this for 15 months. I've been an admin for 9. I have 20,000 edits. I know the steps. "Of course you are wrong". Of course? Please be civil. Please. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">(cat scratches)</a></sup> 12:32, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

But you are wrong one MUST follow the template. If I hade done as you would have said and directly posted on the meditation page it would have goten denied. Why I chose to post here I simpley because other on the meditation page have posted here. You are wrong in saying that one can just post on the meditation page. The template is something one MUST follow. And it is good that I chose to make an extra post because this one has ofcurse goten dissrupted and has lost its purporse. Now if I would have only posted on the suggested pages and then you would have posted and dissrupted on of them also then perhpas the meditation people could have said; well you didnt really make an attempt to post on the other pages.</p>
<p>Also AND THIS IS THE KEY didnt you just say that the things on the template are suggestions? Well if they are suggestions then ofcurse there is no problem in posting here?</p>
<p>And how long you been doing this is irrelevant. I just proved you wrong, now didnt I? So learn to live with it.</p>

<p>Lots of time is wasted on NPOV disputes. I suggest a new category of protection. If a minimum of five admins decide to protect a section of an article (particularly the intro) then it remains protected until a minimum of five admins object. We might then move to greater stability though I acknowledge the downside of preventing editing.

<dl>
<dd>No. Admins aren't supposed to use their administrative position to endorse specific positions in a NPOV dispute; the protection policy, in fact, forbids that in no unclear terms, and admins have ended up before the ArbCom before for violating it. A successful vote for adminship represents community support for an editor's restraint, stability, and committment to the project; it does <i>not</i> represent, in any way, community support for their views. Therefore it does not confer any special right to impose their view on articles, not even if they can find four like-minded admins to agree with them. An article where five admins are in dispute with five good-faith regular users should be considered a normal content dispute between users, and it should be settled like any other dispute. --<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 21:22, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>You've perhaps misunderstood me here. I had no intention of 5 supporting one view over another. My point was that five admins should be able to agree on a NPOV statement that encapsulates a controversy, particularly in an introduction. i doubt that 5 vs 5 would waste anywhere near the huge amount of time and effort WPians can devote to revert wars. The point of my post was to suggest something new that could cut down on wasted effort. The "something new" is the suggestion that individual sections of an article (introductions for example) may be protected in special cases for perhaps a limited period of time. <a href="../../../m/c/c/User%7EMccready_a493.html" title="User:Mccready">Mccready</a> 13:40, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've taken a quick look, but you should be aware that I am one of the editors that the raiser is taking issue with. Looking in the page history the page was originally created as Wikipedia:Jeffrey Vernon Merkey and moved to it's current place, there is no indication it has ever been listed on RFC. Secondly it's inescapable to mention the content in relation as to if it's a valid RFC, the positions listed are in fact written by the same person, rather than as per the RFC that editors should only edit one opinion. Secondly the use of a list of authors with a vague assertion of some wrong doing is of course inappropriate for an RFC. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User%7EPgk_d0c7.html" title="User:Pgk">pgk</a><sup>(<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk"><font color="mediumseagreen">talk</font></a>)</sup> 21:01, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This might be a done and finished topic as of February 21 but I hardly think that Jobe6 is WoW.

She moved the article <i>Internet Relay Chat</i> to <i>Internet Relay Chat on WHEELS</i> and I'm almost 100% sure she wasn't Willy on Wheels.

Although I do agree with his block, maybe in the near future Jobe6 should be unblocked and see if he wants to contribute constructively again. <a href="../../../m/o/e/User%7EMoe_Epsilon_7345.html" title="User:Moe Epsilon"><font color="#FF0000">M</font><font color="#EE0000">o</font><font color="#DD0000">e</font></a> <a href="../../../m/o/e/User_talk%7EMoe_Epsilon_62b6.html" title="User talk:Moe Epsilon"><font color="#0000FF">ε</font></a> 01:34, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Willy on Wheels has spawned many imitators; in fact, the vast majority of people who move articles to pages "on wheels" are probably not the original Willy on Wheels. Regardless, anyone who vandalises or claims to be WoW will not be tolerated, and the account was rightly blocked by Curp's bot for page moves. However, given Jobe6's history of decent contributions, we can only hope that there is some other explanation; we all should <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> here. Until there is some indication, though, that Jobe6 requests to be able to edit again, wishes to be unblocked, or provides some other explanation, I think the block should stay.

<dd>Yes we're going to have to deal with that when it comes around, we think we'll stand a better chance of survival the other tab sites because we are Gnu copyrighted. Anyways, a law suit against TabWiki would only cause the links to stop working, and as they'd be part of your templates this would be easy to fix. I'm not a legal expert, but I don't think theres any way they could draw Wikipedia into any legal battles. maybe someone knows more on this subject? --<a href="../../../d/i/p/User%7EDiploid_3efa.html" title="User:Diploid">Diploid</a> 15:38, 27 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not a lawyer and not at all certain about this, but it could be <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contributory_infringement.html" title="Contributory infringement">contributory infringement</a>, however unreasonable this seems. I believe that's why the <a href="../../../d/m/c/DMCA_bb76.html" title="DMCA">DMCA</a> offers safe harbor to information locating services, like Google. Having your site under the GFDL will not help you defend against lawsuits. It's still a violations and it's going to make the copyright holders even more frusturated because GFDL sites tend to be reproduced widely (see <a href="../../../m/i/r/Wikipedia%7EMirrors_and_forks_fe2e.html" title="Wikipedia:Mirrors and forks">Wikipedia:Mirrors and forks</a>). <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperm401_861f.html" title="User:Superm401">Superm401</a> - <a href="../../../s/u/p/User_talk%7ESuperm401_06a9.html" title="User talk:Superm401">Talk</a> 00:34, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So, according to my understanding of the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contributory_Infringement_f3f4.html" title="Contributory Infringement">Contributory Infringement</a> page (thanks for the link btw) wikipedia would be performing a indirect patent infringement <b>if</b> online tablature was proven to be in patent violation. And in that if we have our problem, there has yet to be a tablature site that will risk taking the RIAA to court (to my knowledge). Powertabs and Mxtabs, two of the largest tab sites, were the first of many to be shut down by intimidation by the RIAA. On another note I've done some homework and I think tablature could be considered legit in the USA (where both wikipedia and tabwiki are based) since it's definition of a <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctrine_of_equivalents.html" title="Doctrine of equivalents">equivalent device</a> includes the statement:
<dl>
<dd>"A doctrine of equivalents analysis must be applied to individual claim limitations, not to the invention as a whole."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>which would also suggest onine tabbing's legality because although the overall sound of many online tabs is similar to the song, the bars and individual frets ("elements") that make up the song are generally different from the origonal tab (in that they are transcribed from one string to another, or flat out wrong). Basicaly I think the online tabbing community's inaccuracies and newbisms could be our savng grace. Just a disclamer that once again i am not a legal expert, if anyone is please help us out on this one! --<a href="../../../d/i/p/User%7EDiploid_3efa.html" title="User:Diploid">Diploid</a> 03:04, 1 March 2006 (UTC) (excuse my spelling, it comes from engineering)

<p>I read on the Wiki mailing list about Freakofnurture abusing his tools. The complainer said the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Almost immediately after creating account for what would be my first time editing wikipedia an admin blocked me indefinitely.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>username&#160;: Let's Get High And Edit Wikipedia IP&#160;: 69.60.118.148 Reason given "stoner..." by</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This admin describes himself as pissed off and also proudly displays a widget that says he does not do any drugs. I had the impression, perhaps wrongly so, that wikipedia was supposed to be more of an open atmosphere where there isn't such a heavy hand with admin powers. In other words, a place where someone's first visit isn't met with an insult (stoner) by someone claiming to be angry, pissed off and a judeofacist (whatever that is, but it doesn't sound too nice). I really do not see what the problem with my username is. It is silly, perhaps, but not offensive. Thank you</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I asked the admin for his reasoning and he replied on my talkpage with the following statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's a username that promotes illegal activities and can be seen as an invitation to vandalize the site. Also closely resembles the disruptive "let's vandalize wikipedia" and "let's fuck and rape admins" accounts which are typically blocked automatically within seconds of creation. Basically I'd block anything that started with "Let's" on general principal, because it's probably another sockpuppet of the same select few individuals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe this admin abused his tools, because:</p>
<p>1. He is not a police officer, thus, he should not enforce the law on Wikipedia, unless it explicity states so in the Wiki policy; 2. I don't believe that this illegal activity relates to Wikipedia, because, this activity might not be illegal elsewhere; and also, because this falls under free speech. One is allowed to say that he likes drugs; and, 3. Because the admin said he would ban anything that starts with the word "Let's" based on assumption that it is a sockpuppet (I have some problems understanding that argument).</p>
<p>I believe the user in question should be unblocked and offered an apology, while the admin should be dealt with accordingly. --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnittas_0872.html" title="User:Anittas">Candide, or Optimism</a> 08:25, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The appropriate action is to put an Rfc against Freak of Nurture for abusing his admin powers to promote his POV, and then see what the arbcom makes of the case. Nandesuka is right that consuming cannabis is not illegal in many parts of the world, merely because it is (if it is) illegal in the States is totally irrelevant unless we are starting to promote US laws as standard in the world, not appropriate activity for an international encyclopedia. There may be other stuff behind this particular case but to block someone solely for encouraging what is in parts of the world a fully legal activity, and concerning a law whopse validity is questioned almost everywhere but at least a substantial minority has no justification, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 14:21, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes while it would be entirely wrong to block an entirely new user (which freakofnurture doesn't believe this user is) for saying "lets get stoned" there clearly is more than that to this case. The block looks ok but the reasoning (stoner) is clearly not, people with a pro cannabis POV must be made as welcome here as anyone else. Cannabis use is neither universally illegal nor universally condemned and using doesn't hurt others so to class someone who says <i>I love pot</i> as we (rightly) would condemn someone promoting paedophilia or thuggery (though I can think of one user who hasn't been blocked yet claiming he is a gangster while threatening another user). I can confirm that neither freakofnurture or this lets get high user are involved in the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannabis_%28drug%29.html" title="Cannabis (drug)">cannabis (drug)</a> articles and in that sense his anti-pot beliefs have not intruded on the main space, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 14:49, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The username was not nearly so objectionable that a block was warranted. We should block "offensive" usernames only in extreme cases, not as a matter of course. —<a href="../../../u/m/m/User%7EUmmit_38d5.html" title="User:Ummit">Steve Summit</a> (<a href="../../../u/m/m/User_talk%7EUmmit_97c6.html" title="User talk:Ummit">talk</a>) 16:01, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Oh, for Pete's sake. Someone created a deliberately trolling username. Freakofnurture used a bit of humour in his block message. Should he have stuck with the by-the-book boring-as-dry-toast log entry "Username block"? Oh, probably. Is it not unreasonable to expect someone who creates a trolling username like that to have a sense of humour, and accept that we caught them? I think so.</p>
<p>Freakofnurture isn't trying to enforce some crazy anti-cannabis policy. There are any number of Wikipedians with pro-marijuana slogans and boxes on their user pages; FoN hasn't blocked any of them. I'm a Canadian editor, and FoN hasn't blocked me.&#160;:D We've now wasted an absurd amount of time and effort discussing what just about everyone agrees was a good block, just because Freakofnurture had a bit of harmless fun in the block log.

<dd>Exactly. I don't block users whose overall presence is a positive one, regardless of what they believe in. I blocked an inappropriately-named account within seconds of its creation, then released the IP autoblock, so he could create a new one and forget the whole thing ever happened. In the event that this user intended to make positive contributions to Wikipedia (which I seriously doubt) he's probably registered another name, and we may never know who he is (which would be a Good Thing, considering the quantity of bullshit being generated over this issue).

<dd>Well, I changed it again--sorry. I didn't like having the Current surveys link at the top, so I moved it back to the bottom but gave it its own section so it will appear in the table of contents.

<dd>Wait--now that I've changed it, I'm confused. Wasn't the math section in alphabetical order before, and not now?

<dl>
<dd>I hadn't noticed the alphabetical order. My intent was to make the order match the order at <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERfC_a13a.html#List" title="WP:RfC">WP:RfC#List</a>, simply because that makes it easier to verify that the two lists are in sync. If the former order on the /All page makes more sense, obviously <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERfC_a13a.html" title="WP:RfC">WP:RfC</a> could be changed instead. (Sorry; I meant to mention that.)</dd>
<dd>As for the survey link, my feeling (as a dumb user) was that it "ought" to be transcluded onto the page and appear in the ToC like all the others. Obviously it's different and wants to stay that way, so my thinking was that by putting the "See also" link at the top, right under the ToC, it was almost as if it was in the ToC, as a 14th item. It seemed a waste to actually put it in a ToC'ed section, since it's essentially a stub, and it seemed ever-so-slightly obnoxious to make the user click through a second time.

<dd>I understand what you mean, but when I had "Current surveys" up there, my eye went right past it. I'll leave it as it is for now, I guess, and see if anyone else comments or changes it. Maybe there's more that should appear in the "See also" section, like <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAR_b522.html" title="WP:RFAR">WP:RFAR</a> perhaps.

<p>I am getting increasingly concerned about the overuse and abuse of fair use on Wikipedia. The latest thing that I noticed was the use of a {{<a href="../../../t/i/m/Template%7ETIME_c2ff.html" title="Template:TIME">TIME</a>}} template license that was using weasely words and allowing us to upload almost all the TIME covers (copyrighted material no less!) under the banner of <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">fair use</a>.</p>
<p>I have started off the Wikipedia page <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_review_1790.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use review">Wikipedia:Fair use review</a> to discuss this issue further. My goal is to remove all invalid fair use images from Wikipedia, and those that should be on the site should be fully reviewed and a rationale given.</p>
<p>There are two reasons for this review:</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../a/b/o/Wikipedia%7EAbout_8d82.html" title="Wikipedia:About">Wikipedia:About</a> we have written:</p>

<p>The second reason is that we are increasingly opening ourselves up legal liability. You can't just upload an image and slap a fair use tag on it! This, however, is what some editors have been doing, pissing off many in the process.</p>

<dd>I agree with Ta bu about the importance of this issue. The quality, timeliness, insightfulness, and striking nature of the illustrations in TIME, like any other popular media, are a primary factor in the commercial value of their work. It is due, in part, to such illustrations that the public chooses to purchase TIME's product (both new issues, and access to archival copies) when they desire information about events both in the world today and in the past. We must accept that, to a non-trivial extent, Wikipedia is in direct competition with TIME (as well as any other form of popular media), and that our careless use of their copyrighted works to improve the value of articles unrelated to TIME's product is an unacceptable violation of copyright law. Fair use is intended to protect public discourse, so the use of time covers to discuss TIME is usually acceptable. Fair use is not intended to give us an easy way to obtain fantastic illustrations for our articles at no cost. This is a subject matter not likely to be understood by our general userbase without education and support. Ta Bu needs your help. --<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 04:33, 26 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There's an issue of principle beyond the legal issue. This is "the free encyclopedia." 100% free content is neither realistic nor desirable.

<dd>I question this. What non-free images do we actually need? I'd argue that we need none of them. If Debian can produce a 100% free operating system, Wikipedia can produce a 100% free encyclopedia.

<dd>To an extent WikiProject Fair use has created some of the problems, including the one that Ta Bu is complaining about here. The most notable and pertinent flaw in the approach favored by the active members of Wikiproject fairuse is the over reliance on vague boilerplate justifications, and a lack of any concern over the replacablity of the works in question. As far as I can tell, the state of Wikiproject fair use is much like the effort which was made in late 2004/early 2005 to run around and tag unlicensed works as gfdl-presumed: well intentioned but misguided. They've made an effort to improve things, but it seems that most of their actions have as an unstated starting requirement that they don't disrupt the longstanding abuse of fair use on Wikipedia. Unfortunately, a stronger approach will now result in the deletion of tens of thousands of images and *few* users are willing to commit to that sort of effort or the angry response it will draw from uninformed users angered by the loss of pretty pictures.--<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 05:55, 26 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In my opinion, WikiProject Fair use isn't there because it rejects the assistance of users whos idea of correcting fair use problems on Wikipedia involves removing large numbers of images rather than creating lengthy chains of process and pretzel logic in an attempt to justify a fair use claim for almost every image we're already using. Although that is only my personal opinion based on my own limited interaction with Wikiproject Fair use, I believe it is quite clearly supported by fact that the only mention of any form of removing content on the project page is in the context of adding more justifications to prevent the removal.</dd>
<dd>Since there is no mention of removing violations in Wikiproject Fair use's goals, I'd say that this entire discussion is outside of the scope of your project.

<p>I'm not sure if deleting all these covers will do any good, because different people will just upload them again. If you have a template for Time covers, people will assume Time covers are okay to use, and then to delete them later just causes hard feelings in the people who took the time to upload them thinking they were doing something kosher. We should figure out a way to easily prevent people from violating fair use in the first place, otherwise this will be a permanent cycle of upload and delete. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 23:44, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In that case, I encourage admins to start speedy deleting any <i>new</i> images that have existed on the site for more than a day without fair use rationales. The one day limit will give people a chance to upload the image and then add the fair use rationale: I know that it sometimes takes this long to add it when I upload a fair use image. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 07:48, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I am personally going through my past image uploads, by using the image upload log, and based on the new copyright criteria and other things that were instituted, I got rid of about 30-40 of my uploads. Some of them were FU orphans, some were formerly tagged with licenses such as CanadaCopyright.

<dd>It looks like being banned from Wikipedia's IRC channel was the trigger.

<p>"So, you can imagine how upset it makes me to see groups of Wikipedians with plans to make Wikipedia a moderated site. I even saw one group proposing a parliamentary Wikipedia.

"...I do not want my material being used by a foundation that ridiculed and banned me from its IRC channel merely because I was expressing ideas that are supposedly fundamental to its ethos. Banned for supporting the wiki ethos, banned for supporting the "you can edit this article now" ethos. It's a shame, but that's what happened, and that's why I want to leave."</p>

<dd>That is why I used the qualifier <i>usually</i>.&#160;:-) For a template that can bring the whole website down, I would not argue against letting only admins edit it, or creating an even greater level of protection. Still, for templates that are not as critical, I don't think semi-protection is unreasonable, especially when what is high-risk is ill-defined, which leads to non-admins being excluded randomly. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 12:04, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>im sorry but didnt t-mans 6 month block, pass only with second choice votes included therefore making it a second choice resolution to the mentorship, an admin should verify the decison before enforcing the 6 month block<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenon_e558.html" title="User:Benon">Benon</a> 00:10, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'll have to add my voice here, I'm concerned that it was considered passed 8-0-0 (if anything, it should be only 6 (2)-0-0). If mentorship works, I have to question why a ban is needed? <a href="../../../n/s/l/User%7ENSLE_4a42.html" title="User:NSLE">NSL</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">E</font></a> <sub>(<a href="../../../n/s/l/User_talk%7ENSLE_f7ec.html" title="User talk:NSLE">T</a>+<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_NSLE_ad4c.html" title="Special:Contributions/NSLE">C</a>)</sub> at 00:42 <a href="../../../c/o/o/Coordinated_Universal_Time_e510.html" title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</a> <small>(<a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../m/a/r/March_7.html" title="March 7">03-07</a>)</small>
<dl>
<dd>As I noted earlier, the ban passed as well, but is superceded by the mentorship, until such time as the mentorship breaks down or the mentors decide the ban is appropriate. To be clear: T-man should <i>not</i> be blocked at this time. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 00:48, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The two conditional comments under the 6 month ban are phrased in a confusing manner. This is the 3rd draft of this comment, and I'm still working out what Dmcdevit and Mindspillage meant! I think they mean that <i>if</i> the probation passes <i>then</i> their votes to ban become second choices. If there is no probation, then they are simple supports which are further conditional among the 3 options presented for bans. The probation passed, so the ban is 1 vote short of majority. I think. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 00:53, 7 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Okay, here goes (and I think I speak for Mindspillage as well): There were multiple banning proposals on the table. Midway through, the mentorship proposal was made, so we each made the 6-month ban our last choice in the case that the mentorship passed, (which it did), while still supporting both it and the lesser ban proposal. So, even giving our votes precedence, the lesser bans failed due to lack of support, but the supports on the longer ban still hold (even as second choice), so it passes. We did not oppose it. 6 month ban <i>and</i> mentorship pass (and the other remedies). Regardless, the ban is put on hold for the mentorship. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 01:05, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think Dmcdevit's clarification is fine. We go with the mentorship and the ban is waiting in the wings. I think that what is missing from the proposed decision page is an implementation section, a summary by a clerk of what he understands the final decision to be. From now on I'll make such a summary in any case that has entered the vote to close, and I'll also recommend this to my fellow clerks. This summary will be a subsection of the Vote to close section, and can be edited by any other clerk or arbitrator during the voting to close period. When the case is closed, that summary will be copied verbatim to the talk pages of all participants and commentators, to this page (<a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a>) and to <a href="../../../a/e/r/WP%7EAER_9866.html" title="WP:AER">WP:AER</a>. Any arbitrator who signs off on the decision will also, therefore, sign off on the implementation. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 01:11, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's fine for future cases, but what about this case? The wording of the final decision still isn't clear, and Dmcdevit's clarification isn't represented anywhere on the final case page. Indeed, since the final case page says "All remedies that refer to a period of time, for example to a ban of X months or a revert parole of Y months, are to run concurrently unless otherwise stated", it seems to indicate that T-man's mentorship doesn't begin until <i>after</i> the 6-month ban. I understand that that's not the committee's intention here, but the page should reflect that. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 01:22, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Those who want to have political userboxes have been cast as a crowd of n00bs with almost no article edits. This is not supported by the facts. I don't personally feel that political userboxes are useful, I just want to remind everyone that there are many experienced productive Wikipedians who think they are and we should be careful to respect them.

<p>Since there's a tiny possibility that the user-to-user email feature actually could be abused, I've gone ahead and enabled the e-mail confirmation requirement for using email features. This is a bit annoying for the moment since you have to do it separately on each wiki.</p>

<dd>Of course that's his intent, but don't kid yourself that many people are fooled by it. The first links on what links here is the arbcom decision. You could interpret the arbcom decision as a warning that needs to stay, but the rest he can change as he wants. Really there's so many people watching his edits that he's not going to get any vandalism in just because his talk page looks clean.

<p>Ir didn't seem that any of the addresses had been used for anything except vandalism of this article. The week was because the editor (or editors) in question have been doing this for some considederable time, ignoring blocks.

<dd>18!!!!!! Good God, use <b>24</b> only if you must, preferably 26+ if you can. A rule of thumb: If you 24 does not do it, then <i>don't range block</i> (and I have even recieved a SourceForge email to undo a 24-range block for unplugging 1/3 of a city). Another rule: if you are not sure how to get the range block right, then <i>don't do it</i>.

<p>I do not wish to meddle in the affairs of wizards, but I have detailed all of this vandal's activities on this page: User:Gnetwerker/My Notes/Asian fetish vandal, including going through all of the edit summaries to determine whether anyone else was using that IP range.

<dd>The fact that there may be registered users editing from that /18.

<p>I found myself pondering this one day, what would happen if it was confirmed that someone who has a long valued history of positive contributions, under one user name, were in fact one of the more despised, and long hated running vandals?? And this could be confirmed to beyond a shadow of a doubt?? Would they be blocked on sight, or would their +s be allowed to be balanced against their -s?</p>
<p>A second but related <i>what-if</i>, suppose that one day Jimmy Whales woke up only to find that he had a nervous breakdown, and was in fact out of his mind, and decided to use his own account to move pages to completly random titles with the words "<i>cheese</i>" or "<i>on wheels</i>" in them? Is there anything that could be done, or would wikipedia as we know it simply collapse under the mad emperor, page-moving as wikipedia burns...</p>
<p>These two questions seem like two potentially interesting loopholes in established disciplinary practices--<a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhistle_blower_f201.html" title="User:Whistle blower">Whistle blower</a> 22:56, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In the first situation, I would welcome them with open arms, but some people might not be so forgiving. In the few cases this has happened (Wik), the person was discovered because he started exhibiting the same behavior that got him banned in the first place, even though he'd clocked up thousands of legitimate edits in the meantime. If they've completely avoided the old fights and have shown themselves to be good editors, I see no reason why they should not be welcomed.</dd>

<dd>It could qualify as both but either way we can conceivably claim fair use on it. 155.43.145.84 14:32, 8 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>First off, it's orphaned, so fair use doesn't apply as currently, there is no use, and thus the whole question of whether is might be "fair" is moot. Secondly, it just might be fair use in an article on that advertising campaign, if that article discussed the campaign in some detail. It would not be fair use in <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lindsay_Lohan_4008.html" title="Lindsay Lohan">Lindsay Lohan</a>; and is not needed there.

<p>My brother complained to me today that he was blocked from editing Wikipedia. It turns out he was editing from one of 7 indefinitely blocked <a href="http://www.ozemail.com.au" class="external text" title="http://www.ozemail.com.au" rel="nofollow">OzEmail</a> proxies. This prompted me to take a closer look at blocked shared IPs on Wikipedia. I compiled a list of long-term blocked IPs with the {{<a href="../../../s/h/a/Template%7ESharedIP_e2f7.html" title="Template:SharedIP">SharedIP</a>}} template on their user talk page. I then searched for attempted saves in the last approximately 24 hours of logs. Three sets of IPs stood out:</p>
<ul>
<li>The aforementioned OzEmail IPs (203.166.96.234 - 203.166.96.240)</li>
<li>Two proxies from <a href="http://www.isu.net.sa/saudi-internet/contenet-filtring/filtring-mechanism.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.isu.net.sa/saudi-internet/contenet-filtring/filtring-mechanism.htm" rel="nofollow">Saudi Arabia's national NetNanny</a> (212.138.47.15 and 212.138.47.24) -- we were probably blocking everyone in that country</li>
<li>A proxy from <a href="http://www.tpgi.com.au" class="external text" title="http://www.tpgi.com.au" rel="nofollow">TPG Internet</a> (220.245.178.132)</li>
</ul>
<p>I've added all three sets to the trusted XFF list now, so they shouldn't be a problem in the future. The point I want to make is: please don't block ISPs or entire countries indefinitely without researching the alternatives. I'm all for blocking non-compliant ISPs like AOL, but we shouldn't block well-behaved internet citizens for no good reason. If you're having trouble with an ISP proxy, come and talk to me about it on #wikimedia-tech and I'll see if it's eligible for a trusted XFF listing. Blocking whole countries is especially poor form, imagine what the media would do with it if they found someone willing to allege that our <a href="../../../s/a/u/Saudi_Arabia_53d2.html" title="Saudi Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a> article was biased. -- <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim_Starling_d5f6.html" title="User:Tim Starling">Tim Starling</a> 03:42, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Some of those proxies mentioned above (including one of the Saudi ones) were involved in "SQUIDWARD" vandalism. Lately, we've been getting several dozen SQUIDWARD vandalizing IPs every day, and we block them. When we block these, we block indefinitely, because when we tried blocking for 24 hours the same IP usually comes back the next day for more. "Researching alternatives" is not a particularly helpful suggestion. If you can work some "XFF" magic, it would be better to do so proactively and systematically, before a particular ISP proxy becomes a problem. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 04:26, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The range 203.186.238.128/25 (now unblocked) is a Hong Kong ISP, see <a href="../../../r/a/y/User_talk%7ERayleung2709_29d2.html#helpme" title="User talk:Rayleung2709">User_talk:Rayleung2709#helpme</a>, they may use AOL-like IP address jumping. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 05:00, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In general though, we need a better solution to the problem of IP blocks and autoblocks causing <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collective_punishment.html" title="Collective punishment">collective punishment</a>, a practice more closely associated with <a href="../../../g/o/d/Godwin%27s_Law_5a9a.html" title="Godwin's Law">&lt;godwin&gt;</a>Nazis<a href="../../../g/o/d/Godwin%27s_Law_5a9a.html" title="Godwin's Law">&lt;/godwin&gt;</a> than free encyclopedias. There's no other message board or forum site in the world where established users and even moderators or administrators get blocked because of the actions of some hit-and-run third party. Many school IPs are very frequently blocked by necessity, which is bound to permanently discourage many of our most promising young would-be contributors (and in many cases is likely the result of school bullies harassing nerds by effectively creating a denial-of-service situation).</p>
<p>One suggestion would be to create a database flag that gives a user immunity from all IP-based blocks and autoblocks: such users could only be blockable explicitly by username. Maybe this flag could be settable by anyone who places blocks, ie administrators. When you get an e-mail from some legitimate user complaining about being autoblocked, it would be nice to be able to check their contribution history, verify that it's not some throwaway account or vandal, and then turn on the flag and give them the good news that the problem won't recur. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 05:19, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Blocking everyone who hasn't been verified by an administrator seems unnecessarily restrictive to me. After all, how does one get verified, if one has never edited wikipedia before and is never likely to in the future because their entire country is blocked? Would you have joined Wikipedia if the only way to do so was to plead with someone by email? I'd prefer it if blocking code were developed in a direction which as much as possible does not favour established users over newbies. The complaints of regular users give us insight into the effect our blocking patterns are having on new users, and that will be lost if implement a whitelist.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>None of the IPs I listed above appear to be open proxies. There was some squidward vandalism from them, but as far as I can tell, it came from ordinary residential computers using those ISPs -- probably a <a href="../../../z/o/m/Zombie_computer.html" title="Zombie computer">zombie</a> network. -- <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim_Starling_d5f6.html" title="User:Tim Starling">Tim Starling</a> 05:50, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You make it sound like "Blocking everyone" is something I'm advocating, when in fact it's merely an accurate description of the existing status quo. Surely it would be better to have an escape hatch where we can <i>avoid</i> blocking everyone who is forced to use the same IP.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Blocking will always affect users unevenly: some users must share a proxy with a million other users, while some vandals have /16 ranges to play with. Given this reality, <b>blocking by IP address can never be democratic</b>. The only democratic and fair thing to do is to judge users by their own merits, make them accountable only for their own actions and not those of any third party, avoid collective punishment... the only way to do that is to let good users bypass all IP-based blocks and autoblocks.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>Many users already have <i>de facto</i> immunity from all IP-based blocks and autoblocks!</b> (ie, with trivial effort they can evade the ones they themselves caused, and in practice they never encounter the ones caused by any other user). Only this is not based on any kind of merit, but mere random accidents of geography and ISP. And good users who are second-class citizens (many students, AOL users, residents of certain countries, etc) currently have no opportunity to earn the same status that is the birthright of even some vandals. The current blocking code has consequences which are perverse and simply insane.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Yes, what I'm suggesting would treat anons and very new accounts differently than more established users, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Treating all users exactly the same sounds good in theory, but in fact it's repeatedly been shown to be a source of failure in social software: see <a href="http://shirky.com/writings/group_enemy.html" class="external text" title="http://shirky.com/writings/group_enemy.html" rel="nofollow">Clay Shirky: A group is its own worst enemy</a>.

<dd>If someone has never edited Wikipedia before, there are still various ways we could get them verified... all we really need is some demonstration of non-bot human effort, to prove that it's not a throwaway account.

<dd>This would only really be needed in extreme cases (eg, a campus where we truly need to keep the proxy IP permanently blocked 24/7, to pick one real-life example).

<p>It's hard to recall nearly two weeks later what the circumstances were. It's also worth pointing out that no genuine newbie starts out his Wikipedia career by vandalizing another user's userpage, so this could be a sockpuppet of some returning troublemaker, perhaps circumventing an earlier block. It's likely there were some deleted articles, so perhaps the userpage vandalism could have been misguided retaliation for speedy deletion of his article(s). Who knows, perhaps I mistook a genuine misguided newbie for a throwaway sockpuppet account created for the sole purpose of vandalism.

Dschor is <i>banned</i>, and as Dmcdevit has clarified, this includes a ban from his talk page. Non-objectionably in this case appears to include complaining about the ban, a favourite topic of bannees, and one which often gets their ban extended. My protection here follows protection by arbitrator Dmcdevit who protected because the banned user was using it, which was peculiarly reversed by Haukurth. I have reprotected it for Dschor's own good: he cannot now extend his ban by editing it.

<dd>I'm interested in the general issue, not just this particular case. If people generally want to have a policy that says the talk pages of banned users are protected then I'll certainly abide by that. Then it should be codified and applied consistently, which is not the situation now. I notice, for example, that SPUI commented extensively on his talk page during his ban and yet the page was not protected and the ban was not extended (both of which I'm fine with). <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 18:24, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My take would be that normally, such pages should not be protected, as protection prevents other people adding notes to them. If the ban is short, those notes and questions may be important. Protection is always a last resort, and should never happen as a matter of course. However, if a banned user is using his page to troll, carry on the dispute, or continue to fight the case, then protection may be better than extending the ban. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><small><sup>ask?</sup></small></a> 18:32, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(indent) A ban need not mean the protection of banned users' talk pages. It can, for instance, just mean a blanket revert of any and all edits that banned users make to their own talk pages, regardless of value or content. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">D</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><b>e</b></a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">ath</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 16:12, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dschor is not only blocked, he's <i>banned</i>--forbidden to edit Wikipedia. This is why he is not permitted to edit Wikipedia for the duration of the ban, which was instituted by the arbitration commiteee.

<p><a href="../../../q/u/t/User%7EQutezuce_4fd6.html" title="User:Qutezuce">User:Qutezuce</a> has raised on my talk page an ongoing issue he's been dealing with, regarding frequent cut-and-paste moves done by the following users:</p>

</ul>
<p>It's not entirely clear whether this is deliberate vandalism or simply a lack of awareness of Wikipedia's rules regarding page moves. Qutezuce has raised the issue with them, but the editors never acknowledge his talk page posts, and mostly seem to stop editing after his post (at which time a new one starts doing the same thing). Based on this editing pattern and the fact that all of their edits pertain to cartoons (every single one of them has made edits to some combination of <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curious_George_af0c.html" title="Curious George">Curious George</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Fairly_OddParents_90b9.html" title="The Fairly OddParents">The Fairly OddParents</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/o/SpongeBob_Squarepants_8744.html" title="SpongeBob Squarepants">SpongeBob Squarepants</a> and/or <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Pink_Panther_fbb9.html" title="The Pink Panther">The Pink Panther</a>), Qutezuce suspects that it's the same person editing under multiple usernames. But other than the ongoing cut-and-paste problem, their edits tend to be valid and legitimate. And even the moves are legitimate disambiguation (i.e. this isn't a Willy on Wheels scenario); they just use the wrong procedure and then fail to acknowledge any discussion about it.</p>
<p>Any assistance in figuring out what can be done about this would be helpful. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 18:50, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In any event,the second block didn't take (when my initial block expired he was free to edit again). He has continued with the personal attacks, but his article edits since then are not vandalistic in nature. I think that in this case it's better to encourage the improvement in article editing. I really don't mind being called silly names, for now, as long as the articles are improving.

<dd>He has been stating he believes you might be a sockpuppet of User:ChadBryant, and if your complaint here is that he is "outing" personal information, this is awfully strong evidence that you <i>are</i> a sockpuppet of ChadBryant.

<dd>I was dealing with this dispute for a while, and I'm exhausted. Every user involved in it, including Chadbryant, deserves a long timeout. There are personal attacks on both sides. They do nothing but put sockpuppet tags on each other's userpages, and attempt to get each other blocked by gaming the 3RR. These are grown men involved in a years-long dispute about a pro wrestling newsgroup. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 02:36, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've seen an almost identical comment from another admin, so it looks like they are going through admins. I arrived in this by blocking ChadBryant and TruthCrusader for 3RR a couple of days ago. The puppy is baring her teeth; I'm going to try riding herd on this and see where it goes. I have placed a notice on Talk:Rec.sport.pro-wrestling which is a lot more absolute than I usually like to be, basically giving a no-tolerance heads-up. I plan to lecture, and block for infractions without further warning, until they learn to play nice, or the article goes to dispute resolution (which I heartily reccomend <i>against</i>, the amount of accusations in edit summaries alone is excessive, I don't want to think about what they'd do in an Rfc or mediation.) I welcome advice and if you want to keep an eye on me please do; I would prefer other admins were aware of the progress of this attempt.

<p>My two cents regarding April Fools jokes on the main page and elsewhere:</p>
<dl>
<dd>1. Nobody actually thinks they're funny except you.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia and <i>under no circumstances</i> should false information be featured anywhere, especially on the main page.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>3. Wikipedia has reached the point of notability that depending on what is done it could quite possibly receive press attention. We run the risk of coming off as a childish joke project pretending to be "a real encyclopedia", or as a propagator of lies and misinformation. This could considerably compound <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Seigenthaler_Sr._Wikipedia_biography_controversy_919c.html" title="John Seigenthaler Sr. Wikipedia biography controversy">other PR issues</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>4. April Fools jokes are viewed in a negative light by many other Wikipedians, so you're really just asking for trouble.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Considering how Wikipedia is still struggling to be viewed as a serious academic source, I don't think excessive April Fools jokes are a path that we want to go down right now. That being said Wikipedia isn't run by robots, and I don't think it would go amiss to feature <a href="../../../e/x/p/Exploding_whale.html" title="Exploding whale">Exploding whale</a> that day or do something of the sort. Whatever's done though, <i>don't wheel war</i>. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanderson7_df2b.html" title="User:Canderson7">Canderson7</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECanderson7_595d.html" title="User talk:Canderson7">talk</a>)</sup> 20:53, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Nobody actually thinks they're funny except you.</i> This statement makes no sense. If the "you" is addressed to an individual, then it's plainly false; if it's addressed to you-plural ("y'all", as they say in the American South), then it's meaningless.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And considering that major and respected news media, to give a major example, have no problem with the concept (witness the BBC's "Swiss Spaghetti Harvest" of 1957, <i>Sports Illustrated'</i>s "Sidd Finch" story, and NPR reporting the sale of Arizona to Canada -- complete with actual interviews with Arizona's governor and Canada's foreign minister. This whole hypersensitive concern with Wikipedia's image is misplace, in my opinion. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 00:35, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The "you" refers to the person making that particular April Fools joke. It is true of jokes in general that what one person and perhaps more than one finds very funny will appeal little to <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;compare_sites=&amp;y=r&amp;q=&amp;url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;compare_sites=&amp;y=r&amp;q=&amp;url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">a wider audience</a>. "Major and respected news media." Wikipedia is certainly major, but in the vast majority of academic circles it is not yet respected. At the time of their April Fools jokes, those organizations you mention were not struggling with the image crisis that Wikipedia is at the moment. Far from hypersensitive, my concern with Wikipedia's image is a result of current perception (that it's a joke reference source that no one should really take seriously). As I said though, this does not mean that April Fools day should not be devoid of humor, merely that a thought be given to the wider scheme of things and Wikipedia's role as an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanderson7_df2b.html" title="User:Canderson7">Canderson7</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECanderson7_595d.html" title="User talk:Canderson7">talk</a>)</sup> 03:47, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I do hope that, regardless of whatever shenanigans they may be carrying on themselves, admins will also be manning new page patrol on that day to deal with the enormous number of nihilartikels we're likely to get. Some of the April 1 hoaxes from last time were still showing up at AfD in the fall. I'd also remind everyone that April 1st in wiki time lasts nearly 48 hours, from midnight on the 1st in New Zealand to midnight on the 2nd in Hawaii. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChick_Bowen_2101.html" title="User:Chick Bowen">Chick Bowen</a> 04:15, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was looking at the article "Brian mccann" expanding it, and I realized that the last name was not capitalized, which irritates me. So I created a new page, telling myself I'd just redirect the old page, and then went to redirect and realized I could've moved it and saved the hassle and that I did exactly what is asked not to do.

<li>No info was merged, but there is info there re trading strategy that doesn't appear to be in the older article (the one at the proper name). I did not merge it (bcz i know too little abt the game to know whether or how to add it), but i left a substantial note abt it on the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Talk%7EBrian_McCann_%28baseball_player%29_2c93.html" title="Talk:Brian McCann (baseball player)">talk page</a>.</li>
<li><i>If</i> there had been no content worth merging there, the history would need eventual merging <i>anyway</i> (by someone), lest editors who are more concerned than you about this double-check for it in an endless stream. <i>Nothing</i> but rdrs should in the long run be left anywhere in the main namespace with an rdr at the top of the history.</li>
<li>I don't <i>really</i> think it's my business as an editor, to set priorities for other editors, and IMO my use of "you" in my first cmt in this section might suggest i was criticizing you for doing half (or 10% of) the job i would have done. I regret that suggestion (and to the extent that that notion was influencing my mind at the time, i'm embarrassed by my slip). I should have more clearly confined myself to pointing out that in such situations, there is <i>another</i> job left to be done, by someone moved to do so. Especially so since admins doing both jobs when they do the rdr part is far from sufficient; those of us aware and concerned abt the problem need to specifically turn over the rdr "rocks" (to see what content "crawls out") -- more often than i do. But perhaps there could be a bot-built list of rdrs with non-rdr versions below them, for us to hack away at, instead of our searching "what links here" pages for rdr's &amp; displaying their histories.</li>

<p>From other posts I learned quite a bit. ADMINISTATOR'S HACKED ON WIKIPEDIA TO GIVE THEMSELVES ADVANTAGES!!! Some person said that the founder of wikipedia left wikipedia empty, so then somebody must have hacked on wikipedia to change the main page so that only admins can edit it, and make an administrator an official position. I am not accusing anybody but I want to know if this hypothesis is wrong. I am not saying the hacking was bad, but I mean, is there anyone out there who could actually hack on to this site.

<p>Since key templates and legal pages are protected, it follows that perhaps policy pages should be protected as well. People should not be able to vandalize policy pages as it can create confusion to new users, just like a comprimised template (like "flux"), possible worse. I also see no need for policy pages to be openly editable, as there is almost nothing to update (unlike an article); there is almost never a serious reason to edit them. I wonder if this could be considered policy, since permanent protection policy does not yet mention policy pages. Perhaps we could avoid things like this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Semi-protection_policy&amp;action=protect" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Semi-protection_policy&amp;action=protect" rel="nofollow">[26]</a> from happening. <b><a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoice_of_All_a6ef.html" title="User:Voice of All"><font color="blue">Voice</font><font color="darkblue">-of-</font><font color="black">All</font></a></b><sup><a href="../../../v/o/i/User_talk%7EVoice_of_All_cf88.html" title="User talk:Voice of All"><font color="blue">T</font></a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Voice_of_All_b66c.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Voice of All">@</a>|<a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="darkgreen">ESP</font></a></sup> 12:49, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think you're forgetting that this is a Wiki.

<dd>As I said, even if there are some now, one can point them out, I am sure that an "ti" instead of an "is" not as bad as "GMDOS{FMS COMMUNISM" as the whole article. People should discuss changes, even breifly, and then have them implemented. "Clarifications" are often not seen as just that by others, so it better to just discuss in the first place. I never said that there was "no reason to change anything", but that people can <b>discuss it first</b>, just to repeat for the third time, <i>I do not think that the pages are perfect and can not be improved</i>. I think that 1) discussion is better (and often needed anyway), 2)there is far less need to update than articles (like changing events) and 3)vandalism is not worth it. I would hate to se an S-Pro'ed page and go to the policy pages only to find a large penis, and for a policy page too. I would no want to tell a new user to read NPOV when it say "WIKI IS COMMUNISM...-WoW".

<dd>I would protect legal/HTF templates and policy. Other articles need IPs, as there is a lot to say about and add to an actual article. Many need modifications, so some vandals are worth the cost. I can not stress this enough...articles need to be updates...many are not NPOV or wikified right and these are simple things that anyone can do without consensus. Policy pages have no such need for all of these edits, there are fairly stable and require consensus support. There are no "current event policy pages" or anything of the sort. So no, my argument only works on the trio, not every type of page, such as articles. If we semied every articles, we would loss a lot of good potential edits. If we semied(or full-pro's) a policy page, we would stop some vandalism, maybe 1 minor edit a month that was not specifically uncontructive.<b><a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoice_of_All_a6ef.html" title="User:Voice of All"><font color="blue">Voice</font><font color="darkblue">-of-</font><font color="black">All</font></a></b><sup><a href="../../../v/o/i/User_talk%7EVoice_of_All_cf88.html" title="User talk:Voice of All"><font color="blue">T</font></a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Voice_of_All_b66c.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Voice of All">@</a>|<a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="darkgreen">ESP</font></a></sup> 18:39, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why start using protection specifically pre-emptively to specifically exclude anons from editing some particular pages? What benefit does this yield? It sends the wrong message: "you can edit anything apart from These Important Things because We don't trust you to do that yet". Semi-protection is bad enough when it is applied indefinitely to a certain high-profile article, but applying it to documents we often refer newbies to, either in templates or messages would not benefit the Wiki at large whilst giving an unfortunate first impression. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 19:23, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>Having non-editable policy pages gives new users a worse impression than an occasionally vandalized policy page would. It's an extreme solution to what's basically a nonexistent problem. I can appreciate that you're trying to help by suggesting this, but there's no immediate need for this course of action, and it goes against the concept of page protection being an exceptional measure.</p>

<dd>They can be sub-delegated, but it means the delegate can't take the IP addresses and move them to another provider. Say BigTelco gives 256 IP addresses to SmithCorporation. They might read in WHOIS as being delegated to SmithCorporation, rather than BigTelco. But, if SmithCorporation decides to change internet providers, they have to get a new bunch of IP addresses. Whether SmithCorporation uses them statically or dynamically - you can't tell. Though if the vandal comes back on the same IP, just keep making the block for longer amounts of time. They will get bored. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchmuckyTheCat_0da1.html" title="User:SchmuckyTheCat">SchmuckyTheCat</a> 07:23, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

My impression is that their tiff centers around the removal of wikilinks for dates (which, of course, is the <i>most important thing possible</i> that these editors could be working on), but it also seems to center around other stylistic issues (eg <a href="../../../m/i/c/Micrometre.html" title="Micrometre">micrometre</a> vs. <a href="../../../m/i/c/Micron.html" title="Micron">micron</a>).

<dd>Bobblewik appears to be a little reluctant to get the hint from his previous blocks that, at present, policy, guideline, or other thing aside, his edits are not going to stick. They lack the kind of support that is needed for such massive scale changes, whether you do them semi-automatically, automatically or manually. If you encounter resistance, you <i>do not</i> go and do another 1000 after promising to stop. He shouldn't be surprised that he's gotten blocked again. He clearly hasn't learnt the lessons of earlier blocks and so a temporarily-indefinite block until he indicates that he's going to stop it is probably reasonable.

I think that someone who repeatedly goes against consensus in this manner (this is not the first time this has happened) ought to be blocked; an indefinite block pending an explanation sounds fine to me. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color:#072764">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color:#c6011f">79</span></a> 19:30, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia is the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit. Wikipedia depends on volunteer editors to improve it. Wikipedia depends on <i>you</i> to improve it. Therefore, whatever you are working on right now is <b>the most important thing possible</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Sometimes, other editors who are not as quick-thinking as you may not immediately realize the value and importance of what you are working on. They may try to drag in irrelevant concepts such as "consensus" or "verifiability" or "NPOV". They may even, misguidedly, revert some of your edits. This is an unavoidable occurrence, and nothing to be concerned about. Simply rerevert the changes, and proceed -- after all, you are working on <b>the most important thing possible</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Because of the importance of your work, Wikipedia gives you a number of powerful tools which will help you perform your work speedily. You are encouraged to <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">be bold</a>. You are free to <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">ignore all rules</a>. It is much more important to improve the encyclopedia than to slavishly follow policy, and what improvement could be more important than yours, which is <b>the most important thing possible</b>?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Don't let anyone tell you that your work is not important. Some editors place an undue emphasis on actual, verified facts, but factual content is worthless unless it is properly presented. Readers will be badly confused if some articles use British spelling and some use American, or if some section headings use <font color="blue">All Capitalized Words</font> while others capitalize <font color="blue">Only the initial word</font>. Ensuring consistency of these vital details is not only important, it is <b>the most important thing possible</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Proper article titles are also extremely important. Articles are referred to, and can only be found or linked to, by their titles. A wrongly-titled article might never be found, or worse: the false implications of its wrong title might give a reader dangerously wrong impressions. For example, if the topic of an article is occasionally referred to by a more popular name, it is permissible to have a redirect stub under the popular name pointing at the correct name, but the real article must, obviously, always have the strictly correct name. Remember, correctness is not a popularity contest. The content of an article may be important, but ensuring that the article has the correct title is <b>the most important thing possible</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Sometimes, you may become disheartened at the progress of your important work. It may seem as if every other idiotic editor on the project is ganging up on you, all simultaneously unable to appreciate the importance of your work. Do not lose heart, however: you are carrying on a sacred tradition; you are not alone. In fact, there is <a href="../../../l/a/m/WP%7ELAME_0afb.html" title="WP:LAME">a special gallery</a> erected to commemorate and celebrate the valiant efforts of unsung heroes like you who were willing to work, despite the costs, on <b>the most important thing possible</b>.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The corollary to this then should be: If you feel something is wrong, you are likely not the only person to see that it is wrong. If you cannot fix it, you can take comfort that <b>you are not the single point of failure</b>. Either some other editor will eventually correct it, or some other editor may eventually convince you that it was not wrong. --<a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 20:52, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Tony that material was clearly original research the way it was used in the [[Cuba[[ page. IT was implying something that was NOT cited. It was claiming that the statement above was wrong based on cited information. The statement above these sources claimed that Cuba runs a two tiered segregated healthcare system. The statement that was deleted was als pov and said something to the effect "Clearly this ignores data which suggests the Cuban healthcare system is one of the best in the world" and cites ciafactbook as source. CIA factbook sources rank life expectancy and child mortality rates, 1. niether of which tell us that the healthcare system is great, 2. neither of which tell us that the segregated healthcare system doesnt exist.</p>
<p>The way the citations are used is Original Research!</p>

<p>No, it was clearly deleting sourced information. Tony did not see the complaint only the immediate fact of deleting information, he like most administrators jumps to conclusions before properly examining the circumstances. You are still off track. (Gibby 06:37, 11 March 2006 (UTC))</p>

<dd>I move to give KDRGibby a 1RR limitation.

<dd>There is no explicit provision in the remedies to impose a 1RR limitation. The existing remedies ought to be enough.

<dd>Thank you very much, Jmabel to allow me to present these articles to you. Excuse me by advance, I do not write English very well. Let to me very introduce to abort the author of these articles to you: it acts of Gilles Marchal who is a very talented French artist years 1970; It does not sing any more but on the other hand, it writes very good texts on various events of the French history. These texts are not fictionalized, insofar as all that he writes true, is checked thanks to very precise research with the public records.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, Gilles Marchal introduced there a new element: humour. All that is told true, and is often ignored of the public, but simply treated with much humour. By the French wikipédia, there were many people who adhered to this style of writing, in particular a club of professor of history and librarian of the university of Grenoble, which take for pretexte the texts of Gilles Marchal to feed their debates. I add that there is no financial aspect with these presentations. The site is completely free access. I think sincerely that these bonds, not only do not withdraw anything with quality articles, but can give a new and different approach to the manner of approaching them.</dd>

<dd>With regard to the aspect of the page (that you find very ugly), I am quite sorry, I am not very gifted in design, however, the texts can be read on a file pdf created to more easily print the accounts suggested.

He was just objecting to a previous block, which was groundless, and also objecting to the vandalism of an article he'd contributed which he'd spent some time researching. I think anyone would object to being treated like that. I think it is clear that the block was really just on the grounds of his sexual orientation. I hope that everyone here agrees that blocking a contributor for their sexual orientation is every bit as abhorrent as blocking them for their race, sex, age or any other aspect of their human nature.

<dd>As long as his desires are not acted upon (Wikipedia is not totally neutral, things like murder, theft and pedophilia are assumed to be wrong), all that counts are his contributions.

<dd>Thanks for the reply. To be honest, I wasn't aware of his edits of <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_offender.html" title="Sex offender">sex offender</a> or <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_grooming.html" title="Child grooming">child grooming</a>. However, looking at them now, they look like honest attempts to improve the article. Of the edits you link to, the first is indeed a reversion with no explanation in the edit summary or talk page, but it is by <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a>, not <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERookiee_acb7.html" title="User:Rookiee">Rookiee</a>. Willmcw's reversion was later undone by another user, 24ip, with the explanation that the material that Willmcw tried to re-add was a duplication of that at <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_sexual_abuse.html" title="Child sexual abuse">child sexual abuse</a>. The current article bears much more resemblance to Rookiee's version than to Willmcw's, suggesting that the Wikipedia community at large prefers Rookiee's version. The edit to the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_grooming.html" title="Child grooming">child grooming</a> article that you link to is uncommented, true, but is not a "large deletion of content". Rookiee added much more than he removed, and what he added covers much the same ground as what he removed. So you are again mistaken. In any case, neither of the articles you mention has been edited by Rookiee since last November, so clearly they have nothing to do with the recent ban. If that's the evidence for the prosecution, there is no case to answer. -- 195.93.21.102 02:01, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the reply. I agree that his manner could be improved, but I haven't seen these trollish reversions you mention. I've just checked through all of Rookiee's article edits for this year (there are very few), and can't see anything wrong with them. In fact, his user contributions show not a single edit to any article at all between the expiry of Jimbo's temporary block and the commencement of Neutrality's indefinite one. All he did was complain on <a href="../../../j/u/s/Talk%7EJustin_Berry_6548.html" title="Talk:Justin Berry">Talk:Justin Berry</a>, and edit his own user page. Were there any article reversions in the same period that have since been expunged from his user contribution page? If you could present some evidence that Rookiee has been acting as a "trollish revert warrior", that might be helpful. It still wouldn't convince me that trolling was the sole reason for the ban, though, because then the block reason would just be "trolling", not "pedophile trolling". After all, if you saw someone block a user for "gay trolling" or "Jewish trolling", would you not be suspicious of the blocker's motives? -- 195.93.21.102 02:01, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'd like to see some firmer justification for this block given (diffs etc). I've examined his edits briefly, but it's not obvious to me that he was trolling. Equally, neither was it obvious that he <i>wasn't</i> trolling, but when admins indefinitely ban a user, and delete (not just blank) his userpage, it should be very obvious as to why.

<dd>I agree. It looks to me like he was blocked because he protested his not being allowed to edit <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justin_Berry_85b1.html" title="Justin Berry">Justin Berry</a> on the talk page. Jimbo did block him for a short period of time for this, but it certainly isn't worth an indefinite block.

<dd>My cursory examination of his contributions doesn't reveal anything obviously worth a permanent block but of course I may be missing something and I'm probably more lenient than most.

<p>I too find no trolling worthy of an indefinite block on Rookiee's part. Regarding the links provided above, it is true he deleted a large portion of <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_offender.html" title="Sex offender">Sex offender</a> with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sex_offender&amp;diff=27102001&amp;oldid=26114764" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sex_offender&amp;diff=27102001&amp;oldid=26114764" rel="nofollow">this series of edits</a>, but that wasn't trolling: he was breaking it out to create a new article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Child_sex_offender&amp;diff=27102030&amp;oldid=26819361" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Child_sex_offender&amp;diff=27102030&amp;oldid=26819361" rel="nofollow">Child sex offender</a> out of a redirect. These actions was reverted by <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">User:Willmcw</a> with the rollback button as if they were vandalism.

(All of this took place on November 1, making it ancient history by now.) I don't want to get into a semantic argument over whether pedophilia is a sexual orientation, a paraphilia, a mental illness, or what, but while having sex with children is illegal, declaring a sexual attraction to them in and of itself is <i>not</i> illegal. I thinking labeling him a troll and vandal and blocking him indefinitely without so much as an RfC, let alone an ArbCom decision, is supremely unfair. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a>/<small><i><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a></i></small> 16:32, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Are we getting to the part where somebody unblocks him, or what?

<dd>That doesnt sound appropriate. What are your reasons?

<p>I'm looking for an admin from the Greater Vancouver area to help back me up on something. In the <a href="../../../s/t/u/Wikipedia%7EStub_types_for_deletion_254f.html" title="Wikipedia:Stub types for deletion">stub types for deletion page</a>, several people are trying to get several of WikiProject Vancouver's stubs deleted. The problem is, this would veto the agreement made collectively by the WikiProject's participants. Here's the situation...</p>
<p>If you're from the area, you would know this already, but there is a distinction between Vancouver proper and Greater Vancouver (or the GVRD) made by those in the area. Both "Greater Vancouver" and "GVRD" are common names for the area. However, the guys who want the stubs deleted cannot seem to comprehend that and are proposing that the GVRD stubs be merged with the ones for Vancouver proper. However, the participants of the WikiProject had found this problematic, because of the distinction between the GVRD and Vancouver proper, and had beforehand reached an overwhelming consensus on creating a different GVRD stub category for non-Vancouver proper articles (all but 3 people agreed; it was pretty much a landslide).</p>
<p>Now they are arguing that "GVRD" cannot possibly be the common name for the area, despite the fact that those guys are not residents of Greater Vancouver (and, by the sounds of it, have little concept of how municipalities are laid out here). The reason why I want a Vancouver-area admin is because I'd like to have someone back me up on this, because the other WikiProject participants seem to be staying out of this, and because I'm now fighting alone, those guys are threatening to veto an overwhelming decision that was made by the participants for the sake of stub categorization and what they seem to be expendable. Even if you don't agree completely with my point, there's no disregarding this threat -- that a few people can effectively overrule a decision made by many, and by those who understand the region best because, well, we live here.</p>
<p>I'd appreciate if any admins from the Vancouver area are willing to support this. Even if you're not from the area but have a thorough understanding of the GVRD, I'd love to see you too. Thanks. --<a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBuchanan-Hermit_699c.html" title="User:Buchanan-Hermit"><span style="font-size: 13px; color: #3366FF;">Buchanan-Hermit™</span></a>..<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Buchanan-Hermit_9eb7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Buchanan-Hermit"><span style="font-size: 8px; color: #669900;">CONTRIBS</span></a>..<a href="../../../b/u/c/User_talk%7EBuchanan-Hermit_6a2c.html" title="User talk:Buchanan-Hermit"><span style="font-size: 8px; color: #669900;">SPEAK!</span></a> 02:37, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

Secondly, I can't find any mention of {{<a href="../../../g/v/r/Template%7EGvrd-stub_72c7.html" title="Template:Gvrd-stub">gvrd-stub</a>}} on the WikiProject talk page (aside from mention 2 days ago of the present SFD discussions); is there something I'm missing? Should {{<a href="../../../g/v/r/Template%7EGvrd-stub_72c7.html" title="Template:Gvrd-stub">gvrd-stub</a>}} come up for deletion (currently it sounds like there's more of an inclination to just rename it and the oddly-named category), if there really is that much support from the other WikiProject participants, then a few of them could voice their opinion on SFD.

Stop by his talk page, or find him on IRC, and tell him we appreciate him. <font color="#696969"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> <sup><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><i>Talk</i></a> • <i>Contact</i></sup></font> 14:26, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Could we not put a notice on the user talk page telling users when they are blocked? Could we do it when the user is unblocked?

<dd>Interesting, thanks. Let me be more specific about my question. A user finds out about a new message just by opening an article page. They see:
<ul>
<li>a banner on any page that they open</li>
<li>a link in the banner to the new information</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>That has some advantages. For a start, reading pages is what people do when using Wikipedia for its primary purpose. What would be involved in giving these advantages to users that are blocked or unblocked? <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblewik_fbc0.html" title="User:Bobblewik">bobblewik</a> 11:46, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem is that people just browsing (for example, AOL IPs) might be blocked accidentally, and then they wonder why they're blocked; they didn't do anything. While we obviously need to tell them they're blocked if they try to edit, there's no need for them to know while they're just browsing.

<p>I was going to suggest <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalliburton_Shill_8a32.html" title="User:Halliburton Shill">User:Halliburton Shill</a> change his username because, as his user page explicitly states, the name is meant to imply some sort of collusion between Halliburton and Dick Cheney. In fact, some other user had already nominated his user page for deletion. Howerver, having had (very minor) disagreements with this editor over some links he wanted put into the <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Cheney_58d2.html" title="Dick Cheney">Dick Cheney</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halliburton.html" title="Halliburton">Halliburton</a> articles, I decided that it would be best to avoid any appearance that I was simply making him change user names out of some sort of petty squabble.

<p>I'm pretty sure I know exactly what the problem was with Tawkerbot2.</p>
<p>When the database gets overloaded for some reason, existing pages can sometimes display incorrectly. When this happens (say for Jimmy Wales):</p>
<ul>
<li>In the regular (non "edit page") view: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jimmy_Wales" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jimmy_Wales" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jimmy_Wales</a> , the page appears not to exist even though it does: you get the <b>Wikipedia does not have an article with this exact name</b> message. In other words, it appears to be either a deleted page or a never-created page.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In the "edit page" view: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jimmy_Wales&amp;action=edit" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jimmy_Wales&amp;action=edit" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jimmy_Wales&amp;action=edit</a> , the <i>same</i> page appears to be blank even though it isn't: you get an empty textarea. In other words, it appears to be an existing page that is blank (or has been blanked), which is not the same as a non-existent (deleted, or never-created) page.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
I have actually observed the above behavior (often, it's lasted only a minute or two, however this time it lasted a good deal longer). The problem is, the second view above (the "edit page" view) is completely indistinguishable from a truly blank page (eg, a page that has been blanked by a vandal).</p>
<p><br />
I'm pretty sure Tawkerbot2, like many other Wikipedia bots, examines the "edit page" view rather than the regular view, because then it can extract the Wiki markup directly from the textarea (the alternative would be to try to parse the raw HTML source). But in doing so, it becomes vulnerable to the database-overload glitch mentioned above: suddenly, edits can look like they've just blanked a page. Tawkerbot2 reverts what it believes are blankings, but actually aren't.</p>
<p>Note, this only applies to complete blankings... if the page is replaced by any text (no matter how small, even only a few characters like "POOP!!!"), there are no false positives.</p>
<p>To avoid false positives, when the edit-view textarea shows an apparent blanking, the bot must load the page again, but this time in the regular non-"edit page" view, and examine the raw HTML source to verify that it truly does represent a blank page.</p>
<p>This can be a bit tricky because it's not good enough merely to look for the tell-tale <b>Wikipedia does not have an article with this exact name</b> which reveals that it is a false positive, because the database overload condition might have gone away in the interval between the first "edit page" view load and the second non-"edit page" view load. Also, one difficulty with parsing the raw HTML source of a page is that it can be randomly changed by developers at any time (including the exact wording of the <b>Wikipedia does not have an article with this exact name</b> message), as opposed to Wiki markup which isn't subject to random change in this way.</p>
<p>Bottom line: to make Tawkerbot2 safe, you should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Temporarily turn off reverting for total page blankings (100% size reduction) but keep it turned on for partial or merely near-total page blankings (any size reduction less than a full 100%). In this mode, you could restart Tawkerbot2 immediately.</li>
<li>Implement the workaround described earlier (a second verification of raw HTML source of the non "edit page" view, to check for false positives). Once this is in place, Tawkerbot2 could safely revert total page blankings as well.</li>
<li>As mentioned above, the glitches only occur when the database gets into an unusual state and Wikipedia pages display falsely.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
Ultimately this is the fault of the Wikimedia code... it shouldn't falsely report a page's status, even under unusual conditions of database overload. There's a workaround as described above, but at the extra time-and-bandwidth cost of reloading the page a second time in the regular (non-edit-page) view.</p>

<dd>This thing is making errors besides the DB problems.

<dd>No, it is the DB problems. Please read what I wrote above: the DB problems cause the page to appear falsely: it causes the page to appear to be blanked, and that throws the bot off.

<dd>The bot log reports it to be a "content blanked" revert, which leads me to believe its the db at fault. This has happened a few times in the past (once every thousand reverts aprox) and we were scratching our heads as to why this was happening but this makes sense. The bot has had these errors in the past but as the db was only having problems for a short peorid of time, only one edit was involved which complicated debuging. As for monitoring, the bot does report to a (password protected for fairly obvious reasons) website which shows the reverts and reasons (as well as reports for all actions the bot checked with an user / quick contrib/block links) If anyone wants access send me an email and I'll give you the auth. -- <a href="../../../t/a/w/User%7ETawker_141a.html" title="User:Tawker">Tawker</a> 21:14, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>From what I can see, the DB problems started as early as 14:02 UTC. For instance, my own monitoring showed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Slobodan_Milo%C5%A1evi%C4%87&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=43589800" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Slobodan_Milo%C5%A1evi%C4%87&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=43589800" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Theodore_Roosevelt&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=43589867" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Theodore_Roosevelt&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=43589867" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> as page blankings, although they obviously aren't. However, at that time it was only a few isolated cases... some time later, <i>every</i> single article started appearing blank or non-existent, in the "edit page" and non-"edit page" modes, respectively. I think the DB wasn't locked until some time later (14:47 or so). -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 16:17, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My comments here follow from Curps' first "to be safe" bullet above. Even before today I was already thinking that the bot maybe should do something with 100% blankings besides reverting them. Mostly because of the cases where someone improperly handles a copy-vio. These cases need a little more finesse than the bot has. Add to that the problems today and less frequently earlier with false positives of blankings, and it becomes more important. My idea is that, instead of reverting 100% blankings, the bot log them to a subpage in it's user space. Then anyone who wants to patrol blankings can Watch that subpage. Enough people Watch it, and we'll have blankings reverted fairly quickly. And because it'll be humans doing the reverting, you'll have human judgement of when to warn, when to direct people how to correctly handle copy-vios, and when we have false positives. - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasAndroid_b0eb.html" title="User:TexasAndroid">TexasAndroid</a> 16:42, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Why would you replace a copyvio with a 100% blanking though? It's very easy to take this to be vandalism. There should always be a copyvio tag on it... even non-admins who handle copyvios should be aware of this. And note obviously that there will sometimes be a valid pre-copyvio version, which should simply be reverted to, without any copyvio tagging. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 16:51, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The problem is those that are not aware of this. These are good faith edits to handle copy-vios. Yes, they are handled incorrectly, but the fact that they are well intentioned, not vandalism, is why they need a bit more finesse than the "vandalism" message that Tawkerbot2 slaps on the page. The person who did the blanking needs to be directed to instructions for how to properly handle copy-vios, not bit by a vandalism warning. It's really an issue of the warning rather than the revert in this case, and more specifically the wording of the warning.</dd>
<dd>That all said, I had thought there were a couple of examples on the bot's page of people complaining of this. However, going looking for them now, the only thing close I can find is an example of the DB glitch bug having causes the bot to undo a well-done copy-vio edit. So this may all be moot if this has not actually happened. - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasAndroid_b0eb.html" title="User:TexasAndroid">TexasAndroid</a> 17:13, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ok, I've killed the bot for now pending the fixes, sorry about my delay, this happened during my 5 hours of sleep and seeing as the bot was running with basically no problems I left it on overnight. I'll disable blanking for now and put it back up, it should be able to catch the mass bot attacks and most of the "gibberish" pending a fix on the blanking problem. I'll look into having it check the main article page and if it reports a blank page first, maybe that will fix it.</p>
<p>As for the "mis-redirects" and copyvio's without the copyvio tag, I'm still at a loss for how to handle those, the bot can't account for every single human error. If anyone wants they can have a look at the code, it's on a password protected wiki and I can send you the password. I'll have a look and see what I can do and report it back here.

<p>Recently-banned user <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> frequently refers to himself as the "RJII Project,"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:RJII" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:RJII" rel="nofollow">[34]</a> and has implied that he is paid to edit Wikipedia. As of November 2004, he has made <a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/count_edits?user=RJII&amp;dbname=enwiki_p" class="external text" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/count_edits?user=RJII&amp;dbname=enwiki_p" rel="nofollow">over 20,000 edits</a>, or over 40 a day, averaging 22 per page. His <a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/contribution_tree?namespace=0&amp;user=RJII&amp;dbname=enwiki_p" class="external text" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/contribution_tree?namespace=0&amp;user=RJII&amp;dbname=enwiki_p" rel="nofollow">contribution tree</a> shows a clear focus to his edits. While such activity should be commended -- he has, after all, contributed greatly to the encyclopaedia -- I feel that his motivations are a cause for concern. He has implied that the goal of his "project" has been to shape a new "reality" with regard to certain things. I fear that much of this "shaping" probably involves a great deal of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ARJII&amp;diff=43519771&amp;oldid=43519666" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ARJII&amp;diff=43519771&amp;oldid=43519666" rel="nofollow">[35]</a> We are presented with a couple of evident possibilities: (1) that a partisan person/organization, with funding, has been shaping the encyclopaedia to fit a particular POV; or (2) that a partisan person/organization is using the encyclopaedia to present its own research. There are also other disconcerting possibilities that I'm sure I don't need to list. The question is, what can we do? Do we just hope that, if these edits are against Wikipedia policy in some way, they will be corrected by other editors over time? The implications are unsettling -- can any well-funded person/organization mount such a focused campaign, and how will that effect the encyclopaedia as a whole? --AaronS 18:00, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Absent any concrete evidence to the contrary, we have to assume that editors are acting in good faith and represent the (unpaid and otherwise uncompensated) will of a single person.

<p>Hello! I wonder if I can get a second opinion on this matter. <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDecadeZone_cc36.html" title="User:DecadeZone">User:DecadeZone</a> has been adding a list of redirects to the article Jonathan Bowers. All of them seem to be vocabulary for large numbers which was coined by the group Bowers is associated with. Should these redirects be left alone, or should they be nominated for deletion? There are quite a few of these redirects, and they seem to be vocabulary that is not widely known in the mathematical community. I have not seen this before on Wikipedia, but something does not feel quite right at the moment. What are your thoughts? --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> 23:14, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Quite a bit of history to this. Jonathan Bowers page existed before for as he is notable for his work on <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polychoron.html" title="Polychoron">Polychoron</a>. Other names of large numbers got deleted through AfD. This contained a table which included Bower's names. The table was cut and pasted into the Bowers page by an anon. I and the anon did quite a bit of work cleaning up the table. I suspect the anon <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.192.107.242.html" title="User:64.192.107.242">User:64.192.107.242</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDecadeZone_cc36.html" title="User:DecadeZone">User:DecadeZone</a> are one and the same, but doubt they are Bowers so not "vanity", not technically "OR" as the page reports on original research. Bowers work is quite sound mathematically, with a notation not far removed to some very distinguished mathematicians <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conway_chained_arrow_notation.html" title="Conway chained arrow notation">Conway chained arrow notation</a>, I'd probably say notable, as they are probably the largest numbers every described, but don't think they are notable enough to warrant individual redirects.

<dd>Hm...after some thought, this appears to look more like a content dispute. Some of those redirects I think should be nominated for deletion - I don't think they can be substantiated to be completely attributable to Jonathan Bowers - quick internet searches show that some of them are like <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologisms.html" title="Neologisms">neologisms</a> or even <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protologism.html" title="Protologism">protologisms</a>. I have an inclination to delete them via <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_neologisms_5320.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms">Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms</a>. In the meantime, perhaps we can politely ask these editors not to add more redirects? I will do this right after this post. The length of these posts is indicative that this situation is sort of in a grey area, so personally I'd feel more comfortable taking a bit longer to resolve everything, even at the expense of having these redirects present on the site for a longer time. I will nominate some of them for deletion in a few days, if no-one else has done so. I haven't talked to any of these editors yet, so let's assume that they really think that these are encyclopedic links - perhaps this is also an opportunity to tell these editors about our "best practises" on Wikipedia, and hopefully we can come to some sort of mutual understanding about this material. In any case, can I suggest that we move further discussions over to Talk:Jonathan Bowers? Probably the better place for it now. --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> 05:42, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Richard Arthur Norton (1958- ) was extensively involved in the discussion of fair use that came out of <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_comment_Ta_bu_shi_da_yu_2_0ed1.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for comment/Ta bu shi da yu 2">Wikipedia talk:Requests for comment/Ta bu shi da yu 2</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Ta_bu_shi_da_yu_2_1765.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Ta bu shi da yu 2">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Ta bu shi da yu 2</a>, and elsewhere.</dd>
<dd>I think I may have butted heads with him a bit on that subject, so I wouldn't feel it appropriate to get involved in an adminnish sort of capacity. Nevertheless, this editor is <i>definitely</i> aware of copyright concerns on Wikipedia. Knowingly uploading a large number of images under an illegitimate Creative Commons license tag just isn't kosher, and is the sort of thing that I expect would draw the wrath of Jimbo.</dd>

<dd>(Edit conflict) Thanks for that link, but that wasn't the question. I already was certain that I could ban him if he continued, which Jimbo's statement confirms. I'd even do it without that statement; being sure that Jimbo would back me up after the fact if needed. Not having interacted with this user until I discovered his spurious license claims, I can handle the blocking issue myself. It's very simple: he uploads <i>one</i> more image that is, IMO, intentionally mis-tagged, and he'll get a loooong block. But I need help <i>cleaning up his uploads; even if it's "just" deleting them</i>.</dd>

<dd>I have silver halide images of over 500 photos of early aviators and early movie stars. The aviator images were distributed or sold by the hundreds at each air meet, and collected by a family member who died in 1940. The ones I have posted are now in my possession. The movie star images come from the same collection. Very few of the images that remain are labelled or autographed. The ones I have posted are from matches I have been able to find at: aviation web sites; or where someone has helped identify the aviator from a posting; or where a duplicate in the collection was labelled. The bulk of the identified collection, and the original personal effects were split between the University of Texas; the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum; and other family members. If your not comfortable with me releasing them using "cc-by-2.5" as coming from my early avation archive, I will release them under a "publicity" license. No image is intentionally mistagged nor are claims "spurious".

<dd>I see things have moved quickly since I quit yesterday. (Can't be around 24/7.) I think running OrphanBot on Richard's uploads to automatically {{subst:nld}}{{subst:nsd}} all those that are under a CC or GFDL tag is an excellent idea. Once nsd/nld'ed, he (and we) would have 7 days to properly tag them. (Outright deletion, OTOH, is panicking: many of these images could be useable, sometimes because they actually are PD, in a few cases maybe under "fair use"—though I would object to just "fair using" them all. Especially those old aviator images fall in this "maybe useable" category. Images like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:HeLa.jpg&amp;diff=43707040&amp;oldid=43356832" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:HeLa.jpg&amp;diff=43707040&amp;oldid=43356832" rel="nofollow">Image:HeLa.jpg</a> are a different kind altogether. The big problem is that things like the HeLa image or those Meadows Foundation houses' images have damaged his credibility so much that I'm reluctant to accept this person's say-so on the subject of the aviator images.) <a href="../../../l/u/p/User%7ELupo_5a34.html" title="User:Lupo">Lupo</a> 08:06, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I must say, however, that I am surprised to find out that indeed he has been blocked indefinitely. There was no hurry to do that: I have always, here and on his talk page, said that I'd do so <i>if he continued to upload images and falsely tag them as being under a free license</i>. He has <i>not</i> done that anymore after my (admittedly very stern) warning, so I don't see the need for an indef block at this stage. A block would make only sense if it were needed to stop the inacceptable behavior; but in this case, it seems the warning was sufficient to get the point across. (The discussion at <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html#Richard_Norton" title="User talk:Zscout370">User_talk:Zscout370#Richard_Norton</a> seems to agree with that.) <a href="../../../l/u/p/User%7ELupo_5a34.html" title="User:Lupo">Lupo</a> 08:06, 15 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>Dear Administrators, In recent days I have noticed that some userboxes referring to the views on regional policy were removed. They include the supporters of: independent Chechnya, Kurdistan, Montenegro, Kosovo and Metohija and many others. I do not know the reason, I can only suspect that they have to do with NPoV. In my opinion NPoV should refer only to articles, not to userboxes put on the pages of the users. But even if one accepts the rule that it should also refer to userboxes, then all the userboxes referring to unity/separatist movements of possibly generally referring to regional policy (or maybe politics in general) should be removed. I cannot see the reason why <i>Independent Kosovo and Metohija</i> userbox should be banned, while the one <i>This user opposes the independence of Kosovo and Metohija</i> should be kept (which is the case now). Why <i>Independent Chechnya</i> is banned while <i>Independent Quebec</i> or <i>Independent Basque Country</i> is OK. I ask you to either <b>restore all the userboxes</b> or <b>remove all of those supporting either unification or separatist movements or the opposition to them</b>. I think a serious discussion should be made on the use of userboxes in the context of NpoV. The following questions should be answered:</p>
<p>1) Should (and to which) extent NPoV refer also to Userpages? 2) If the answer is yes then it should be defined what issues should and what issues should not be displayed. If any issue should not be displayed it should be the whole issue.</p>

<li>Jasra, I think what was and wasn't kept is somewhat random due to the mass deletions and undeletions, although the more popular userboxes might have fared better than others.

<dd>He may be a trained linguist, but what are his qualifications as far as Dravidian Languages are concerned. he seems to be making a lot of baseless allegations. He blatantly says that tamil does not have the word naal. Without even basic knowledge of Dravidian languages, how can he tell that such word does not exist in Tamil. We are happy if he contributes or edits the page, but he should limit his work to THE LANGUAGES IN WHICH HE IS TRAINED and not IN LANGUAGES ABOUT WHICH HE KNOWS nothing.</dd>
<dd>By the way, being a linguist or an Administrator in Wikipedia does not confer him a right to call others insulting names. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoctorbruno_d35f.html" title="User:Doctorbruno">Doctor Bruno</a> 16:26, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I know of another admin who has phoned schools and recieved a good response. I'd suggest calling the school and speaking to the IT department (or if it is a grade school, to the principal/headmaster) and see if that doesn't get better results. <font color="#696969"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> <sup><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><i>Talk</i></a> • <i>Contact</i></sup></font> 19:29, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I think it is only worth the effort to contact them if they have been warned repeatedly and don't stop or if they did something that was particularly damaging. If it was a single, minor incident, it might not be a good idea to get the person in trouble, lest they vandalize Wikipedia again in revenge. They might be deterred from doing this by the possibility of getting caught again, but they could access the Internet from home or another location instead of school or work. For cases that are worth pursuing, I think Essjay's suggestion is good. A letter would probably also work better than an email, but a phone call would probably be the best. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 08:49, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Seal clubbing is a legal occupation as are many others in the meat and fur industries.

<dd>I think that Wikipedia is overly sensitive about usernames, but I don't think the fact that it is a legal occupation in some places makes it an appropriate username according to policy. Prostitution is legal in some places, but someone with "hooker" or "whore" in her username would probably be blocked. Whether a username has a high potential to be offensive or disruptive is probably the most important factor in deciding whether to block it. I believe that this name falls under the inflammatory username section of the <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUsername_0c30.html" title="Wikipedia:Username">username policy</a>, which bans "Names that promote or refer to violent or otherwise illegal real-world actions." It only has to be violent to fit the criteria, though seal clubbing is illegal in many countries. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 08:31, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Username blocks are not only for the "protection" of other Wikipedians; they are often for the "protection" of the user. This user is certainly welcome to contribute under this name, but should not be suprised in the least if other Wikipedians are offended and take a defensive stance towards them. Using a questionable username is an individual decision, but it requires the user to realize and accept that they <i>will offend some contributors</i> and that their experience here will be harmed for that. With all the other reasons that contributors have an unpleasant stay here (check the history of this page, RfC, and RfAr for suggestions of <i>other</i> reasons that a contributor's stay might be unpleasant), is it really worth <b>adding</b> an inflammatory username to the pile?

<dd>No. "Objectivity" in philosophy is not the same as, e.g. journalism. It is technical to the discipline. Extraneous, non-philosophical bull has already been removed to their pertinent disciplines and a search for "objectivity" needs to go to the disambiguation page.

<p>Can administrators try to make it a priority to watch featured articles? There was a piece of very blatant vandalism that remained on there for almost half an hour, and everybody ignored it. This sounds like a rather trivial issue, but I suspect some aren't watching it due to systemic bias. Well, anyway. It just aggravates me further because my connection is unusually slow today. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Elle <small><sub><font color="#CC9920">vécut heureuse</font></sub></small> <small><font color="blue"><sup>à jamais</sup></font></small></a> (<a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENatalinasmpf_9405.html" title="User talk:Natalinasmpf">Be eudaimonic!</a>) 14:55, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The user who posted had, just before they posted, reverted some vandalism to the main page featured article, their contrib history shows. They must mean that. I'd counter by saying it doesn't take an admin to monitor for and revert vandalism. There's a limited number of us and we do the best we can! (I, for example, have the featured article <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a> on my watchlist, as that's an interest of mine, and I've reverted vandalism within the last few minutes). --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 15:48, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's probably just chance on how fast vandalism gets reverted; it depends on who's watching, at what time. Vandalism on the main page FA is usually reverted relatively quickly. Another possibility is that the people who helped write this and nominate this FA (<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a>, if my memory serves me correctly) probably aren't logged on at this time, due to time zone differences. Again, though, most FA vandalism is reverted extremely quickly, regardless of the article.

<dd>One time the complaints about link spam from <a href="../../../a/t/i/User%7EAti3414_5690.html" title="User:Ati3414">User:Ati3414</a> boiled over into a mediation request <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_mediation/Rejected_2#External_link_regarding_the_age_of_the_Earth" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_mediation/Rejected_2#External_link_regarding_the_age_of_the_Earth" rel="nofollow">[59]</a>.

<dd>This is exactly the same thing again, but on a wider scale involing many physics and relativity pages. It appears that a consensus has already been made. People continue to remove his spam, yet he refuses to accept the consensus and have the links to his pages be taken down... he sees it as a personal attack. Also I'm not an admin, so I can't block as you suggested. Is that really the only option? It seemed counterproductive last time as it only enraged him. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregory9_32be.html" title="User:Gregory9">Gregory9</a> 19:18, 16 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Agreed, but if it's not a question of agreeing with the guy, but him violating Wikipedia policy, it is blockable. If there is a clear consensus against the actions, and there is a clear and polite warning to stop, then continuing is simple disruption and any admin can block for that. <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a> is more useful in this case than RFAR because it can establish or clarify a consensus, and that should be done before wasting time at RFAR. If there is already a very clear consensus that wouldn't be needed, but having it all in one collected space is helpful for enforcement. And no it's not the only option, listening to the consensus is a good one, but it the user refuses to do that and continues to be disruptive they are choosing that option.

<dd>Actually, please set up an RFC, formal or informal, but include a concise description of the problem, the pages he is linking to, and specific diffs as evidence of his edits and requests to stop. Don't make it an attack piece, just make a neutral discussion to get to the bottom of the issue and establish consensus to allow moving on. He doesn't appear willing to listen to others at all from what I can see.

<dd>I haven't seen any evidence of innapropriate editing from him, but I have seen plenty from you. How about start by stopping adding links to your site and writings. That's the minimum because there's already a consensus for that. You can put formula's in using latex if you didn't know that, but it sounds like the stuff you are linking to is what people felt wasn't appropriate for adding to articles based on our policies. It's not that hard to follow the rules here, just spend some time reading the policies people have pointed out to you. At your current rate you'll be blocked from editing soon, and there's no need for that, we'd rather have you help, but you're not doing well at that so far. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 04:55, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The one that you removed on the Trouton-Rankine is a 1908 paper, virtually impossible to get, the books don't even mention it so I wrote the whole article. Because the books do such a poor job at explaining them and because the original papers cost about 30$ a pop, I decided to write them. I saw a lot of very bad explanations on wiki so I decided to link them in. There is no way to add 5-10 pages to an existing post, the links are the only way. I can remove my name from the papers.

<p><a href="../../../a/t/i/User%7EAti3414_5690.html" title="User:Ati3414">Ati3414</a> has stated in so many words that rather than adding content to articles by editing, he uses links to small PDF-documents that he as written (presenting well established knowledge only) because of the amount of work that would be involved in writing up the formula's in Latex.<br />

Ati3414's write-ups may be suitable to serve such a purpose. Judging from Ati3414's conduct and attitude, my assessment is that Ati3414's aim is self-promotion. --<a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleonis_cb3e.html" title="User:Cleonis">Cleonis</a> | <a href="../../../c/l/e/User_talk%7ECleonis_c345.html" title="User talk:Cleonis">Talk</a> 12:55, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>We just had a stream of a couple of hundred vandal attacks in the space of less than a minute. All had the Edit comment "SQUIDWARD!!" and replaced the entire article content with [[Image:Squid.jpg|left]]. See, for example <a href="../../../a/r/m/Army_Men_%28game%29_696b.html" title="Army Men (game)">Army Men (game)</a>. Most worrying, the edits were done by a wide range of anonymous IPs. Some posted this several times, some just once. I'd guess that at least 30 separate IPs were used. This has all the hallmarks of a co-ordinated bot attack. Needs further investigation? This same bot could be used for something more malicious. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> 17:37, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would like to remind newer admins and those who rarely focus on dealing with vandalism, (only when it affects their favorite article, for example), that any IP addresses used for "SQUIDWARD!!" vandalism should be blocked indefinitely rather than 24 hours, as these are all <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_proxy.html" title="Open proxy">open proxies</a> or <a href="../../../z/o/m/Zombie_computer.html" title="Zombie computer">zombie computers</a> (otherwise nobody could have access to such a variety of unrelated IPs), and blocking for any shorter duration will result in the IP being re-used in the next attack, because the shorter block always takes preference. Note that "indefinite" <b>does not</b> mean "forever" and that if any legitimate users are affected by this phenomenon, they can have be unblocked once a system administrator confirms that the gaping hole in their network security has been fixed, and blah blah blah... — <small>Mar. 16, '06</small> <tt class="plainlinks"><b>[18:10] &lt;<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakofnurture__f15d.html" title="User:Freakofnurture/">freakof</a><a href="../../../n/e/w/Special%7ENewpages_26cd.html" title="Special:Newpages">nu</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA">r<sub>x</sub></a><a href="../../../r/a/n/Special%7ERandom_5382.html" title="Special:Random">ture</a><a href="../../../i/p/b/Special%7EIpblocklist_2536.html" title="Special:Ipblocklist">|</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" rel="nofollow"><font color="#002BB8">talk</font></a>&gt;</b></tt></p>

<dd>A couple of those are egregious, the others are fine, but it only takes one considering this is exactly what he was prohibited from doing. And by the way banning him from an article is different than blocking. I would say those demonstrate either an unwillingness or inability to be civil in anything relating to the nuclear topic. So a block's probably not in order, but banning from those two articles does seem so, and enforce that with a one week block if he edits them again. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 04:48, 17 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Point taken.

As for the length of the ban, I at first thought that a week or 2 would work best, but Taxman makes a very good point. These behaviors are why the arbcom case came about in the first place...and it was on (mostly) these 2 articles. So maybe a permanent ban is in order. He has shown no signs of reforming in regards to these 2 articles.

<dd>Some of the issues he has raised on the <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear.html" title="Nuclear">nuclear</a> article talk page are legitimate.

<dd>Agreed, but his methods were clearly not acceptable. Now that the issues have been raised, reasonable editors can take and impliment them without his disruptive presence.
