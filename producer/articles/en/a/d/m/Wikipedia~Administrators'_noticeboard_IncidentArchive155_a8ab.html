<p>Today I noticed that someone had posted a PROD tag on an article that I have contributed to. Clicking through to see who pasted it and then seeing this persons contributions revealed that the person registered a few days back and their <b>only</b> contributions are nominations for deletion of articles that I have been contributing to. Have a look: <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Carl_Timothy_Jones_ca9f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Carl Timothy Jones">Special:Contributions/Carl_Timothy_Jones</a>.

<li>Excuse me, but I am not "targetting" you.

<dd>The part about "no longer uses Wikipedia" is garbage, as there was more vandalism after it was put there. User's been temp blocked and the User Talk page (where s/he was trying to use the same tactic to eliminate warning messages) has been protected. Block will be up in a few hours and we'll see for how long. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 23:46, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The threat should go, of course.</dd>
<dd>Beyond that, though, I thought there was kind of a consensus against blocking and page-protecting for "removing warnings" as the warnings are available in the page history. Not sure if that applies when vandalism is still ongoing, though.</dd>

<dd>Yes, it was on <a href="../../../p/l/e/Template%7EPlease_check_ISBN_60fd.html" title="Template:Please check ISBN">Template:Please check ISBN</a>. Can we block a range of IPs? These were from 165.21.155.10 and 165.21.155.11.

In the past few days, he's put genitalia on the front page (on two separate occasions, with two separate images), and he's given Bill Gates and George W. Bush Down Syndrome.

<dd>He added the image to {{<a href="../../../r/e/f/Template%7ERef_label_71be.html" title="Template:Ref label">ref label</a>}} as well and thus had himself back-uped when the first of the two templates were reverted (which was {{<a href="../../../r/e/f/Template%7ERef_label_71be.html" title="Template:Ref label">ref label</a>}}, and you don't want to know how stressing it was to look through 20 templates, finding the vandalism, removing it, and than seeing the articles still having penises all over them...).

<dd>I have to say that this incident may have convinced me.

<dd>Why does Commons even HAVE so many pictures of penises?

<dd>Cute kid. One would assume that he has had a parent or guardian's help uploading/editing. Might be advisable to leave a notice on his talk page with the leader "For your mum or dad - please show them and ask them to respond" or similar. We could then warn them of the pitfalls of having a childs details on wiki. However if it is being released with his parents permission then I'm not too sure that it is wiki's problem. <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViridae_a0d4.html" title="User:Viridae">Viridae</a><a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViridae_b84f.html" title="User talk:Viridae"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 12:48, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Tricky one (which is why I waited for another admin to take the initiative&#160;;). Since the off-wiki damage is already done (or not, if he is all talk and no action), I would suggest another stern warning detailing the action that <i>will</i> be taken should he not engage.

<dd>Brian's actions are indefensible. Bullying of this nature, revealing personal information and threatening to get a user kicked out of their university is appalling and should be met with zero tolerance. He should be banned, immediately, and permanently.

I may be wrong, but all of them focus on the same small set of articles related to the Romanian royal family, and all seem to share an identical POV which I would have thought quite idiosyncratic - anti-communist and anti-monarchist. Both Stefan and Parisian have cited Wikipedia's "undue weight" policy in a rather odd way to justify putting (what is, in my opinion) undue weight on their idiosyncratic POV. So if anyone could check and see if they're all the same person, that'd be nice.

<dd>Idea - create a new subcategory "Foreign language pages for speedy deletion," then change the db-notenglish template to place pages there as well.

<dd>Which raises the question of whether it might be useful to have separate categories for other CSD criteria.

<dl>
<dd>I wholeheartedly support the idea of subcategorizing them. Different CSD criteria involve different research processes for the admin examining the CSD tag. I would think that the backlog would clear more quickly if admins felt 1) they could attack the specific CSD criteria they're comfortable investigating and 2) they could clear out a whole subcategory, something I find very satisfying&#160;:) | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">Mr. Darcy</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a></small> 16:26, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The description of the external link is correct, it is a Wiki that mirrors the Chinese Wikipedia. The thing that looked like a search box was an input box asking you to create a dictionary entry (I think, I'm too lazy to look up all characters) for a <a href="../../../w/u/_/Wu_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Wu (linguistics)">Wu</a> dictionary. Unfortunately the create page link goes to the English Wikipedia. In particular, clicking the button without entering anything led to the "Editing Main Page" screen.

These are all plasuable ways to 'stalk' a person. Regardless, its something he is prohibited from doing.

<dd>Perhaps you've missed the detail that the same cluster of Commons admins who've shown such mutual support and solidarity <i>there</i> are now doing so <i>here on Wikipedia</i>, such as one summarily blocking another's critic (without a hearing or opportunity for defense), rather than properly recusing himself from admin actions in disputes where his personal loyalties are involved. That's unbefitting conduct. It's admin abuse.</dd>

<dd>I don't see where the ArbCom forbade Moby to respond where someone else brings up his name, or to endorse summaries on RfC's, or to write to other people Cool Cat has attacked.

<dd>It is my impression that admins should recuse themselves from admin-powered intervention in disputes where they have personal loyalty to one disputant, not use those admin powers against the other disputant.

<dd>If a block was appropriate, it should not have been enacted by one of Cool Cat's cronies. And it would have been nice to see some consensus-seeking that harassment was indeed occurring, especially since (as noted above) consensus on the first item was that it <i><b>wasn't</b></i> harassing Cool Cat... while the second and third items were being supportive of Elanagirl on the RfC and her talk page – and if <i>that</i> constitutes harassing Cool Cat (because CC opposes her), then how many other people are equally guilty of it? <small>– <a href="../../../s/a/j/User%7ESAJordan_b760.html" title="User:SAJordan"><i>SAJordan</i></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/a/j/User_talk%7ESAJordan_266c.html" title="User talk:SAJordan">talk</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SAJordan_0c1d.html" title="Special:Contributions/SAJordan">contribs</a></sub> <i>09:48, 10 Dec 2006 (UTC).</i></small></dd>

<li>I don't know the history here, but SAJordan has some points here that concern me. I really find it a stretch to classify Moby's actions as harassment. I'm also concerned that Bastique is not completely impartial regarding Cool Cat and it would be better to have the claim of harassment evaluated by another admin. I am tempted to reduce the block period as blocking for a week for <i>those edits</i> following <i>five months</i> of apprarently problem-free behavior is an overreaction. In fact, I don't see any behavior here warranting a block at all. However, as I'm unfamiliar with all the details of this case I have not modified the block, but I do find Bastique's block concerning. If any other admins are familiar with the arbitration case involving Cool Cat and Mody Dick I would appreciate additional perspective on Bastique's block. —<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Bell_8398.html" title="User:Doug Bell">Doug&#160;Bell</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoug_Bell_81b5.html" title="User talk:Doug Bell">talk</a></sup> 10:39, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If you want perspective... Think of a person contesting all your actions on every vote you participate and every article you edit. Practically everything you do this person follows you around. Thats what Moby dick did to me (as per arbcom hearing). Thats why arbcom (redundently since its prohibited behaviour anyways) prohibited him from stalking (harrasing) me. He was told explicity to avoid running into me on votes at a later clarification. Now after a long break he returned to his routine. This non-contributor should have been indef blocked long ago for disruption.</dd>
<dd>Bastique made a sensible decision and blocked him. Bastique is not my pet <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9mon.html" title="Pokémon">pokémon</a> and it is extremely disrespectful for people to argue that he is. I do not understand why people are taking SAJordan's comments seriously.</dd>

<dd><i>"Extreme interest in punishing"</i>? But I <i><b>don't</b></i> think it's wrong to link to public documents on the record, relevant to the discussion then ongoing. Neither Bastique nor I think it was a punishable offense for <i>Cool Cat</i> to do that; but Bastique blocked <i>Moby Dick</i> for it. Bastique waved away Cool Cat's <i>seven edits in four days</i> (including blanking and protection) of Moby Dick's user page as an "error of judgment", but declared that Moby's making even a <i>single</i> non-vandalizing edit on Cool Cat's talk page (in response to mention of his own name) is a "blockable offense". Bastique has not penalized Cool Cat for carrying complaints back and forth between Commons and Wikipedia, but if Moby or I refer to Cool Cat's history, even on the same project, that's "trolling" and blockable. So the question isn't so much about Bastique's (let alone my) "extreme interest in punishing" <i><b>behavior</b></i>, it's about why there's such a discrepancy in how the <i><b>same</b></i> behavior is treated, depending on <i><b>who</b></i> exhibits it. <small>– <a href="../../../s/a/j/User%7ESAJordan_b760.html" title="User:SAJordan"><i>SAJordan</i></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/a/j/User_talk%7ESAJordan_266c.html" title="User talk:SAJordan">talk</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SAJordan_0c1d.html" title="Special:Contributions/SAJordan">contribs</a></sub> <i>02:23, 11 Dec 2006 (UTC).</i></small></dd>

<p>I have no reason to be on SAJordan's side, and I'm not even sure who exactly he is, but I'm finding this whole thing rather disturbing. I agree that this isn't the place to complain, but at the same time it does involve administrators <i>here</i> on en.wiki since Bastique is doing things that I would think are.. bad decisions. I had left comments about Cool Cat on commons that was completely unrelated to SAJordan, and Bastique <i>deleted</i> the talk page containing my comment. I've got nothing to do with SAJordan, and I don't really care about this Moby guy, but am I the only one who thinks somethings not right here? Where does one go, at this point? How does one handle a cross-project issue such as this? Like I said, I'll be glad to take this conversation somewhere else, but I'm really not sure <i>where</i> that would be.

<li>Ned, I'm in sort of the same boat as you in that I don't know SAJordan, Cool Cat, Mody Dick, or Bastique, but I sure have the uneasy feeling that something doesn't add up here—that's why I initially responded in this thread.

<dd>I support the comments of Doug and Ned. I am completely outside the issue, and only noticed here because I am watching this page for an unrelated matter. I am also troubled by Bastique's conflict of interest in this matter, and what I perceive as threats to SAJordan. I would also add that as a member of the community, Bastique doesn't speak for me when he says Jordan is "trying the patience of the community". I would like to see this issue resolved to the satisfaction of all parties involved, which would include SAJordan and MobyDick. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffpw_23d5.html" title="User:Jeffpw">Jeffpw</a> 12:53, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I haven't read all of the above discussion, but if lightening the mood is needed, wouldn't it be appropriate to resurrect User:Captain Ahab or User:Ahab and get him to <s>harpoon</s>, um, file an arbitration case against, <a href="../../../m/o/b/User%7EMoby_Dick_b445.html" title="User:Moby Dick">User:Moby Dick</a>?&#160;:-) Or should that be the other way around...? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 13:14, 11 December 2006 (UTC) <small>(hoping there is no User:Huan or User:Huan the Hound of Valinor)</small></p>
<p>Given that SAJordan's post at the top of this section amounts to a scurrilous smear-job (right up the old canard about unilateral action--what, exactly, is a bilateral administrative action?), I'm surprised the discussion has wound on so long. I would've blocked under the circumstances as well, for much the same reasons as Bastique did. Moby Dick doesn't get the same considerations as other users because he's under Arbcom sanction for exactly this kind of behaviour. The discussion was not related to Moby Dick, as some claim; rather, Coolcat was citing the previous arbitration case as an example of people following him around. The specific context was Star Trek deletions. In no way does this involve Moby Dick. Dropping in like that to make a frivolous remark is harassment and proof that he's watching Coolcat's talk page. The Arbitration Committee, with reason, forbade this kind of behaviour. Moby Dick is right though, that case <i>does</i> make interesting reading, if one makes the time. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 13:31, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your reply. I'm still not sure if I'm really talking with your old self. You used to be conscientious about this, so it is strange that you wouldn't write summaries anymore, not even for deletions of whole sections. Also, your explanation about the edits shows no knowledge of the applicable Wikipedia policies, which doesn't quite fit to an experienced editor of over 8000 edits. — <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESebastianHelm_63db.html" title="User:SebastianHelm">Sebastian</a> 17:17, 10 December 2006 (UTC) &#160;&#160;&#160;<small><i>(Please reply on this page.)</i></small></dd>

<dd>All right, I'll come clean. I have been editing anonymously as User:69.245.41.105, as part of an informal experiment to investigate how anonymous editors are treated when making good-faith removals of unsourced material. (I still defend the edits themselves; as Jimbo has stressed, speculative material must be <a href="http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2006-May/046433.html" class="external text" title="http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2006-May/046433.html" rel="nofollow">aggressively removed</a>.) I have also been using my admin powers to roll back any reversions of my anonymous edits, to see if anyone would challenge an admin making the same edits.</dd>
<dd>My deepest apologies to you if you if anything I've done has offended or threatened you in any way. I don't intend to make any more anonymous edits, and am willing to accept any consequences for what I have done. <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDeltabeignet_14cb.html" title="User:Deltabeignet">Deltabeignet</a> 22:41, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is a weird story! Why did you not come clean when you got blocked in October? I still don't see any evidence that you are the same as the original Deltabeignet. It is a well known fact among experienced editors that Jimbo followed up on his remark and that we have an unmistakable policy about this which you violated. Moreover, you blatantly violated several other core policies, not to improve Wikipedia, but only to prove your point. — <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESebastianHelm_63db.html" title="User:SebastianHelm">Sebastian</a> 23:24, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If there's one thing to be learned from the <a href="../../../k/o/n/User%7EKonstable_8474.html" title="User:Konstable">Konstable</a> affair, as far as I'm concerned, it's that if there's a hole, we should try to fix it together, not poke at it and see how big it needs to be before someone notices.

<dd>Chick, you're misunderstanding me. I did not bring this up as an accusation. To the contrary, it was <i>because</i> I believe in the old, the good Deltabeignet that I thought of that possibility. It still has not been disproven, but I am sorry that it is becoming less and less likely - I would have wished it was all just a bad dream.</dd>

<dd>I'll suggest it to him. And I think the approved method is to have redirects on all the secondary IDs' user/talk pages to his primary's, with a list of those IDs on his primary's pages.

<p>I recently added the LGBT WikiProject tag to <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_partnerships_in_the_United_Kingdom_fc71.html" title="Civil partnerships in the United Kingdom">Civil partnerships in the United Kingdom</a> and rated it a B-class. Shortly afterwards, I got a short but blunt note from an IP that my rating was unacceptable and had been taken down. Since then, <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoel_on_the_SOL_a1fe.html" title="User:Joel on the SOL">User:Joel on the SOL</a> has repeatedly insulted me, questioned my ability as an editor, made numerous personal attacks and has repeatedly removed the grading(very close to breaking 3RR). Admittedly, I lost my temper at first, but despite my attempts to bring him back to what is actually wrong with the rating, he insists of going off about how utterly unqualified I am to rate articles and that I am a deeply unpleasant user. Regardless of whether that is true or not, I fail to see how this has any bearing on a rating that has been supported by everyone but Joel. Some blocking/warning/input would be nice, because he's taking up both mine and Jeff's time on this deeply stupid dispute, that he won't even address.

I think it's simply a case of one user steadily winding himself up about his baby getting what he sees as a low rating, but if an admin could do something about this, I'd be grateful. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDev920_f8f8.html" title="User:Dev920">Dev920</a> (Have a nice day!) 21:35, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I put a note on that user's talk page, asking him to moderate his tone, and warning him again about 3RR. I would encourage you to file a 3RR report if he does it again, and to restore the B rating given the absence of any content-related discussion (as I read that talk page, Joel isn't so much disputing the rating itself as he is refusing to rate the article at all - is that accurate?). | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">Mr. Darcy</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a></small>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, that appears to be what's happening. Thanks for your warning. I'd restore it once more, but I think I'm close to 3RR myself, I'll ask someone else to do it just in case. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDev920_f8f8.html" title="User:Dev920">Dev920</a> (Have a nice day!) 21:59, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, that's accurate. Joel is angry that the article was not rated higher, and is unwilling to discuss his reasons for thinking it should be higher. He ignores all explanations of the GA process, and that "B"is as high as an assessed rating can get (well "A" is possible, in theory, but that is a higher rating than GA and this is not even at GA yet). He states that if it is not rated higher, it may not be rated at all. I will change the rating myself now.<a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffpw_23d5.html" title="User:Jeffpw">Jeffpw</a> 22:03, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Per Talk on this article, there were by Jeffpw's own count three reverts by Joel on the SOL - that does not place anyone over the 3RR limit and now that makes two of you who owe him an apology! <a href="../../../8/1/2E/User%7E81.159.212.153.html" title="User:81.159.212.153">81.159.212.153</a> 23:14, 10 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That would be assuming that you and Joel are not one and the same, of course. Because you also reverted. In any event, I am sure if an admin is interested, he or she can go into the history and see exactly just how many reverts were made, and by whom. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffpw_23d5.html" title="User:Jeffpw">Jeffpw</a> 23:18, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Joel, there is this thing called <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFCU_026f.html" title="WP:RFCU">Checkuser</a>, which will allow us to determine (if necessary) what IPs you edit from. Personally, I would have already blocked you for a 3RR violation, as it is obvious. And, should you persist in this battle you may be blocked for less than 4 reverts, because 3RR merely extablishes a clear line, it does not entitle you to edit war up to 3 reverts per day. If you persist in edit warring <b>and</b> continue to deny the obvious, I'll be happy to apply for a checkuser request and drop a much longer block on you after the result comes back. Try a peer review to see how to improve the article, and remember that no one <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">owns</a> any article here. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 08:31, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ugh, I thought we had moved along already. The anon user has admitted to being a meatpuppet of Joel on the SOL - or, if he's lying, it's just Joel himself. Either way, if those two users are working in concert to avoid violating 3RR or to otherwise influence the editing of that article, they should be blocked. I've also noted on the anon's talk page that he must not remove the template, with a fuller explanation of why it's appropriate. | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">Mr. Darcy</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a></small> 23:14, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article for <a href="../../../b/e/i/Beit_Hanoun_November_2006_incident_5c8a.html" title="Beit Hanoun November 2006 incident">Beit Hanoun November 2006 incident</a> has been protected due to edit warring regarding the permissibility of two images – Image:Beit HanounBlood.jpg and Image:Gaza morgue .jpg – with disputed fair-use rationales. Some have complained that part of the reason the images ought to be removed is that they are meant to play on people's heartstrings rather than be informative.

I believe the display of the images are pushing a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> violation, as they appear merely there for shock value (and, ironically, pulling on heartstrings). It looks like the approach was something along the lines of <i>compared to those fourteen gruesome images, the two images for this article are nothing</i>, which, in my opinion, is not an appropriate approach to deciding the correctness of a fair-use rationale. So, my question is, should these images be removed from the talk page or am I just over-reacting? -- <b><a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETariqabjotu_f37f.html" title="User:Tariqabjotu"><font color="black">tariq</font><font color="gray">abjotu</font></a></b> 03:16, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>While not an admin, I took a look at the page in question.

The images of the Armenian Genocide (I didn't see any there from the Holocaust) and from 9/11 serve no useful purpose on the talk page except for the user in question to attempt to debunk an opinion which they disagree with. On the subject of the pictures, the <i>gaza morgue</i> image is clearly irrelevant as it could just as easily be a picture of people crying in any city in the world on any random occasion. While I could be convinced as to the relevance of the <i>blood</i> image, simply standing on its own in the article would not give it any useful purpose. In contrast, if there were images available of Israeli troops during the event itself, or some other topical image from the event itself, I could see its relevance more surely. -- <b><a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChabuk_81ec.html" title="User:Chabuk">Chabuk</a> <sup>[&#160;<a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChabuk_849e.html" title="User talk:Chabuk">T</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Chabuk_38b0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Chabuk">C</a>&#160;]</sup></b> 04:00, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>I came here due to a message from Tariqabjotu, so thanks for the notice.</p>
<p>I dispute that edit warring is regarding the fair use ratinal of the pictures, that is in my view a obvious distraction that will no succed: any one who is impartial will recoqnize that they fullfill all the cirteria for fair use.If they indeed would have been fair-use breach, one of them would not have been undeleted after i took it to deletion review, complaining that "one" admin had deleted it out of process, and that it indeed was fair use.</p>
<p>WP:POINT is not applicable since it states that one should not disrupt wikipedia to make a point. The other pictures are not there to make a point, they are there as an argument. That is a huge difference. If my article gets deleted, and i afd another article, that would be POINT, ie to do something one in reality does not endorse, to prove its inappropriateness. The additional pictures serve no such purpose, they are not there to demonstrate the inappropriateness of anything. WP:POINT would be to go to Holocaust, 911 and Armenian Genocide, and removing those pictures arguing that they are "pulling on heartstrings" (what a nonsensical made up rule!). So no, POINT is not applicable.</p>
<p>"They apear for shoch value". C'mon, if they were shock site-picture, they would not be on wikipedia to start with. They are on stable articles and nobody is disputing their appropriateness on those articles - it is very weak to argue that they are appropriate on article main space, but not appropriate on a talk page regarding a dispute of the appropriateness of war time pictures.</p>
<p>"serve no useful purpose on the talk page except for the user in question to attempt to debunk an opinion which they disagree with". Is <i>"to debunk an opinion which they disagree with"</i> not enough reason in it self? C'mon, we are talking about a talk page, talk pages are there to present arguments and debunk false arguments.</p>
<p>Regarding the validity of including any individual picture in that article, this is not the place to comment or respond to comments regarding that, the article talk page exists for that. Further, i would like to make clear that i am the one actively engaged in trying to find a solution to this problem. I talk on the talk page, i invited third parties. When that did not work, i created a RFC. Now, this did not work either, and i have filed a request to the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_Cabal_Cases_2006-12-08_Beit_Hanoun_November_2006_incident_ce03.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal/Cases/2006-12-08 Beit Hanoun November 2006 incident">Mediation Cabal</a>. understand that i am working in accordance to policies and guidelines and have no interest in breaching either of them, it is me that is following the dispute resolution process, it is not me that is unitarility deleting images out of process, it is not me that is removing peoples comments and arguments in the talk page and it is not me that have been warned and <a href="../../../n/o/t/User_talk%7ENotAWeasel_4c96.html" title="User talk:NotAWeasel">blocked for incivility</a> and <a href="../../../r/u/n/User_talk%7ERunedChozo_5acb.html" title="User talk:RunedChozo">revert wars</a>, rather, it is me reporting those kinds of behaviors. Further, i want to make clear that i am not the only one advocating the right to present the images on the talk page as arguments, at least two other users have supported their inclusion. That is the talk page, that is were we present arguments. And those are pictures used on Wikipedia articles, so how could they be good enough for an article, but be "to shocking" on a talk page? Are we going to deny one side the ability to present arguments in good faith?

<dd>OK. I've been tangentially involved in similar disputes, which may make me slightly biased, but if this one is anything like any of the others, I'll have to say back up Striver. This appears to be yet another example of the ridiculous Israel POV-warriors vs. ridiculous the Muslim POV-warriors, not about FU. While I was on a similar page, I felt people were using excuses to get each image suggestion removed, and it doesn't surprise me that the fair-use criteria has come up on this page either. Striver was doing nothing more than saying, "hey, look, these other images are part of WP articles, so why shouldn't this article have one?". Because it was not a FU argument, but a content argument (or at least, Striver saw it that way), this was <i>not</i> a WP:POINT violation, but a reasonable request. That's my two cents, I may be wrong, but it's what it seems to me. All said, I wouldn't mind seeing every Israel-Arab article on this entire encyclopedia full-protected until people learn to work out their differences. -<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatstuart_7fbf.html" title="User:Patstuart">Patstuart</a><sup><a href="../../../p/a/t/User_talk%7EPatstuart_e8fd.html" title="User talk:Patstuart">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Patstuart_a3f0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Patstuart">edits</a></sup> 06:48, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As I've said on the talk page already there is a serious fair use problem with putting the images on the talk page (at minimum).

<li>I've just logged in and am horrified to note the response to Bishonen's and my edits at Renaissance architecture have been such a problem. I have to say after giving the matter a great deal of thought and consideration I have to say I think Catherine is correct to revert. I am now tending to side with the school of thought that considers it unlikely that the King of Spain, chose to adorn the external walls of his palace with toilet paper dispensers for the use of his servants. In fact they are more likely to be either mere Renaissance decoration or for the securing of goats. Regarding Palladio's design for the toilet paper holders at <a href="../../../v/i/l/Villa_Capra_066b.html" title="Villa Capra">Villa Capra</a> this is more complex, While those in the "Tourist Comfort Zone" are undoubtedly of high quality and aesthetically pleasing, the trade mark stamped on the reverse indicates <a href="../../../i/k/e/Ikea.html" title="Ikea">Ikea</a> a (Swedish company). Palladio is not known to have visited Sweden, or to have sold copyright to Ikea, this leads me to believe he is not responsible for their design. In conclusion I think Catherine was probably correct to revert. I shall now go and revert <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Renaissance_architecture&amp;diff=93587615&amp;oldid=93582143" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Renaissance_architecture&amp;diff=93587615&amp;oldid=93582143" rel="nofollow">[37]</a> with a suitable summary.

<dd>We don't really have any reason to believe that these particular users frequent those pages. The only way to ensure contact was to do so directly. As for the POV-fork thing, I don't see how that could apply, since this isn't in article space, and it isn't even an article, it's a discussion page. We're on our third topic of discussion, and is open to anyone to participate. So far we've covered user interfaces, stubbing, and now we're on vandalism. The user interface discussion provided so much useful information on tools that it became the basis of this tools presentation: <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Transhumanist_Tools_bb19.html" title="User:The Transhumanist/Tools">User:The Transhumanist/Tools</a>.

<dd>What I meant to say is that is this not equivalent to what would be a POV-fork if in article space? Basically, what Samir asked below, what's the difference between this and Admin school, it seemed like just an offshoot to bypass the result of the MFD.

<dd>See my answer to Samir below, but I'll add an additional comment here: it wasn't a bypass because from the discussions evolved an entirely new thing, which is based on the suggestions and concerns aired in the MfDs. I'm actually glad now that the admin school idea was killed, because this project is much better. It's not another help desk like the old program was, this page has greater scope, a more refined platform, and is much better focused on the betterment of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Transhumanist_1191.html" title="User:The Transhumanist">The Transhumanist</a> 10:10, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To pipe in, I've had conversation with this fellow a few times and his tone seems to me to be unapologetically contentious, xenophobic, paranoid, rife with a sense of persecution, ultra-nationalistic, anti-Indian, anti-Hindu, and generally trollish. Top that off with bad spelling, grammar and punctuation/space usage, and a strong inclination to delete other people's comments on talk pages and/or edit them (by changing copy or interspersing his own commentary), and I am beginning to think this guy is going to be a thorn in the side of most people he decides to disagree with (which it seems is most people). He demonstrates a lack of good faith and a willingness to play tit-for-tat over perceived slights (i.e., comments that disagree with his opinions or make note of his behavior). Taking him at face value he seems to be genuine in his rationale, and not just being disruptive for sport. But he should probably be watched closely and given more serious consequences for continuing his unpleasant behavior.</p>

<dd>I've had a brief look at some of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/71.139.38.76" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/71.139.38.76" rel="nofollow">IP contribs</a> and i am afraid to note that it is more a content dispute than a wikistalking. Try to discuss the issues at the talk pages or at his talk page and see where it would lead. Please feel free to correct me if i am wrong. -- <i><a href="../../../f/a/y/User%7EFayssalF_b498.html" title="User:FayssalF"><font size="2px" face="Verdana"><font color="DarkSlateBlue">Szvest</font></font></a></i> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Image%7EWikiquote-logo.svg_6594.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg/10px-Wikiquote-logo.svg.png" alt="" width="10" height="12" longdesc="../../../w/i/k/Image%7EWikiquote-logo.svg_6594.html" /></a> <small><a href="../../../f/a/y/User_talk%7EFayssalF_f604.html" title="User talk:FayssalF"><font style="background: orange"><sup><i>Wiki me up ®</i></sup></font></a></small> 12:50, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Is it possible to block his IP from user creation and editing (he's mostly on a static cable from what I can see).

<dd>This guy is a real pain. I would say it's time to ask for an underlying IP block, as he seems to be doign this as much just for the <a href="../../../d/e/n/WP%7EDENY_da3a.html" title="WP:DENY">WP:DENY</a> effect as anything. -<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatstuart_7fbf.html" title="User:Patstuart">Patstuart</a><sup><a href="../../../p/a/t/User_talk%7EPatstuart_e8fd.html" title="User talk:Patstuart">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Patstuart_a3f0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Patstuart">edits</a></sup> 15:07, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Where would I go about asking for that? I've got pretty good evidence of his underlying IP... I agree this is a <a href="../../../d/e/n/WP%7EDENY_da3a.html" title="WP:DENY">WP:DENY</a> issue, which is why I stopped tagging his socks.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 15:28, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
