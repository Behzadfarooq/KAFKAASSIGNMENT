<p>I am requesting a block against Gzornenplatz a second time, as per the discussion on <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_page_protection_f234.html#Gzornenplatz" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for page protection">Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_page_protection#Gzornenplatz</a> and other related discussions on various pages - hopefully for longer than 24 hours, as Gplatz reverts upto 30 articles at once and wastes other editors' time, and since this is not just the second offense but the nth in a series of edits that was mentioned during arbitration: the entire list of images being reverted can be found on the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Gzornenplatz%2C_Kevin_Baas%2C_Shorne%2C_VeryVerily_Evidence_4a8a.html#18_Oct.2F19-20_Nov:_continued_conduct_by_User:Gzornenplatz" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Gzornenplatz, Kevin Baas, Shorne, VeryVerily/Evidence">arbitration Evidence</a> page. As the first link shows, Gplatz has actually consented that the CIA map of India is not NPOV, but he continues to revert to it anyway, and besides the long edit war with me, has been edit warring with <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENichalp_b881.html" title="User:Nichalp">User:Nichalp</a> after the discussion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:IndiaSikkim.png" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:IndiaSikkim.png" rel="nofollow">here</a>. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 15:50, 23 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I suggest you actually read that policy: "Such disruption is to be objectively defined by specific policies". I am not violating any general rules nor specific arbcom terms. If "reverting upto 30 articles at once" is supposed to be disruption, then Simonides has indicted himself, since he obviously reverted those same pages just as much. Unjustified blocks have been and will be reverted by other sysops, so don't waste your time further. <a href="../../../g/z/o/User%7EGzornenplatz_145f.html" title="User:Gzornenplatz">Gzornenplatz</a> 21:29, Jan 23, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It may be useful to recall that <a href="../../../b/a/n/Wikipedia%7EBanning_policy_2e63.html" title="Wikipedia:Banning policy">Wikipedia:Banning policy</a> states that the decision to ban a user can arise from 5 places. The first "place" mentioned is "The Wikipedia community, taking decisions according to appropriate community-designed policies with consensus support, or (more rarely) following consensus on the case itself." I would far rather Gzornenplatz/Wik reformed to become a co-operative user. If he does not do so soon, I for one would support a move to use this method to ban him. Gzorneplatz/Wik, please reform.

<p>Being disruptive, taking an overly aggressive approach (eg mass reversions on 30+ articles) and other unneighbourly activity. Remember, not all Wikipedia policy is written down. Many users see your actions as being disruptive and would prefer you took a more conciliatory approach where you have content disputes with other users. You would do well to recognise this and calm down. I believe your behaviour, taken as a whole, is extremely discourteous to other users. As you are aware we have well-trodden paths for dealing with content disputes - please follow them, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 22:30, 23 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Simonides has engaged in the same mass reversion, so even from a purely technical view, I can't have behaved worse than him. And if you actually look at the issue, it is obvious that he is trying to push an Indian POV and I'm reverting to an NPOV version. There's no "conciliation" possible with blatant POV pushers. We do <i>not</i> have "paths for dealing with content disputes" that lead to binding decisions on content, and anything else doesn't help in such cases. But you probably care more about "peace and quiet" than about the neutrality and accuracy of Wikipedia content, and think I should just let the POV pusher have his way. Now, aside from the mass reversion, if there's any other "disruption" or "unneighbourly activity" you'll have to specify it, and I can respond to it. Vague and unfalsifiable general accusations, which basically amount to saying "I don't like you", will not fly. <a href="../../../g/z/o/User%7EGzornenplatz_145f.html" title="User:Gzornenplatz">Gzornenplatz</a> 22:45, Jan 23, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"The other person did it too" is <b>not</b> a defense. I agree that we need better procedures for dealing with both contentious issues, and POV-pushers, but revert wars aren't it. As to "general accusations", the reason I didn't do a block was that I was originally taking the initial report (here) on good faith - when I actually looked at your recent editing history, I saw nothing particularly objectionable. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 14:41, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"The other person did it too" is a defense against me being punished but not the other person who did it too. That's elementary justice. If you get a consensus that those "mass reversions" are block-worthy disruption, then you could block both of us, as well as a number of other users I could name who are doing the same (Halibutt, Emax, etc.). I fully agree that we need better procedures for those disputes than revert wars, but until we have them, revert wars are the best we have; the only alternative is to give up to the POV pusher. I find it curious that you take the report of an accuser on good faith, and on that basis, without showing good faith toward the accused and without investigating, propose a lengthy block and say "I'm tired of dealing with this person" (I don't remember having even talked to you before outside of this page). <a href="../../../g/z/o/User%7EGzornenplatz_145f.html" title="User:Gzornenplatz">Gzornenplatz</a> 03:29, Jan 25, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I see fairness is not a priority of yours. Thankfully, it is one of other sysops. (Contrasting this to "building an encyclopaedia" is a ridiculous strawman, as if building an encyclopaedia required you to be unfair!) If you have better things to do than to deal with such disputes fairly, then just stay out of them entirely, OK? Blocking people arbitrarily is not going to make the encyclopaedia better. <a href="../../../g/z/o/User%7EGzornenplatz_145f.html" title="User:Gzornenplatz">Gzornenplatz</a> 17:18, Jan 25, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I said that fairness was not as high a priority as building the encyclopaedia. If you disagree with that, I can only conclude that for you, the opposite is true - that the encyclopaedia is not the most important thing here. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 18:12, 25 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And I can only conclude that logic isn't a priority of yours either. There is no contradiction between fairness and "building an encyclopaedia" that would force you to weigh them against each other. On the contrary, fairness in dealing with disputes helps in building the encyclopaedia, as it will keep the bad users out and the good users in. If you blindly block a good NPOV user, the encyclopaedia could lose many useful edits and various POV pushers could go about their ways unchecked, and this could send a fatal signal, attracting even more POV pushers and driving more good users away, etc. <a href="../../../g/z/o/User%7EGzornenplatz_145f.html" title="User:Gzornenplatz">Gzornenplatz</a> 18:30, Jan 25, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure if I understand the history of this dispute correctly. But at least, it is disingenious to talk of "mass reversion" here: this is about a single issue, the border of India, and the "mass" only comes into play because there are lots of versions of the map of India, with different regions highlighted.</dd>
<dd>also, I cannot see that gzpl is 'not arguing his point'. He does make a very clear case on <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_GzornenplatzBlock_9878.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/GzornenplatzBlock">Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/GzornenplatzBlock</a>. Of course, the reverts solve nothing, but that goes for both sides. Why is there not a discussion where alternative solutions (such as explicit annotation of the line of control) are considered by all parties?</dd>
<dd>So, while I may not be aware of the history of this, I don't see gzpl as unilaterally guilty at all. If you block him for a month now, this just means that the other side has won the revert war, but it doesn't contribute towards a solution of the pov dispute. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 14:48, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd>I have never been involved in this dispute, but I will say something anyway. The map by Gzornenplatz has anti-Pakistani (not ant-Indian) POV. I have seen many Indians argue that the current line of control should become international border, something that Pakistan vehemently opposes (and <b>that</b> is the dispute between Indian and Pakistan -- notice how Indian government claims that there is no "dispute" about Kashmir, but Pakistan claims that Kashmir is the "core dispute"). I don't think most Indians argue or think that they will ever get Pakistani part, but many Pakistanis believe the whole of Kashmir (at least the Muslim majority part -- if not Jamu) should be part of Pakistan. This makes Gzornenplatz map anti-Pakistan. His map endorses Indian claim. However, I also see problems with Simonides map. Why does the border include all of Kashmir within India? The entire area of Kashmir should be changed to dotted line. Why the text only has: presently administered by "Pakistan" and "China." It should list all three countries: presently administered by "Pakistan," "India" and "China." <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneGuy_27ad.html" title="User:OneGuy">OneGuy</a> 15:52, 25 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This has developed into a discussion about in what cases admins are justified in meting out their maximum non-arbcom-endorsed penalty of a month's block. I argued that gz is <i>not</i> such a case, regardless of whether you think he is annoying: vandals are blocked, annoying people are rfar'ed, and the arbcom will decide if they are annoying enough to be blocked for longer periods. If we agree that admins may block "annoying people" for a month, hell, I could have saved myself the pain of <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Antifinnugor_7c0f.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Antifinnugor">rfaring</a> a <i>far</i> more annoying specimen&#160;:-\ <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 14:29, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<p>Fred Bauder told me Gzornenplatz was Wik (I don't really know why, it didn't seem relevant to the discussions I was having at the time - but he did). Raul later confirmed that. I have no reason to suspect that Fred and Raul were doing anything other than telling the truth and I fully accept their confirmations that Gzornenplatz is Wik. I have also, many days ago, espoused the view that Jimbo must be aware of this - and that he is giving the ArbCom its head on this one. There is one thing that puzzles me though. Although <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">Wikipedia:Blocking policy</a> makes it clear that there are 5 ways a user can be blocked, and that the first one of these is community consensus (which, I note as an aside, isn't the same as admin consensus), I can see no reference to Wik being permanently blocked - either by community consensus, or any of the other 4 methods.

<p>I don't want to make a big deal out of this, it was no big deal as long as Wik was just considered gone. Ignoring a departed vandal is one thing but allowing them to return is another. To Everyking's comment re:Wik/Gzornenplatz just coming back as another user - why do we even bother to ban anybody then? After all, they can just come back as someone. There will always be more vandals, but we have to do what we can. And as for making good contributions - I think most of our banned users have made good contributions at some point or another. But that's not the point here. This isn't even about Gzornenplatz's recent edit wars, since those are under the arbcom's jurisdiction.</p>
<p>If I'm shown to be wrong about the community banning Wik, I'd be glad to remove the block, but I just don't see how we would allow him to return.

<dd>Based on the Arbcom ruling concerning Gzornenplatz, no official connection with Wik was drawn. Thus, there is no basis for imposing an ex post facto ban on Gzornenplatz in connection with Wik. Admins may only apply the sanctions imposed on Gz's editing, which are already quite stringent. Whether or not Jimbo imposed a permanent ban on Wik in June is irrelevant because the Arbcom already made a ruling on Gz without considering that statement by Jimbo in June. BTW, even more recently, the arbcom has just thrown out two such cases against Gz. An admin blocking Gz for any connection with Wik would be <i>himself</i> acting without regard for the most recent Arbcom decision. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 02:23, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<p>Are we trying to correct his behavior, or are we just punishing him for the sake of punishing him? He's done a lot of good work as Gzornenplatz, and even before his latest bout of arbitration he had largely stopped the behavior that made Wik <i>persona non grata</i>; ever since he was recently placed under editing restrictions, he's been pretty good about abiding by them and really hasn't made significant trouble.

<p>This is all academic, I suppose; he was banned by Jimbo, and Jimbo's say-so is needed to unban him. —<a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">Charles</a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User_talk%7EMirv_53de.html" title="User talk:Mirv">&#160;P.</a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Mirv_1dda.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Mirv">&#160;<sup><small>(Mirv)</small></sup></a> 20:59, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Jimbo declared him hard banned on the mailing list. Whether Jimbo then created a block on the account is immaterial. As for why we're doing this... Wik launched one of the worst vandalbot attacks ever. It was sustained, and it was very difficult to clean up. He is hard banned for this reason, and because he tried to force people to ban people on his say-so. These are serious, serious offenses. And what escelated it to the point where this happened last time was Wik's edit warring and reversions. As revert warring has continued as Gzornenplatz, I have trouble seeing the case for reformation. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 21:43, Jan 29, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The quote shows that not only Jimbo knows that Gzornenplatz is Wik, but also note the first sentence: "This comment of yours is the sort of classic that I am sure is going to lead to your banning sooner rather than later." "Sooner rather than later"? That is sufficient evidence that Jimbo didn't think Wik/Gzornenplatz should be banned at least on 19 Dec 2004 when he wrote that sentence.

<p>I am getting a bit tired of this. Everybody keeps saying Gz is Wik, and Jimbo hates Gz/Wik's guts, and therefore he should be banned. And this is all backed up with sybillic remarks of Gz's and apocryphal references to statements of Jimbo's on mailing lists. Hell, Jimbo knows how to use mediawiki. He can come here (or to VP) and officially state he thinks gz should be blocked. Until he does so, this is all very much in the air. Why don't we just drop this until we get a clear ruling by the arbcom (you know, along the lines of "block gz!"), or by Jimbo. It's not like gz is vandalizing WP at a 1,000 articles an hour, so no harm is done by just letting it rest for a while. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 13:59, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>So, basically you are claiming that anyone can revert five times a day. Is this correct? I don't see anything in the policy that allows one to "cancel" out a revert and the self-revert.

<p>Well, here we go again. Viriditas again is trying to distort the facts. Check the above edits. You will notice that yes the 4th edit is a revert but I immediately reverted to the previous version (what Viriditas calls "5th revert" ) when I realized the mistake <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneGuy_27ad.html" title="User:OneGuy">OneGuy</a> 22:03, 23 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You violated the 3RR policy twice on the same article in the space of two weeks, and this constitues abuse on my part? Please. Your own edit summary contradicts your claim. If you "realized" your mistake at 11:11 on 23 Jan 2005 and made a self-revert,then why did you violate the 3RR again at 20:57 on 23 Jan 2005?

This is the second time you've violated the 3RR on this article, your first violation on this article is <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive2_7f0d.html#User:OneGuy_at_Israeli_violence_against_Palestinian_children" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive2">archived</a>. --<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 05:01, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>As you can see, no one has agreed with your claim that I reverted the article 5 times (something you initially claimed).

<dd>Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. I suspect that most people could care less about this issue, nor tracking down every one of your claims, which happen to be false. The facts clearly show that you reverted the article five times in 24 hours, regardless of what anyone thinks. As I have recently learned, 3RR policy does not count a self-revert, so you still made four reverts, and this is the second time in two weeks that you have violated the 3RR on this article. --<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 05:41, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The policy might not have said anything about that, but anyone with common sense would recognize that the 5th revert (done within few minutes) restored the previous version.

Secondly, I am not familiar with any 3RR policy that says that "reverts which cancel each other should not be counted." I can understand not counting an initial self-revert, however. Finally, it is you who has resorted to misinterpration, as you mistakenly categorized your fourth revert as a fifth, when you wrote, <i>the 4th edit is a revert but I immediately reverted to the previous version (what Viriditas calls "5th revert" ) when I realized the mistake.</i> In actuality, your fifth revert was made 11 hours later, not minutes later as you say I claimed. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Children_and_minors_in_the_Israeli-Palestinian_conflict&amp;diff=9593824&amp;oldid=9592831" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Children_and_minors_in_the_Israeli-Palestinian_conflict&amp;diff=9593824&amp;oldid=9592831" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>. It's somewhat ironic that you would accuse me of "extreme misinterpretation" when in fact, that is exactly what you did when you mischaracterized your fifth revert as a fourth. --<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 06:23, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am done responding to this. Anyone with common sense would see that both the 3rd and 4th reverts (done within few minutes) canceled each other, leaving only 3 reverts in 24 hours. This is the second time that Viriditas tried to get me blocked (but failed) because apparently he can't stand anyone who disagrees with his POV. He has been reverting the article continuously for the past several days or (weeks) without ever discussing his reverts and without ever trying to resolve the dispute on the talk page. If he posts anything on the talk page at all, it's usually about how I violated (in his imagination) some policy and could get blocked <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneGuy_27ad.html" title="User:OneGuy">OneGuy</a> 06:46, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>You wrote, <i>both the 3rd and 4th reverts (done within few minutes) canceled each other, leaving only 3 reverts in 24 hours</i>. The way I interpret the policy, the actual self-revert itself is not counted. I don't see anything about "cancelling" any prior reverts. The whole point in self-reverting is to acknowledge your mistake and restore the previous version, which is why it should not be counted. You, OTOH, made an additional revert within the same 24 hour time period, violating the 3RR for the fourth time. You are essentially saying that anyone can make five reverts as long as they self-revert once, within 24 hours. Is that how everyone interprets the 3RR policy? I'm more interested in understanding policy than seeing anyone blocked or banned. --<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 06:59, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Viriditas, you are wasting people's time with this legalistic bullshit. OneGuy shouldn't game the system, either, but immediately reverting a revert does, you know, cancel that revert. We can't cover all this silliness in policies, but that's why we are allowed to use our common sense. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 10:22, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>I would imagine, based on his deletion summaries and past work, that these images are meant to be replaced by their commons counterparts. However, it turns out that the EU flag image at commons is called Image:EU flag.png; probably this one was a simple mistake, easily enough corrected.

<dd>I looked at this briefly (didn't look at the diff of every last edit, so be please take that into account when reading my comments). It seems like Kenny, Daeron and the anon are responsible for most of the editing, with GzPl only doing a few. GzPl's version also seems somewhat more NPOV than Daeron's. OTOH, he doesn't seem to have made any effort (on the article Talk: page at least) to see what Daeron's point is, or work it out - just restores the article back to his version. Daeron, after doing the same several times (with occasional variations, perhaps in an attempt to include some content they could accept), is now responding on the Talk: page, although I'm not sure there will be a meeting of minds. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 15:21, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, a couple of nights ago there definitely was a co-ordinated series of attacks on <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a>, and <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionism.html" title="Zionism">Zionism</a>, though it could have been one extremely persistent vandal. The same edits were being inserted into the same articles (and eventually their Talk: pages, when the articles were protected) by the same IPs, usually anonymous proxies. Blocking the IPs on first vandalism seemed to slow them down a little, and after a couple of dozen IPs were blocked, they appeared to run out of steam. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><small>(Talk)</small></a> 19:10, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I posted what turn out to be some inflammatory comments on <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Isaac_Fanous_95ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Isaac Fanous">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Isaac Fanous</a> (on which i did not vote), including raising the possibility that the nomination is intended to "make a point" about the deletion that resulted from <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Marco_of_Alexandria_2c9b.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Marco of Alexandria">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Marco of Alexandria</a> early this month. I was acting, in the newer VfD, in behalf of WP standards for VfD, but not as an admin per se; i am now accused of vandalism directed at <a href="../../../o/m/a/User%7EOmar_Filini_43d3.html" title="User:Omar Filini">User:Omar Filini</a> (presumably on the previous VfD page and perhaps its corresponding article, tho i will report here after reviewing what could arguably be involved).<br />
I have since also advised another user involved, via <a href="../../../a/f/a/User_talk%7EAfanous_0198.html" title="User talk:Afanous">User talk:Afanous</a>, believing the complaint has only enhanced my influence on him.<br />
While i can't see any occasion for use of admin powers in the <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Isaac_Fanous_95ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Isaac Fanous">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Isaac Fanous</a> matter, IMO any other admin than myself would probably be able to exert a positive influence there; in particular i think there is need to deal, as a personal attack (as i labeled it more or less "privately" on <a href="../../../a/f/a/User_talk%7EAfanous_0198.html" title="User talk:Afanous">User talk:Afanous</a>), with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Isaac_Fanous&amp;diff=9600615&amp;oldid=9600525" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Isaac_Fanous&amp;diff=9600615&amp;oldid=9600525" rel="nofollow">edit</a> including "So its a religious issue". (In it, Omar also was the first to do what he later complains about, in assuming WPians are mostly Christian, and influenced by that).<br />
I'd appreciate someone else stepping in to facilitate civil discourse and counter abuses of the process.

<p>This didn't require an admin, but easily could without the involvement of someone responsible and (unlike me) previously uninvolved, as Afanous &amp; Omar have escalated their conflict further. I'm now aggressively removing personal attacks, and the subject of some of them.</p>
<p>Should i bother completing my research about what could be construed by Omar as my vandalism against him? Would anyone have read it if it had been done before this increased distraction?</p>

<dd>I'm sorry, I still don't exactly understand the problem. They're fighting over a VfD? Personal attacks on each other? Why not just ignore it until the VfD is over? <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><small>(Talk)</small></a> 00:18, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You sound like you think it's fine to say "no personal attacks", and ignore escalating personal attacks. IMO opinion your failure to speak out against leaving such policies on the books is a problem!</dd>
<dd>Well, perhaps the problem is that i'm a busybody, i s'pose. I think Omar shows no sign of learning from the earlier 20-5 loss or the current, so-far-9-2 loss that he can't accomplish anything with his uncritical self-confidence. (Afanous, on the other hand, can't take yes for an answer unless he gets to give it back to Omar as good as he's getting.) IMO a firm insistence on at least doing it by the rules helps communicate to them that these games won't eventually overcome the community's consensus if they are stubborn enough.</dd>
<dd>I'm trying to do that since it happened in front of me, but there are a number of reasons i'm not the best one for it. One is that Omar thinks the grudge he has over not getting a free rein on the earlier VfD gives him an excuse for defying my efforts, and treats each restriction as part of my persecution of him; someone else taking the roles i now do would simplify that. I also may not be suited to the role tempermentally, and just finally finding that out, in trying harder lately to correct the VfD-neglect, which i described about a year back as one of the weaknesses of my admin candidacy.</dd>
<dd>Tell you what: why not take a look at the page and tell me how well you think i'm doing so far.</dd>

<dd>It says that HistoryBuffEr is banned for 30 days for personal attacks and 30 days for discourtesy, and prohibited for one year from editing any article which relates to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict except in a proscribed manner. There is no mention of a continuing edit restriction on Jayjg.

<dd>Chris, the editing-restriction period against HistoryBuffEr is spelled out, but no restriction period against Jay is defined. My memory of reading the pages is that at one point a period of restricted editing against both parties was proposed, but then was only imposed on HistoryBuffEr. The end result is very unclear.

<dd>In fact, I don't think believe any such editing restriction applies, since in the end no findings regarding improper editing were found against me, and the penalties against me were dropped.

<p>The quote was said by Israel's justice minister, claiming that it doesn't represent the "official view" of Israel is not true. Since everyone who watched the news during the time of Arafat's death probably do remember hearing Lapidot saying this, I believe it is very relevant to the article. But Jayjg didn't think so, deleted the text and replaced it with a vague quote from <a href="../../../n/e/w/NewsMax.com_29cf.html" title="NewsMax.com">NewsMax.com</a>. Non explanation for why this was necessary was offered. And I wouldn't have brought it up if the removal of properly referenced text in question weren't done in such a hostile and unexplained manner (see the talk page). <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalestine-info_15f0.html" title="User:Palestine-info">Palestine-info</a> 10:44, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, politicians run off with the mouth all the time, and what they say doesn't necessarily represent their respective country's positions. Lapid was not speaking in an official capacity when he made his remark, so it was incorrect to attribute his comment as "Israel's" official position. --<a href="../../../m/p/e/User%7EMPerel_ce51.html" title="User:MPerel">MPerel</a><sup><small>( <a href="../../../m/p/e/User_talk%7EMPerel_2b5d.html" title="User talk:MPerel">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MPerel_0ace.html" title="Special:Contributions/MPerel">contrib</a>)</small></sup> 12:03, Jan 26, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Actually, you replaced the original statement in the article about "security concerns" with a comment emphasizing Lapid's personal concerns. As far as I know, Justice Ministers do not set policy on where Palestinians are buried in Israel, and in any event Lapid was speaking hypothically, before Arafat died. The official statement was made after his death. Also, (and unsurpisingly) you misrepresent my source; I brought two sources, Newsmax <b>and</b> the Chicago Tribune, though I could have brought many more, and the sources were quite clear on Israel's official position. As for your claims about what you would or wouldn't have done based on the Talk: page, you changed the text without using the Talk: page, including text you were proposing which had been clearly rejected by a number of other editors. Dealing with your constant attempts to inject bias into all articles relating to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is quite tiring; on the Israel article, for example, you've even made a Request for Comment, and had a number of unrelated editors come in and tell you are wrong, but you simply don't accept it. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><small>(Talk)</small></a> 15:43, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

It would also be interesting to hear the arbitrators who were involved in the cases opinion. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalestine-info_15f0.html" title="User:Palestine-info">Palestine-info</a> 16:52, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I suggest that you concern yourself less with lawyering and rules, and more with accuracy and good writing. It would appear that you made a demonstrably inaccurate edit, and Jayjg reverted it because it was inaccurate.

<p>A new user (although they talk as if they're familiar with Wikipedia processes and editors) named User:Gearle0521 moved the <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_5c73.html" title="African American">African American</a> article to a bizarre name and deleted several paragraphs as racially biased.

<p>I'm new to Wikipedia. These are communications between myself and someone named FVW, who I believe is acting like a bully for no reason, and who has defaced my talk page with a rude, insulting, and alarming notice for no reason whatsoever. i had added a link to the topic "Bhajan" to a page of devotional singing and bhajans, which also links to other bhajan webpages. It would seem to be a logical link to add, however, even if it is somehow not appropriate for some strange reason, there was no reason for FVW to add a mean-spirited warning to my user's page that would make me very unlikely to add helpful links in the future. My user page is <a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.7.228.233.html" title="User talk:68.7.228.233">User_talk:68.7.228.233</a>. The webpage I had added to the topic of Bhajan was <a href="http://www.devotionalsinging.com" class="external free" title="http://www.devotionalsinging.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.devotionalsinging.com</a>. Thank you for any assistance you can offer to help clear this up and prevent further abuse of well meaning wikipedia contributors.</p>
<p>My communications with FVW begin with the title: your alarming notice</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hello, it took some sleuthing to find who left this alarming warning for me, since you did not include any contact information. I believe you left the alarming warning after I added a link to the page regarding Bhajans, because apparently you deemed it to be spam. The referenced page is a noncommercial page of chanting and devotional singing that includes many bhajans and links to other pages of bhajans, and which is soon to include even more. If you deem it to be not appropriate to this topic for some reason, that is obviously part of your job, and I am new to this process, however it seems that you are quite quick to send alarming notices that must certainly chase away those who have come to contribute valuable links, such as the link I added to your bhajan page, which had no links at all until I added the link to our free, streaming audio page of bhajans, which also includes links to other pages of streaming audio bhajans. I think that it is a shame that I'll have to see your alarming notice whenever I check my user talk page at wikipedia.</dd>
</dl>
<p>FVW replied: Wikipedia is not a web directory. Only add links that are informative and strictly relevant to the subject. --fvw* 15:56, 2005 Jan 26 (UTC)</p>
<p>Of course, giving a link to a free page of streaming bhajans is clearly informative and strictly relevant to the subject of bhajans. It was surprising to see that you left this message on my page and then chose to also leave the nasty warning alarm on my page just because you thought that my page of streaming bhajans somehow did not relate to the subject of bhajans. I think this makes it clear that you like to bully people who have come to participate in this effort, since I clearly explained why this alarming notice was not wanted or warrented. Is there an administrator that I can bring this problem to?</p>

<p>There has been an ongoing revert war concerning only the third paragraph of this section, dealing with the possible bisexuality of Abraham Lincoln. The latest version is the result of Abelincoln98 violating the three revert rule. He has also been shouting on the talk page.</p>
<p>There are around 5 versions floating around. Most are obviously not neutral, and the current one removes the link to the article where his sexuality is contested (obvious vandalism), but even ones that are claimed to be neutral aren't (in my opinion.. heh). I'd suggest reverting to the version before the current one, and protecting the whole article (or just that section, if such a thing is possible). If you don't want to protect the page, then you're definitely going to have to monitor the actions on this page more carefully, because I doubt this revert war will end any time soon. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><font color="#BA0000">brian0918</font></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#BA0000"></font></a> 01:12, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As someone who hasn't been involved at all, I can see nothing the anon did to warrant a block. They were pushing a POV, but were willing to discuss that on the talk page, possibly rather too vigorously. Discussion on their talk page should precede a block for any but the most egregious vandalism.-<a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadfium_9104.html" title="User:Gadfium">gadfium</a> 02:02, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
I did not block this user because of his edit to the article. I blocked him for intentional disruption and making personal attacks, not on me but on other users.</p>
<p>His comments on the talk page (directed at Everyking) made it clear that this user was only here to vent rage against somebody:</p>
<ul>
<li>We, the people of ex-soviet bloc countries are personally insulted when anglo-saxons pet "Uncle Joe" as the kind old leader.</li>
<li>You are Stalin apologets.</li>
<li>I really wish Stalin ruled you, not us. You are like Rumsfeld, who met Saddam during mid-1980s and praised him as a good ally in the anti-Khomeini Iran war. When will you realize that Putyin's current rule is an analog of Stalin's...</li>
<li>Thus, by not mentioning Stalins criminality in unambigious terms, you hold the english-speaking world blind to Putyin's methods and you contribute to a "new Uncle Joe" sentiment, which will inevitable put the world and the poor Russian race in great danger...</li>
<li>Anglo-saxons betrayed us big time then, shame on the Free World...</li>
</ul>
<p>After I'd blocked 195.70.48.242 for attacking Everyking as one of the 'Anglo-Saxons' who betrayed the Hungarian patriots, he then sent an email to a number of other admins browbeating me because of my alleged Russian ancestry: "'Sokolov' is a patent slavic name, thus we have good reason to assume that user '172' belongs to an ethnic group which has some relation to the USSR / Russia. This means the admin user '172' cannot be an objective judge of matters concerning Josif Stalin, because he is bent on protecting that russian dictator by necessity of ethnic kinship so strong among slavs." Just to respond to those bigoted comments-- even though they are not worthy of a response-- I am not Russian. My family lived in Lodz until 1939. Of the surviors following 1945, one relative returned-- my father's cousin-- but he was killed shortly after the war. One of my aunts fled to the Stalinist USSR, but was killed there. The rest found there way to the U.S. after leaving the refugee camps in Germany. So my family likley suffered far more than his due to the horrors of German and Russian totalitarianism. Yet this is no excuse for me, or any other editor, to start trolling the Stalin page and ranting and raving about 'Anglo-Saxon' betrayal and 'Stalinist apologetics.' Hailing from Hungary does give 195.70.48.242 an excuse to use the Stalin article as a forum to vent rage against the Russians. He must be held to the same standards of behavior as (say) Everyking, Fred Bauder, and myself when participating on the Talk:Joseph Stalin.</p>
<p>The personal attacks and disruption generated by this user more than warranted a block. <b>Furthermore, the one week block is established protocol.</b> For example, <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeutrality_7a9d.html" title="User:Neutrality">User:Neutrality</a> blocked <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGenyo_5057.html" title="User:Genyo">User:Genyo</a>, another nationalist editor who was behaving in a similarly disruptive manner on <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Russia_9acb.html" title="History of Russia">History of Russia</a> for one week. (Actually, 195.70.48.242's behavior warrnated an even longer block than Genyo, given the combination of disruption and personal attacks directed against Everyking. Genyo at least attacked 'Russian imperialism' while refraining from attacking other users.) <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 03:01, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't have a strong feeling about the block, except perhaps that it ought to have been preceded by a warning. I am troubled, however, by Fred Bauder's apparent judgement, based on his comments on <a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.html" title="User talk:172">User talk:172</a>, that having grown up in the Eastern bloc entitles an individual to make POV edits and personal attacks. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadicalsubversiv_69e3.html" title="User:Radicalsubversiv"><b>R</b>adical<b>S</b>ubversiv</a> <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadicalsubversiv_1bf7.html" title="User talk:Radicalsubversiv"><b>E</b></a> 06:29, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This block was unjustified by any stretch of the imagination. Can an admin unblock please? Consensus is clearly against 172 on this.

<dd>This is my last response to you. (1) I did indeed block that user for making personal attacks, which was an aspect of his particularly disruptive behavior. My statements were not contradictory. (2) I did not say that Neutrality makes policy. I pointed to that block as an example of precedence. Now leave me alone. I will not bother to block this user again.

<p>I don't think having lived under a totalitarian regime gives a Wikipedia editor unlimited license. They ARE entitled to a rant or two when they encounter what they perceive as bias.

<dd>Sorry, I'm still extremely troubled by this. You seem to be implying that a user who grew up in a country you judge to be totalitarian is entitled to more leeway in violating policy than a user who did not. I find this unacceptable.

I don't proceed on the assumption that they ought to be blocked, at least not for a few edits.

<p>The problem with blocking wars is that we fail to present a united front to a potentially disruptive user. If he takes it wrong, seeing a crack in our front, he then goes on to being banned, wasting arbitration committee time, instead of being brought up short and conforming to our shared policies. Anonymous editors are not allowed to make a practice of personal attacks, endless rants about the evils of communism, etc. I'm in agreement on that, but not with pre-emptory blocking of someone who is initially outraged at a single article, an outrage I share but express in a different way. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> 14:58, Jan 28, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>not</b> blocking a user <b>is not</b> an endorsement of that user's edits. If uninvolved admins object to the block, don't block. I am honestly concerned about 172's behaviour. Of course the nationalism rant is stupid, but since when have we been blocking users for being blockheads? Admins are <i>janitors</i> not the lords of Wikipedia. We have the cumbersome but working system of rfc+arbcom. 172, if you are upset about that user's ranting, open an rfc about it, just like everybody else. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 15:20, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd>no, no, I agree it is a problem, I'm just saying the way you should address it is not by unilaterally blocking users, but try to get a consensus to work it into policy. If you ask me to vote for a policy that slaps a short block on the kind of rant we're looking at here, I certainly will! The more reasonably complete articles we are sitting on, the more work it is to protect them from being torn apart by pov-pushers. I do believe policy will have to recognize this, and give us better tools for defending WP. Again, I'm not saying that your block was unfounded. I'm saying that "block-revert-wars" make us look divided and clueless. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 22:27, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</small>

<dd>That's why I gave up. If Fred Bauder wants to continue providing cover to trolls because their POV lines up with his own, then he'll no longer encounter my opposition. As for a vote on a new policy, I'm unfamiliar with the process for launching a vote, so I'll leave that to another user. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 01:18, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There are two identical Wikipages <a href="../../../a/z/e/Azerbaijani_language.html" title="Azerbaijani language">Azerbaijani language</a> and <a href="../../../a/z/e/Azerbaijanian_language.html" title="Azerbaijanian language">Azerbaijanian language</a>. I tried to merge the first one with the second one under common name 'Azerbaijanian language' but did not succeed. Can somebody help me to redirect 'Azerbaijani language' page to the 'Azerbaijanian language' page'. I appreciate your attention and your help.

<p><a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETravis9_eddd.html" title="User:Travis9">User:Travis9</a> is a purposefully created sockpuppet for voting on <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Wikipedia%7EDon%27t_be_a_dick_981e.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Wikipedia:Don't be a dick">VFD:Don't be a dick</a>.

<dd>After some persuasion on the IRC, I've decided to assume good faith and believe that Travis9 is indeed a newbie who happened to know how to vote <b>keep/BJAODN</b> on their 5th edit on their first day. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_c719.html" title="User:Zocky">Zocky</a> 16:41, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I suppose it's vaguely possible that they could have seen this on another vote, looked to see what BJAODN was, and then copied the other vote. But I wonder how they found they way to VfD so quickly... <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 15:08, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well VfD isn't <b>that</b> hidden. You wander around and run into a page on VfD (these tend to generate discussion elsewhere too) or you dive into policy (not unusual for newbies) and run across the deletion policy. --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 23:47, 2005 Jan 29 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am not sure where to put this, so if I am in the wrong spot, I apologize. All I want to ask for help is that I created a new page, <a href="../../../f/a/c/Fact-value_distinction.html" title="Fact-value distinction">Fact-value distinction</a>, and I wanted to make sure alternate spellings such as <a href="../../../f/a/c/Fact_value_distinction_d82b.html" title="Fact/value distinction">fact/value distinction</a> went to the new article. I tried to accomplish this in the wrong way, I suspect now, by creating the alternate spelling name pages and trying to move it to the correct article. It did not work out well, first of all I spelt distinction wrong on one page. Could someone help clear this up for me. Someone? thanks --<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikerussell_7470.html" title="User:Mikerussell">Mikerussell</a> 18:32, 2005 Jan 28 (UTC)</p>

<p>Could someone kindly block him? He keeps disruptively incorporating a template which is up for deletion into the <a href="../../../s/i/s/Wikipedia%7ESister_projects_1129.html" title="Wikipedia:Sister projects">Wikipedia:Sister projects</a> link boxes. The result is an deletion notice that does not match the various templates themselves. This is uglifying a LOT of articles. He knows about the Three revert rule, but seems intent (more so than me, which is a feat).

<dd>I dunno, from looking at <a href="../../../t/f/d/WP%7ETfD_0497.html#Template:Sisterproject" title="WP:TfD">WP:TfD#Template:Sisterproject</a> and <a href="../../../s/i/s/Wikipedia_talk%7ESister_projects_dbe2.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Sister projects">Wikipedia talk:Sister projects</a>, it seems like there's a real debate over how to do this, and I don't see that either of you two has everyone else on their side, so I think you all are going to have to work it out (which I am confident you both will, albeit after some sparks and grouchiness and upset). <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 15:36, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>
