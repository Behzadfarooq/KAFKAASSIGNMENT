<dd>This looks to be another <a href="../../../i/a/s/User%7EIasson_c21f.html" title="User:Iasson">Iasson</a> sockpuppet, but this is based solely on a hunch after looking at the wording of the <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28miscellaneous%29_ea61.html#Attention_all_inclusionists.21" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (miscellaneous)">post</a> you mentioned above, particularly "The encroaching hordes of deletionist" and "Friends, now is the time to come forth to do battle against the enemy. We must marshal our forces at once."

<dd>Judging from spelling and grammar, though, I don't believe this is Iasson himself, but someone parodying his style; our troll has a little too good a command of the English language to reliably pass for Iasson, and he takes it just a tiny bit too far. Of course, these things are almost impossible to pin down for sure. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 17:34, 2005 May 5 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I feel I should point out that being a sockpuppet, even a loud and long-winded one, is not in itself grounds for being blocked.

<dd>A complaint about libel has been made by someone who is not a public figure. If we keep the material, or keep reinserting it as Delirium is doing, we're on sticky ground legally. This is a question of commonsense and sticking to policy, and also making an effort to be fair to named individuals. Usenet isn't a credible source. We can write about the group and we can write about its awards using Usenet itself as primary-source material, but we shouldn't name the award winners, especially once they have told us the issue might affect their business.

<dd>I'm clearly outnumbered, so I won't go on about it, but I just want to add that media law isn't as simple as that, not even in the U.S. There are a number of avenues that could be pursued in a case like this. Anyway, the main point for me is that we shouldn't want to use Usenet posts as a source of criticism of private individuals. No newspaper would do it (unless there was some public-interest issue at stake e.g. if someone named kook of the year on Usenet had also been grooming young girls for sex) so we shouldn't either. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 22:14, May 5, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I completely agree with you on this one. Even in articles about controversial biographical public figures, people are sensitive about using derogatory terms to describe them. And at least when they *are* reported, both the critics POV as well as the response to critics addressing the details behind the negative term are given for balance. But this case is just plain defamation and very unencyclopedic. --<a href="../../../m/p/e/User%7EMPerel_ce51.html" title="User:MPerel"><font color="#330000">M</font><font color="#334400">P</font><font color="#338800">er</font><font color="#33CC00">el</font></a> <sup><small>( <a href="../../../m/p/e/User_talk%7EMPerel_2b5d.html" title="User talk:MPerel"><font color="#11BB00">talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MPerel_0ace.html" title="Special:Contributions/MPerel"><font color="#3399FF">contrib</font></a>)</small></sup> 04:56, May 6, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your understanding of defamation is faulty. A statement doesn't have to be an allegation of criminal activity to be defamatory--most defamatory statements are nothing like that. In general if a person reading the statement would be likely to think less of the person about whom the statement is made, then it may be defamatory.</dd>
<dd>There is a secondary sting here. A person reading this nonsense on a Usenet newsgroup or a kook site may not tend to think much of it (the allegations aren't particularly credible or well supported) but if he reads it in Wikipedia (even though Wikipedia may only be reporting a fact) the fact that Wikipedia thought the fact worthy of reporting would tend to make the statement more credible and thus cause more damage to the victim than the original publication.</dd>
<dd>My opinion of Wollmann is well known, I nominated him for his first KOTM, but also in my opinion the publication of this <i>outside Usenet</i>, especially on a venue as prominent as Wikipedia, may cause damage to Wollmann. In my nomination and subsequent comments I referred solely to his antics on Usenet, whereas some of his fellow kooks since then have falsely accused Wollmann of all kinds of wrongdoing of which he is innocent. Wikipedia should not get involved in this fight. Wollmann is a private individual, his privacy should be respected. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 11:47, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No. Although the exact legal definition of defamation will vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, it generally includes the requirement that a statement be a factual assertion (i.e. provably true or false), and <b>false</b>. (E.g. <i>an intentional false communication that injures another person’s good name or reputation</i> <a href="http://www.legal-definitions.com/defamation.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.legal-definitions.com/defamation.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>; <i>A false statement that injures someone's reputation</i> <a href="http://www.nolo.com/definition.cfm/term/E0563767-C3CE-42B0-90107F29AF588A6C/alpha/D" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nolo.com/definition.cfm/term/E0563767-C3CE-42B0-90107F29AF588A6C/alpha/D" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>) So, in this case, reporting that "so-and-so was voted Kook of the Year" is a factual, true, statement, and therefore by definition not defamatory. (There's legal axiom which I don't have time to look up that goes something like "truth is an absolute defense against charges of defamation".)</dd>
<dd>This person might have a case against the KotM site, but I doubt it. I don't know about all jusisdictions, but in the US, at least, statements of opinion which do not imply facts are protected (<i>constitutional protection extends to statements of opinion .. that do not contain or imply a provable factual assertion</i> <a href="http://www.lectlaw.com/def/d021.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lectlaw.com/def/d021.htm" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>), and since there's no objective test for being a "kook" (it's a matter of opinion), they are almost certainly safe too.</dd>
<dd>Finally, I never said that only allegations of criminal activity counted as defamatory - I merely gave that as an <i>example</i> of a factual assertion which would be defamatory (if untrue). <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 18:41, 10 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Jurisdiction does make a difference. In the UK Wollmann would have to prove that you published something potentially defamatory (he does that by getting his lawyer to look at the site and download the defamatory statement). Now if you want to defend yourself by justification, the onus is on <i>you</i> to prove that the statement is true. How are you going to do that? There is no such entity as alt.usenet.kooks, it's just a bunch of people. Okay, so you try getting your lawyer to go to google groups and find a post where someone says "we voted and Wollmann is the winner." Well, that <i>may</i> work, or it may not. Perhaps Wollmann's lawyer goes to Google Groups and shows the judge some clear examples where false reports have been made on alt.usenet.kooks. There are many such--the group has at least once had kooks and trolls posing as alternative vote wranglers, and in any case we only have that person's word for it that the votes went the way they did (voting is traditionally by email). You could get me to testify that I made the first nomination of Wollmann for KOTM, but that doesn't prove that the votes tallied were actually cast. All you can prove is that I made a post on auk and a few weeks later some guy claimed that they did a count and Wollmann won.</dd>
<dd>In short, a good lawyer could have you for breakfast in the UK jurisdiction. In a jurisdiction that is less plaintiff-friendly, the result may be different. You'd better hope that the person you risk defaming doesn't have money or can't get standing to sue in the UK. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 18:56, 10 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, that's a considerably more interesting point.

<dd><i>With all their beliefs united Thule began funding construction of an inter-dimensional flight disc named the Jenseitsflugmaschine (Other World Flight Machine) in 1921. The disc was built through a series of psychic revelations of the medium Maria Orsic then translated by a Vril medium named Sigrun. Together, they provided the basic materials to be used in the construction of the machine and the first designs of the machine itself. This machine was then built in Munich in 1922 in secret under the leadership of Thulist Professor W.O. Schumann of the Technical University of Munich.</i></dd>
<dd><i>Thule and Vril experimented with the odd disc machine for two years and then dismantled it after Professor Schumann derived a levitator unit from the research. This was perfected over many years and aroused great interest by Hitler, Himmler, and Goering.</i></dd>

<dl>
<dd>No. There's a third hurdle - that its length be in an appropriate proportion with the length of the article and with the amount that can be said about the topic. Which is a variation on writing in a NPOV manner, but is still very much important.

<p>I see what <a href="../../../p/j/a/User%7EPjacobi_dff5.html" title="User:Pjacobi">Pjacobi</a> means. I've just tried editing <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_mysticism.html" title="Nazi mysticism">Nazi mysticism</a>, among other things adding some qualifications to pretty unpleasant claims (e.g., "Another key belief is in the weakening of this <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herrenrasse.html" title="Herrenrasse">Herrenrasse</a> (master race) due to <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miscegenation.html" title="Miscegenation">interbreeding</a> with <a href="../../../l/e/s/Lesser_races.html" title="Lesser races">lesser races</a>." changed to "Another key belief is in the supposed weakening of this <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herrenrasse.html" title="Herrenrasse">Herrenrasse</a> (master race) due to <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miscegenation.html" title="Miscegenation">interbreeding</a> with so-called <a href="../../../l/e/s/Lesser_races.html" title="Lesser races">lesser races</a>.") SS swept in, declared my additions to be "weasel words", and deleted them. He's just reverted them again. It seems really to matter to him that we not dilute the reference to lessser races; I can't understand why. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 14:53, 7 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Some key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>It shouldn't matter if I think Dinosaurs ride in spaceships, but...</li>
<li>I don't think dinosaurs ride in spaceships</li>
<li>I think the text that was being added needed a clean up</li>
<li>I don't think the text being added was <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">vandalism</a></li>
<li>I think moving the text to the talk page would have been better than simply deleting it</li>
<li>I definitely think protecting a page yourself, on your version, after reverting a page repeatedly, is a misuse of admin abilities</li>

<dd>Nonsense, admins protect pages that they have been reverting all the time. It's called being a janitor, and sometimes some of us catch flak from people personally involved in the material (which I am not). The difference between "ben is gay" and "nazis had UFOs" is pretty tenuous. Add the fact that this anonymous user was vandalizing my user page every time I removed his/her conspiracy theory (and continues to) and you have a pretty standard case of test message/protect page/block as needed. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilsor_f92e.html" title="User:Silsor">silsor</a> 12:34, May 8, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As I've already explained elsewhere: "As the diff. illustrates, I made some uncontroversial edits to the English, and wikified the headers. The worry I have about the content (the etmyology of the term "Thule") I took to the Talk page." A "vulgar display of power"?

<dd>I don't think you meant to violate policy, certainly, and the edits you made were wholly suitable changes to make, but Sam is right in that sysops are expressely forbidden from editing vandalism-protected pages. I've been frustrated by this several times, but it is the best way to keep the wiki process going (all participants have an equal chance to effect the changes they wish), and we should keep observing it.</dd>

I'm now not sure that I should have blocked ElKabong myself, as I had been involved in editing the page (at the time I thought that, given the 3RR issue isn't a subjective matter but an objective and mechanically verifiable fact, being an interested party shouldn't matter, but I should have checked the rules first). I'm therefore reluctant to do anything about the anon. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 16:58, 6 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Blocking someone for 3RR seems to involve some subjective decision. I would recommend against blocking someone for 3RR in the future if you're involved with the article in question. Warn the anon, explain he's making the same edits as someone who was blocked and let someone else do the blocking should the need ever arise. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 19:50, May 6, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, I'll be much more circumspect in future (oddly, it was the first time I'd ever blocked for 3RR). The anon has been warned, but is clearly <a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElkabong_f4ca.html" title="User:Elkabong">Elkabong</a>, and has no self-control — swearing and shouting at other editors, calling anyone who disagrees with him an Islamist, a sockpuppet, etc. The page in question (<a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamophobia.html" title="Islamophobia">Islamophobia</a>) has now had to be protected because of him. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 21:07, 6 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I've spent some time trying to protect Chadbryant from a string of vandalising sockpuppets, but it must be admitted that his own behaviour can often be just as childish as theirs. The only thing to be said in his defence, I think, is that he limits his silliness to his own User and Talk pages, whereas they extend their vandalism to articles and to his User page. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 12:12, 7 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree that vandalizing his page is childish and he has a right to not have to go through it, however it does NOT take away from the fact that he changed my comments on his user page when all I was trying to do (and quite politely I may add) was inform him that I am NOT one of the trolls he has his flamewar with AND to please stop accusing me of being as such. **NOTE** Ok I have JUST seen he has done it again, changing my comments once more. This time He has me linking myself to some geocities webpage of someone whom I assume is the person he keeps accusing me of being. Really now, perhaps someone needs to talk to him because obviously he thinks he is above the rules. TruthCrusader 08:19, 8 May 2005</p>

<p><a href="../../../d/r/i/User%7EDrippingInk_8cfa.html" title="User:DrippingInk">DrippingInk</a> (<a href="../../../d/r/i/User_talk%7EDrippingInk_13e6.html" title="User talk:DrippingInk">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_DrippingInk_b3d4.html" title="Special:Contributions/DrippingInk">contribs</a>), editing from his account and from various IP addresses, has been persistently changing the titles of songs, albums, etc., and the use of numbers ("1st" for "first", # for "number", etc.) across a range of pop-music articles, from Wikipedia style to his own preference. He hasn't even claimed that his changes reflect the labels' versions of the titles; he simply, stubbornly, and with no other explanation that he thinks he's right, and doesn't care about Wikipedia style, insists on changing them. He has even twice made a copy-and-paste move of an article to its redirect and <i>vice versa</i> in order to pursue this agenda. He has also (again, with no explanation) moved short descriptions of singles from album articles in order to create stubs. He refuses to engage in discussion of most of these issues.</p>
<p>Although I have no interest in the subject matter of the articles concerned, I've now been defending them against this sort of semi-vandalism for long enough that I probably count as involved. Could someone else look at the situation, and deal with his IP-address sock-puppetry and his other behaviour? <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 15:14, 7 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>He's also now blanked my user page. Is it unacceptable for me to block a user for vandalism when it was aimed at my page? I assume so, if (as in this case) I've been in conflict with the person in question. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 17:30, 7 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Blanking someone's userpage isn't acceptable and I won't have a problem with you blocking him for such a blatant vandalism act.

<ul>
<li>I've blocked him for 6 hours for the blanking. Try to get him to discuss and come to an agreement after it expires (feel free to unblock yourself, if you think I'm too harsh). Please, be as specific as you can when quoting rules and policy. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 17:49, May 7, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I shall certainly try — but he's stated (on my Talk page) that he doesn't care what Wikipedia style is. Still, I suppose that anyone can change. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 18:48, 7 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am completely uncertain as to whether Mel is right about what he says is official Wikipedia style. For example, he wants the song "I'm With You" to be called "I'm with You" (lowercase "with"). And I just don't think that looks right, and I suspect the label would recognize the former. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 19:12, 7 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I kinda agree -- Wikipedia style should take back seat to the actual usage, in the case of titles. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 19:32, 7 May 2005 (UTC)

<li><i>With</i> in this case seems to fall into a bit of a gray area. <i>Chicago</i> suggests, "...Lowercase prepositions, regardless of length, except when they are stressed (<i>through</i> in <i>A River Runs Through It</i>), ..." In this case, I believe I would capitalize it, just as I capitalize <i>without</i> in U2's "With or Without You". — <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledge_Seeker_08dc.html" title="User:Knowledge Seeker">Knowledge Seeker</a> <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">দ</a> 19:50, 7 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The <i>Chicago Manual</i> quote from above, I should point out, says more fully, "3) Lowercase prepositions, regardless of length, except when they are stressed (<i>through</i> in <i>A River Runs Through It</i>), <b>are used adverbially or adjectivially (<i>up</i> in <i>Look Up</i>, <i>down</i> in <i>Turn Down</i>, <i>on</i> in <i>The On Button</i>, or [Latin section omitted].</b> (Section 8.167, page 367 of the 15th Edition). So something like "Spice <b>Up</b> Your Life" (DrippingInk's version) is preferred to "Spice <b>up</b> Your Life" (Mel's version). It's not vandalism <i>per se</i> as Mel Etitis makes it out to be, though DrippingInk could certainly use some work on his social skills. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 00:13, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The case of "with" is just one of many, though; he's capitalised "to", "the", etc. in various other titles, as well as insisting on phrases such as "the 1st single reached #2". He also reverted my wikifying of headings which were all-capitalised. (Incidentally, I found a number of sources (including Amazon) that used the "I'm with You" version; Lavigne's own site has no relevant information, astonishingly. No-one has offered the obvious evidence — an album cover with the title in the form insisted upon by DrippingInk.) <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 22:19, 7 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm no fan of Cantus' tactics or attitude WRT this project, but the ArbCom ruling mentions that he may not revert "articles" more than once a day, and this Template is not an article.

<dd>Geni, I've warned him on his talk page as I feel people should be warned before being blocked. I then went to the page to revert his 4th revert, but since then someone has put forward a compromise version, so I left it.

<p>This block is an abuse of the policy: the reverts in question are of images (graphs), which can not be reworded (duh). Geni knows this full well, and is trying to silence me because he disagrees with my contributions. Jtdirl has an axe to grind, because he and I have disagreed on unrelated matters. IMHO, Geni and Jtdirl should lose admin privileges, but I'll settle for an immediate unblocking. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 01:52, May 9, 2005 (UTC)</p>

I may have inadvertently crossed the 3RR myself by getting muddled up timewise yesterday, and have not touched the page after realising this (if I have I can only apologise), though I believe KEITH has reverted many more times as he has been up against me and worldtraveller. besides the spamming and almost certainly untrue statements combined with the terrible English makes his repeatedly putting in what he does arguably on the verge of vandalism,--<a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 17:12, May 8, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I've warned him on his talk page. I'm not sure there's any point in blocking him right now, as the edits have stopped and he seems to have access to several IP addresses anyway; and Squeakbox, if you also violated it, I'd have to block you too. I can protect it if you like, so let me know if that would help. If he does it again, he'll be blocked. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 00:52, May 9, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dejvid, judging by a glance at the history, you've violated 3RR too. I think protection would make more sense in this case so you can sort it out on talk.

<p>I'm concerned that this is yet another bad-faith 3RR report that was not properly investigated. After reading the talk page, it appears that Slrubenstein was reverting based on talk-page consensus, while Arcturus, who reported this "violation," kept inserting the unsupported version. The dispute is, in fact, currently listed on <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a>. Given that, I think it's a terribly bad idea for <i>any</i> of the participants to be blocked. There can't be discussion if Slrubenstein is sitting out a 3RR block. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 23:48, 8 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd unblock him altogether, but then I only support 3RR blocks in the case of pointless POV revert-warring (when both sides are composed of POV-pushers). In this case, Slrubenstein appears to have the support of talk page consensus, and frankly makes a good case. Academics <i>are</i> moving towards using only CE/BCE, although no body, to my knowledge, has mandated such a change. It wouldn't surprise me if Common Era notation became the standard within a generation. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 23:53, 8 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Exactly, though strictly speaking admins are not supposed to look at content issues regarding 3RR, but I think a warning on SLR's talk page would have helped, particularly as he was upholding the consensus. Brief page proection would have made more sense in this instance. I'm going to unblock him early unless anyone explicitly objects, but I'll leave it a few more hours, as I take on board the points made above that he's been blocked before. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 23:57, May 8, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've reduced the block to three hours from now, which means he'll have been blocked for six. This is twice the length of the last block he got from Geni. I'm doing this on the grounds that he's a good editor who was upholding the consensus of the talk page; he probably didn't realize he'd made a fourth revert, and because he wasn't warned, he wasn't given a chance to revert himself.

<p>Could someone please point to the part of the policy that suggests it's okay to revert-war if you are "upholding consensus"? Slrubinstein has a history of revert-warring. I don't necessarily have a problem with that, but suggesting he doesn't know what he's doing is a bit silly, frankly. And the point, El C, is that admins are evenhanded. They shouldn't give a pass to their friends. Doing so encourages some editors to feel they are "protected" and can revert to their heart's content. Surely you don't want to encourage that notion? <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 03:19, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The point? The point of what, Grance Note? If you think favouratism was a factor in my position, then I think you're wrong. if you think I face the risk of leaving that impression, then so be it. While I would, in that case, attempt to answer such charges, what I refuse, however, to do is uninvolve myself administratively with people whom I have a positive collegial relationship with. Unironically, I feel that extends to you as well (that is, we have a positive collegial relationship). And for that matter, people whom I have a poor one with. As for what actually comes to my attention (I can only act on what I'm privy to), in this case, a direct request for assistance from SR, that might seem like an important factor (it is on the perception end of it), but I'm confident that it has no bearing on my objectivity here. If you disagree with that, if you think I wasn't being evenhanded, I welcome your input on any 'specific' item. Corruption is something that I oppose very strongly, but I could not give a flying seaturtle about political-correctness (which is, irnoically, one factor listed in the AD/CE debate; there, as well, I don't think it should be one – the basis should be the critical scholarship of that specific field/s). <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 07:11, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, the thing is, Slrubenstein has a history of revert-warring against POV-pushers. This isn't necessarily a good thing, but I for one look favorably on users who try to uphold consensus and who push for academic integrity (in this, I refer to the long struggle against CheeseDreams). Wikipedia isn't just an exercise in democracy, anarchy, or even (sadly) aristocracy, but an attempt to make an encyclopedia. If we fetishize policy we risk losing sight that policy was made to protect the encyclopedia, not the other way round. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 03:24, 9 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for your comment. I'm not asking you to "fetishise" policy, just to point out where "revert-warring against POV-pushers" (which in itself is pushing a POV, of course, we all have POVs!) is encouraged. I looked at the page. I don't actually see a "consensus". I see a majority and some dissenters. Unless you are defining "POV pusher" as someone who does not accord with the majority view -- and I sincerely hope you are not -- I don't see how Slrubenstein is excluded from the rule on reverting, professorship or otherwise. If he is pushing the majority view, he has <i>even less</i> reason to revert more than three times because he can be sure other editors will back him up. I'm sure Slrubenstein is a good editor, who does try to insert POVs that are supported by research, but he's inclined to get carried away. A block is a gentle reminder not to do that. Unblocking him, and the defence of his behaviour here, supports behaviour that I think should be discouraged as detrimental to making the encyclopaedia. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 04:41, 9 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I read through the talk page, and my impression was that the majority had actual reasons for their position–reasons that made sense–while the dissenters were just that--dissenters. They had no justification that I could discern, they just didn't want the CE/BCE. Now, I personally don't care either way; I've used both in papers depending on how I was feeling. I mean, when the point of change is still the purported birth of Jesus a simple renaming doesn't reduce the Judeo-Christian centric nature of the calendar. That said, if a majority makes a good case for one or the other in the absence of actual policy it should be supported. Repeatedly changing the article and acting as though there's no consensus is disruptive. There's a reason the other editors would back him up. I don't find a 24-hour block, or even a 6-hour block, a gentle reminder. Rather, it moves an important participant from the debate. I'd rather see the page protected. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 04:50, 9 May 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It remains the case that a majority, however well they argue their case, does not represent a "consensus". I don't believe that either side made a particularly good case. I personally don't like CE but I wouldn't change it if I saw it. You are right that repeatedly changing the article is disruptive. It's disruptive whether you are in the majority or not, and whether you argue your case well or not. The rule against revert-warring is valuable and should be supported, not just in cases where those we don't agree with breach it. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 05:30, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Rules apparently mean nothing at Wikipedia. It's who you know and who knows you. Don't call it a clique or cabal because that might violate the rule against personal attacks - unless of course you are one of the "in-crowd". Then you can violate any rules you wish because your friends will always be there to help make excuses for you, revert for you, unblock you, vote for your adminship, and generally cover for you.

<dd>Hello there and welcome to Wikipedia. I see this is your second edit, thus I'll safely assume you're either a very new user or a sockpuppet. I'll be kind and assume the former. I've never been invited to join the cabal, despite being an administrator for over half a year and an editor for close to two years. It was only a few months ago that we made the 3RR enforceable by blocking, and even then it was only an option. No administrator is required to block anyone, and I know some do not on principle. In this case, <b>several</b> administrators looked at the matter and decided there was no point in blocking Slrubinstein (who, incidentally, has PhD and is generally not looked upon as a dunce). Wikipedia is emphatically not an experiment in anarchy; we reward those who contribute to the project. If administrators are granted more leeway than new users, and they are, it is because they have demonstrated in the eyes of the community that they can actually make themselves useful. I'm sorry if you find this system unfair, but it is what it is. If you really think the system is hopelessly corrupt, within thirty minutes of creating an account, I'd encourage you to go elsewhere, because you're obviously too pure to help us dunces write our cabal-opedia. If, on the other hand, you think we can be saved, I'd suggest that you write some articles or add to existing ones, and show by example how to be a good wikipedian.

<dd>I'm sorry, I thought I was speaking with someone who has principles. Or, at least, the ability to conduct a civil conversation. Anyway, a PhD doesn't grant one the right to break the rules, no, but it does generally entitle someone to the benefit of the doubt when facts are involved. Seeing as Steve Rubinstein is an associate professor, we assume he isn't a mere dunce like some undergraduates I know. That being said, you've overlooked the point of my post.

As a community we have the good judgment to decide how to apply the rules, as we wrote the rules in the first place. Ideally we'd like those who edit in good faith to never need to be aware of any of our rules.

<dd>I can't imagine what gave you that impression. Moving right along, I'd like to remind you that this page is meant for discussing the three-revert rule, not speculating on the relative mental capacities (or lack thereof) of various wikipedians. If you have a beef with me I suggest you open an RfC. That's really the best place for it. Otherwise, I'd have to ask that you return to a discussion of the dispute on <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>, which you, thus far, have singularly failed to mention.

<dd>I was right the first time when I noted the conspiracy of dunces, which by the way was not a <b>personal</b> attack, it was an indictment of Wikipedia as a whole. You, on the other hand, engaged in a very <b>personal</b> attack on me and my integrity. "I'm sorry, I thought I was speaking with someone who has principles." So you are the violator. I am not interested in the <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> article, I am interested in the bias that has turned this egalitarian enyclopedia project into a sordid game of inequality, bias, cliquishness, hypocrisy, and abuse of power.

<dd>So, you aren't interested in contributing to articles? That strikes me as an odd position if you're joining a project whose express purpose is to create an encyclopedia. I suggest you travel over to the <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_Pump_1a2c.html" title="Wikipedia:Village Pump">Village Pump</a> if you wish to propose policy. If you trul think I've been engaging in personal attacks, I again recommend you to the RfC page. Perhaps questioning your principles went a bit far, but I was unsure of what to make of a user who complains about cliques and then mocks the person who tries to answer. This seemed to me an odd way to respond, and I could only conclude your principles were in abeyance. I apologize if this conclusion did not please you. More to the point, if your remark about a conspiracy of dunces was meant for Wikipedia is a whole then you actually just attacked several thousand users, not just a dozen or so. Either way, I'm somewhat offended, but I'd be happy to ignore it if it would help us deal with the matter at hand, which I believe is the <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> article.

<dd>You're jumping to that conclusion without all the facts. I've unblocked or reduced the blocks of a few editors in the last day or so, either because they weren't warned properly or because they e-mailed me to say they'd stop the reverting or vandalism, and they were mostly editors I didn't know, not friends. You shouldn't judge people based on one isolated case. Slrubenstein almost certainly made a mistake here. He wasn't warned and therefore didn't realize, and was blocked before he had a chance to revert himself. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 03:57, May 9, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh, I agree, as evidenced by the way I voted during my tenure on the Arbitration Committee, but we are dealing here with consequences of edit warring and our principles as regards to how to deal with it, rather than our principles as to whether ideally we'd like to be in this situation at all. In that regard, the point is to discuss what is happening and <i>fix it</i>. We don't do punishment here, even for 3RR, whatever some elements seem to think.</dd>
<dd>For the 'record', I strongly disagree with the POV that SLR was pushing which he seemed to believe was consensus - I find "CE/BCE" quite a vile thinly-disguised attempt at hiding cultural imperialism, rather than recognising it, but never mind. <i>*sighs*</i> Evidently I'm just another evil sysop, intent on laying waste to Wikipedia society and our social norms.</dd>

<p>As the original blocking admin, I feel I should add my thoughts to this. When I first saw this, I was inclined to just warn. I actually got as far as SLR's talk page to do that, when I saw Dante's comment further up about a previous 3RR block. On further investigation, finding that he had previously been blocked twice for the same offence (3RR), I thought a 24 hour block was in order and appropriate. I would not have done so otherwise. Whether or not it was by community consensus, 3RR is what it says on the tin, to coin a phrase: a rule. SLR broke the rule, whether deliberately or not. I, too, obeyed the rule, which is there for a purpose. On the other hand, I have no problem with his unblocking: I would have done it myself, had SLR contacted me (which he didn't). I certainly think the RFAr is ridiculous and totally OTT. <a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmoddy_2381.html" title="User:Smoddy">Smoddy</a> <a href="../../../s/m/o/User_talk%7ESmoddy_5430.html" title="User talk:Smoddy">(Rabbit and pork)</a> 19:01, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>These two have been at it for three to four days according to the edit history of the article. Most of the edits during that time period are by either Yuber or Kain, responding to edits by the other to the article. I may not have been around as long as Yuber has, but I believe this is why they have the arbitration process. As stated above, the most recent development has been a vandalism report by Kain... a clear sign that things are getting out of hand IMHO. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChanting_Fox_262d.html" title="User:Chanting Fox">Chanting Fox</a> 02:25, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Chanting Fox, I specifically warned Yuber that I would report him as well as noting in my edits when I was removing his vandalism from the page.

<dd>Yuber, the links you provided don't show the exact diffs of the reverts. However, looking at the history, it seems there's been reverting on both sides.

<dd>Peta, can I ask why you blocked KaintheScion? He made no further edits after the warning, you protected the page so he can't revert it again now anyway, and Yuber also looks as though he violated 3RR. Shouldn't we either protect or block? I don't see the point in both, as blocking for 3RR is meant to prevent revert wars and not be a punishment. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 02:38, May 9, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Given the abusive nature of KaintheScions contributions on talk pages and via email, I thought it woulld be better block him for 24 hours in addition to protecting the page so that he could cool off and come back and act like a civil editor tomorrow. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 02:47, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is the second time in the same day that SlimVirgin has unblocked someone blocked by a fellow admin for a 3RR.

<p>RickK has accused me of being Iasson and put my articles up for VFD. Some explanation is in order. Since wiki policy forbids blocking except for vandalism and similar offenses, sometimes I must provoke blocks in order to enforce a wiki-vacation. However, it is easily provable that I am the same user as <a href="../../../r/a/d/Rad_Racer_dbfe.html" title="Rad Racer">Rad Racer</a>, SonicSynergy, the creator of these two articles, et al. I am in fact leaving the wiki within the next two weeks.</p>
<p>Significant edits to provide both points of view have been made to the latter, and the title of the former is the actual official title of the treaty, which played an important role in the development of the global drug control regime. Ultimately, I think both meet the minimum standards for Wikipedia articles to be kept. I request users (primarily sysops) who voted in these decisions to re-vote.</p>

<dd>Good snag, but I think it's an imposter. The language is a little <i>too</i> obvious, and the real Iasson knows perfectly well that his <i>List of Active Vfd Voters</i> was deleted quite some time ago. Displaying the same behaviour as a banned user, even if one isn't that user, might be grounds for blocking, though. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 18:33, 9 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Impersonating other users is a blocking offense, regardless of who they are impersonating. Acting in the same way as a banned is user is likely to get them banned, as someone said on here about one of the last-but-one wave of Iasson sockpuppets - If someone complains that they get blocked for behaving like someone who is blocked/banned then the apropriate response is "Well don't do that then". <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 20:57, 9 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>But what if they behave like a banned user in a good way? Banned users are not one-dimensional. Are you saying we should discourage good contributions if they are similar to good contributions made by a banned user? <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 21:28, 10 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>As I said when this came up last time, if they are making good contributions to the encylopaedia who cares if they do it in the style of you, me, Jimbo or whoever. If they are getting greif because of a similar username, then we can politely suggest a different may be apropriate. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 22:55, 10 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The problem with that is that the "well don't do that then" logic doesn't apply in cases where a person is banned on account of being a previously banned user but had only been making good edits. Certainly people fall into this category; Wik/Gzorn...(I've forgotten already) springs to mind. So while we might ban someone for being a previously banned user, we can't necessarily discourage them from making whatever specific kinds of edits they were making. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 23:20, 10 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Greetings. It is my intent here to explain my recent activity, which may shed some light on what is happening right now at<a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Assumption_by_Russia_of_the_Soviet_Union%27s_seat_in_the_United_Nations_11c8.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Assumption by Russia of the Soviet Union's seat in the United Nations">Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Assumption_by_Russia_of_the_Soviet_Union's_seat_in_the_United_Nations</a> and <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Wikipedia%7EProtocol_Amending_the_Agreements_0ac4.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Wikipedia:Protocol Amending the Agreements">Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Wikipedia:Protocol_Amending_the_Agreements</a>, thus providing some useful information to those who are investigating the matter.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Many times, I have performed vandalism on the Wiki (typically user page vandalism) for the purpose of provoking a block to enforce a wiki-vacation. The vandalism was intentionally designed to be easily detected and reversible. While frowned on (and indeed, in violation of policy), this is not a particularly uncommon practice.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>At example was the inclusionist rant under the pen name "Colonel Gazpacho" (not to be confused with <a href="../../../g/a/z/User%7EGazpacho_8dfc.html" title="User:Gazpacho">User:Gazpacho</a>) which I posted at various user pages. In addition to fulfilling its purpose of provoking a block, it also stimulated speculation as to whether I am Iasson. Noting the speculation, the next time I decided to take a block-enforced wiki-vacation, I impersonated Iasson at the VFD.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>While this did indeed provoke a block from RickK, I failed to account for the possibility that he would put my articles up for VFD, ostensibly in accordance with the policy that banned users' contributions may be reverted. His doing so made it necessary to take measures to disprove my association with Iasson, in order to preserve the articles; however, users were understandably skeptical. Due to another block, I have not been able to fully communicate that explanation to you until now.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I recommend that users evaluate the articles based on their own merits, and not on my supposed connection to Iasson. I see little purpose in deviating from the normal VFD policy, unless it is out of spite. Judge me on my actions, but judge the articles on their merits.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On the matter of <a href="../../../t/p/a/User%7ETparker393_3f6f.html" title="User:Tparker393">User:Tparker393</a>: He is a friend and infrequent Wikipedia contributor who I sometimes call on for help when I need an ally here. He occasionally forgets to login or sign his posts, which has caused some confusion at VFD. However, we are two separate people and do not share accounts.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In the future, I will, no doubt, avoid impersonation in favor of simple vandalism when a block-enforced wiki-vacation is desired. This should avoid the unintended problem of legitimate articles being VFD'ed due to an incorrect association with hard-banned users. That is all.</dd>

<li>I may be able to cast a <i>little</i> light on this. It should be seen in the context of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=216.127.145.75" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=216.127.145.75" rel="nofollow">contribs</a> of the signing IP 216, whose most recent (and 3rd) contrib is the one on this page that we're discussing. The second, 4 hours earlier, was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Jerzy&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=13485107" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Jerzy&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=13485107" rel="nofollow">vandalism of my ... user page(!)</a> (such vnd'sm being an activity attrib'ed above to "205/24"). (Now, i didn't say i'd make <i>sense</i> of the thing, but the common theme must have some sort of significance.) That vnd'sm by the mere truth-and-light-supporting messenger 216 came 8 minutes <i>after</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Assumption_by_Russia_of_the_Soviet_Union%27s_seat_in_the_United_Nations&amp;diff=13485380&amp;oldid=13484818" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Assumption_by_Russia_of_the_Soviet_Union%27s_seat_in_the_United_Nations&amp;diff=13485380&amp;oldid=13484818" rel="nofollow">my edit</a> on one of the VfD's mentioned, which i summarized "Document hiding of IPannotation &amp; whodunit info", and where i added the info that two items, one of which (a keep vote) bore <a href="../../../t/p/a/User%7ETparker393_3f6f.html" title="User:Tparker393">Tparker393</a>'s purported sig, were from edits by User:159.169.57.3 (not mentioned above), and 11 minutes <i>before</i> <a href="../../../t/p/a/User%7ETparker393_3f6f.html" title="User:Tparker393">Tparker393</a>'s acct reverted my edit, hiding the evidence of the entry's origin but implicitly claiming that Parker and 159 are one, in contrast to 216's rage at its revelation and Parker's effort to hide it. Also interestingly, the attribution of the vote to Parker was made by the above messenger IP, 216, a few hours earlier the same evening, <i>before</i> i blocked Parker for 12 hours, and thus when Parker didn't need 216 to make the claim on his behalf. Someone else might want to explore why the 159/Parker connection is worth all this fuss.

<li>Tommy's edit was not to hide the accusation of linkage but rather to put his signature there which he forgot (or restore a deleted message or signature of his; I don't remember). However, he botched it by also eliminating your comment, in reverting back to the previous history entirely. We have been emailing extensively about these matters so I know what's going on here. Remember <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanlon%27s_Razor_789c.html" title="Hanlon's Razor">Hanlon's Razor</a>. There has been no forgery going on at the VFD that I know of (other than the RicK K thing) and neither Tommy nor I use sockpuppets (although we both have a tendency to not login). He and I both have a few different locations we go to and from during the day, which explains the different IP addresses. You can get a developer to confirm all this if you want. Tommy and I are several hours' drive apart, which can be confirmed by an IP lookup (whois, as it were). <a href="../../../2/4/2E/User%7E24.54.208.177.html" title="User:24.54.208.177">24.54.208.177</a> 09:25, 10 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>It seems to me that if this person feels the need to commit vandalism in order to get blocked for a mini-vacation, we could accomodate him by blocking him permanently. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 19:11, May 10, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Might as well. It's the only way to bring a stop to this atrocious behaviour. <a href="../../../2/4/2E/User%7E24.54.208.177.html" title="User:24.54.208.177">24.54.208.177</a> 23:45, 10 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>During his ArbCom case it was Iasson's MO to play his aliases against each other to produce the illusion that they were not him, despite their characteristic disruptive edits. This is just more of the same. I was one of the first users to admonish Iasson about his VfD trolling and presented evidence against him to ArbCom, so it's plausible that he would hold a grudge and try to sow confusion as to whether I'm one of his aliases. I regret having made it easier for him by posting a joke vote in VfD when he reappeared. Iasson's bans should be reset and recognizable aliases should be reverted/deleted on sight in accordance with <a href="../../../b/a/n/Wikipedia%7EBanning_policy_2e63.html" title="Wikipedia:Banning policy">Wikipedia:Banning policy</a>. <a href="../../../g/a/z/User%7EGazpacho_8dfc.html" title="User:Gazpacho">Gazpacho</a> 23:54, 10 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, it was just a coincidence. I chose the name "Colonel Gazpacho" because I like to eat <a href="../../../g/a/z/Gazpacho.html" title="Gazpacho">gazpacho</a> and, more importantly, "Gazpacho" sounded like the name of a South American warlord. In fact, when I saw your user name cropping up, I thought that you had borrowed the idea from me. As for the alias thing, I have had various aliases (<a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERad_Racer_55af.html" title="User:Rad Racer">User:Rad Racer</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/n/User%7ESonicSynergy_9130.html" title="User:SonicSynergy">User:SonicSynergy</a>, etc) but never used more than one at a time, that I can recall. I typically scramble the password and move on to another one. <a href="../../../2/4/2E/User%7E24.54.208.177.html" title="User:24.54.208.177">24.54.208.177</a> 01:47, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>One other thing, what's the standard for what is a "recognizable alias"? It's been documented that most requests for confirmation of sockpuppets submitted to developers turned out to be mistaken, and that would be the result if you referred the Iasson/me or me/tparker393 matters to them as well.

<dd>I highly doubt it. This guy can actually write coherent sentences, and doesn't employ (near as I can tell) any of Iasson's obvious rhetorical quirks nor display Iasson's specific grammatical weak points.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive21_3063.html" title="Edit section: Levzur has returned">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../l/e/v/User%7ELevzur_80ee.html" title="User:Levzur">Levzur</a> has returned</span></h3>
<p>For those who may not know, Levzur was an editor who had a case before the ArbCom 6-8 months ago, where he was facing a one-year ban for, abusive behavior to other contributors about articles related to the Republic of Georgia. Apparently he assumed that he would, indeed, be placed under a ban &amp; announced that he was leaving Wikipedia for good, &amp; the ArbCom closed the case, deciding the matter was now moot.</p>
<p>About a week ago, I stumbled upon the fact that he had returned; concerned, I would take a periodic glance at his contributions, but he had not done anything worth mentioning ... until a week ago, when he added the following here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Bagrationi&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=13112399" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Bagrationi&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=13112399" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>. I left a note on his talk page about his behavior <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ALevzur&amp;diff=13336327&amp;oldid=13195557" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ALevzur&amp;diff=13336327&amp;oldid=13195557" rel="nofollow">[31]</a> -- which he did not answer, but he did appear a little more subdued for a while (&amp; was productively working on getting one of his articles accepted as a Featured Article). However, tonight I found this exchange <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Georgian_people&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=13447482" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Georgian_people&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=13447482" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>, where he behaves quite inexcusably to another contributor.</p>
<p>So, should he just suffer a ban for <a href="../../../n/o/_/No_personal_attacks.html" title="No personal attacks">personal attacks</a>, or should we just cut to the chase &amp; ask the ArbCom to re-open his old case? -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 03:49, 10 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>It's been a while, I'd say give him a second chance and let it slide. He seems to be capable of quality work, if the above example is any guide. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 09:56, 10 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>For once I agree with Everyking about the note on the talk page.

<p>How about some perspective on the incident <i>where he behaves quite inexcusably to another contributor</i>? Two people are arguing over a point of Georgian demography. One of them, <a href="../../../l/e/v/User%7ELevzur_80ee.html" title="User:Levzur">Levzur</a>, is a "Georgian historian and politologist" with a "PhD in History", the other, <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarnen_a442.html" title="User:Marnen">Marnen</a>, is a "Gen-X post-hippie arts geek" from New York. Unless we have a reason to doubt their credentials, let's assume that this is an argument between somebody that knows what they're talking about and somebody who has a tangential interest in the topic. Even if Levzur's claims are POV (which is, of course, possible), it's quite normal for somebody who knows what they're talking about to get frustrated by an insistent diletant who can't support their claims with anything. I don't really know what Marnen knows about Georgia, but judging by the failure to grasp the patrilineal inheritance, I'd say not much. So, unless someone with a knowledge of Georgian demography can help us understand what's going on, I'd say stay out of this topical discussion. The project needs knowledge more than political correctness. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_c719.html" title="User:Zocky">Zocky</a> 12:09, 10 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The AC's about to reopen the case, as the only reason it was closed was that he disappeared. He's acting the same as he did then, so case reopens.

<dd>That seems silly. The behavior I see seems very mild, hardly even worth a slap on the wrist. I don't know about his old behavior, I think there was an old dispute about Gamsakhurdia, but there's no need to flip back through the notes to hold a person to account for everything they've done before. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 18:47, 10 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would consider this. For one, they did serve something of a sentence of exile, and although probably not as long as the ArbComm might have handed out, it's still something. For another, and more importantly, the point of all of our mechanisms is to either i) get people to reform so they can work cooperatively in a productive manner, or ii) remove those who cannot do so. If this person has indeed improved substantially (I don't know if they have, I'm taking the seeming assertions of others above), then we've gotten to goal i) - so I'm not sure of the value of revisiting the old RFAr. If they are still unable to work with those they disagree with, though, we may have to go for ii). <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 19:08, 10 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Have any of you people who are arguing to let Levzur stick around even bothered to check his edit history? He's a POV pusher of the extreme variety, refuses to compromise, refuses to even admit he's even slightly wrong. He should be permanently banned, and once again I raise a protest to the arbcom to quit closing appeals without decision because a user supposedly leaves, it just lets them come back to commit the same mayhem all over again. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 19:14, May 10, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't know if I'd call it mayhem. There is apparently some POV pushing, but POV aside, he apparently does good work as well. Is this person generally causing us harm, or helping us build articles? <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 19:36, 10 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I contend that he is a POV artist, but also a valuable contributor. If we can find a way to balance that out... -<a href="../../../r/h/y/User%7ERhymeless_6a19.html" title="User:Rhymeless">Tim Rhymeless</a> <a href="../../../r/h/y/User_talk%7ERhymeless_4dd3.html" title="User talk:Rhymeless">(Er...let's shimmy)</a> 20:24, 10 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Probably just a specific ban on topics for which Levzur is pushing his POV, with no ban on anything else. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 20:42, 10 May 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But the topics he seems knowledgeable about are those pertaining to Georgian history and politics. Yet those are also the ones he pushes POV on. So if you banned him from those, I don't know how much good he would do as a contributor. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 21:23, 10 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Levzur not only pushes his POV &amp; ignores remarks on his Talk page, but after he stated he was leaving Wikipedia on 1 May 2004, he continued reversion war over several articles from anonymous IP addresses for the rest of that May (for some articles, into June -- see <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_investigation_Archives_2004_07_5f67.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for investigation/Archives/2004/07">this</a>). If he showed an inclination to at least <i>talk constructively</i> with other Wikipedians, I'd be happy to ignore the fact that he returned; I've got lots of other things on Wikipedia to work on. But he refused to directly respond to my warning, &amp; is more eager to throw around his credentials than to reason with other users -- e.g., calling someone a "dilettante and demagogue". Sorry, but as an <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amateur.html" title="Amateur">amateur</a> here on Wikipedia when I see someone call another contributor by those terms, my <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikistress" class="extiw" title="m:Wikistress">Wikistress</a> goes up -- no matter who is applying to those labels to whom. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 22:36, 10 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmm, if a self-proclaimed "Gen-X post-hippie arts geek" from New York was pestering you about facts in your country and your area of expertise, plus failed to understand that their questions were answered (precisely because of their lack of topical knowledge) how would you react? Judging by the guy's talk page, some people seem to appreciate his work just fine. The one thing that I made effort to investigate was his edit war on <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_people.html" title="Armenian people">Armenian people</a> over which year a number is from, and now it seems accepted that his info was correct. So how about if an admin tried to talk to the guy amicably and explain that due to the nature of the project we have to suffer dilettantes and demagogues with good humour, instead of ganging up on a valuable contributor? <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_c719.html" title="User:Zocky">Zocky</a> 00:39, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

For some time he's been pursuing a revert war over a set of pop-music articles, insisting on his personal preferences over Wikipedia style (for titles, headers, language, etc.). I've been the main person involved, although <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>, <a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltimate_Star_Wars_Freak_7703.html" title="User:Ultimate Star Wars Freak">Ultimate Star Wars Freak</a>, a couple of anons have also had their edits reverted by him. He's already been blocked for using a sockpuppet to vandalise my page and to make edits to avoid a block, and has used various IP accounts to make his edits. He's now adding dubious copyright templates to images I've listed on IfD (including placing templates about the original up-loader's position on images for which he wasn't responsible), and has replaced the images on <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spice_Girls_4805.html" title="Spice Girls">Spice Girls</a>, from which I removed them when I nominated them at IfD.

I doubt that anything like mediation or RfC would do any good, though I'd be willing to go through it.

<dd>I seem to recall bumping into this chap before but cannot recall the details. I don't think he's being entirely unreasonable in wanting the pictures in the <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spice_Girls_4805.html" title="Spice Girls">Spice Girls</a> article--if they're copyvios the usual deletion procedure should be followed and then you can remove the picture links.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On the subject, the article itself is written in a rather breathless, juvenile style, and could do with a good cleanup. Given their massive global appeal in the late 1990s, the Spice Girls probably deserve a decent write-up. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 11:14, 12 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>On the first point, the problem is that the images seem pretty clearly to be copyvios, and are indeed going through the copyvio process — but I understood that in such cases they should be removed until proved to be in the clear (when I marked images as possible copyvios in the past, I noticed that they were removed from the relevant articles by a helpful admin).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>On the second point, I couldn't agree more (some of your attempts to tone down the style are among the reverts that DrippingInk keeps making). <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 17:48, 12 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm unclear what to do now; this user seems to be completely lacking in self-control. I found that he'd up-loaded a number of images to which he'd attached no copyright templates; he refused point-blank to give them templates, and they seemed obviously to be scans from magazines or taken from Web sites; I listed them in IfD and removed them from the article <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spice_Girls_4805.html" title="Spice Girls">Spice Girls</a>. He (using his account and various IP addresses) keeps putting them back, also reverting edits made by Tony Sidaway, me, and others, accusing us of vandalism.</p>
<p>When I found that he'd up-loaded more images, I checked them, and founf that – although he'd added a general Fair USe tag, they seems to be taken from Websites or magazines again. I listed one as a possible copyvio, and asked him if he would put a template on the other. His response was: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMel_Etitis&amp;diff=13697840&amp;oldid=13693671" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMel_Etitis&amp;diff=13697840&amp;oldid=13693671" rel="nofollow">[35]</a>. On Image:Gwen Stefani.jpg he's placed a "GFDL" template, but with no information as the origin, nor any indication that he's in fact in a position to grant permission to use it. RfC isn't relevant, as his behaviour has been alomost wholly aimed at me; is there any other action that would stand a chance of getting him to stop thrashing around in this way? <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 16:14, 14 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
