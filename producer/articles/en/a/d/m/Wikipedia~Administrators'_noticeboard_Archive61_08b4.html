Shout about it publically all you like after the appropriate edits have been oversighted, but not before.

<p>So I've been going back and forth with <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">User:JzG</a> on this, and, while I have no doubts about his good faith in his actions and our discussion, I would very much like a neutral, uninvolved party to review what's gone on the last week and get some sort of motion on this.</p>
<p>Emmalina is a YouTube gal who's been the subject of multiple news stories. There were a number of AfD's, the third that was closed somewhat bizarrely as delete, and unfortunately upheld at DRV and turned into a redirect to Notable YouTube memes. When that was deleted, a second DRV occurred, with a number of people changing their positions based on the deletion. The vote count (see why DRV shouldn't be a straight vote?) was dead even, so Xoloz "played <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Solomon_d3cc.html" title="King Solomon">King Solomon</a>" and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ADeletion_review%2FLog%2F2006_October_26&amp;diff=84865485&amp;oldid=84861928" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ADeletion_review%2FLog%2F2006_October_26&amp;diff=84865485&amp;oldid=84861928" rel="nofollow">left the deletion, but unprotected the redirect</a>. Since that redirect, we had one anon try and resurrect the information outright, and a discussion was occurring before JzG decided to simply protect the redirect, essentially stopping discussion dead in its tracks.</p>
<p>Whether I think it's the right move to eventually keep the redirect in place is irrelevant (I think the original delete close didn't take our guidelines into effect at all), but it's obvious that <a href="../../../c/c/c/WP%7ECCC_b716.html" title="WP:CCC">consensus changed</a> and the DRV closing reflected that. The protected redirect is helping nothing, and stifling the discussion to actually come to a consensus in light of the new events. I have no problem with rolling with what the consensus ends up coming to amongst the editors, but that would require us to be able to without this sort of intervention. I'm noting this at JzG's talk page so he can toss in his two cents, but I'd appreciate some neutral review on this. Thanks. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 14:06, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Asking for neutral input into the discussion isn't - but insisting that the protected redirect is removed prior to the conclusion of that discussion is. It doesn't need removed unless the discussion reaches that conclusion. It only needs removed now if you assuming the outcome of the discussion is to remove it - that's beggaring the question.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 18:44, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, given that I believe that he protection has effectively stifled debate, and was put in against what the DRV closing was, I disagree.

<dd>But you are still not explaining how protecting a page stifles debate. You aren't debating on the protected page, are you? The talk page isn't protected, is it? Go debate. If the result is a consensus to undo the direct then fine. If not, then the question doesn't arise. I still don't understand why you are on this page with this. If you want community input into a debate then there is RfC or DRV.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 19:34, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It seems to me that on a strictly path-of-least-resistance standpoint, you could always (1) start a discussion on the <a href="../../../e/m/m/Talk%7EEmmalina_e121.html" title="Talk:Emmalina">Emmalina talk page</a>, (2) create a working copy in a sandbox off the Emmalina talk page, and (3) solicit some participation or discussion through appropriate RFCs, etc. If you end up with a well cited page in the sandbox and a consensus on the talk page to un-redirect, you'll have a much better case to re-open. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheronJ_75b8.html" title="User:TheronJ">TheronJ</a> 18:59, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, there already exists one in the history. The article has been through some rather bizarre discussions the last few weeks, and the sourcing and attention is in line with similar articles with similar notability (<a href="../../../g/e/r/Geriatric1927.html" title="Geriatric1927">geriatric1927</a> comes to mind). We're actively abandoning our guidelines on this one (which we're prone to do), and I'd honestly rather see a new AfD with the lack of a notable YouTube memes article happen than the current situation - then we can ahve the protected redirect knowing it's a real consensus, and not just one person deciding they don't like the DRV result. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 19:11, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wow, wacky. I can't say I wouldn't have closed the 3rd AfD as delete - in borderline cases, the admin has to use their judgment, and Deizio's judgment was delete. It looks like Xoloz's intention was to "see what happens", and what happened was the article was recreated. On the other hand, it is extremely suspect that it happened to be recreated by an anon whose only edit, ever, was to recreate the article. The main problem I have is that JzG's reprotection basically ignored process and made a spot judgment on the article's notability. He didn't explain the protection on the article talk page, and his conversation with Badlydrawnjeff is debating the notability of the article, not really explaining his action. I would be in favor of unprotecting and respecting Xoloz's DRV closure, but I think JzG's impurt would be valued here. --<font color="#3300FF">Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">talk</a>)</font> 19:58, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Rationale as stated several times: the consensus was not to have a separate article, notable YouTube memes got deleted so we should have a section on notable memes in YouTube and see where it goes. If it gets too big it can be forked. But we should stick to what is verifiable, factual information, and not fall prey to the ludicrous fandom which is so common in this kind of article. In other words, we do the same as we did with <a href="../../../y/t/m/YTMND_ce03.html" title="YTMND">YTMND</a>, where we leave it to their wiki to do the original research "look at this, k3wl" crap which causes so much trouble with neutrality, verifiability, sourcing and other WP policies and guidelines. And to be honest I am just the <i>tiniest</i> bit pissed off with endless wrangling about subjects which have no sources which meet our guidelines, which are trivially easy to find out about from the original source, which is still on the web. I did not think we were intended to be a mirror of Google or indeed YouTube. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 23:03, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I have recently deleted a suite of user talk templates designed to dissuade targets from removing warnings from their user talk pages. In my opinion, the templates were collectively eligible for deletion under <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">speedy deletion criterion</a> number one for templates, "templates that are divisive and inflammatory". I consider them to be divisive and inflammatory for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The suite of templates threatens administrative consequences for removing warnings, including the <a href="../../../p/p/o/WP%7EPPOL_a58e.html" title="WP:PPOL">protection</a> of talk pages and the <a href="../../../b/p/_/WP%7EBP_c8aa.html" title="WP:BP">blocking</a> of users;</li>
<li>There is no consensus whatsoever on what the appropriate response should be to the removal of warnings (see <a href="../../../r/e/m/Wikipedia%7ERemoving_warnings_48c6.html" title="Wikipedia:Removing warnings">Wikipedia:Removing warnings</a>, <a href="../../../c/e/n/Wikipedia%7ECentralized_discussion_Removing_warnings_45df.html" title="Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Removing warnings">Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Removing warnings</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/m/Wikipedia%7ERemoving_warnings_poll_8b64.html" title="Wikipedia:Removing warnings poll">Wikipedia:Removing warnings poll</a>);</li>
<li>The suite of templates employs a stern and confrontational tone, and uses threatening language, which may be warranted when backed by strong consensus (for example, templates which warn against <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVAND_6593.html" title="WP:VAND">simple vandalism</a>) but is not appropriate given that there is no consensus as to the appropriate generic response to removing warnings.</li>
</ul>
<p>I invite the community's review of these actions.</p>
<p>As a note to users who employ these templates, I should add that given that there may be consensus about the appropriate response to removing warnings <i>in individual cases</i>, users should consider tailoring a message to each situation. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a>&#160;(<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 11:34, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I fully support this action. The warning templates have been a pernicious source of problems and disruption for so long, far outweighing any usefulnes they had to the community. When people are getting blocked for edit warring over internal templates, things have gone too far. If an editor is removing warnings in a problematic matter, a message more tailored to the situation would be more appropriate, especially because there is little agreement over what situations qualify as problematic. As to the deletion of these templates, I suggest that <a href="../../../i/g/n/Wikipedia%7EIgnore_all_rules_528b.html" title="Wikipedia:Ignore all rules">IAR</a> applies in this case, if nothing else. --<a href="../../../s/l/o/User%7ESlowking_Man_5da9.html" title="User:Slowking Man">Slowking Man</a> 11:43, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Concur completely. In some situations there is a carefully-crafted system for escalating warnings, to enable admins to work together to deal with a serial offender: this is a good reason for using graduated warning templates. In other cases, however, the "one size fits all" approach simply fails to meet requirements: this is an obvious example. There is no consensus as to how long people are required to keep warning templates around, even: I have even seen people advocating that such templates should never be archived to serve as a permanent record of someone's misdemeanours!

<dd>While this seems a 'novel interpretation' of the intent of T1 I'm not going to object because I <i>really</i> dislike these templates and the massive disruption surrounding the whole 'you cannot remove warnings' / 'scarlet letter' philosophy.

<dd>I've also had the thought that there might be further debates elsewhere. These debates and the results <i>should</i> have been recorded on the talk pages of the templates.

<dd>Grrr... I always seem to find out about the deletion discussions on these right after they close. Which is part of the problem here. The templates are beloved by the users who place them and despised by the admins who see them as violations of the harassment / edit warring / talk page and other policies. The people using them get notification of the TfDs. The admins refusing to enforce them do not. Ergo, neither of those TfD discussions reflects anything like the whole story. The fact is that these templates are abused <i>constantly</i>... as the regular appearance of this issue on AN &amp; AN/I demonstrates. The idea of allowing any user to place a negative / insulting / potentially false 'warning' on the talk page of any other user and edit war to enforce its display there is (by far) the <i>worst</i> I've seen actively put into practice. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 17:45, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Whether the templates are good or bad is irrelevant. The fact remains that due process had been followed, and consensus in the TfD discussion was that these templates should stay. (And it wasn't even a weak consensus: 10/3 in one discussion, 16/3 in another discussion.) Once consensus to keep has been established, templates should <b>never</b> be speedily deleted (likewise for articles and categories). Otherwise, what is the point of having a deletion process? If you want rid of these templates, follow due process; failing to do so is a gross abuse of power. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluap_751b.html" title="User:Bluap">Bluap</a> 18:57, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

However, I agree that following due process is almost always preferrable to IAR, because it leads to less discussion. In this case, however, due process was followed, and did not result in the correct answer, so deletion was the right thing to do. <a href="../../../e/u/g/User%7EEugene_van_der_Pijll_eaa2.html" title="User:Eugene van der Pijll">Eugène van der Pijll</a> 19:03, 6 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Concur. I'd normally side with Bluap, but this case is special. In a normal deletion case, it's the deleting party that needs to demonstrate consensus; default in case of no consensus is to keep. But in this case, the burden of evidence must be reversed. These templates owe their existence only to the existence of the underlying policy (namely, that removing warnings is blockable). With policies, it's the proposers of a policy that need to demonstrate consensus. This consensus doesn't exist, as the debates elsewhere show; therefore, no policy, hence no justification for the templates. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 20:29, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just to clarify that (of course) many of the people who support these templates do not intend to use them for "harassing someone with false warnings"... but Cyde is absolutely correct that this happens. Alot. And I think it is <i>that</i> which justifies an 'out of process' deletion. These templates <i>are</i> frequently used for harassment and that's something which is clearly contrary to Wikipedia policy. The users who support their use in valid cases have good intentions (though I think even then subjecting someone to this kind of treatment often only inflames the situation), but can't prevent their constant mis-use. Wanting a tool available to you for arguably legitimate reasons can't trump the fact that in so doing you also make it available for inevitable abuse. We don't pass out handguns to everyone just because some people can use them responsibly. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 19:30, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I also applaud's Bainer actions on this, I have seen too many edit wars over simply removing warings (which, in itself does not harm the enclyopedia) ending up with absurd situation of blocking someone for "removing a warning about removing a warning over a mis-interpreted edit." I have also seen good faith users being given warnings about a potential problem, the user resolving it swiftly on the article page but <i>months later</i>, when the user cleans out his page for tidyness (i.e. not selectively), another good faith user reverts him, and gives him a follow up warning. <b>Having a good faith user get harrassed by another good faith user is not good practice, and this is exactly these templates encourage in my experience.</b> Personally I think that the deletion was an excellent example of IAR - if due process dictates a situation that increases the likelyhood of unwarrented harrassment, then it <i>should</i>, and <b>must</b> be ignored, which is exactly what the IAR policy is meant to do.

<p>I can confirm that I saw those two TfD discussions, and I can also confirm that I disregarded them. The only argument mustered in favour of keeping the templates was that they were useful, with some users saying that this was so because the templates allowed for the convenient implementation of <i>the policy against removing warnings</i> (although there is no policy on this matter, indeed no consensus at all).</p>
<p>On the other hand, arguments in favour of deletion included that the templates misrepresented policy (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_d9f5.html" title="User:Mark">Mark</a>), were often used in practice to harass users (<a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a>) and were uncivil and sometimes used for harassment of good faith users (<a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a>). These opinions by experienced and respected users were seemingly ignored in favour of a numerical assessment of the result. Moreover, the opinion of <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Reid_d143.html" title="User:John Reid">John Reid</a> (the original creator of the templates), that the language used had changed to be "dishonest and pompous" and misrepresenting of policy, was also seemingly disregarded.</p>
<p>In short, the concerns which led me to consider the templates divisive and inflammatory - that they misrepresented policy, and were threatening and confrontational without the support of strong consensus - greatly outweighed the weak results of these two TfD debates, which in the light of <a href="../../../r/e/m/Wikipedia%7ERemoving_warnings_48c6.html" title="Wikipedia:Removing warnings">substantial</a> <a href="../../../c/e/n/Wikipedia%7ECentralized_discussion_Removing_warnings_45df.html" title="Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Removing warnings">previous</a> <a href="../../../r/e/m/Wikipedia%7ERemoving_warnings_poll_8b64.html" title="Wikipedia:Removing warnings poll">debate</a>, could not be said to amount to a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">consensus</a>. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a>&#160;(<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 00:22, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'll just put in a quick word in favour of the templates (in reply to Carcharoth, here are your complaints...). The main use of these is when a user is on a vandalism spree and is removing warnings as fast as they're getting them; otherwise it would be possible for a user to get nothing but test1s and not be blocked. Some vandalfighters don't check talkpage history when warning a user (probably to speed up their vandalfighting). These templates are important for speed in such cases. The problem is when they're used on old warnings to edit-war on talk pages or to keep bad-faith warnings there; but this sort of misuse (which I agree is quite prevalent) is on the same level as misuse of any other template (such as {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest1_2f2b.html" title="Template:Test1">test1</a>}}. Perhaps the templates should say something like 'Do not immediately remove warnings from your talk page' and explain why. --<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">ais523</a> 09:10, 7 November 2006 (<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">U</a><a href="../../../a/i/s/User_talk%7EAis523_6ca0.html" title="User talk:Ais523">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ais523_df26.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ais523">C</a>)

<dd>They may be clean in the sense that they are not threatening blocks, etc., but there existence is still predicated on the idea that users <i>should</i> react to the removal of warnings by adding some sort of challenge/response. To my mind that is still an undesirable escalation in conflict. In my opinion, the whole removing warnings debacle has been one of the most undesirable aspects of Wikipedia for a long time. If we are really going to address this, I would strongly encourage people to nuke the messages entirely. If removing warnings is really a problem that ever needs to be addressed, then it should be addressed through personalized attention and not through a templatized continuation of hostilities. Retaining the messages, even in a neutered form, will continue to give the impression that giving warnings about warnings is an accepted way of dealing with conflict. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 09:50, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>{{Wr}} is fine now, but the level-3 and 4 warnings are no longer level 3/4 because they don't threaten blocks (can you have a 'last warning' with no method of following it up?)

<dd>Actually, you are wrong about that. The text of <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a> refers solely to disputed <i>deletions</i>... not disputed keeps. However, that said, these templates WERE deleted (as 'CSD T1') and the proper 'process wonk' response to <i>that</i> should have been to list them on DRV. Even though they were instead restored via wheel war I think the best move may be to set up a DRV rather than continuing the wheel war with another deletion first. As Dragons flight notes above, removing the 'higher levels' and false statements about blocking in these templates <i>reduces</i> the damage they do, but not significantly. The first level alone claiming that users should not remove warnings from their talk pages is all the excuse needed for edit warring / harassment to keep warnings, whether valid or not, displayed. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 11:23, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The comments quoted above about "any deletion debate" were taken by me to mean that AfD, TfD, MfD, et cetera all go through DRV rather than having separate review pages for each.

There are only <i>three</i> comments suggesting deletion, and one of them (Kusma's) only suggested deleting 3 and 4, leaving only John Reid's comments in favour of deletion of 1 and 2, and they suggested rewording (which has now happened) as an alternative to deletion, and the nomination. There were 16&#160;!votes to keep, most of which can be ignored because they made no new points, but it seems reasonable to think that many users will be annoyed if these are deleted (they were probably trying to use the template and alerted by the TfD tag on the template itself).

<dd>The massive edit warring to restore comments and then warnings about removing those comments was clearly unnecessary... though further confused by the fact that half the comment removals were made by an anon IP and thus some people were restoring because that anon shouldn't remove comments from someone else's talk... except that the anon was probably the user themself. In any case, user was properly blocked for multi-sockpuppet voting on *fDs. The edit war over whether the warnings should be displayed did nothing to improve the situation and was not the cause of the block. The fact that this practice is sometimes used to abuse 'problem' users doesn't make it any more proper or any less abusive... especially when it is just as commonly used against users who have done little or nothing wrong. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 11:48, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, it did waste my time, as I had to dig into the page history to try and find out what was going on, and even then it was not very clear. It would have been much clearer if the comments had been present in an archive. Would it have been acceptable to go through the page history and create an archive page clearly showing the talk page comments made in chronological order? I suppose one argument against that, is that it gives the impression that removal of comments hadn't been going on. It also gives the impression that later posts were added to a page full of comments, when in fact they were often added to a page with previous comments removed. If anyone could be bothered, diffs could be added to each section showing when they were removed. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 13:09, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think this is more of a problem for presidential election years, which get everyone fired up, in addition to the including the same sorts of elections as the mid-terms. 2008 will be twice as bad as 2004 apparently was, due to the huge increase in the popularity of Wikipedia.

<p>Hi. Don't know if this is the right place to post my question, but here it is. I use user name Vayaka almost everywhere and I have registered it in some Wiki progects, but I can't rigister it in the English Wiki (Login error:The name "Vayaka" is too similar to the existing account "Nayaka". Please choose another name.) Is there a way to register nickname Vayaka?--195.210.185.5 10:02, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>For some context, this is the AntiSpoof extension; I seem to remember from wikitech-l that an admin can get round the filter at <a href="../../../u/s/e/Special%7EUserlogin_5f6a.html" title="Special:Userlogin">Special:Userlogin</a> and then email the user in question the requested account, but I'm not sure. --<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">ais523</a> 10:11, 7 November 2006 (<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">U</a><a href="../../../a/i/s/User_talk%7EAis523_6ca0.html" title="User talk:Ais523">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ais523_df26.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ais523">C</a>)

<p>Hey all. Can someone look at Image:Owenpuma.jpg and settle this, please? I don't want to start blocking people for disruption, although I'm sorely tempted, as I have already made a content judgement and so shouldn't use my admin tools. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPanarjedde_04da.html" title="User:Panarjedde">User:Panarjedde</a> and <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingjeff_8e3f.html" title="User:Kingjeff">User:Kingjeff</a> have been squabbling over various images etc, with, of course, the other one always being wrong. This image, Image:Owenpuma.jpg, was posted by Kingjeff with no status. Panarjedde immediately tagged it for deletion. I then came across it during a clearout of <a href="../../../c/s/d/C%7ECSD_87ad.html" title="C:CSD">C:CSD</a>. I removed the speedy tag and put the correct fair use tag on the image (I've tried before to find a free image of Owen Hargreaves - one doesn't exist at the moment). Pan is continuing to tag it for deletion and revert fair use tag, so please, someone else step in so I don't get my editor / admin wires crossed.

<dd>The issue has been misrepresented. Let me explain, possibly not assuming I am wrong without knowing what happened (this is for Patstuart):
<ul>
<li>"This image, Image:Owenpuma.jpg, was posted by Kingjeff with no status." <i>Wrong</i>. The image was posted by Sebas87, and had a wrong fairuse tag, which claimed it was a sporting event poster.</li>
<li>"Panarjedde immediately tagged it for deletion." <i>Wrong</i>, the image was uploaded on 7 September, I tagged it on 6 November, not exactly "immediately".</li>
<li>"Pan is continuing to tag it for deletion and revert fair use tag." We had a discussion about this tag, after Proto disputed the replaceability of the image, yet today, with no compromise reached, he unilaterally removed my tag. Only today, therefore, I reinserted the tag.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>The fact is that Proto is removing a tag he does not like, claiming he acted as an admin until now, while he was involved in the matter since the beginning.--<a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPanarjedde_04da.html" title="User:Panarjedde">Panarjedde</a> 12:19, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You forgot to add that the second tag was different from the first, as <i>you</i> proposed a fair use license that does not apply.

<p>I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Owenpuma.jpg&amp;diff=86048603&amp;oldid=86047955" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Owenpuma.jpg&amp;diff=86048603&amp;oldid=86047955" rel="nofollow">added</a> a "Replaceable fair use" tag to Image:Owenpuma.jpg.

<dd>Well, if this is the official answer, let me say it is unfair that admins are allowed to use their authority in their own content dispute.

<dd>Sorry I agree with the tagging. the current tag says "where the image is unrepeatable, i.e. a free image could not be created to replace it". Note the could not be created, since of course someone could take a photo the image can be created to replace it thus is fails fair use. (This is not a unique image with the person doing a unique act, it's a simple photo of them) The fact that someone can't find a current one is irrelvant, one can be created. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 12:22, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And as soon as a free image is available, then fair use no longer applies to this image. The current tag is poorly worded.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">type</span></a></small> 12:27, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Not to mention that the image is tagged incorrectly anyway it is from advert yet is tagged {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EPromophoto_9608.html" title="Template:Promophoto">promophoto</a>}}, which is (from <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image_copyright_tags</a>) for publicity photographs of people or events, such as headshots or posed shots, from a press kit, also see <a href="../../../p/u/b/Wikipedia%7EPublicity_photos_4459.html" title="Wikipedia:Publicity photos">Wikipedia:Publicity photos</a> - an advert is not a promophoto. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 12:34, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem is not the content dispute (I have given my reason on the talkpage), the problem is that you removed a tag in a content dispute you were involved in, and claimed to have done it because the dispute was between me and another user, while you had just stepped in to do your admin duties.</dd>
<dd>Furthermore, I would suggest you to read <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html#Policy" title="WP:FU">WP:FU#Policy</a>, which is an official policy of WP, which requires non-free, fair use images to be used only if "no free equivalent is available or could be created".

<dd>Further to this the image is apparently from an advert for puma. The article to which it is attached mentions nothing about puma whatsoever, at best a fair use argument could be used for illustrating the persons association with puma but it is not being used in that way. Again the fair use policy covers this (in the counter examples) "An image of a rose, cropped from an image of a record album jacket, used to illustrate an article on roses.", the fair use criteria have been significantly tightened recently and it is this sort of abuse of fair use which has prompted it. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 12:53, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay, after a read of <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">WP:FU</a>, I see that whilst fair use could be argued. "if the image could <b>reasonably</b> be replaced with a free image that would provide the same value to the reader, then it is very likely to be removed and a request made for such a free image to be obtained". Note the word 'reasonably'. I have tried to find a fre photo of Hargreaves before; none exist on the net, and I don't expect to be bumping into him any time soon to take such a photo. Therefore a fair use photo is justified.</dd>

<p>As a relatively new (&lt; 1 month) admin, I am not sure whether a user talk page with comments from other users and a {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-author_8ff7.html" title="Template:Db-author">db-author</a>}} tag added by the user qualifies for speedy deletion.

<dd>IIRC last time there was any real discussion on this the view was that even for users exercising their right to vanish we would simply blank the talk page, and use deletion primarily for scrubbing any personal info. The basic reasoning being as suggested above that their were some editors who were effectively leaving one week having their talk and user page deleted then returning the next, repeatedly (I perhaps exagerate on that, but you get the idea).--<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 07:13, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The only time user talk pages are deleted is when the user is banned.

<p>I just noticed a new option in the block screen: we can choose not to autoblock IPs used by the blocked user. Sounds like a handy tool, but of course we won't know in advanced who is using AOHell so perhaps not as handy as it first looks. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 00:40, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sounds great, but doesn't the autoblock go poof as soon as you switch IPs anyways?

<dd>This should be used sparingly, otherwise most blocks will end up being meaningless ("We don't want you to edit from this account for 24 hours! But feel free to create a new one.")

<p>Uh, maybe it's different here, but the change on wikibooks was to <i>allow</i> blocking of all IPs that were used by a particular account (we didn't have that before). This tool has a great capacity for doing collateral damage, since it's essentially a step beyond "not allowing account creation"... if I understand it correctly, it means that any <i>registered user</i> will not be able to edit if they're using that IP, which is a serious problem for schools, AOL, etc. --<a href="../../../s/b/_/User%7ESB_Johnny_4962.html" title="User:SB Johnny"><font color="green"><b>SB_Johnny</b></font></a>|<sup><a href="../../../s/b/_/User_talk%7ESB_Johnny_91f0.html" title="User talk:SB Johnny"><font color="green">talk</font></a></sup>|<sub><a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User:SBJohnny" class="extiw" title="b:User:SBJohnny"><font color="green">books</font></a></sub> 17:20, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>As I understand it, an IP number has no right to remove warnings, etc., from its own talk page. A the other extreme, some users in good standing routinely zap (without archiving) all discussion they regard as old, and there seem to be few complaints (answered by "Look in the page history"). But what's the policy (or what are the guidelines) on a user's fast deletion (without archiving) of warnings and adverse comment left on his/her own talk page?

<p>It's not anyones place to force users to keep comments on thier talk page if they don't want them there. If a user has read it, they can remove it. Besides, if you have warned the user, it will always be in the history of the talk page for evidence.

<dd>A previous discussion on this topic had the administrators who commented come to the conclusion that it was not okay to remove <i>current</i> warnings from a talk page. So, for example, a user who has been warned that the images they upload are missing mandatory information (such as the source) cannot remove the warning unless they've added the source information to that image. Similarly, a user currently engaged in vandalism cannot remove current warnings against vandalism. This is entirely different, however, from removing old warnings against vandalism. The consensus at the time was that a warning that was a month old was reasonable to remove but a warning just a few days old was not (unless it had been dealt with). Times in between were discretionary. If a user removes current warnings and then continues the abusive behaviour, it becomes <i>much</i> less reasonable to extend a presumption of good faith to that user. Also worth noting with IP pages is that it is possible for multiple users to "use" the page. In that case, it may be inappropriate to remove a comment as it may be directed to one of the people who share your IP address. Of course, the best solution in this case is to get your own account. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 05:32, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Abusive users remove very recent warnings, perhaps in the hope that (a) {{subst:test2}} will be followed by {{subst:test1}} rather than {{subst:test3}} (for example), perhaps in the hope that (b) they won't be recognized as recidivists. If it's (a), they're being treated with undue leniency; if (b), with unneeded leniency and timewasting. For example, if I notice on my first encounter with User:JoeBlowhard (fictional name) that he has made what appear to be racist comments, I may waste time on the rhetorical effort of AGF if he's removed from his talk page a series of recent warnings about racist comments. A lot of these people are quick to remove any message commenting on the removal of messages: the simplest inference (for me) is not that they want a "clean" talk page but instead that they don't want to be seen by newcomers as the kind of "contributors" (detractors) that they really are. You say: <i>Similarly, a user currently engaged in vandalism cannot remove current warnings against vandalism</i>: granted that people disagree over what "current" is, I think all (except the perps) would agree that it covers what's less than a week old. But is there any policy (or at least guideline) that says such a thing? I sometimes deal with truculent customers who are keen to stand up for their rights (or anyway whatever rights seem to let them continue to be a [<i>insert contumely here</i>]); it would be good to be able to say to them (politely, of course!) "It's not your opinion versus just mine, chum; it's yours against the policy <span style="text-decoration:underline; color:#009">Wikipedia:Don't screw with comments on your own talk page</span>." -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 06:55, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agree with Hoary. The problem here is rarely users removing week-old, or even day-old warnings.

<p>User talk pages exist to facilitate communication. Not to act as a 'rap sheet' or 'wall of shame'. That is not their purpose. Restoring warnings is thus at best edit warring, and at worst disruption or harassment. If you need to see what a person has been told before check their page and/or contribution history. If that is too difficult then get together and come up with standardized edit summaries to parallel the standardized templates... add special characters around them to make them stand out in the page history and you can have a record every bit as complete, but more concise and less disruptive. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 12:48, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agreed 200%. If we do want a proper way to record "this is going on your record" issues, then it needs to have a way for good editors to address mistakes or bad-faith warnings and get them removed from their record. But that seems far too bureaucratic, so nobody has implemented such a thing yet. Regardless of whether it is ever implemented, a person's talk page is a poor stand-in for that. --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 19:35, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

These two sentences are particularly noteworthy: <i>Feel free to decorate your personal pages as you see fit, but keep in mind that your user talk page has the important function of allowing other editors to communicate with you. People will get upset if they cannot use it for that purpose.</i> Yes, we can consult user contributions, pages histories, etc. but the usefullness of warnings and related discussion is in readily providing a context for understanding users' activity in Wikipedia - their edits and comments. Warnings tags have been designed to draw one's attention (not only the errant user's attention but others' as well) and one becomes justifiably suspicious of users who have blanked their talk pages and accompanying warnings while exhibiting edit histories of a controversial nature. It smacks of attempting to <i>sanitize</i> their presence on Wikipedia, and in that sense resembles sockpuppetry. <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkville_8753.html" title="User:Pinkville">Pinkville</a> 01:40, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>"I have been blocked for "persistent vandalism." The full text of the message is "Your account or IP address has been blocked from editing.

During the last months the article has advanced very little, because most of the revisions are either adding or removing VGCharts.

<dd>Methinks this an acceptable solution; or at least a long ban (e.g., 3-4 weeks). If he admits he did wrong and apologizes, then he's let back in. But until then, a community ban seems acceptable. The 3-4 weeks might be enough, though, to get him to think about his conduct, and reconsider in the future.-<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatstuart_7fbf.html" title="User:Patstuart">Patstuart</a><sup><a href="../../../p/a/t/User_talk%7EPatstuart_e8fd.html" title="User talk:Patstuart">(talk)</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Patstuart_a3f0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Patstuart">(contribs)</a></sup> 00:23, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Reading misogynist comment makes me reconsider.

<dd>I didn't notice that comment on my talk page, actually. I love the way he plays the sexist card at me for no good reason.

<dd>I think his present behaviour is so out of the pale it cannot really be tolerated. This is not to preclude that he can stop at any time. However, an indef block at this stage may just further inflame the grudge and lose all hope of redemption.

<dd>There is only really one question to be answered here, which is: do we think this user is likely to calm down and resume making good edits? If we do, then we should ban him, as a community act, from the <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Connolley_fbe1.html" title="William Connolley">William Connolley</a> article, and possibly place him on civility parole. If we think that he is never going to reform then we should show him the door. I lean to the former view myself. Either way, he can challenge a community sanction via ArbCom and we can restrict by block any disruption in the mean time. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 14:38, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks, it seems there were also a lot of articles and user pages that were created with {{subst:MediaWiki:noarticletext}} . Perhaps an old bug that has now been fixed? I've marked many of them for speedy deletion or blanked them as appropriate. <b><a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGraham87_fa35.html" title="User:Graham87">Graham</a></b><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGraham87_9542.html" title="User talk:Graham87"><font color="green">87</font></a> 11:47, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Need some help with this, an AOL vandal has been repeatedly reverting many of <a href="../../../h/u/1/User%7EHu12_d0ca.html" title="User:Hu12">User:Hu12</a>'s edits, and it's quite aggravating to me, as I'm sure it must be to him (ex. diffs: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Onse_Telecom&amp;diff=84758594&amp;oldid=84713787" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Onse_Telecom&amp;diff=84758594&amp;oldid=84713787" rel="nofollow">[50]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Timothy_L._O%27Brien&amp;diff=84363853&amp;oldid=84238161" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Timothy_L._O%27Brien&amp;diff=84363853&amp;oldid=84238161" rel="nofollow">[51]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Robotic_book_scanner&amp;diff=84363607&amp;oldid=84240234" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Robotic_book_scanner&amp;diff=84363607&amp;oldid=84240234" rel="nofollow">[52]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Les_Claypool&amp;diff=84418834&amp;oldid=84393675" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Les_Claypool&amp;diff=84418834&amp;oldid=84393675" rel="nofollow">[53]</a>). It's quite likely the spammer is the same as had posted personal information on my userpage from AOL, and was noted as likely through a checkuser <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_checkuser_Case_EinsteinEdits_ade6.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/EinsteinEdits">here</a> to be the since banned <a href="../../../e/i/n/User%7EEinsteinEdits_7b00.html" title="User:EinsteinEdits">User:EinsteinEdits</a>. As both myself and Hu12 reverted and repeatedly warned this user for his linkspam, and this vandalism started soon after that (and I know, personally, that I haven't done anything that might antagonize anyone here recently), it seems obvious to me that it's the same person doing it. I had been liaising with <a href="../../../k/y/l/User%7EKylu_6ad3.html" title="User:Kylu">User:Kylu</a> on this problem (see some messages on her talk page regarding this situation <a href="../../../k/y/l/User_talk%7EKylu_Archive_6_c972.html#HU12" title="User talk:Kylu/Archive 6">here</a>, however it appears she has gone on Wikibreak. So I figure it's high time I come here, and ask for others to keep an eye on this AOL vandal, and especially Hu12's contributions, since they seem to be getting reverted on a daily basis.

<p>I have written a proposal for a hybrid between RfC, Arbcom and the Community Ban and named it <a href="../../../r/f/s/WP%7ERFSL_0992.html" title="WP:RFSL">WP:RFSL</a>. It is intended to be an RFC with teeth (or faster Arbcom that works be Admins not by Arbitrators or Community ban with discussions). What do you think? Will it work? Can it be abused? <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">Alex Bakharev</a> 09:22, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Interesting. I'm not an expert at RfCs, though... What is an "RfC with teeth"? If during an RfC strong remedies are proposed and endorsed by a substantial number of editors, I don't see why such strong measures from a regular RfC couldn't be enforced. So, if regular RfCs have no teeth it's because nobody proposes or endorses stringent messures. A regular RfC has the advantage over this new RfS proposal that the decision-making isn't limited to admins. I don't particularly like the idea of giving admins a role akin to an "arbcom-at-large" or "ad-hoc arbcom". On the other hand, this is what sometimes happens anyway at <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a>, so maybe this could be seen as a formalization of an existing informal process... There's also the timing question. New ArbCom elections are upcoming: why not wait and see whether the newly constituted ArbCom manages to work more speditively? <a href="../../../l/u/p/User%7ELupo_5a34.html" title="User:Lupo">Lupo</a> 10:04, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>This needs to dovetail with <a href="../../../c/o/m/Wikipedia%7ECommunity_sanction_99c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Community sanction">Wikipedia:Community sanction</a> a new policy written to document our recent community probations. I mention on the talk page that user conduct RFCs can be a starting place for community sanctions. I did so because currently a RFC has a motion for community santions. <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFloNight_10cf.html" title="User:FloNight">FloNight</a> 21:44, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

The policies are new maybe we should see if they will work. I was thinking among other thinks about some cases like <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html#Homeontherange_Again" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I#Homeontherange_Again</a> there many admins insist on permaban, but some does not agree. In that case some structured way to deal with the problem faster then through arbcom may help. Also if there was a process to have a consensus solution for the chronic revert wars (like "if we allowed to name <a href="../../../m/o/l/Moldavian_language.html" title="Moldavian language">Moldavian language</a> as <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanian_language.html" title="Romanian language">Romanian language</a>?", "if <a href="../../../g/e/n/Category%7EGenocide_a1e2.html" title="Category:Genocide">Category:Genocide</a> suitable for <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holodomor.html" title="Holodomor">Holodomor</a>", "when it is appropriate to use word liberate", etc it would be a breeze. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">Alex Bakharev</a> 23:10, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What new ground would this proposal cover?

<li>That is a good point.

<dl>
<dd>I do not think that they will combine well. The Community sanction policy is written to reflect the new practices that have emerged over the last few months. It is flexible with no particular way to reach consensus for community sanctions. <a href="../../../r/f/s/WP%7ERFSL_0992.html" title="WP:RFSL">WP:RFSL</a> does not describe a current community practice. It appears to be a more rigid process than the community wants to use. Instead I think that user conduct RFCs will be a spring board for community sanctions in some instances. Overtime when this happens we can document it with policy. Thoughts? <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFloNight_10cf.html" title="User:FloNight">FloNight</a> 15:30, 9 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think RFSL is too process-heavy. The problem with RFC (or one of the potential problems) is that if there is consensus that an editor's behavior is a problem but the editor doesn't agree, there is no enforcement mechanism but to take it to Arbitration. Rather than adding yet another step in the dispute resolution process, Community sanction becomes the enforcement mechanism for RFC. When there is strong consensus that action needs to be taken, the participants can bring their case here. I expect that once it becomes more widely known that admins are willing to enforce article bans, revert paroles, and so on, there will be a lot less dead-end RFCs. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 15:55, 9 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Plus the fact that as Flo says, Community sanction is something we are already willing to do, RFSL is an eniterly new thing which will likely attract a lot of debate if we try to implement it. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 15:57, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually <a href="../../../d/e/_/WP%7EDE_3fff.html" title="WP:DE">WP:DE</a> links RfC to community sanctions, although only in cases where <i>uninvolved</i> editors form the consensus. Is that the difference here? 72.199.30.31 17:12, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I know that. My concern is that one describes what the community is already doing and the other is proposing a fairly rigid new process. I do not think that they mix that well for that reason even though they do overlap. As we find our way with community sacnctions I've tried to carefully follow the community lead here instead of getting ahead. Waiting for the community to use the authority that we had newly recognized on this page in discussions before introducing it. Doing it this way was key to successful introduction of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Wikipedia%7ECommunity_sanction_99c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Community sanction">Wikipedia:Community sanction</a>, I think. <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFloNight_10cf.html" title="User:FloNight">FloNight</a> 22:10, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>They certainly look the same to me, right down to their user pages.

Somewhat unexpectedly, Mugaliens claims to be more moderate than Dr1819. Either that's for show, or the user is honestly interested in making a fresh start.

<dd>(after ec) My impression is that they are different people who both happen to have the same interest. Dr1819 has a pretty distinctive style of interaction, which I don't see the traces of in Mugaliens's postings. Also, Dr1819 has some strong interests unrelated to unbifurcation, and Mugaliens doesn't seem to share them (although I confess I haven't gone through all his contribs). <a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreplySpang_a627.html" title="User talk:FreplySpang">FreplySpang</a> 23:40, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>(after looking more closely) Hm, I take it back, Mugaliens does seem to be a network engineer who is interested in aviation, much like Dr1819. They could be the same guy.

<p>The images are really inflammatory. Official warning templates only have images (and a single stop hand sign) for the fourth level. Talk about having "grumpy users" scare off a newcomer. I'd be scared off if someone tuck a big-ass stop sign or something on my talk page, especially on a first-level warning. Hbdragon88 03:30, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Basically, Durova is correct. While some RC patrollers are inconvenienced by warning removal and would like it to be a blockable offence, to my knowledge there are no admins who will actually block for this (as opposed to repeating the behavior that caused a warning in the first place, which obviously is bad).

<li>Pretty much. More specifically, a group of people discussed it and found consensus for forbidding talk page warnings; but as they started acting on that and drew attention from others, people outside that group tended to disagree, and it started to become clear that the consensus of the group did not match the consensus of Wikipedia as a whole.

<dd>If someone is removing warnings and then continues to misbehave, then admins are free to take appropriate action. On occasions this might include replacing the warnings - but as a norm <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assmming good faith</a> demands we assume the person has read and understood and wished to start again. Of course that assumption is easily rebutted if the misbehavious continues. However, {{Wr0}} seems to be nothing but an assumption of bad faith - if someoen removes warnings it looks to me more like they HAVE read them.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 16:29, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Since I spend most of my administrative time at <a href="../../../p/a/i/WP%7EPAIN_2701.html" title="WP:PAIN">WP:PAIN</a> and <a href="../../../r/f/i/WP%7ERFI_2cc3.html" title="WP:RFI">WP:RFI</a> maybe I should explain my take on this more clearly. From the way I've read the threads on this debate, I just don't have authority to block in direct response to warning removals. I wish the community would back me in extreme cases such as when administrator warnings get blanked less than a day after they were posted. So as it is I don't block for that, but people who remove valid warnings almost always earn a block for established policy violations soon afterward. So I weigh the removal along with other factors when I decide how long to block them. <font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><span style="color:#009">Durov</span></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><span style="color:#0c0">a</span></a><sup><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova"><i>Charge!</i></a></sup></font> 00:50, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

I blocked user as a sock of <a href="../../../f/a/k/User%7EFakir005_57af.html" title="User:Fakir005">Fakir005</a> (<a href="../../../f/a/k/User_talk%7EFakir005_b12f.html" title="User talk:Fakir005">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fakir005_4aa4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fakir005">contribs</a>). Back story is archived at AN/I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive145#Block_request_for_legal_threats:_User:Fakir005" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive145#Block_request_for_legal_threats:_User:Fakir005" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, Fakir005's only edits and intents on WP was to improperly edit the <a href="../../../z/e/d/Zedo.html" title="Zedo">Zedo</a>, <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_serving.html" title="Ad serving">ad serving</a> and related pages. After Fakir005 was blocked for disruption (not by me), s/he made threats of switching IPs to continue these efforts <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Fakir005&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=86349182" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Fakir005&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=86349182" rel="nofollow">[94]</a>. Shortly thereafter, <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_serving.html" title="Ad serving">ad serving</a> was again vandalized in similar fashion by Bimzalazim <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ad_serving&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=86534160" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ad_serving&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=86534160" rel="nofollow">[95]</a>. The content &amp; tone of this vandalism was similar to Fakir, it was the vandals first and only edit, and the username was obviously chosen as a derivative of my username. All these factors led me to the conclusion that Bimzalazim was a sock of Fakir attempting to continue the vandalism.</p>
<p>It seems Bimzalazim is e-mailing various admins (including myself) accusing me of being a sock/shill of <a href="../../../z/e/d/Zedo.html" title="Zedo">Zedo</a> and demanding to be unblocked. I don't agree, but perhaps it should be reviewed.

<p>I received yet another email from Bimzalazim, again falsely claiming he has been blocked for calling Zedo an adware and claiming that ZimZalaBim is crooked and on the Zedo payroll. I responded pointing out the falsehoods and asking <i>yet again</i> if the user is really claiming he and Fakir005 are different people, pointing out that we can check to be sure. I suspect if I get any further emails from this person, I'll simply reply asking for the person to state under oath that he and Fakir005 are different people. Without that, there's really no benefit to continue responding. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 18:52, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I received another message from Bimzalazim, but no firm statement whether or not the accounts, Bimzalazim and Fakir005, were related. My response was as follows: "You have made no sworn statement that Bimzalazim and Fakir005 are unrelated accounts. I need you to state whether these two accounts are related or not. Until you do that, please do not email me further." The user did ask that <b>both</b> accounts were immediately unblocked, however, which strongly implies that Bimzalazim is indeed a sockpuppet of Fakir005. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 20:24, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I notified you of Fakir005's non-NPOV edits because you had a comment on that user's talk page reminding them of the WP NPOV policy. I never received any such comment on my talk page when I created my login, so I assumed this was in response to some sort of non-NPOV activity. I decided to notify you directly since you were probably already familiar with Fakir005's activity. I certainly find watching this whole process fascinating.

<p>It sounds like this was handled very reasonably but I do have one small suggestion. For future reference, I do not think users should be requested to provide statements "under oath" or "sworn" statements. We have no authority to be administering or demanding oaths and using that language carries a suggestion of legalism that we generally try to avoid. Just a thought. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 21:54, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>My understanding is that the user has now admitted to using abusive sockpuppets and plans to withdraw the legal threat. Just a heads-up. Newyorkbrad, I see your point. Do you believe it would be acceptable to ask a user to <b>promise</b> rather than swear? I am not trying to imply any legally binding statements, what I'm trying to ask is a sort of "swear" like kids make on the school yard. That is, "yes, I've thought about it and I do assert that the following statement is true." Does the term, "promise", carry sufficient connotation without the underlying legal implications? If someone swore and then we proved later they were lying, I'd be disappointed and believe it would show they are acting in bad faith, but obviously I would never launch legal action or anything. If "promise" does not serve, any other wording that you think would work? I find that occasionally I do need some sort of statement from a person in order for me to look at unblocking them or otherwise working on their behalf. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 22:21, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was away for a bit, and have just retrieved another e-mail from Bimzalazim (sent about 3 hours ago) calling me "a crooked Adminstrator taking this job only because you are promoting Zedo as an Adserver and raking in Millions..." and asserting that "You are a sock puppet of Zedo" etc, etc. For the record, I have absolutely no connection to <a href="../../../z/e/d/Zedo.html" title="Zedo">Zedo</a> or any other adware company, and as far as I know, no one in my family or close circle of friends has any connection to Zedo or any other adware company. As noted above, another editor pointed out the vandalism at the <a href="../../../z/e/d/Zedo.html" title="Zedo">Zedo</a> article to me a month ago, and that's how I got involved.

<dd>I agree with MONGO. The unblock request seems either insincere or incorrect: the claim that he couldn't even <i>view</i> his talk page due to protection is wrong. And he even made abusive edits to the page after the block, most notably this threat to evade the block itself <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AFakir005&amp;diff=86349182&amp;oldid=86345993" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AFakir005&amp;diff=86349182&amp;oldid=86345993" rel="nofollow">[100]</a>.

<dd>There's no real easy way to rename image files. One can reupload an image to Commons (or to a local project) with a more descriptive name less likely to cause conflicts and tag the original as a duplicate for deletion. The movie poster image, for instance, could really stand to be renamed "Betty Blythe 1921 movie poster" or something of the sort. The point being that the conflict can be resolved by renaming at either Commons or the local project, but it is a bit of a hassle, especially if one doesn't have admin tools. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 18:13, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>I've been involved in a (mostly civil) dispute over the title of <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_board_game_Monopoly_af1d.html" title="History of the board game Monopoly">History of the board game Monopoly</a> for a couple of weeks. Multiple proposals were made, initially, for a possible new title, but only two proposals looked to have support: leaving the title alone, or moving the article to <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Monopoly_%28game%29_13a4.html" title="History of Monopoly (game)">History of Monopoly (game)</a> to line up with the main article's title at <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monopoly_%28game%29.html" title="Monopoly (game)">Monopoly (game)</a>. I narrowed the discussion, which has been mentioned at RFC, down to those two options, and it still appears mostly deadlocked, with 11 total votes, and one more vote for the move than for leaving the article at its present title. I don't want to say "Hey, no consensus, I'm leaving it" because that might cause negative feelings, but I'm not sure what SHOULD be said. I'm not asking for a ruling, I'd just like someone who has NOT been involved with this article at all or its dispute to come to the talk page and say "No consensus, leave it," or "One vote more is enough, move it," or "Wait a bit longer and see if one option winds up with more votes than the other." The last thing I want to see is a war start up moving the article back and forth between multiple titles.

<p>Could the administation take an independent look for the following reversal of useful and pertinent contributions at the Mustafa Kemal Ataturk site please? It is very difficult for me not to interpret the revision by Khoikhoi as disrespectful vandalism. More I studied his log history at various article related to the Turkish subjects and prior bans for the same disruptive behaviour, more concerned I became. Could someone help revert the edits he damaged and request him to be more respectful to others' work? Thank you.</p>

<dd>Sorry but that is your personal interpretation of the posts. The posts happened to serious. THe problem with applying your own rules is that they aren't WP rules.

Deletion of other peoples that do not attack anyone is <b>censorship</b>.

<p>I admit referring to someoness mother. I didnt know that was disallowed.

I apologise if anyones or their mother was offended.

Guidelines on how to deal with trolling or stupid questions will also need top be developed. I think this procedure is far better than leaving judgement upto individuals as to whether a particular post is offensive, silly, tolling etc. That is one reason I proposed that it should take the agreement of 2 editors before any post was removed from the Rds(except in cases of blatant violiation of WP:Civi, WP:BITE etc.).In fact maybe the last guideline to add to the 3 I have already formulated would be:</dd>

<dd>May I make a comment about LightCurrent? This is my observation after several months of interaction.
<ol>
<li>I believe this is a good-faith editor, and I don't think strict/punitive remedies are necessary or desirable.</li>
<li>I think his problems stem from two sources: a) I believe he is truly, genuinely incapable of recognising the line between appropriate and inappropriate humour/comments. That, IMO, is why he is pushing for rules and regs on this matter; I think he invests a lot of emotion into his work on WP and it causes him a great deal of anxiety to have uncertainty/ambiguity v/v its reception. Compounding that is that b) he has no faith in the community at large to guide him in matters of appropriate communication. I believe it causes him great anxiety to feel 'at the mercy' of a bunch of people.</li>
<li>I believe he has a problem with authority, and that extends not only to Administrators, but in fact to <i>anyone</i> who offers feedback or concrit, however mild, on his contributions or behaviour. Note that for a couple of months, he had a header on his userpage reading something like, 'Barnstars from my friends, blocks from my enemies'. He can't recognise when a critical observation or inhibiting action is taken against him <i>in good faith</i>, or <i>to be helpful</i>. Such actions automatically make the perpetrator an enemy.</li>
<li>I think the only reasonable solution is <i>if</i> an editor can be found who has community trust and common sense, and who would be willing to mentor/mediate, and from whom LightCurrent would actually accept concrit and gentle guidance. I do not know if such a person exists, because I have seen numerous instances of LC reject and pillory even the gentlest, most well-meaning guidance. OR, we just accept the status quo. Because in my observation any comment or attempted intervention from the community at large generates a firestorm of conflict that LC and a couple of other editors latch onto, to the detriment of the community. <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnchoress_3b7f.html" title="User:Anchoress">Anchoress</a> 21:48, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think that is a very good summary and I dont think I can disagree with any part of it. I am particularly impressed with the fourth suggestion as I do find that reasoned argument works better with me than threats or critisism. Also yes if we did have rules and reg, everyone including me would know where the line was. I am the first to admit it when I have been <b>shown</b> to be wrong as past evidence shows. I thank Anchoress for taking the time to do this personality analysis. 8-)--<a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELight_current_29d4.html" title="User:Light current">Light current</a> 22:04, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, its dead on. However it isn't the community's place to legislate or make insanely detailed rules for behaviour because you are incapable of understanding what is over the line.

<dd>Well really I cant quite see the difference apart from the wording being more formal (less colloquiall). Perhaps its colloquiall language that gets your goat? Unfortunately, if you keep it a secret as to what offended you, no one will know what to avoid in the future. Also, I bet that what offended you was not the same thing as what offended some other commenters. But of course we wont know until everyone is specific about what exactly is offensive of wher exactly the line is drawn.</dd>
<dd>Anyway why do you object to having some rules on the RDs. You seem to quote your own versions of the existing rules often enough when it suits you. I wouldnt say the people posting here are abusive. Some are however seem agressive and hostile as if <b>their</b> very existence were being threatened.

<p>After discussions with Light current and pschemp, I will be working personally with Light current on this stuff. This would be something like the mentorship suggested above; I hope to come to some understanding with him on what's appropriate for the reference desk, and on how to handle disputes about such issues in the future. If there are further problems that I miss, I would appreciate being informed of the situation and being given the chance to take the first try at handling the issue through discussion. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 03:30, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

It's partly because I happened to have noticed elsewhere the self-identified age of one of the participants in the thread (a reason why I increasingly try to keep tabs on that sort of thing - sometimes it <i>is</i> helpful to know the age of the people you are talking with), but also because in general the way the original question was phrased might well be something that would be considered inappropriate for Wikipedia. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 03:04, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I too would agree that I personally find this thread disturbing and worrying nad not at all to my taste. However I will strongly defend its retention as it appears not to break any current guidelines and many people will not find it objectionable. If people want to ban this sort of discussion, then a guidelines on sexual acts or use of certain language on RD should be drafted. This is a very good example of the point about censoship that I have been trying to make the past few days. People keep on saying that WP is not censored. REmoval of this thread without backup from existing guidelines will prove that this is not the case.

<dd>Actually agreeing with Light current here. It isn't an unreasonable question to ask in of itself. I find the practice a bit gross myself but that isn't a reason to censor it. In fact, this is a good example of the desk being used for what it is supposed to be used for.

<p>I know Wikipedia is not censored for minors, and I usually don't bring up age issues, as many people around here don't divulge their age, but it is with questions like this that I suddenly find myself drawing back and thinking, "hang on, I (and many other people) <i>would</i> talk differently about this topic if I (or they) were aware of the age of the people reading and posting in the thread." I have no problem with children reading encyclopedic articles about such topics, as the articles can be presented neutrally, but on these topics the tone of the discussions are more subjective and need to be tailored to the age of the people asking the questions. To be quite clear, it is not the self-identified age of the original questioner I am worried about, it is the self-identified (on their user page) age of one the participants in the thread. About the relevance of the question to the Reference Desk. It is always possible to slide around a question and try and make it relevant, but it is quite clear the original poster wasn't asking about the subjects people changed the thread into. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 10:49, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Are these people under 16? If not whats the prob? You can have sex at 16 (ie whilst still a <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor.html" title="Minor">minor</a>) here. And I assume that includes <b>all forms</b> of legal sex however perverted an individual might think. I believe a*** sex between opposite sexes is legal in the UK presently. I believe also that at one time not long ago it was not. So the question was in fact refering to legal activities (in UK at least)</dd>
<dd>So what you are implying is that it was not the original question that should be disallowed, but one ore more of the responses for veering off topic? Is that right?

<dd>One of the people responding to that thread self-identifies as 12 years old. I didn't want to have to say that quite so bluntly, as I thought I'd made it clear above that looking at the user pages of the people involved in the thread would have made clear my concerns. I'm not saying that such questions should be avoided, but that people involved should remember that, by Wikipedia's very nature, minors (self-identified or otherwise) may be reading and even participating in such threads. And it is not the type of sex involved that worries me, more the whole idea of people in that thread discussing sex as if they were talking to adults, but probably not realising that one of the people in the thread was 12 years old. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 16:06, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes. But this is not what I was talking about. I am merely wondering whether the people participating in that discussion would have said things differently if they had been aware of the ages of the people involved <i>in the dicussion</i> (not the original poster). Not whether the activities or discussion of said activities are illegal. My position is that people should remember the "I don't know how old this user is" thing, and remember this when they find themselves talking about whatever <i>they personally</i> feel to be 'adult' material. This only applies to discussions, because minors <i>reading</i> Wikipedia are the responsibility of their guardians (who should be aware that Wikipedia has material not suitable for minors). When you are directly corresponding with someone on a talk page or at the reference desk, it is important to check whether that user has self-identified their age, because <b>if you would act differently towards someone of that age if they were standing in front of you</b>, you should do the same online. If they don't self-identify their age, then no problem. Just remember that you don't know their age. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 16:34, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Now, your example is a simple RD question and answer. The problem comes when people post questions like "how to I get my girlfriend to do XYZ?", and people reply "practice safe sex", when they should reply "we don't answer questions like that" (plus, "practice safe sex" if they want to say that).</dd>
<dd>But again, this is going away from my point (ie. going off-topic), which is: Wikipedians in general (including those at the Reference Desk) need to remember that unless they are told otherwise, the user they are talking to could be a minor, so self-regulate yourself as you would if talking to someone face-to-face. This is <i>not</i> just the OP in a thread (which is what you are focussing on for some reason), but <b>any anonymous person</b> on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 17:24, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Can someone please review the precipitous action by <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarnildo_0cba.html" title="User talk:Carnildo">Admin Carnildo</a> on a fair use image deleted before the time limit, so far as I can see. I've been away and am still extremly busy, but what seemed to be some edit warring I looked in on as a Member's Advocate has me scratching my head as the image policies seem to now be applied contrary to common sense and way, way beyond legal needs.<br />

<dd>Carnildo is absolutely right. This guy is not a recluse, and it would be quite possible to get a free use image of him. Better to use no image than one that violates fair use. -- <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteel359_41ed.html" title="User:Steel359">Steel</a> 21:17, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Agree with Carnildo here the fair use policy is pretty clear your suggestion on <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarnildo_0cba.html" title="User talk:Carnildo">User_talk:Carnildo</a> "Yeah, I'm going to hop a plane and go hunt the guy down for a Pic? So how many hundreds do you think I'll spend" misses the mark the policy says "No free equivalent is available or could be created" not "could be create cheaply by the person currently wanting to use the image". And your comment "You seem to be forgetting the mission—a world class information source", seems to be missing the very significant part of the mission - the "free" bit. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 22:51, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I echo others' approval of this deletion, and would also point out that by clear consensus as well as with the authorization of the foundation, "legal needs" is not the issue. We want an image policy that's consistent with our article policy, which is that GFDL or public domain is the norm and relying on fair use a rare exception. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChick_Bowen_2101.html" title="User:Chick Bowen">Chick Bowen</a> 23:22, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree, of course, with the deletion. But I have a question: I often come across "fair use" images that aren't even close to being fair use. For example: Image:Axis porcinus.jpg: "This is fair use, because it's the only picture of this animal that I could find." (paraphrased). What should I do about these? Should I just delete these images, or is there a tag {{<a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENot-fair-use-please-delete_be8c.html" title="Template:Not-fair-use-please-delete">not-fair-use-please-delete</a>}} that I can put on the image and just forget about it? I don't want to have to: put a tag on it that I cannot remember, notify the original uploader, AND add the image to a page like <a href="../../../p/u/i/WP%7EPUI_d69d.html" title="WP:PUI">WP:PUI</a>. It's such a clear violation of our FU policy that I'm not going to jump through that many hoops. <a href="../../../e/u/g/User%7EEugene_van_der_Pijll_eaa2.html" title="User:Eugene van der Pijll">Eugène van der Pijll</a> 23:43, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>This strict constructionist interpretation of an '<b><i>ideal</i> goal'</b> in a <i>work in progress</i> is really baffling to me from the standpoint of quality of the product and <b>respect for other editor's time and interests</b>. Do keep in mind, if an editor is interested in a topic, there are tens of thousands of readers who are likely to be looking in and appreciative.<br />
<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;So happens I'd briefed the uploader by email on how to obtain a free image sans a costly flight, but this <i><b><u>unecessary rush</u> to delete material before it can be replaced</b> only makes our <b>articles <u>poorer</u></b> to my way of thinking</i>—a case of throwing out the baby with the dirty bath water.<br />
<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;Would that most of you champions of the rule of 'free' should consider that this 'noble goal' is a mirror of an ideal that the English wikipedia be portable to several hundreds of relatively minor cultures, not a legal need—so there is no reason to rush to delete such (save perhaps anal retentativeness and an over indulgence in unnecessary and in this case harmful rules worship).<br />
<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;To my mind, unnecessarily removing <i><u>any</u> good-faith content</i>, perhaps especially pics (the old saw: <i>'<u>A picture speaks a thousand words</u>'</i> certainly applies in cases like this! &lt;g&gt;), just <b>diminishes and devalues the overall results and quality we are (all? hopefully) trying to obtain</b>. Never mind that properly attributed publicity pics are something the theoretically harmed owner will cheer us on doing to include, when such 'harm' is added, this gets beyond ridiculous into the realm of stupid and self-defeating.<br />
<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;I suppose we ought to follow the <b>logical extension</b> and start speedy-deleting book and magazine cover art too... to be consistant and logical, so we can all look ourselves in the mirror without regrets. Not!<br />
<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;In sum, that <b>idealistic introductory paragraph</b> is self-defeating and inconsistant in <a href="../../../f/u/c/WP%7EFUC_7b76.html" title="WP:FUC">WP:FUC</a>, and I'd really respect you all better if you were thinking of the <u>big picture</u>, not some trivial idealistic non-need that cannot be satified perfectly given books, et. al. Please focus on the content and the user-reader, not editorial policies, making your decisions as admins 'easier' by blindly following <b>bad voting results</b> (We <u>ALL</u> <i>should</i> know <b>how this kind of guideline twist happens. This one needs <u>undone</u></b>, clearly.) rooted in such inconsistancy, and the product will benefit greatly from all the time you free up undoing <a href="../../../g/o/o/Good_thing.html" title="Good thing">good things</a> other editors add towards a better project. You could take all that energy and (shudder at the unthinkable!) have some time to <b>add some content yourselves</b> instead of indulging in the endless morrass of wiki-politics mistaking such time as being productive. They are at best supportive, not steps forward in-and-of themselves; I applaud your contribution that way, but please do keep that in mind whilst executing the office. (Yuck on this useless messaging!) Best regards, imho, that policy needs an enema and practial face-lift edit. I may just email Jimbo on this slanted interpretation. This is one more spill over from lack of top down direction and uniformity of policy.

<dd>I agree. In Frank's email to me, his primary concern seemed to be that he felt that I had been wishy washy about handing down decrees. Ok, that is normally a fair enough criticism of me, but it is my style, and a style that has served us well. But in further investigating the case, it became clear that his real concern is that policy is firmly against him in this case.--<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> 21:13, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry Jimbo -- I have no dog in this hunt, so really don't care which consistent policy is followed, so far as it <u>is logically</u> consistent—after eight years as a taxi dad, I really hope I never ever see another soccer game, so there is no 'my side', just a <a href="../../../b/a/d/Bad_thing.html" title="Bad thing">wrong thing</a> here. There are too many nitpicky criteria to keep track of around here as it is, without illogical inconsistency— that's challanging enough as it is. As in my reply email, you can either disallow fair use or allow it. Not both.

<dd>In that case, this is not the place to debate policy. Admins just carry out policy, we don't determine it.

<dd>Not sure what 'case' I have, but agree this (WP:AN) is certainly now not the venue, though was for the inital request. As I replied to Jimbo by email, it should be all Fair Use or none. I had nothing on the table on this, save it seemed nonsensically inconsistent, and still is to me.<br />
<br />
Apparently, whilst I was off-wiki dealing with RL, this was policy promongulated. But <b><u>Kudos to Jimbo</u> for growing a spine and actually doing some managing and setting a policy! That was quite a shock to realize! Maybe we're in for better days and our productivity will improve, should he keep on that tack! Do another Jimbo!<br />
<br /></b> One things certain... <b>The banner template for 'Policy' really needs to be much better differentiated from the 'guidelines' box.</b> After three years or so, I just overlook most of them for the text and they are <u>way too similar</u>! If you follow most of the thread(s), no one pointed out my error when I said 'guideline' (including a couple of user talks) so I didn't know I'd had egg on face until I was drafting my email reply to Jimbo last night. My premise above is clearly we were discussing a guideline... I've been in favor of more top-down managing for a long, long, long while!<br />

The likelyhood, therefore, is that the community trusts Ezeu's judgement, and trusts that he is able to close a simple AfD.

Thirdly, and finally, even if I thought the article should be deleted, that wouldn't mean I would delete it, as there are opinions to both keep and delete this article. An Admin's job is not to choose how is right in an AfD discussion. It is to see what consenus has been met, and abide by the communities decission. This issue needs no admin action for now, so I suggest to you that you don't worry about, go and edit somewhere else, and the community will decide what to do with the article. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Halo_3472.html" title="User:The Halo">Th</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Halo_Esperanza_d8f6.html" title="User:The Halo/Esperanza"><font color="green">ε</font></a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Halo_3472.html" title="User:The Halo">Halo</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Halo_8994.html" title="User talk:The Halo"><b>Θ</b></a></sup> 19:25, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

I was NOT here to discuss Ezeu at all. Hence forget about him and forget about you too. I am here for finding 2-3 admin that could close this AFD after reading all the arguments. Those admins should have no prior affiliation with this topic (not Jew, Not Muslim). I need those admin BEFORE CLOSIND DATE OF THIS AFD. So that they can close it after reading arguments. When ever I use the word of VOTE some people start writing against me (see the AFD). Then I say okay arguments but then people like your do not listen. --- <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EALM_scientist_afc8.html" title="User:ALM scientist">ابراهيم</a> 19:52, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ibraheem (providing I read the Arabic in your signature correctly), please know that no one is trying to attack you, or to cause you trouble. The Halo was trying to explain the general AfD process, and why the result of the last AfD was what it was, regardless of any biases that might have been seen. It's really best not to type in caps, as it comes across as shouting, and is kind of anti-productive to the situation. Just as you think that he has not read up on the AfD discussion, you should read what he has said to you, as it's very applicable.

<dd>Ibrahim is right about how AfDs are closed. It is not always the apparent <i>keep</i> or <i>delete</i> comments that decide whether or not an article should be kept but it is also the strength of the arguments on both sides of the issue. I believe Ibrahim is hopeful that an admin or group of admins will take this fact to heart and not merely count the calls for <b>keep</b> or <b>delete</b> in the AfD discussion. <i>(<a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetscott_c779.html" title="User talk:Netscott">→</a><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott"><span class="pBody" style="border: 0; color: gray; padding: 0; font-size: 100%;">Netscott</span></a>)</i> 20:18, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Currently the AFD in question is only Jews vs. Muslims battle ground "mainly". People who are neutral are in minority. <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Aqsa_Mosque_3981.html" title="Al-Aqsa Mosque">Al-Aqsa Mosque</a> is located in Israel capital. Muslims claims it is our third holiest site according to our Hadith and Quran. Hence a person who declares himself a Jew <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Third_holiest_site_in_Islam_%28second_nomination%29_60a0.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Third holiest site in Islam (second nomination)">created this article denying this Muslim claim .</a> It will remain in non-consensus with respect to votes always. Hence you need to read the arguments and decided to keep or delete it. See most of the votes on Keep are from people who openly say themselves Jews and most of the votes in delete are from those who are Muslims. Hence either wikipedia policies are not good enough or you admins are not implementing it rightly. I just tried to illustrate my point clearly while doing that if you feel I become anti-semantic (which I am not at all) and you feel like banning me. Then so be it. After this AFD keep I will start hating wikipedia from deep of my heart anyway. --- <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EALM_scientist_afc8.html" title="User:ALM scientist">ابراهيم</a> 20:09, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>(Sorry to continue discussion here) - ALM, could you possibly provide some specific examples of where the article is not good? I am starting to see what you mean about a POV fork. The problem is that the article <i>should</i> be included on Wikipedia.

<p>A proposed guideline is in development to address some gaps in the Wikipedia namespace.

Related content at <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyrights_92c4.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyrights">Wikipedia:Copyrights</a> presumes that the reader already knows how to recognize copyright violations. Due to Wikipedia's lack of some clear statement on the subject, a good number of editors proceed in ignorance and leave problems for the rest of us to clean up. <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_honesty_b038.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor honesty">Wikipedia:Editor honesty</a> is intended to be a straightforward practical guideline: the equivalent of a university academic honesty policy.

<dd>I have issues with the name and subsequently the content. If you want to educate people about plagiarism, make a policy at WP:Plagiarism. However, writing a policy requiring people to be honest at all times is too general and tremendously unenforceable. I can just see any factual mistake someone makes resulting in people accusing them of being dishonest, and this would be very bad. Mistakes don't just happen to newbies either. You need to narrow the scope to address plagiarism specifically and leave the rest of the general lecture on moral behaviour out. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 00:49, 12 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have to completely disagree with Pschemp on this one. I, for one, was comparing it side-by-side with <a href="http://www.asu.edu/studentaffairs/studentlife/judicial/academic_integrity.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.asu.edu/studentaffairs/studentlife/judicial/academic_integrity.htm" rel="nofollow">Arizona State's Academic Integrity Policy</a>, and saw that this page was pretty close to our needs. Also, the proposed draft gives what I consider to be adequate leeway to good faith new editors, and the adequate punishment to <a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrimetime_bbeb.html" title="User:Primetime">Primetime</a>-like users. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">xd</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a>)</sup> 00:54, 12 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Its the good faith old editors I'm concerned about. I don't think it gives adequate leeway to them. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 03:28, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Editor integrity is better. I realise its really rough, but if you use a word like honesty, people will latch on to it and start making it a sin to be accused of, just like the word civility. Remember, that if it gets adopted, whatever you choose will become the new meme to throw at people in disputes. Like I said before, I still think the focus is too broad and that older good faith editors will get caught in it, but I realise it is a work in progress. It is a good start. The plagiarism section is good. I'm just not sure we need the others.
