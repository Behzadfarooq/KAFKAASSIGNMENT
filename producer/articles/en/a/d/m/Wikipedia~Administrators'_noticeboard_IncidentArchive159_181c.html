<dd>Unless I missed it, Trödel overlooked two other arbitration cases that Nathannoblet filed a few weeks ago, which made no sense and I believe set the modern Olympic record for speedy rejection of an arbitration request. His nomination of <a href="../../../k/r/i/Krispy_Kreme_ffba.html" title="Krispy Kreme">Krispy Kreme</a> for featured article status today while the article still has neutrality-disputed and cleanup tags on it also isn't going to impress anyone. On the other hand, the user never been blocked before and does have some (not a huge number of, to be sure) good faith edits, so a jump from zero to indefinite is pretty steep. A one-month block is already a long time and hopefully will send the intended message. Suggest a strong warning and monitoring when he comes off the block and the situation can be reconsidered then if he picks up where he left off. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 18:14, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>&lt;after edit conflicts&gt;I endorse your block, however, I think a community ban may be too much at this point. I don't think Nathan has any malicious intent, he's just <i>very</i> young. Also, I think we should at least wait and see if this block has any impact on him. It is the first time he has ever been blocked and it is possible (though admittedly, unlikely) that it might make an impression on him and help him to understand that his behaviour is not appropriate. <b>Sarah Ewart</b> 18:28, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Nathan seems slightly naive, I am of the opinion that a community ban is slightly excessive, I do however endorse a cool down block. <small><font face="Tahoma"><b>thanks</b>/Fenton, Matthew Lexic Dark <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MatthewFenton_0db4.html" title="Special:Contributions/MatthewFenton">52278 Alpha 771</a></font></small> 18:31, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>(Side note) - I believe 48 hours to be an acceptable cool down period and so I urge the blocking admin to reconsider the length, 1 month is pretty long and I can't imagine it will do much good. <small><font face="Tahoma"><b>thanks</b>/Fenton, Matthew Lexic Dark <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MatthewFenton_0db4.html" title="Special:Contributions/MatthewFenton">52278 Alpha 771</a></font></small> 18:33, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I also thought a month was on the long side, but rather than reduce it now, I'd wait for a reasonable unblock request. If community sanctions are in effect, maybe for the rest of the month he could be requested to edit in mainspace rather than projectspace, or something along those lines. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 18:35, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Sarah Ewart's assessment above: we're dealing with a little kid here. Maybe the month-long block will lead him to lose interest and find something better to do with his time. Another alternative worth looking at is assigning Nathan some sort of mentor, although admittedly, that's a solution that has had <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Garcia_d523.html" title="User:Mike Garcia">mixed results in the past</a>. <a href="../../../a/_/t/User%7EA_Train_c9b0.html" title="User:A Train">A Train</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../a/_/t/User_talk%7EA_Train_dd5d.html" title="User talk:A Train"><font color="DarkBlue">take the</font></a></small></sup> 18:39, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm probably the one who's had the most dealings with Nathanoblet, initially helping him out upon his entry to Wikipedia several months ago now. In the end he turned on me also, but that's a long boring story we don't need to go into here. I think what we've got here is a case of a very young editor who isn't afraid to try new things, and sometimes the boundaries aren't too clear. I endorse the 1 month block to give Nathanoblet some time to think about how he behaves when editing, but I don't endorse a permanent block just yet. Allow him a chance to show us some positive change. He is a little hungry for power, but perhaps with the right guidance he can become a useful editor. He sure is keen. -- <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonghair_25a8.html" title="User:Longhair">Longhair</a>\<sup><a href="../../../l/o/n/User_talk%7ELonghair_0f2b.html" title="User talk:Longhair">talk</a></sup> 21:16, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Endorse the 1 month block. If he is a kid, maybe he will lose interest in that time. If not, then maybe the reasons for the imposed break will get through to him. If the behaviour returns with him after the block I would then support a year long blo0ck over an indefinate one, because if he is indeed a kid then there is not need to punish him forever for childish actions which he will hopefully gorow out of. <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViridae_a0d4.html" title="User:Viridae">Viridae</a><a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViridae_b84f.html" title="User talk:Viridae"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 21:42, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hopefully the suggestion of mentorship will help things work out well here.

<p>Just throwing some ideas around...how does a probation about disrputive behaviour pertaining to the writing of the Signpost. I mean, something like:-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nathannoblet is placed on disruption probation for one year regarding the operation of the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_Signpost_ccd3.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost">Wikipedia Signpost</a> and its' compilation; if he harasses Ral315 (the editor), other writers, or any general page related to this production, he may be blocked for up to one week at an uninvolved administrators' discretion, and up to one month after three such blocks, again at an uninvolved administrators' discretion.

</blockquote>
<p>Although <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROB_4192.html" title="WP:PROB">WP:PROB</a> doesn't specify that a superconcensus of users can actually create probation terms, I believe that in the spirit of <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>, and following the lead of <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAN_eb66.html" title="WP:BAN">WP:BAN</a> (regarding community bans), it <i>could</i> be allowable.

<dd>I'm not an administrator, but I really disliked seeing this happen on Wikipedia once before, an indefinite community ban on a user who had never been blocked before. I've said it before, so I know many of you have just moved on, but sometimes disruptive users get used to not being blocked when they display atrocious behaviour--and they become bolder and bolder, when just having blocked them earlier for their bad behaviour, blocked them repeatedly, and blocked them for a longer time, could have had a positive impact. I think potentially good editors can be made into bad and disruptive ones simply by being allowed to get away with too much. And, with probabtion, no one would have to doubt they had given the user every chance. Please consider probabtion first, you'll feel better when and if you eventually ban the user. And thanks for the info on the <a href="../../../k/r/i/Krispy_Kreme_ffba.html" title="Krispy Kreme">Krispy Kreme</a> FAC--very hard to figure out what it was doing there. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 00:19, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That took a while to read! You have amassed a bevy of suggestive evidence; statistically, Editor X could have won the lottery before being two people from the same town with the same in-depth knowledge and yet rather bizarre theories, unless of course, he has converts. In either case, the behavior is incredibly disruptive not just because of the behavior itself, but the subtly with which it undermines the article. The editor has already been almost completely unresponsive to discussion and attempts to reform their behavior including being dishonest when cornered - since it doesn't appear meaningful contact can be made, I'd support the idea of a community ban. <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShell_Kinney_fd26.html" title="User:Shell Kinney">Shell</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7EShell_Kinney_fbce.html" title="User talk:Shell Kinney">babelfish</a></sup> 16:06, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can try and help you get a checkuser through but if he's on AOL it won't do any good. If you assemble a list of accounts with recent edits (&lt;1 month) and a brief statement, go ahead and file it. I expect once more people read this they will support a ban without technical confirmation (which can only go back a few weeks in any case). <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 16:40, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I've invited one of these accounts to agree to a checkuser. How exactly does the AOL wrinkle crease this seam - would they be limited to confirming whether or not this person hails from Reston, Virginia? That could be enough in light of the other evidence. I'm not the least bit averse to naming him at AOL's abuse department and requesting they revoke his service. That would take considerably less effort than I've already spent undoing his damage. <font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charg</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><span style="color:#0c0">e!</span></a></i></sup></font> 17:00, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If he's using AOL then I'm not sure how you can even be sure of his geographic location, since I think all US AOL addresses show up as Reston VA. Unless this editor made a specific slip-up which I am reluctant to discuss publically, the only thing checkuser could reveal is that each of the suspected accounts has edited from AOL. Since thousands of editors use AOL, this would not provide any confirmation that the accounts were operated by the same person. A check may still be productive if this person was careless in a certain way, or he may be using multiple ISPs where it would be easier to track him. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 17:10, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Okay, I see. To the best of my knowledge he's been a loyal AOL customer. They host his website - and as extraordinary as this is for an AOL homepage, of the 3 million-odd Google returns for a "Joan of Arc" search he's consistently numero uno. So regardless of his actual residence location I'm pretty sure AOL's abuse department could pinpoint him and I don't think he wants his service interrupted. What worries me more is his disruption on other topics, which appears to have been continuous - the homosexuality pages especially. I'm getting set to roll up my sleeves and dig into that evidence now that people take this matter seriously - he's clever but not <i>too</i> clever. <font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charg</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><span style="color:#0c0">e!</span></a></i></sup></font> 17:34, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The only thing checkuser can do then is, for any user name he has used in the last month or so, give you the IP address as of the time of its edits. This would probably not be released to you but could be forwarded to AOL's abuse department, so they could attempt to determine if the wikipedia vandal is the same person whose web site they host. I don't know what it would take to convince AOL to take action, though. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 17:38, 5 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Durova: All AOL users show up from Reston, Virginia. But the most important thing to keep in mind is that the IP address for AOL users is never linked to a specific account but instead is based on the page (URL) being viewed or edited -- see Wikipedia's information on this. It's very odd but that's how AOL IPs work for reasons known only to their engineers.</dd>
<dd>The upshot is that an IP check won't do any good and neither will reporting a set of IPs to AOL. They're likely to just ignore you because you won't be reporting a single and discrete user given that all users are on the same range of IPs. You will instead be telling them that some of the many millions of AOL subscribers happen to get those IPs while editing certain articles, which is not going to come as a surprise to them.</dd>
<dd>You can never be sure whether an AOL vandal is one person or a whole host of users who end up editing under the same IPs. Other websites such as BBs have the same problem. <a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EEReference_8f71.html" title="User:EReference">EReference</a> 17:55, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for the dissection of AOL's innards.

<dd>Well, aren't you assuming that the IPs are linked to that real name? They wouldn't necessarily be linked to a given individual, or even a single individual. And since anyone can claim to be anyone else on here, a name is not proof of identity. AOL cannot suspend someone's paid account based merely on an allegation. This comes up repeatedly on many websites since there's no way to tell who anyone really is on the internet. <a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EEReference_8f71.html" title="User:EReference">EReference</a> 19:02, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Durova, with all due respect for your detective work, I'm a tad uncomfortable with you referring to the guy as a "vandal" and "long-term abuser". Did he ever get blocked? He's not currently banned under any of his accounts, is he? From your description I take it that his main accounts were used subsequently, not in parallel for blatant illegitimate sockpuppetry, or were they? I mean, I have no doubt he may be a disruptive POV-pusher, but has he done anything actually "illegal" in Wikipedia terms besides POV-pushing? And what would we expect his ISP to do about that, at this stage? Let's ban him if he's as disruptive as you say, and then we'll see - any new reincarnations of his will probably be easy enough to spot, once people are alerted. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 19:06, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

The damage he caused at <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joan_of_Arc_9b78.html" title="Joan of Arc">Joan of Arc</a> has been incredibly pervasive and subtle - not just garden variety POV pushing but degrading footnotes, inserting inaccurate statements into previously cited material, and fraudulent citations. He even vanity published and faked the appearance of a legitimate scholarly journal in order to bypass site standards and cite himself. Note that the author name on the pseudojournal is the same as the name he self-identified on the original account, and that the IP inserted it while coyly avoiding use of the author's name at Wikipedia. Due to the high profile of the Joan of Arc article I acutally had to dig through several thousand edits to undo the harm that he caused - expending weeks of my time. If you need more evidence than I've already supplied at <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_Complex_vandalism_at_Joan_of_Arc_3c00.html" title="User:Durova/Complex vandalism at Joan of Arc">User:Durova/Complex vandalism at Joan of Arc</a> then say so and I'll dig up other examples and more diffs.

<p>So far this is unanimous. Think the responses are enough to call a consensus? Much as I'd like to do the honors myself, since I <i>am</i> an involved editor it would be more appropriate for someone else to perform the ban.

A check of some of the allegations turns up the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>The most serious allegations revolved around the claim that the editor (or someone suspected of being the editor) was using a fanciful academic publication ("Primary Sources and Context Concerning Joan of Arc's Male Clothing" within the "Joan of Arc Primary Sources Series") and a fanciful nonprofit organization ("Academy (Association) for Joan of Arc Studies") to dishonestly include his own original research in Wikipedia. But a quick search finds the following entry at a government site which lists this organization as a registered nonprofit in good standing: <a href="http://da.sos.state.mn.us/minnesota/corp_inquiry-entity.asp?:nfiling_number=1334426-4&amp;entity_type_id=NP&amp;:Nsession_id=&amp;:Ndocument_number=0&amp;filename=-839384211.txt&amp;pgcurrent=6&amp;:Norder_item_type_id=10&amp;:Ssearch_Parm=Academy+for" class="external text" title="http://da.sos.state.mn.us/minnesota/corp_inquiry-entity.asp?:nfiling_number=1334426-4&amp;entity_type_id=NP&amp;:Nsession_id=&amp;:Ndocument_number=0&amp;filename=-839384211.txt&amp;pgcurrent=6&amp;:Norder_item_type_id=10&amp;:Ssearch_Parm=Academy+for" rel="nofollow">search result</a></li>
<li>And a search at Google Books finds the allegedly "bogus" book in print: <a href="http://books.google.com/books?ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=Academy+%22Joan+of+Arc+Studies%22&amp;as_brr=0" class="external free" title="http://books.google.com/books?ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=Academy+%22Joan+of+Arc+Studies%22&amp;as_brr=0" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.com/books?ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=Academy+%22Joan+of+Arc+Studies%22&amp;as_brr=0</a></li>
<li>A search at Google Scholar finds the "Joan of Arc Primary Sources Series" although only one item is currently indexed. <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=%22Joan+of+Arc%22+%22Primary+Sources+Series%22" class="external free" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=%22Joan+of+Arc%22+%22Primary+Sources+Series%22" rel="nofollow">http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=%22Joan+of+Arc%22+%22Primary+Sources+Series%22</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The most serious allegations are therefore clearly mistaken and some of the other allegations were based on an erroneous understanding of the manner in which AOL IPs are assigned. The rest were I believe mostly or entirely related to allegations of POV-pushing or suspected sockpuppetry, which are more subjective. If people want to vote for a ban anyway then that's the decision. <a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EEReference_8f71.html" title="User:EReference">EReference</a> 06:12, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

To be candid, I hold only a bachelor's degree in history from <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_University_082c.html" title="Columbia University">Columbia University</a> (my graduate studies were in another field) and my interest in Joan of Arc is an amateur one (although serious enough that I have traveled France to follow her campaigns).

Challenge me for more evidence if you aren't convinced: this case is so complex that I've held back to conserve space.

<dd>I have more time now. I guess I might as well cover several items in the same message since they're all interrelated.</dd>
<dd>Yesterday Akhilleus alleged that a certain book by this organization is not valid because the peer reviewers are listed. I don't think that's justified since this type of disclosure has in fact become more common in recent years for a number of academic publications. For example see the following <a href="http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/article.cfm?RecID=8#N10116" class="external text" title="http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/article.cfm?RecID=8#N10116" rel="nofollow">guidelines here</a> (see point 5 specifically) for an academic publication which lists the peer reviewers and accepting editors who recommended each article (only reviewers who rejected the work remain anonymous under their method).</dd>
<dd>The low price is not too unusual for smaller books, especially at Amazon.</dd>
<dd>Durova has brought up a number of subjects, mostly dealing with old debates and issues which are hard to follow. Some deal with the organization which you dispute.</dd>
<dd>For starters, let's look up the organization's website. On one page it lists at least fifteen members in two categories without listing whatever others there may be aside from these "recent" ones. You had said the total was only four people. Googling the listed names finds that Stephen Richey authored at least one published book on Joan of Arc. François Janvier is evidently an official at the CAOA in the Department of the Meuse, France. François Thouvenin seems to be a translator with the Council of Europe in Strasbourg. Others could be Googled if I had time. The website also lists a publisher's ISBN prefix, which is definitely not cheap to buy. It lists an Employer Identification Number, a SAN, several ISSNs (which might take months to obtain from the Library of Congress) and a list of current or upcoming publications which include subjects such as military records, government docs, a "transcription of BNF fr 4488 ff 463-476" and a bunch of other stuff. This clearly extends beyond four people with one pdf file, I think. Remember that this ultimately comes back to the allegation that a dishonest editor had created or invented a bogus org so he could insert his own stuff into the article. A bit of searching indicates that this is wrong.</dd>
<dd>Your objections to the people themselves have been of two types. One was based on a search for their names at Google Scholar, which is likely to be unreliable for several reasons. It looks like you initially didn't find the organization's publications there either although at least some of them do show up if you use certain keywords. It's also the case that Google Scholar is hardly exhaustive. The other argument was based on the assumption that certain anonymous IPs or accounts here are disguises for one of the members (which would be hard to prove). You assume that certain edits by these anons were deliberately made in bad faith and therefore undermine the person's credibility as a historian. In one case this was because (if I understand correctly) you believe he misrepresented an author's position with regard to specific pieces of evidence. After looking over the links to the old edits you provided it looks to me like the two of you were arguing about rather different issues (an author's mention of a document versus an author's view of a theory related to that document) and therefore misunderstanding each other. Here's why I think that. Looking at the first link you provided, we see him adding citations for two books which quote or mention some historical documents he was using to back up one of his own theories. Now, his edit comment specifically says he's citing a book by Pernoud because Pernoud "mentions this document" (he doesn't say Pernoud supports it) which his text lower down specifies is a letter from "the University of Paris.. to John of Luxembourg" which was among several documents which he said supported his theory that "Charles or his faction" attempted to save Joan of Arc. The other link you provided leads to your rebuttal which you based on a quote from one of Pernoud's other books in which Pernoud casts doubt on this theory and questions the reliability of the "Morosini" records... but it seems that neither of those two issues were the point. He wasn't saying Pernoud's book supported his theory but rather that this book by Pernoud "mentions" the University of Paris letter. This is "original research" on the anon's part but not dishonesty. You state that these rather ambiguous matters would undermine a specific real person's scholarly credentials ... which would not be the case even assuming that he was genuinely the anon in the first place.</dd>
<dd>You also objected to a comment the anon made about Henry V's will in the same link. As far as I can see this refers to footnote 3 in that text in which he argues (I'm summarizing here) that the decision to keep Joan of Arc as a prisoner rather than letting her be "allowed ransom" was similar to previous cases in which important prisoners were also retained in this way. He gives as an example the case of Henry V retaining "the duke of Orléans" according to a statement given in Henry's will. You didn't say why you object to this, but I'll do my best to try to figure it out. Is it inaccurate to say that the duke of Orleans was retained as a prisoner by Henry V&#160;? Or as with the other disputed Pernoud citation are you objecting to the reference to Pernoud because perhaps Pernoud may have disagreed with this theory as was the case with the other one? Since this reference to Pernoud's book occurs in the middle of the sentence right after the mention of Henry V's will but before any mention of the theory which compares the two cases, he doesn't seem to be attributing the theory itself to Pernoud but only the claim that Henry V's will ordered the duke of Orleans to be kept a prisoner. But I'm grasping at straws here to guess the specific objection since I don't think you stated the problem. At least not in your last note. <a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EEReference_8f71.html" title="User:EReference">EReference</a> 06:27, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Despite the practice of the Digital Medievalist, it is not common to disclose peer reviewers in most academic publications. Nor is it common for an association to publish original material that's authored by one member of the association and "peer reviewed" by two of the other members. This is a self-publishing house that isn't following standard academic rules. That's not surprising, because its members/contributors aren't academics--Chris Snidow and Catherine Hénon are <a href="http://www.groove.nl/cd/2/23436.html" class="external text" title="http://www.groove.nl/cd/2/23436.html" rel="nofollow">musicians</a> and <a href="http://users3.ev1.net/~cowrind/pilgrim3.htm" class="external text" title="http://users3.ev1.net/~cowrind/pilgrim3.htm" rel="nofollow">tour guides</a> (or perhaps I should say pilgrims?); <a href="http://uts.cc.utexas.edu/~sparta/menu/about.htm" class="external text" title="http://uts.cc.utexas.edu/~sparta/menu/about.htm" rel="nofollow">Kevin Hendryx</a> is, according to his webpage, "an editor, is a freelance writer by night, and ... loves Tolkien, the Beatles, and Joan of Arc..."; and Bob Perler apparently enjoyed the <a href="http://users3.ev1.net/~cowrind/pilgrim2.htm" class="external text" title="http://users3.ev1.net/~cowrind/pilgrim2.htm" rel="nofollow">2004 pilgrimage</a> guided by Snidow and Henon. I'm sure that all of these people have a strong and sincere interest in Joan, but they don't have the credentials we expect from people who are running a research institute or academic press. At the risk of publicizing too much personal information (even though it's accesible through brief searching on the web), I'll note that the organization is headquartered at the residence of one of the members of the "academy", which is another indication that this isn't an academic organization.</p>
<p>By the way, ISBNs are not cheap, but they're not <a href="http://www.isbn.org/standards/home/isbn/us/printable/isbn.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.isbn.org/standards/home/isbn/us/printable/isbn.asp" rel="nofollow">astronomical</a>, either; a person could get a few contributors together to cover the cost, apply for 501c3 status, and voila, you have an "academy" that issues publications and a journal. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 08:01, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The four people I listed were the four named in connection with this particular publication. As I stated before, some of them may have acted in good faith. My original summary was written three months ago, at which time the organization had no other members, and I wouldn't be surprised if they're trying to get something more serious off the ground. An author who self-publishes may have partners and a larger goal of building a real publishing firm.</dd>
<dd>My earlier post traces a history of unethical behavior by Williamson and his probable sockpuppets in which he consistently attempts to put himself forward as more authoritative than he actually is. To address the two specific instances of misused citations:
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><i>Henry V's will</i> To explain why this is worse than garden variety OR requires background knowledge, a good deal of which I can demonstrate through the same book that Williamson cites. Henry V died seven years before Joan of Arc entered public life.(168, 266) That will did forbid any ransom of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_I_de_Valois%2C_Duke_of_Orl%C3%A9ans_dc82.html" title="Charles I de Valois, Duke of Orléans">Charles I de Valois, Duke of Orléans</a> but did not in any way extend that prohibition into some general rule against ransoming prisoners.(193) Ransoms were one of the principal ways of profiting at war and the English accepted other war ransoms for French prisoners.(172, 190) The duke of Orléans was a special case because at the time of Henry V's death this duke was second in line to inherit the throne of France according to the Valois claim. This duke's son would later become king of France when the older line died out.(196) Henry V claimed legal right to inherit the French crown and had solidified his claim through marriage and treaty,(3) so his prohibition against this particular ransom had everything to do with dynastic succession and nothing to do with Joan of Arc: Henry V wanted to bequeath rulership of France to his infant son. Furthermore - even if by some stretch of the imagination this will did apply to her - Williamson claims this document held legal force in Burgundy, which it didn't. The English alliance with <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_III%2C_Duke_of_Burgundy_3c1b.html" title="Philip III, Duke of Burgundy">Philip III, Duke of Burgundy</a> was not even a very cordial one.(170)</li>
<li><i>Attempts to ransom Joan of Arc</i> As my other diff demonstrates, there weren't any such attempts. Far from what Williamson tries to represent about Charles VII's actions, "cowardly abandonment" is the standard interpretation of his behavior while she was a prisoner.(167) Williamson's citation of a delegation from the University of Paris is completely misleading: Paris was not under control of the French king at this time and its university was solidly pro-English. The University of Paris endorsed the charges against Joan of Arc during her trial and many of her judges had some prior connection to that university.(125-126, 207-217) The delegation from the University of Paris that Williamson mentions is not any action on behalf of the French king - to make that implication in this context is absurd - and Morosini's rumor mill was unreliable: in August of the same year Morosini thought that Joan of Arc had escaped.(99)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>To summarize, Williamson has been laying traps for the uninformed. This is someone who knows exactly what he's doing and who sets out to fool people. One of his own edit summaries admits that he selected citations because he believed they were out of my depth. Before I joined the project he had successfully disrupted one of Wikipedia's core biographies for a year because - I think I can use a strong term without exaggeration - his other crankery actually was beyond the depth of previous editors. He constructs sophisticated exercises in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contextomy.html" title="Contextomy">contextomy</a> while giving them a veneer of plausibility and the above two examples are by no means the only offenses. The good faith assumptions of editors such as EReference account for much of why I waited so long to raise this matter: as absurd as Williamson's claims really are, Wikipedia has at most a handful of editors who know this material in sufficient depth to challenge it on its own terms. So I had to build my own reputation for editing, investigations, and integrity before my charge could be taken seriously. If Wikipedia were a university I would have referred him for formal academic discipline in November 2005. While this assault on Wikipedia's credibility is significant, my real concern is for the students who relied upon us while his edits stood. At best, those students' time was wasted. More likely their grades suffered. <font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charg</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><span style="color:#0c0">e!</span></a></i></sup></font> 15:58, 8 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I see there's another round of allegations here to sift through and try to analyze. I would ask both of you to please read through the whole thing before thinking of replying. Maybe we can finally bring at least this one part of the matter to a close.</dd>
<dd>Akhilleus' post was first. I have to say that I've been confused by your statements here. I'm curious whether you also reject other publications which disclose peer reviewers? Remember that your original accusation held that this was an unethical practice, not merely that it was uncommon. Clearly some journals use that method (uncommon as it is) without being accused of an ethics violation, do they not?</dd>
<dd>You have now added the related allegation that this publication should be taken to task for using peer reviewers who belong to the same association. I may be mistaken, but doesn't (for instance) the Journal of the American Medical Association include articles in which both the author(s) and peer reviewers belong to the American Medical Association? My understanding is that they do, without being considered suspect. I think that's also the case with many small, narrowly focused organizations, isn't it? Your statement on this matter repeated the view that this is an "uncommon" practice, which is debatable but again it isn't the issue.</dd>
<dd>You objected to some of the members, for example by describing Chris Snidow as a musician and tour guide. It doesn't take much searching to find that Chris Snidow has a published book on Joan of Arc which was given the endorsement of a person who is a familiar name from one of Durova's links, Marie-Veronique Clin. Now, in Durova's link Marie-Veronique Clin was described as the co-author of a book which Durova was using as a source. Clin therefore would apparently be someone whose endorsement of Snidow's book would be significant, I would assume? Your characterization of Chris Snidow clearly is unfair I think. If I had time I could wade through these other accusations you've been making against quite a number of other people, but I think a clear pattern is emerging.</dd>
<dd>With all due respect, what I've been seeing here frankly seems to be a case in which arguments continually shift ground whenever one assumption is shown to be mistaken after closer examination. There has also been a great deal of speculation which assumes the very worst about all of the people connected with this organization without any verifiable evidence to substantiate that assumption. I'll assume you are acting in good faith but it's becoming more difficult to maintain that view when you repeatedly refuse to do likewise for the increasingly larger and larger circle of people you're trying to discredit.</dd>
<dd>Next is Durova's post, which sought to explain a few previous allegations.</dd>
<dd>You addressed the issue of the organization's membership. You said that when you had written the first allegation three months ago the org had no one except the four members who are listed in one of their pdf files. Their site mentions other members being brought in far earlier than that, such as Stephen Richey who came in more than a year ago. The rest of your comments consisted of speculation about their motives. You assume they are acting in bad faith (or worse) based mainly it seems on the following issues concerning the anon. I'll now look at those.</dd>
<dd>You first addressed the anon's handling of Henry V's will and the Duke of Orleans. You said the anon claimed that Henry's will held "legal force in Burgundy", therefore he was claiming that it directly affected Joan of Arc's circumstances. In the link you provided he never said anything like this. What he did say was the following. He said important prisoners were sometimes retained and he gave the case of the Duke of Orleans as one example which was rather similar to Joan of Arc's case. He never said that one case provided the legal basis for the other. It seems his point was that Joan of Arc was important enough that her enemies didn't want to allow her to obtain her freedom either. In your recent note you seemingly argued against this by saying that the Duke of Orleans was a "special case" who was retained only because he was so important, which makes it sound as if you're implying that Joan of Arc wasn't important enough to be retained like this Duke was. Didn't she have a significant effect on the war, much more than the relatively obscure Duke of Orleans in fact? Whatever their relative importance was, I can't find any statements from the anon saying what you thought he said. It's common in internet debates for misunderstandings to arise, and I think that's what happened in this case. Unless you feel he was dishonest for saying that Joan of Arc was likely considered too important to be allowed her freedom, I guess I don't understand why you charge him with dishonesty.</dd>
<dd>You then addressed the anon's handling of Charles VII's actions. You said (in summary) that the anon's citation of a letter from the University of Paris cannot be accepted as valid evidence of Charles VII's actions because this University was pro-English rather than pro-French and therefore could not have been acting on Charles VII's behalf. In the link you provided the anon never claimed this University was acting on Charles VII's behalf but rather that the University's letter mentions actions taken by Charles VII's government. The latter is not the same thing as the former. A letter can describe actions undertaken by an enemy ruler even though the letter's authors do not support him. I guess I don't understand how you're reading something different into this passage.</dd>
<dd>You then again charged him with dishonesty which you said was sufficient to undermine his credentials and credibility, which is a little hard to fathom. I'm sure you know that in order to make an allegation of this type against a real person by name you would need very substantial proof and there is no proof here. He clearly doesn't seem to be saying what you attribute to him, and it's an anonymous editor saying it.</dd>
<dd>You criticized me (and unnamed others) for our "good faith assumptions" about the anon and this organization but with all due respect I'm finding it increasingly difficult to see these allegations as anything other than a series of misunderstandings at best. We all tend to jump to conclusions in heated internet debates. Sometimes it's best to step back a bit.</dd>
<dd>A ban based on charges of sockpuppetry against whoever is behind the accounts might be justifiable, but all these other allegations against quite a sizable group of named individuals and their organization are frankly rather disturbing. If I had unlimited time and patience I could continue sifting through more of this type of thing, but since all the previous allegations have turned out quite clearly to be mistaken I would suggest it would be better to drop this portion of the matter. This has long since gone beyond a productive stage, especially since a siteban could be pursued by other means. <a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EEReference_8f71.html" title="User:EReference">EReference</a> 08:47, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>EReference, you raise a lot of points, most of which I won't respond to. However, you're slightly misrepresenting what I said. I didn't say that disclosing peer reviewers was "unethical", I said that what the publication did--not only disclosing peer reviewers, but using "peer reviewers" who are members of the organization, is not typical academic practice and wouldn't be done in legitimate scholarship. There's two reasons: first, the publication seems to be giving them credit as co-authors, but more importantly, these "peer reviewers" are not independent of the publisher. If you want to use the AMA as an analogy, what the "academy" is doing is like the editor in chief of the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i> writing an article and submitting it to two members of the editorial board for "peer review". If that article were published, you'd have no confidence that an independent assessment of the article's quality had been performed. Similarly, we shouldn't have any confidence that Virginia Frohlick and Margaret Walsh performed an impartial assessment of this publication, since they are members of the association that published the book--this is elementary conflict-of-interest stuff.</dd>

<dd>Whether or not other publications disclose the names of peer reviewers is less important than the fact that Frohlick and Walsh are not independent peer reviewers. However, I note that the <i>Digital Medievalist</i> is not a historical journal, but a journal about the use of technology in studying history--its practice isn't directly relevant to how peer review is used in historical scholarship. It's more relevant to look at journals like the <i>American Historical Review</i> or the <a href="http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journalrelatedinfo.cws_home/505591/preface1" class="external text" title="http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journalrelatedinfo.cws_home/505591/preface1" rel="nofollow"><i>Journal of Medieval History</i></a>, neither of which, I believe, disclose the names of referees. The <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i> does disclose peer reviewers, but <a href="http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/293/9/1125?ijkey=5a6c7e1226e226da9bf2bc9fa8dc77858e2e4572&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha" class="external text" title="http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/293/9/1125?ijkey=5a6c7e1226e226da9bf2bc9fa8dc77858e2e4572&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha" rel="nofollow">doesn't associate them with particular articles.</a></dd>

<dd>A more important issue than peer review is that none of the members of the Historical Academy (Association) for Joan of Arc Studies have the credentials we expect in a historical academy (association). Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think that even one of these members/contributors has an advanced degree in history or a related field, or a position at a college or university. We have seen evidence that they're amateur historians and devotees of Joan--this is fine, but the format of their publications is clearly designed to make readers think that they're getting the same kind of product they'd get from a university press, and that, I think, is misleading at best.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>...sigh... I was hoping we wouldn't have a repeat of previous allegations without much substance to back them up, but that is seemingly what has happened again. And it's late. I'm hoping my fatigue will excuse any mistakes or apparent irritability.</dd>
<dd>Akhilleus, you have repeated many of your previous charges against these people without addressing my comments very much. To reduce tedious repetition to a minimum I'll just cover the following topics. You stated that you aren't making allegations of unethical behavior but then proceeded to do precisely that by claiming that this publication violates basic standards of scholarship. The "conflict of interest" allegation and hypothetical analogy given to illustrate it was insufficient for many reasons. Among these would be the fact that the author in this case did not also serve as the editor (as in your analogy) and more significantly you entirely sidestepped the point I had made about JAMA's similar practice of publishing articles in which the author and peer reviewers all belong to the AMA. In other words, if you applied your argument consistently you would need to also dismiss the Journal of the American Medical Association, one of the most respected publications in any field. Rather than addressing this you instead switched the topic to JAMA's disclosure of peer reviewers, which was not the issue. Worse yet, you alleged that the publication was listing peer reviewers as "co-authors" whereas on the contrary the publication states otherwise by clearly labeling them peer reviewers. If you want me to view this as a good faith discussion then you need to stop doing this. You also need to show that your objections can be applied consistently. Namely, if you're going to reject this publication because the author and peer reviewers are members of the same association then you also need to reject JAMA and many others for doing the same. Do you reject JAMA because their authors and peer reviewers often all belong to the AMA? I think this is probably an important point.</dd>
<dd>The allegations you have raised against the people are again based on unsupported speculation. You ignored the members I had already noted who clearly do possess more standard credentials or positions. You sidestepped the point I had raised about Chris Snidow's book having been endorsed by someone who apparently is (correct me if I'm mistaken) a respected author and perhaps recognized authority in the field since one of Durova's links to a previous discussion uses one of her books as an apparently authoritative work on the subject (please correct me if I've missed something here). The publishing method for Snidow's book would not appear to be relevant because the book's content and the expert endorsement it received would not be outweighed by this factor or other objections you have raised.</dd>
<dd>There may well be some problems with this group but this current discussion isn't accomplishing anything. Nor is it directly related to the siteban issue, so I think it's time to move on. <a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EEReference_8f71.html" title="User:EReference">EReference</a> 09:28, 10 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>EReference, I haven't addressed most of your comments because I don't believe they're germane. For instance, it doesn't matter whether Snidow's book has been endorsed by Clin--it's still self-published, it still fails <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, and it in no way establishes that Snidow has an advanced degree in history or a position at a college or university. Similarly, nothing you've said about the other members of the Historical Association (Academy) for Joan of Arc Studies (HAJAS) has established that they have advanced degrees in history (or a related field) or positions at a college or university. The only member of the group that has a significant publication on Joan that's widely known among historians, Stephen Richey, is an independent scholar, not associated with a college or university. As far as I can tell, he doesn't have an advanced degree. To repeat myself, the members of this group don't have the credentials we'd expect from an academic association. They are, rather, enthusiasts and amateurs. There's absolutely nothing wrong with being an amateur, but the publications of such a group don't meet <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>.</dd>
<dd>Here's the byline on <i>Primary Sources and Context Concerning Joan of Arc's Male Clothing</i>: "Robert Wirth (editor), Virginia Frohlick (peer review), Margaret Walsh (peer review), Allen Williamson (authorial contribution and translation)". These credits imply collective authorship. Frohlick and Walsh are listed after an editor and before an author/translator; to me, this looks like they're getting equal credit for producing the work with Wirth and Williamson, i.e., they're basically co-authors. If I were to list this work in a bibliography, it would appear as "Wirth, Robert, ed., and Virginia Frohlick, Margaret Walsh, and Allen Williamson. 'Primary Sources...'", etc. If the intent is simply to acknowledge that Frohlick and Walsh were only peer reviewers and not authors, they should be listed in a separate line, or acknowledged in a footnote--most journal articles that I've read recently thank the anonymous referees in the first or last footnote of the article (and in all of those cases the referees remain anonymous, as in <a href="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0075-4269(2002)122%3C45%3ABM%3E2.0.CO%3B2-X" class="external text" title="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0075-4269(2002)122%3C45%3ABM%3E2.0.CO%3B2-X" rel="nofollow">this article in the <i>Journal of Hellenic Studies</i></a>). An additional point that needs to be raised is that since neither Frohlick nor Walsh have formal expertise in this field, there's no indication that they're qualified to perform peer review--we have no way of knowing whether they're familiar with scholarship on Joan of Arc or historical method in general.</dd>
<dd>What you're saying about the AMA is ridiculous. It's obvious why it's ok for ordinary members of the AMA to author and referee articles that appear in <i>JAMA</i>--they're not directly connected with the editorial board of the journal or the administration of the AMA. In contrast, Walsh is the president of HAJAS, Frohlick is Secretary-Treasurer, and Williamson is "Founding Director". If the president or founding director of the AMA published an article in <i>JAMA</i> and it was refereed by the secretary-treasurer, I think most people would see a problem. Now imagine if none of them had an M.D., yet the article were about the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. I think you'd lose some faith in the editorial standards of <i>JAMA</i> at that point...</dd>
<dd>Failing to meet the standards of legitimate scholarship isn't necessarily unethical. As Durova stated, most of the members of HAJAS are probably acting in good faith; but since they aren't professional scholars, they're unaware of the standards that should be met. However, if someone is aware of the proper editorial processes in publishing professional work in history, including peer review, and still presents HAJAS is a legitimate academic publisher, then I'd say there's a potential ethical problem. That's just one of the things Editor X is accused of. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 23:49, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok. Since you won't let this drop I'm going to analyze the latest spate of accusations. If nothing else it should show why other editors really need to check allegations more closely from now on.</dd>
<dd>You again alleged that this organization is not scholarly because its members fail WP:RS. You justified this in part by stating that Stephen Richey's book fails this test because he's an amateur without a university position. This is puzzling since a search of Wikipedia finds that this book is cited as a source several times in the main Joan of Arc article and the Joan of Arc Bibliography article. The edit histories of both show that these articles have been repeatedly edited by you yourself. With all due respect, this puzzling pattern begs the question: Did you object to this book before or only after it became apparent that the author was associated with this organization you're trying to discredit? In the first of these articles that book is not only cited but also extensively quoted in the text itself (for example, see this part <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joan_of_Arc_9b78.html#Rise" title="Joan of Arc">here</a>. This fact could hardly have been overlooked since entire passages from the book are included so prominently in the text. Clicking on previous versions from the edit history shows that they've been there a very long time without being removed.</dd>
<dd>The WP:RS standard has nothing to do with the wider issue of scholarly merit since WP:RS is a purely internal regulation which governs WP inclusion but does not necessarily affect someone's legitimacy as a scholar. Snidow's book clearly has merit because it was endorsed by an expert. Richey's book appears to have received good reviews from De Re Militari for example. A scholarly organization can be composed of independent scholars without violating any rule and indeed many of these organizations contain quite a few independent scholars. Wikipedia's RS rule would only be germane if you want to remove any of their books from WP articles, in which case Stephen Richey's would appear to be the chief one which would require removal.</dd>
<dd>I think your other criticisms are also clearly irrelevant or unfair. In brief: the publication clearly states that the peer reviewers are peer reviewers. Listing them in a single line may be nonstandard but since they are labeled quite clearly to indicate their function your criticism on this point is petty. Your treatment of my AMA analogy was unfair, since your objections (the closeness of one group's members) would essentially boil down to the difference in size between the organizations. You need to assume good faith and remember that we're dealing with a very small and new organization which cannot be expected to have the same degree of distance between members that an old and large organization like the AMA would have. If you look at other small scholarly societies such as the Marie de France Society I suspect you could find the same objections to make. It's a small close-knit group, the founding members still have prominent positions and all the members obviously know each other pretty well since their website includes a jovial tongue-in-cheek group photo of them gathered together. Surely their peer reviewers must belong to the same small group unless there are lots of other Marie de France scholars out there somewhere who could provide meaningful critiques for this very obscure subject. The point I was making with the AMA example was that if the AMA also allows its own members to provide peer review (the procedure which you're complaining about) then the only point of objection comes down to how well the participants know each other. This seems a senseless objection when applied to a very small group which is just starting out.</dd>
<dd>If your criticisms have merit then you will need to remove the quotations and endnote references to Stephen Richey's book from the Joan of Arc article. I'll leave that up to you. I've been trying to bring this discussion in here to a close because I think it has gone beyond the productive stage and is turning into a classic Usenet debate. But ending it is also up to you since you are the one making public accusations which I've been trying to balance against some analysis. Some balance is clearly needed I think. <a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EEReference_8f71.html" title="User:EReference">EReference</a> 09:52, 11 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm sorry, where did I say Richey's book fails <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>? Apparently a feature of a "classic Usenet debate" is the failure to read carefully. At any rate, it seems that none of the members of HAJAS have advanced degrees or have a position at a college or university--it's a group of amateur historians. So I can't see how it can be described as a scholarly society, or how its publications can be regarded as reliable sources.</dd>
<dd>Regarding the byline: when "'Primary Sources and Context Concerning Joan of Arc's Male Clothing" was added to <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joan_of_Arc_bibliography_7dcb.html" title="Joan of Arc bibliography">Joan of Arc bibliography</a> by an IP user (presumably Editor X), the author was given as "Robert Wirth et al." (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joan_of_Arc_bibliography&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=65561082" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joan_of_Arc_bibliography&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=65561082" rel="nofollow">this diff</a>). The same credit was given to another work published by HAJAS. So, I'm not the only one who thinks that Wirth, Frohlick, and Walsh are being given credit as co-authors--Editor X does also. Or, perhaps he just doesn't understand how bibliographies should be formatted, in which case I hope he's not doing any copyediting at HAJAS.</dd>
<dd>Last (and least important): why do you assume that the peer reviewers of HAJAS must be members of HAJAS? Is it because no one else would pay attention to their work? Perhaps a quote from <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peer_review.html" title="Peer review">peer review</a> is in order: "Typically referees are not selected from among the authors' close colleagues, students, or friends. Referees are supposed to inform the editor of any conflict of interests that might arise." HAJAS would be on better ground if it recruited peer reviewers who aren't members of the organization, and who are recognized experts--for instance, professors in history departments! This is the practice of most academic journals--they find referees who are experts in the subject that aren't members of the editorial board. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 03:39, 12 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You have said that these people lack degrees or university positions. A bit of digging would find that Margaret Walsh is/was a university professor. If I had time I could check others.</dd>
<dd>In your last post you denied having ever said that Stephen Richey's book fails WP:RS. In your post the day before that one, at 23:49 on 10 December 2006 you said the following: "Stephen Richey, is an independent scholar, not associated with a college or university. ....To repeat myself, the members of this group don't have the credentials we'd expect from an academic association... the publications of such a group don't meet WP:RS."</dd>
<dd>You quite clearly have said that Richey does not have the right credentials, by which I assume you would mean his book fails the standard you've been applying.</dd>
<dd>The rest of your comments probably require only brief observations. The method chosen by an anon at WP to list one of the group's books does not change the fact that this book quite clearly and explicitly does identify the peer reviewers as peer reviewers. Finally, I already cited examples of two other journals which also evidently use peer reviewers who belong to the same organization. Yet you do not criticize or dismiss these two for that practice.</dd>
<dd>I will ask again that you please allow this increasingly pointless discussion to finally drop. We both could be doing better things with our time. <a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EEReference_8f71.html" title="User:EReference">EReference</a> 09:27, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm admittedly coming into this discussion late &amp; perhaps after all is said &amp; done (sorry, I've been busy with personal affairs), but I would endorse that Durova has more than adequately performed due dilligence on this matter: there is something questionable about the sources <a href="../../../a/w/i/User%7EAWilliamson_c1f7.html" title="User:AWilliamson">AWilliamson</a>, et alia have been quoting. (I'm especially worried at AWilliam's sockpuppet's failure to provide bona fides to Adam Bishop (Adam's a real medieval scholar, &amp; could easily verify any personal information.) This is one of the problems that I would assert every Wikipedian worries about: wonky information being slipped into Wikipedia. (Remember the <a href="http://daveydweeb.com/2006/11/05/long-term-wikipedia-vandalism-exposed/" class="external text" title="http://daveydweeb.com/2006/11/05/long-term-wikipedia-vandalism-exposed/" rel="nofollow">NPA personality theory</a> article?) Durova deserves our thanks for her hard work uncovering this.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for EReference, I want to point out that any user who describes her/himself as "distinguished" more often than not does not deserve that title. Speaking from a few years of experience with Wikipedia, I'd say that there are a couple of dozen editors that this adjective could be applied to, but most of them have screwed up in one way or another in their time with Wikipedia. In short, one should never describe oneself or another Wikipedian as "distinguished" -- we have Barnstars that work just fine for that purpose. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 00:29, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Per <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFCU_026f.html#AWilliamson" title="WP:RFCU">WP:RFCU#AWilliamson</a>, EReference has been banned as a Williamson sock. I guess that about wraps things up for this thread although I consider it highly probable that Williamson will try other sockpuppets. He's been known to switch tactics before when the detectives are hot on his trail, so here's my best estimate based on the patterns I've noticed:
<ul>
<li>His underlying topics of interest will remain the same but he'll attempt to focus on pages where he estimates a good chance of avoiding scrutiny.</li>
<li>He'll probably disguise some characteristics, such as his past switches between registered accounts that bickered on talk pages and IPs that avoided talk pages and bickered via edit summaries.</li>
<li>POV pushing, deletion vandalism, and edit warring are likely to remain dominant characteristics. Also misleading edit summaries. Vague and evasive attempts to pose as an authoritative expert are also probable. His pet theories can be distinctive since they're bad OR, which makes him identifiable by comparison against past behavior.</li>

<dd>The issue you raised was already explained by another editor. I'm raising another and perhaps more important issue: administrators at this project periodically encounter users who devote a substantial portion of their time to POV advocacy. The specific POV varies by editor but the methods and techniques are remarkably similar - as are the trajectories these people follow. This project really isn't set up on an advocacy basis. In fact, as I express at <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_Recusal_792e.html" title="User:Durova/Recusal">User:Durova/Recusal</a>, it's best to avoid personal hot button issues whatever they may be. A lot of editors catch onto the spirit of this site and become respected Wikipedians. The ones who persist in advocacy have trouble with conflicts and policies until some sort of administrative action is necessary.</dd>
<dd>Step back a moment and ask yourself, if an editor whose POV you agreed with cited MySpace or a blog, would you have the integrity to delete the citation? Or if you're busy at a page where no other Wikipedian is active and you know there's another notable POV that disagrees with you on that subject, would you chase down a good citation to represent it?

<p>Yes, you raised different issues in an attempt to discredit me rather than address my complaint. <b>Is there a proper procedure for the deletion of articles, or is there not</b>. I would just add that I totally disagree that you're here to "document public debates". This is not the media. This appears to be Wikipedia's major flaw. <b>It is supposed to be an encylcopaedia</b>. I cannot think of any encyclopaedia anywhere which slants political and sensitive issues and groups in the very obvious left-wing way Wikipedia does. Locating the most extreme description of an organisation out of hundreds of less extreme comments and using the former as the only accurate "sourced" description is surely the most blatant piece of bias you'll find anywhere on the planet. You seem to agree with that. I do not. It seems you feel the only POV on Wikipedia is pushed by those you perceive on the Right who are raising valid points. That is your answer to them.</p>
<p>Please stick to the issue I first raised here. The arbitrary deletion of an article on a major Conservative pressure-group in the UK. <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChelsea_Tory_f648.html" title="User:Chelsea Tory">Chelsea Tory</a> 10:28, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Dear Mr. Pax, you are wrong. You asked me to show you your origin disputes which you said you did't have, and I showed it to you.

<p>OK. The article was initially nominated and I think deleted for being a non-notable resturaunt. However, I'm thinking it is notable, but the problem is with the way the name is transliterated(and the fact that there are multiple permutations of it) is that it is difficult to find material referring to it.. The user trying to protect the article from deletion cited these: <a href="http://www.paklinks.com/gs/archive/index.php/t-175827.html" class="external free" title="http://www.paklinks.com/gs/archive/index.php/t-175827.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.paklinks.com/gs/archive/index.php/t-175827.html</a> <a href="http://lahore.metblogs.com/archives/2006/11/lahores_seven_g.phtml" class="external free" title="http://lahore.metblogs.com/archives/2006/11/lahores_seven_g.phtml" rel="nofollow">http://lahore.metblogs.com/archives/2006/11/lahores_seven_g.phtml</a> <a href="http://www.pakistanimusic.com/lyrics/AliHaider-AaraPajama.txt" class="external free" title="http://www.pakistanimusic.com/lyrics/AliHaider-AaraPajama.txt" rel="nofollow">http://www.pakistanimusic.com/lyrics/AliHaider-AaraPajama.txt</a> <a href="http://www.chowk.com/show_user_replies.cgi?membername=Romair&amp;start=630&amp;end=639&amp;page=64&amp;chapter=7" class="external free" title="http://www.chowk.com/show_user_replies.cgi?membername=Romair&amp;start=630&amp;end=639&amp;page=64&amp;chapter=7" rel="nofollow">http://www.chowk.com/show_user_replies.cgi?membername=Romair&amp;start=630&amp;end=639&amp;page=64&amp;chapter=7</a> <a href="http://www.readysteadybook.com/BookReview.aspx?isbn=0060740426" class="external free" title="http://www.readysteadybook.com/BookReview.aspx?isbn=0060740426" rel="nofollow">http://www.readysteadybook.com/BookReview.aspx?isbn=0060740426</a> and a small mention in a local(for Lahore, anyway) magazine, <a href="http://64.233.161.104/search?q=cache:sdMp3lgYsxoJ:www.newsline.com.pk/Newsdec2003/lifedec2003.htm+phajja+lahore&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=2" class="external free" title="http://64.233.161.104/search?q=cache:sdMp3lgYsxoJ:www.newsline.com.pk/Newsdec2003/lifedec2003.htm+phajja+lahore&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=2" rel="nofollow">http://64.233.161.104/search?q=cache:sdMp3lgYsxoJ:www.newsline.com.pk/Newsdec2003/lifedec2003.htm+phajja+lahore&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=2</a></p>
<p>I'm not sure if it's enough to prove notability, but it's enough to make it debatable..

<p>I'm quickly bringing this up here as a) the "victim" (and after reviewing the situation I too) have msged the admin involved with no reponse and b) I believe it to be so cut and dried that dragging it through the drawn out <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">DRV</a> process is not needed. Essentially, the Pornotube article has been created and deleted three times before, twice under <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#A7" title="WP:CSD">A7</a> and once as an unchallenged {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}}. Today <a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKane5187_315f.html" title="User:Kane5187">Kane5187</a> created it, and it was quickly speedy deleted by <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a>, with the deletion summary <i>nn website</i>. I happen to see the authors complaints on Zoe's page (Kane5187 was then told <i>"Claims of notability were not cited with reliable sources."</i> and that the article was a recreation of previously deleted material.</p>
<p>For a start, the previously articles were literally one line, specifically:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Pornotube</b> is a video search engine which plays <a href="../../../p/o/r/Pornographic.html" title="Pornographic">pornographic</a> videos similar to <a href="../../../y/o/u/Youtube.html" title="Youtube">Youtube</a>.</p>

Apart from being literally ten times the size of that version, Kane's article stated, and was referenced;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Little more than two months after its creation, PornoTube is already one of the most visited adult sites in the world [1].</p>

<dd>I dunno, at the risk of sounding like a process wonk, take it to DRV... you'll have my "vote" to undelete. It shouldn't have been speedy deleted.

<dd>Well, if we were <i>really</i> a process wonk, then it would be clear to see that this was an out-of-process deletion that should be reversed (pending community consensus)&#160;:) I personally just think Zoe was a little quick on the trigger.

<p>I just want to clarify something: I only created one version, the most recently deleted one. I first got involved when I ran across the PornoTube article created by someone else, made an edit or two, went away and came back to find it gone. I checked the log and didn't think that "<i>nn website</i>" qualified for deletion, so I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zoe&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=94658725" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zoe&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=94658725" rel="nofollow">voiced</a> my concerns at Zoe's talk. Zoe responded with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKane5187&amp;diff=94658958&amp;oldid=90578061" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKane5187&amp;diff=94658958&amp;oldid=90578061" rel="nofollow">this</a>, which I didn't feel justified a delete, as I indicated when I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zoe&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=94661737" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zoe&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=94661737" rel="nofollow">responded</a> again, expressing my intent to recreate the article. At that point, I wanted to create an article that was without a shadow of a doubt a notable and verifiable article -- and I backed up a copy of it, pre-deletion, here. So, anyway, I just wanted to clarify that I only created one new article, but was involved in the dispute over two deletions. <a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKane5187_315f.html" title="User:Kane5187">Dylan</a> 18:11, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The cited 'source' for the sites notability is just saying it has an alexa rank of 300. Other than that it makes no other claims.. and mostly just sounds like a paid advertisement, it's also in a section of the site which appears to have many such paid advertisements. Alexa data is worse than useless.. anyone can easily fake out the publicly available alexa data and they don't make much of an effort to stop it. If the site is as notable as it's being claimed to be, we'd have more indicators than alexa.--<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 20:17, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>A subject not being notable is not a reason for speedy deletion. You can only speedy delete if the article doesn't assert notability. This one clearly did, so it should be undeleted.

<p>This article should not have been speedied. There are a good selection of notable sources which discuss the site such as those mentioned on the article before it was deleted and ones such as <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,70627-0.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,70627-0.html" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/07/25/youtube-has-porn-clone/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/07/25/youtube-has-porn-clone/" rel="nofollow">[39]</a> (It is a blog, but a very notable one - see their about page), <a href="http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2161094/porn-copy-youtube-launched" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2161094/porn-copy-youtube-launched" rel="nofollow">[40]</a> etc...

<dd>Well, one of the criteria for <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#repost" title="WP:CSD">CSD G4</a> is that the content must be largely the same (and in fact, the administrator is instructed to "ensure that the material is substantially identical and not merely a new article on the same subject"). The previous speedy deletions were okay because those versions did not assert notability. The version you deleted did, and was a completely different article from the previous deletions. Not criticizing, I've certainly made similar mistakes where I didn't look close enough, just explaining why you're "getting heat". —<a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell"><b><font color="#333333">bbatsell</font></b></a> <a href="../../../b/b/a/User_talk%7EBbatsell_7978.html" title="User talk:Bbatsell"><font color="#C46100" size="1">¿?</font></a> 05:38, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

Well yesterday was no different and it looks like that the previous comments by the admin had no effect on him. The only thing that did change was that <a href="../../../s/t/a/WP%7ESTALK_e55b.html" title="WP:STALK">WP:STALK</a> is now not the only policy that KPbIC is violating. Now he is using his open vigilantism (even though he is not an admin) to challenge the <a href="../../../n/c/%28/WP%7ENC%28UE%29_41c6.html" title="WP:NC(UE)">WP:NC(UE)</a> policies for the English name of <a href="../../../k/i/e/Kiev.html" title="Kiev">Kiev</a>, and combining the two into one: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ukrainian_Beer_Lovers_Party&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=94811835" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ukrainian_Beer_Lovers_Party&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=94811835" rel="nofollow">[41]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ukrainian_postal_codes&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=94812073" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ukrainian_postal_codes&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=94812073" rel="nofollow">[42]</a>. Like I said before, this user has his own understanding of what wikipedia is and with a silly alibi (it does make one chuckle reading his explanations on the archived topic, the refrences to the big and evil "russifiers") he is openly stalking and harassing me and other users and completely disregarding wikipedia guidelines. Like I said before, I do not wish to commence the suggested time-consuming <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAr_9ea1.html" title="WP:RFAr">WP:RFAr</a>, hence why I once again ask that someone talk some sense into this disruptive user.--<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKuban_kazak_c2e3.html" title="User:Kuban kazak">Kuban Cossack</a> 14:29, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>One again, <a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKuban_kazak_c2e3.html" title="User:Kuban kazak">Kuban kazak</a>, I'm asking you to leave your Russification spirit out of Wikipedia, and start to do something constructive.

There is no need to substitute each and every instance of Kyiv to Kiev, unless you want to be involved in trolling, harassment, disrespect of other contributors, or being uncivil.

<dd>Well I'll just link to my response on the Russification charge (which has no basis) in the archive. However what you self-interpret as right and the vigilante stance you take is hardly acceptable to wikipedia. Once again I am telling you to back off, write articles and leave other users alone. Kiev is an <b>ENGLISH</b> spelling of the city that was decided upon by a lengthy consensus on the talk page, and hence, by wikipolicies that you have never read, it applies to the whole of en-wiki! So drop off the stalking, the harrassment and the vigilantism, as you are no admin to make such decisions, before I go through the <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAr_9ea1.html" title="WP:RFAr">WP:RFAr</a>. So far not a single admin told me that what I am doing is <b>wrong!</b>, and I do not need an alibi such as insulted national pride to base my edits on. --<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKuban_kazak_c2e3.html" title="User:Kuban kazak">Kuban Cossack</a> 23:50, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Amendments to a guideline should be discussed on its talk page, not on a new page — although it's generally acceptable to edit a guideline to improve it.

If, however, you compare the citations that he/she has falsified to the actual citations in the article, you'll see that the information he/she is posting is incorrect.

<p>Of course Roman Dog Bird hasn't vandalized since his last warning -- but only because he keeps receiving more and more warnings instead of being blocked. He received a test2 on the 15th <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Roman_Dog_Bird&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=94413659" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Roman_Dog_Bird&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=94413659" rel="nofollow">[49]</a>, a bv on the 15th <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Roman_Dog_Bird&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=94413659" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Roman_Dog_Bird&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=94413659" rel="nofollow">[50]</a>, at test3 on the on the 16 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Roman_Dog_Bird&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=94415563" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Roman_Dog_Bird&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=94415563" rel="nofollow">[51]</a>, and yet another test3 on the 17th <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Roman_Dog_Bird&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=94636345" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Roman_Dog_Bird&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=94636345" rel="nofollow">[52]</a>. Whatever constructive edits Roman Dog Bird has made, they are far outweighed by his extensive vandalism. Since his account is older than 4 days, Roman Dog Bird can vandalize semi-protected pages. It would be advisable to block Roman Dog Bird, to prevent him from engaging in even more vandalism. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn254_98f8.html" title="User:John254">John254</a> 02:25, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The user is clearly causing more damage than benefit, I agree. But still, he abid by the last warning, that makes a block rather unfair and unnecessary atm. I think it's preferable to closely monitor him and block immediately if he vandalizes again.--<strong><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_60c3.html" title="User:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">Hús</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_Esperanza_ea94.html" title="User:Husond/Esperanza"><font color="green">ö</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User_talk%7EHusond_a306.html" title="User talk:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">nd</font></a></strong> 02:51, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Roman Dog Bird might not be blocked immediately after his next act of vandalism. If an editor gives Roman Dog Bird yet another test3 after his next act of vandalism, and I request that Roman Dog Bird be blocked, say, sixteen hours later, we're going to be back here debating whether Roman Dog Bird should actually be blocked, because, after all, he did stop after his last warning, and the account is presently inactive. This sort of nonsense could continue for weeks, unless Roman Dog Bird is actually blocked, irrespective whether he presently appears to be active, and whether he has vandalized after his "last" warning. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn254_98f8.html" title="User:John254">John254</a> 03:05, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If this user's misdemeanors are not detected in 16 hours then he probably isn't causing damage enough to have someone on <a href="../../../r/c/p/WP%7ERCP_b874.html" title="WP:RCP">RCP</a> notice him. Once again, I reiterate that the user is respecting a last warning that was given to him and therefore a block is unnecessary at this time.

<dd>Roman Dog Bird's edits are being noticed and reverted, long before 16 hours. The problem is that editors are simply issuing additional warnings each time he vandalizes, instead of immediately reporting him on <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>. Roman Dog Bird has been slipping through the cracks for far too long, and should really be blocked indefinitely. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn254_98f8.html" title="User:John254">John254</a> 03:39, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, I have put him on the RC channel's blacklist, just so we can see if he continues to edit maliciously.

<li>He's clearly revert-warring without reference to the talk page. That he's four minutes outside 24 hours is frankly beside the point.

<ul>
<li>Endorse as well. There's no reason we should encourage edit warring. Once people revert more than once you already have an issue. <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> overrides such technicalities of four minutes. <a href="../../../c/o/w/User%7ECowman109_5ea9.html" title="User:Cowman109"><font color="DarkGreen">Cowman109</font></a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/w/User_talk%7ECowman109_260b.html" title="User talk:Cowman109">Talk</a></sup> 21:55, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>My reasoning for the block was that for someone who has been blocked for 3RR before, 4 reverts in 24 hours <i>and 4 minutes</i> is simply gaming, and, compounded by the incivility, the block was valid and uncontroversial. 3RR is not an entitlement to edit war. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>•<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 21:57, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

First; if anybody worked "against consensus", it was in fact Amoruso. Only three editors worked on the article at the time; two of us were in agreement, and Amoruso disagreed with the two of us. Secondly; I found Amoruso extremely incivil, e.g saying I made "outright lie"s, etc., which I find <i>very</i> offensive.

<li><b>Endorse</b>. <i>In general</i>, I believe once a block is reversed on an editor, it should not be reinstated. Assume good faith, prevent edit wars, make the administrators look more consistent. &#160;:) However, there are too many other issues with this particular editor and I believe a 48 hour block is justified.

<li>I respectfully disagree. I know this is not a popular opinion and although I do not support Amoruso's every edit (in this case, I wish he had waited and not called his opponent a vandal). Please let's keep in mind that we deal with the area of WP inundated with daily attacks of all kinds. In his defense, I'd like to point out that Amoruso usually does discuss his edits on the talk pages and is far from being the worst violator of WP policies. ←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a> <sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">ну</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Humus_sapiens_ea7b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Humus sapiens">?</a></sup> 01:26, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Agreed. Since we discuss technicalities here, 24 hrs is 24 hrs - I saw users casually being forgiven for reverts made over period longer than 24 hrs.

<li>I've edited on the same pages as Amoruso for quite awhile now. Like Humus, I don't endorse every edit he has ever made, but I completely disagree with Steve Hart and Palmiro that he should be singled out for censure and criticism. I would ask you Steve, when you make the list yo mention, to look at ALL parties concerned and their behavior as well as Amoruso's. It obviously takes more than one editor to make an edit war. Amoruso is interested in some very contentious pages. These pages are also plagued with frequent vandalism. The general contentiousness of his topics of interest, and the way MANY OF US deal with them, are at the root of the problem. Given the contentiousness of the topics, we would all do well to pay very close attention to WP policies about NPOV, civility and assuming good faith (note to self and others). Singling out one editor for severe censure is not as helpful to the project as learning to compromise, to state things neutrally, to allow more than one pov on a particular page. <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EElizmr_0824.html" title="User:Elizmr">Elizmr</a> 01:52, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Editors are judged on their own edits, the misbehaviour of other editors is not an excuse for violating the rules. I'm not going to include other editors as I'm not involved in the case, but do report them if you want. Your wise words about NPOV and civility is actually the root of the problem, since this user has a longtime history of <i>not</i> adhering to these policies.

<dd>Wow, Palmiro, this is a <b>strong personal attack against Amoruso</b> and I feel you should retract it. I'm quite familar with <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalestineRemembered_d4da.html" title="User:PalestineRemembered">User:PalestineRemembered</a>'s editorial history. This user ran afoul of many core Wikipedia policies including <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> on many occasions. Please refer to the history of her talk page to see the lack of any development as an editor in terms of adherance to policy or "culture" in terms of civility, etc. In terms of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, she accused everyone who ever disagreed with her of poor faith, attacking her personally, etc. She once accused me of trying to get her to make a racist remarks. In terms of her understanding of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, she once said that "infidels" had no place editing pages in English Wikipedia that have to do with Islam. Saying that only one class of EDITORS should be editing on a particular topic raises a very red flag when it comes to her participation in this project. Finally, her understanding and implementation of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> was completely lacking. Calling non-Muslim editors "infidels" and refusing to retract that remark was highly uncivil. She did not even attempt to be CIVIL to anyone she considered a "Zionist" (which was basically a curse word to her). If you are going to compare Amoruso to this woman, you are way way off base. (Also please note that many editors who share PRs viewpoints are great Wikipedia editors and I very much enjoy working with them, but she was not by any criteria a good editor). <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EElizmr_0824.html" title="User:Elizmr">Elizmr</a> 00:07, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Oppose block per Humus and Elizmr. It also seems to me that if the "3RR" is going to be applied the way some people are applying it, the reference to 24 hours should be eliminated from the policy page. If the rule is really that you can't revert more than three times in an unspecified time frame as determined subjectively by an administrator after the situation has occurred, let's say so. <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 02:16, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Endorse, <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">User:Dmcdevit</a>'s judgement was correct.

<li>Oppose block per Humus, Elizmr and 6SJ7. Amoroso was not violating 3RR so the reverse of the block was correct. I agree also with Humus that he has thrown himself into the maelstrom of some very contentious pages and that there needs to be evenhandedness here. I've personally stopped editing some contentious pages involving religion because the arguing is endless and never resolved. He might want to step back from some of this editing but I think that singling him out for severe censure is not warranted.--<a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMantanmoreland_c701.html" title="User:Mantanmoreland">Mantanmoreland</a> 03:05, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Edit warring in general is discouraged.

This is false and it should be clarified that edit warring is bad, without specific reference to the numerical requirements of 3RR. <tt class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">Khoi</a><a href="../../../k/h/o/User_talk%7EKhoikhoi_f6d5.html" title="User talk:Khoikhoi">khoi</a></tt> 03:34, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> I'm disappointed to see several editors who share Amoruso's political viewpoints, to the extent that a couple of them has exchanged barnstars with him, suddenly comes out in support. Editors should not value political leanings over rules and procedures. And I don't think edit warring with a sock puppet changes the facts of the case, unless he <i>knew</i> it was a sockpuppet, in which case he should have reported him instead of revert warring.

<dd>Moshe's right; just because it a number editors who have 'exchanged barnstars'with Amoruso are supporting him in this does not mean that we can assume that it is their shared viewpoints that lead them to do so.

</ul>
<ul>
<li>a tendency of being uncivil on talk pages, e.g.: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Holiest_sites_in_Islam&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=91751102" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Holiest_sites_in_Islam&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=91751102" rel="nofollow">[64]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Mossad&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=91535639" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Mossad&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=91535639" rel="nofollow">[65]</a></li>

<li>consistently removing warnings on own talk page, e.g: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Amoruso&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=91753902" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Amoruso&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=91753902" rel="nofollow">[66]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Amoruso&amp;diff=90421924&amp;oldid=90421388" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Amoruso&amp;diff=90421924&amp;oldid=90421388" rel="nofollow">[67]</a>, including removing an olive branch response by one editor addressed not to him, but to a third editor: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Amoruso&amp;diff=89730227&amp;oldid=89727861" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Amoruso&amp;diff=89730227&amp;oldid=89727861" rel="nofollow">[68]</a></li>

<li>and finally, what I read, perhaps wrongfully, as a suggestion to editors of WikiProject Israel to take the edit wars over <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a> to other country articles in the region, I quote: <i>"See the concerns over Talk:Israel#Permanent semi-protection. I wonder how we can address the issue that Israel's article will be attacked fervently but it seems that nobody is concerned with articles concerning Syria, Jordan, Egypt, Iran... ... I feel that this line of thought is an attack on Israel's sovregnity as state and I just wonder if there can be some perspective or edits by us on other country articles in the region atleast to attempt to balance the heavy and undue bias."</i>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Israel&amp;diff=80776232&amp;oldid=80637346" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Israel&amp;diff=80776232&amp;oldid=80637346" rel="nofollow">[69]</a> (partial quote)</li>

<p>I should provide additional diffs on request. I briefly wrote about this editor's behaviour three months ago, here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_massacres_committed_during_the_1948_Arab-Israeli_war&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=69252906" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_massacres_committed_during_the_1948_Arab-Israeli_war&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=69252906" rel="nofollow">[70]</a>. There was a brief discussion on AN/I last month which involved the editor and a bad faith request to have a page unprotected: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive149#Bad_faith_behavior_by_Shamir1_and_Amoruso_.28continued.29" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive149#Bad_faith_behavior_by_Shamir1_and_Amoruso_.28continued.29" rel="nofollow">[71]</a>. You should note that I was involved in a dispute with the editor in August <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Palestinian_exodus&amp;diff=70328663&amp;oldid=70317098" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Palestinian_exodus&amp;diff=70328663&amp;oldid=70317098" rel="nofollow">[72]</a>, but I also received some kind words from him <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Palestinian_exodus&amp;diff=70330221&amp;oldid=70328663" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Palestinian_exodus&amp;diff=70330221&amp;oldid=70328663" rel="nofollow">[73]</a>. I'm generally not editing the same articles as him, we crossed paths as I was working on the NPOV backlog.</p>
<p>People are allowed to hold strong opinions and still edit articles. But it doesn't exempt them from following rules. In this case we're dealing with a user who for a long time has replaced well sourced material with text and links to partisan sites, is edit warring when other editors objects and often resort to calling those who disagree with him vandals.</p>
<p>This user has been subject to every attempt of dispute resolution except ArbCom, so it would be nice with some discussion on AN/I. I believe that this kind of behaviour is out of line and has been allowed to go on for too long. While I wouldn't call for a ban myself, I do think that the editor needs a break from editing Israel-Palestine related articles, at least for a month or more. -- <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_Hart_8ceb.html" title="User:Steve Hart">Steve Hart</a> 09:34, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Steve, it appears to me that Amoruso's responses to your specific allegations are more than adequate, and that in general this has the feel of a personal issue, rather than an AN/I issue. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 21:15, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So you feel it's ok to delete material which is relevant to an article and properly cited to reliable sources? Or to include material based on partisan sources, even over the objections of other editors? In that case we will never agree. Yes, this is personal issue, but in the sense that I'm tired of seeing propaganda in articles. This is either an encyclopedia or not an encyclopedia.

<p>Steve Hart, I believe I completlely refuted your claims. Saying I deleted material which is relevant to an article is simply a false statement. Partisan sources is your POV in the matter, it's a regular content dispute - I and others believe it's a very valid source , and frankly if we take the Lebanon flag example your allegations seem to have been made in bad faith. You couldn't have missed the original user who explained that Lebanon wasn't a combatant and removed the flag before me, and you couldn't really have missed the user who added the flag who admitted his mistake and even apologised. One would think you chose that example to make a quick slur which people won't check, and it's disturbing. I want to assume <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good faith</a> here and I hope you won't resort to this again. I hope we can continue happilly as fellow wikipedians now.

<ul>
<li>removing the flag of Lebanon from the article 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict</li>
</ul>
<p>Too bad Steve Hart didn't (hmm.) go a bit further and saw that the user who placed the Lebanon flag admitted he was mistaken. Lebanon wasn't a combatant in the conflict and therefore the flag was out of place. The editor who placed the flag removed it himself. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2006_Israel-Lebanon_conflict&amp;diff=92882662&amp;oldid=92882253" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2006_Israel-Lebanon_conflict&amp;diff=92882662&amp;oldid=92882253" rel="nofollow">[75]</a></p>
<ul>
<li>page move, moving Sirhan Sirhan (militant) to Sirhan Sirhan (murderer)</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, I did. Murder is NOT <a href="../../../w/t/a/WP%7EWTA_2564.html" title="WP:WTA">WP:WTA</a> as far as I know concerning someone who murdered a whole family. Perhaps Steve Hart can explain us how is such a person a militant&#160;? A militant could belong to an organization like HAMAS or Islamic Jihad MAYBE but this person was acting SOLO. So perhaps Steve Hart wants us to change the definitons of Criminal Law&#160;? This page was not a page in contention and no edit war or reverts took place.</p>
<ul>
<li>deleting material properly sourced to BBC: [134], ABC News: [135], PBS, others; blanking text in references: [136]</li>
</ul>
<p>Did I&#160;? I would like to remind Steve Hart that Blanking = vandalism and that's harsh accusation <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">incivil one</a> and he should avoid that ASAP. This was according to policy, another banned user pushing this, not Timshifter apparently possibly (who got 3RR for this) but BlueDome (actually another sock-puppet of the banned user in question ) and policy explained here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Taba_Summit&amp;diff=92731694&amp;oldid=92203167" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Taba_Summit&amp;diff=92731694&amp;oldid=92203167" rel="nofollow">[76]</a> and here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Taba_Summit&amp;diff=91774716&amp;oldid=91755921" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Taba_Summit&amp;diff=91774716&amp;oldid=91755921" rel="nofollow">[77]</a> by many users.

<ul>
<li>a tendency of being uncivil on talk pages, e.g. [139] [140]</li>
</ul>
<p>none of the two example seem to be incivil. Actually, the Paranoia remark seems very light-hearted and a <a href="../../../l/o/v/WP%7ELOVE_328a.html" title="WP:LOVE">WP:LOVE</a> behaviour if anything, just jokingly. If someone got offended by it, I'd apologise of course. In fact, like Steve Hart said I (wrongly it seems) was particulary civil to him too even though he deleted material of mine.

<ul>
<li>consistently removing warnings on own talk page, e.g: [141] [142], including removing an olive branch response by one editor addressed not to him, but to a third editor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ah, the ol' "don't remove from your page" think. Have you looked on other user talk pages at any chance&#160;? Are you seriously pushing this allegation&#160;? Note that the alleged olive branch response was made by <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalestineRemembered_d4da.html" title="User:PalestineRemembered">user:PalestineRemembered</a> a user now banned for 1 month for disruptive behavoiour on people's user pages. Seems Hart is missing a whole lot of information here. The timeshifter allegation was addressed already above - it was completely inappropriate and therefore removed.</p>
<ul>
<li>and finally, what I read, perhaps wrongfully...</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, you read that wrongfully. The topic on hand was how leads should be written for country articles. I suggested we try to reinstate some format into this in the name of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. I feel it's my right to discuss such issues with my fellow wikipedians at the project page&#160;? There was no malice or ill-intent there, just concern to make Israel on par with other country articles.</p>
<p>Steve Hart notes that he was involved in a dispute with me back in August. That's true. In fact, this seems to be what it's all about. Steve Hart not just disputed but edit-warred over that page and reverted constantly and was also warned about it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Steve_Hart&amp;diff=70529999&amp;oldid=70449788" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Steve_Hart&amp;diff=70529999&amp;oldid=70449788" rel="nofollow">[79]</a>. He also wanted to ban me from the head-start which was almost a threat and perhaps a violation of <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a> - "<i>Frankly, I'm not sure you will be allowed to edit for much longer if you are to go on like this</i>" and didn't seem to be concerned of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> issues <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Amoruso&amp;diff=70297456&amp;oldid=70297103" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Amoruso&amp;diff=70297456&amp;oldid=70297103" rel="nofollow">[80]</a>.

Finally, his repeated violations of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> saying that other users are biased towards me for political reasons even though this has just been contradicted by a good faith editor who disagrees with my political opinions completely and utterly.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=93787343&amp;oldid=93787303" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=93787343&amp;oldid=93787303" rel="nofollow">[82]</a> Another proof of Steve Hart's agenda which revolved again over his war edit in August can be found again on this noticeboard.

Blocking a single user is not going to stop pro-Israel and anti-Israel editors from carrying on the Middle East conflict in the form of edit warring on Wikipedia articles. Rather, it might be advisable to identify the articles suffering from the worst pro-Israel/anti-Israel revert warring, and instead of fully protecting them, community banning the editors most involved in the revert warring from editing those specific articles for a period of several months. Unlike outright blocking, temporarily banning the editors responsible for the revert warring on a per-page basis would allow such editors to continue to contribute to any other articles that they could edit in a constructive manner. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn254_98f8.html" title="User:John254">John254</a> 01:52, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm going by what Fred Bauder reported in the diff that I posted above because I understand that Fred has a lot of credibility on Wikipedia. If he's wrong on what he reported, then of course I retract and apologize to Mantamoreland for presenting false evidence that he used sock puppets in the past. Let me make it clear, that even though Fred presents evidence that Mantanmoreland was using sock-puppetry in the past, I'm not accusing Mantanmoreland and Amoruso of being the same person right now. I realize I need to apologize to Mantanmoreland also for implying that. I'll expressly state it: I apologize to Mantanmoreland for implying that he and Amoruso are sock puppets of the same person. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7ECla68_4b38.html" title="User:Cla68">Cla68</a> 06:18, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think since those characters are against the MOS, a bot could watch the newly created articles for such charactes and put them in a catagory for review. Then we can move the legit one's and delete the less than legit one's.

<dd>That's a good idea. Any Unicode that shows up in article titles is worth watching, and if someone good with bot-fu wants to tackle the job, it would be most welcome.

<dd>Sounds good, but wouldn't it make sense to have the bot flag only article names that contain Unicode characters that are <i>visually similar</i> to common characters? I'll wager a wild guess and say that the review category would otherwise be full of false positives, e.g. article names containing German <a href="../../../u/m/l/Umlaut_%28diacritic%29.html" title="Umlaut (diacritic)">umlauts</a>, French <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diacritic.html" title="Diacritic">accents</a> etc. (or are these not Unicode characters?) <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 21:48, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>All of the accented characters used in English, French, German, Spanish, and the Scandinavian languages are in the basic character set. When you go further afield, then you have to get into Unicode, but it's a very small fraction of the total number of new articles. Yes, the category will probably still have a bunch of false positives, but I don't think it will get <i>that</i> many hits in total.</dd>

<dd>Actually, my first set of tests show way too many false positives when searching for Unicode characters.

<p>Note that MediaWiki already has a feature that disallows mixed-script usernames and names that may look too similar to existing one.

I'm not involved with the articles in dispute, and I've had no interaction with this user prior to my warning him for the first case. I've blocked him for 24 hours. Can I ask other uninvolved admins to review his edits and alter his block length as y'all see fit.

<dd>Endorse.
