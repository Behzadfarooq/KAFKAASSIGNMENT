<p>Now that <a href="../../../a/w/i/User%7EAWilliamson_c1f7.html" title="User:AWilliamson">AWilliamson</a> is community banned as the sockmaster of the <a href="../../../l/o/n/Wikipedia%7ELong_term_abuse_53c2.html#Joan_of_Arc_vandal" title="Wikipedia:Long term abuse">Joan of Arc vandal</a> I have a query about whether there's still a conflict of interest reason for me to refrain from banning his sockpuppets. So far I've touched only one: an impersonation account <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova._6bc6.html" title="User:Durova.">User:Durova.</a> that deleted archive contents of Williamson's prior talk page wars. Some of those socks have been inactive for many months but other suspected socks remain disruptive at Williamson's other interest points: cross-dressing, homosexuality, and Catholicism. In particular I noticed <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFCU_026f.html#CC80" title="WP:RFCU">WP:RFCU#CC80</a> this evening - a declined request whose other named accounts don't look like red flags for Williamson socks to me - but the edit history for <a href="../../../c/c/8/User%7ECC80_50a2.html" title="User:CC80">CC80</a> is classic Williamson activity. I've suspected the account of being a sock since September when it edit warred to delete a link from <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joan_of_Arc_9b78.html" title="Joan of Arc">Joan of Arc</a>.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joan_of_Arc&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=72620242" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joan_of_Arc&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=72620242" rel="nofollow">[1]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joan_of_Arc&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=72620242" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joan_of_Arc&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=72620242" rel="nofollow">[2]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joan_of_Arc&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=73549680" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joan_of_Arc&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=73549680" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> My long investigation probably puts me in the best position to identify his socks - I'd checkuser anything that's dubious.

<dd>There are no conflicts of interest with banned users. There are no conflicts of interest simply because an abusive user declares one. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 07:09, 16 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Then here's my second question: I'd like to notify the relevant Wikiprojects for these other subjects because I suspect he'll attempt to dodge enforcement by hopping between socks and different articles. Those project participants would be more likely to spot that behavior than I would. The only catch is where to send them to report such a complex case. <a href="../../../r/f/i/WP%7ERFI_2cc3.html" title="WP:RFI">WP:RFI</a> doesn't normally handle sockpuppet investigations. Since I know this case in so much depth, would it be appropriate to refer new reports directly to my user talk?</dd>
<dd>And BTW I don't think this user has claimed I have a conflict of interest. I want to proceed in a way that proves I've been fair and honest in case some future troublemaker ever tries to claim I acted improperly. Since I do a lot of investigations I field spurious misconduct allegations fairly often. I'm open to recall so I want to cover all my bases.

<dd>I've updated that in the last day. After giving this a lot of thought and asking for input I've decided to put my name forward as the primary investigating admin (and contact point). By the way, the only <a href="../../../g/o/a/Goa_Inquisition_ad45.html" title="Goa Inquisition">Goa Inquisition</a> editor that's been confirmed as a Williamson sock is <a href="../../../c/c/8/User%7ECC80_50a2.html" title="User:CC80">CC80</a>. <font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charg</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><span style="color:#0c0">e!</span></a></i></sup></font> 14:16, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I see several possible approaches. One, enlist another sysop to take over. Two, enlist a couple of admins to review your work and handle appeals. Three, document the heck out of each action you take - specifically the reasoning behind each action. This leaves the door open for peer review and is probably the most practical. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 14:38, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If any of these suspected socks appeals a ban I'll be ready with evidence, although this user's long and creative career makes it slow reading to even review the documentation, much less replace me (I wouldn't wish this on anyone). I suppose my long hours of work on the case are far from ended. <font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charg</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><span style="color:#0c0">e!</span></a></i></sup></font> 15:25, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, Alan, we all know that there are old sites that list the image as copyright Mr. Chung. That is not the point. The PMO has specificially said that the image is their's on August 8, 2006 regardless of what some pages on the House of Commons web site said.

<dd>The problem is they are getting the release from the Prime Minister's Office, when there are 2 urls that show it belongs to Herman Chung and one that says House of Commons. The PMO is separate from the House of Commons and the 2 Herman Chung references are on the parliamentary web site. I'm new to this kind of dispute, but I would think we would have to see them remove the Herman Chung notice or provide a release from Herman Chung. Additionally, the PMO isn't the right place to contact for a release, it's the House of Commons. I did e-mail them regarding this issue, but I have not received a response yet. I had contacted &lt;infonetATparlDOTgcDOTca&gt; on Dec. 14/06 <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 02:42, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>By your logic <i>anyone</i> could make us get their permission for <i>any</i> image just by putting it on their homepage and writing "© Me" below it.

<p>For the record, the image name probably needs adjustment, once everything is sorted I will be pushing for the name to be changed on commons and making the change to using articles here.

I just don't want to start re-protecting in the middle of the wide-spread change unless it's a serious situation, because it may cause hard feelings and the best way to proceed from here is to simply bring the matter to discussion.

<dd>I agree with many of these unprotections (particularly for templates not used in article space), though not all of them. But I must quibble I'm afraid with Renesis's statement "Most of these were protected on a whim at RFPP, without any community input." That's the way protection works--we protect if there's a problem, and someone can come along and unprotect, and it's not a big deal. At least, that's the way it <i>should</i> work; if we've gotten so nervous about wheel wars that we're not willing to undo someone else's protection, then <i>that's</i> a problem. I urge any admin who sees something that badly needs protecting to protect it, and similarly to unprotect something that needn't be protected, and if there's a dispute then deal with it. The overwhelming majority of protections <i>and</i> unprotections are not controversial. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChick_Bowen_2101.html" title="User:Chick Bowen">Chick Bowen</a> 07:29, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>This massive, unilateral unprotection of templates is disruptive, and a serious violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. These templates were properly protected by a large number of administrators per <a href="../../../h/i/g/Wikipedia%7EHigh-risk_templates_dce7.html" title="Wikipedia:High-risk templates">Wikipedia:High-risk templates</a>, which authorizes an exception to the general <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProtection_policy_d869.html" title="Wikipedia:Protection policy">protection policy</a>, and recommends that heavily used templates be fully protected as a preemptive measure, before any substantial vandalism occurs, due to the severe harm caused by template vandalism. The assertion that template substitution is somehow a panacea that will ward off the evils of template vandalism is quite incorrect -- the danger associated with template vandalism is that a single act of vandalism on a heavily used template will result in a large number of vandalized versions of the template being displayed. This is true even if the templates are substituted -- when a heavily used, substituted template is vandalized, hundreds of vandalized versions of the template may be generated before the damage to the template is repaired. Additionally, because template substitution breaks the link between the original template and the substituted versions, vandalized substitutions of the template will remain after reversion of the vandalism on the template itself, and may be difficult to find and repair. Moreover, when a user applies a substituted template, the text of the template is displayed in the user's contribution history as though they entered it themself. The vandalized text of a template will thus appear as if entered by the users applying the template, and without any indications that a template is being substituted, if the vandal removes comments such as .&lt;!-- Template:Test (first level warning) --&gt; from the template. Vandalism of substituted templates is the <i>only</i> type of vandalism that can be used to falsify users' edit histories, thereby causing immense disruption. I urge administrators to protect the <a href="../../../h/i/g/Wikipedia%7EHigh-risk_templates_dce7.html" title="Wikipedia:High-risk templates">high-risk templates</a> that <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman">Aaron Brenneman</a> has taken it upon himself to unilaterally unprotect. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn254_98f8.html" title="User:John254">John254</a> 11:31, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>John254, you are incorrect about the history of 'high risk templates'. They were not "protected by a large number of administrators", but rather by individual admins acting 'unilaterally'. Often doing so for large swaths of templates at once. This is not "a serious violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>" as you describe, but rather 'an admin doing his job properly'. I've both added and removed templates from that list several times myself... it's called making updates to fit the current situation. If people disagree with some of the actions they can be discussed and reversed if need be. No need for hyperventilating. As to your theory that hundreds of usages of a substituted template might occur before vandalism is repaired... it seems exceedingly doubtful to me. The second someone substitutes a template and gets results different than they expected they are going to correct and/or report it. <i>Maybe</i> a couple people use it without actually looking at the results, but not "hundreds". --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 12:05, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I stand by my claim that these templates were "protected by a large number of administrators", since many different administrators were involved in effectuating these protections. No one administrator protected all of these templates him/herself. When many different administrators act to protect templates, it shows far more consensus than <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman">Aaron Brenneman</a> personally unprotecting almost every user talk namespace template that was protected. Moreover, these templates are often applied by automated means, such as <a href="../../../v/p/r/WP%7EVPRF_2210.html" title="WP:VPRF">vandalproof</a>, so vandalism won't necessarily be detected instantaneously. Users participating in RC patrol generally aren't looking to see if the warning templates have been vandalized, since, until recently, it was essentially impossible to vandalize these templates. Nor should such vigilance be required -- reverting vandalism on articles is a sufficiently difficult task already without worrying about the vandalism warnings themselves being vandalized. A cost-benefits analysis weighs in favor of full protection for these templates: it's far more important to ensure that no one has tampered with these warnings when they are placed on user talk pages than to maximize the editability of the warning templates themselves, which seldom require editing. There was certainly no shortage of administrators willing to edit the warning templates when they were fully protected. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn254_98f8.html" title="User:John254">John254</a> 12:31, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

Many of them would be substituted and forgotten by the commenter; many of them would not be discovered at all except perhaps by the new user who finds a penis on his talk page; others would be covered over by later revisions and require manual removal. Substituted templates are worse to have unprotected; at least with the transcluded templates you know that if you removed it from the template it will be gone from all the other pages. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 09:47, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>While I'm not sure that there are hundreds or even dozens of uses of {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest_d929.html" title="Template:Test">test</a>}} per minute that the user doesn't bother viewing the result, I see that it might be a good idea to keep test[0-4] protected. As for the rest ({{<a href="../../../s/p/a/Template%7ESpam_0bb2.html" title="Template:Spam">spam</a>}} and all the other more specific ones), I think we'd be fine with semi-protection.

<dd>Ok, so can have dispensed utterly then with Alkivar's complaint about existing templates.

<p>Templates that are not meant to be on articles are not articles. That should be obvious, but the articles are the only thing that really matters to be available to editing as much as possible. High use volume templates by definition should not be edited very often, so there is very little downside to protecting them and a lot of upside. So what if subst reduces the number of pages that get affected by vandalism. But since not all templates are substituted, reducing is not eliminating. We should be making efforts to eliminate vandalism, not make it easier. All high volume and high risk templates should be protected whether they are substituted or not. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 15:33, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>First, removing protection is just a normal admin action, and it can be talked about without dramatic overtones. And Aaron, this is not article namespace, so the same rules don't automatically apply. That's the wider issue here, the status of the template namespace. We've been treating it in much the same way as article namespace - people create what they think they need, and we go from there, with consensus required for deletion. That's a bit problematic - these are not encyclopedic content pages, they are tools for building and maintaining the content. Some of them are really extensions of the software (and hardly ever need to change), and we've had popular templates upgraded to new software features before. The template namespace is more like an open source programming library than like an encyclopedia.</p>
<p>It's not clear that the open status of the template namespace is beneficial to the project. We have a lot of duplication of effort, a lot of inconsistencies, and a total lack of a sane naming scheme for templates. Maybe we're getting it backwards. Maybe templates should be more often (semi-)protected, and maybe new templates should be automatically TfD'd (or rather reviewed) after a month and require consensus to keep. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User_talk%7EZocky_f226.html" title="User talk:Zocky">Zocky</a> | <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_Picture_Popups_bee7.html" title="User:Zocky/Picture Popups">picture popups</a> 03:03, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Time out. Where exactly does it say this image is under a noncommercial license? Are we talking about the <a href="http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/SeaWiFS/" class="external text" title="http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/SeaWiFS/" rel="nofollow">SeaWiFS home page</a>? Because that just says, "All SeaWiFS images and data presented <b>on this website</b> are for research and educational use only" (emphasis mine). And I can't find this image on the web site (admittedly, I only searched via Google and didn't really browse around the site much). No such restrictions are presented on the <a href="http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3?img_id=4488" class="external text" title="http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3?img_id=4488" rel="nofollow">Earth Observatory page</a>, which is usually pretty good about stating the image license terms.

<dd>The problem is that the only reason anyone ever thought it was PD is that it was assumed to be a NASA image. Since it's not, we can no longer assume it's PD. The burden of proof is always on us to show something is PD; if SeaWiFS doesn't explicitly release their images to the public domain as the other NASA divisions do, then we cannot consider them free.

<p>Someone said on the main page I should post here. Good afternoon. I joined this site two days ago and yesterday my account was blocked forever becuase I tried to help out another person. I was invited to join this site by an old web buddy named Coolcat and he pointed me in the right direction towards a couple of articles and some other users. People then started saying I was another person named Husnock and, in violation of my privacy, conducted an ip address and posted I was living in the UAE. I then went to Husnock's web page and saw some very mean messages towards him by some other people. I responded to one of them and thought it would show up as his name, but my name instead appeared. I was then told that I was permanently banned from this site and my user page was blanked. I'm new to this site, for the most part, so dont know your policies but, hey, that seems really brutal. I was just trying to help this guy out. Please see my account: <a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamelCommodore_54c3.html" title="User:CamelCommodore">user:CamelCommodore</a>. If I broke a rule, I'm sorry. I just want a fresh start.

<dd>Ridiculous. CheckUser is not an invasion of privacy.

<p>Hello again. I put the template on my talk page, it was denied. How can I appeal this? I am not a meat or a sock, whatever that means. I do know Coolcat and he told me about Husnock. I was only trying to help but now I can't log on to this site. I am sorry for putting the message on Husnock's page. Can't I at least get a second chance instead of being kicked off this website forever? Please help me, thank you. Regards- Camel Commo</p>

<dd>I was going to hold my tongue but this is pretty pathetic stuff - AGF does not mean that we are required to remove our brains. It's you, it's always been you - all those tales of mysterious figures (all in your immediate area and all off the same or similar IP addresses) be they come colonels, generals or commanders has been one of the most transparent cases of game-playing and frankly trolling I've seen in a while. I have no idea why you are insulting the intelligence of the community with this game - I can only assume it's to muddy the waters in some manner with your current ARBCOM case. Stop - just stop. At the moment, there are a fair number of people who want to see you continue to contribute to the encyclopedia but those constant dramas and games are getting to be pretty tiresome. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesknight_2ce5.html" title="User:Charlesknight">Charlesknight</a> 15:28, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Good sir, please understand me...this is not a trick. I have that person's e-mail address if you want it and there is a way I can get it to you without posting it here. He is not me, but has sent me e-mails about this sitation. He has tried for two days to get unblocked and be put back on the site and has been met with nothing but accusations and cold shoulders. I feel very badly that he was blocked. All I am asking is that he is unblocked and given a second chance and not be punished for trying to help me.

<p>I oppose unblocking. This is definitely a troll account, and probably someone's sockpuppet.

CamelCommodore also happens to use the same IP address that Husnock uses, and at the same times. I'm not sure there is a case for unblocking CamelCommodore on the theory that he will turn into a productive wikipedian, but whatever shred of a case there might be would depend on whether Camel Commodore really is a real life friend of yours whom you asked to come here. Otherwise, CamelCommodore looks like a sockpuppet of Husnock playing out some bizarre game. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 20:16, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Its my honest opinion that we should unblock CC. It would be very distressing for them if they were actually a different person who suddenly got caught up in a huge furor involving a large amount of people who could block their account at will. I havent seen any evidence of him doing any major harm to the encyclopedia, and in the event I turn out to be wrong and he does do harm then he can be quite easily and quickly blocked again. I think <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">Assume good faith</a> has been thrown by the wayside to a smaller or larger extent, in this whole affair and maybe we should return to one of the principles of wikipedia. <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViridae_a0d4.html" title="User:Viridae">Viridae</a><a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViridae_b84f.html" title="User talk:Viridae"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 21:17, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Morwen's work is to be commended, that must have taken some time. I strongly advise everyone, inclduing me, just let this die. This has gotten out of control with multiple posts about where people live and what ip addresses they are using. Way too much real world info.

<p>Wow, you should be a detective. Dont forget this guy states to know <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolcat_e5e1.html" title="User:Coolcat">User:Coolcat</a> which is probably hw he found out about me and my edits. Also, Camel and I carried on a conversation on his talk page at the same time. Also, FYI, can we please get away from posting where people live (i.e. CamelCommodore is in the UAE). Since you've already said it, please be aware that all Americans in the UAE are confined to just a few ip addresses. But, in the end, posting where people live is against policy. I've done all I can for this guy and don't like where this is heading. Too much mistrust and implications of distrust and untruthfulness. I gave this person your e-mail and you and he can hash it it if you want. I think he is just going to start up a new account at this stage.

<p>I think that's a pretty solid case that these accounts are all socks of the same unpublished author who's been trying to use Wikipedia for self-promotion. We can't get a checkuser on the original account because it was banned in September. Anyone object to calling these all his sockpuppets and closing the theater?

<dd>I've stayed out of the debate considering that I was a major part of the situation that resulted in JB196 being banned in the first place (he then proceeded to vandalise my user page and talk page for a long period of time using AOL accounts) but suffice to say I have been convinced that Dell was JB for a long time. Apart from solely editting wrestling articles it was the little things that they shared that convinced me such as labelling reverts of their edits as "vandalism" and the fact that the sign all posts the same way without a space between the full-stop and the signature. I agree with the ban, though I do not see why it is required to go through AN as isn't being a confirmed sock of an already banned user grounds for a banning? –– <b><a href="../../../l/i/d/User%7ELid_b8c5.html" title="User:Lid">Lid</a></b><sup><small>(<a href="../../../l/i/d/User_talk%7ELid_6320.html" title="User talk:Lid">Talk</a>)</small></sup> 01:49, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The other accounts are all socks of each other, but JB196 was too old to checkuser. Considering the vanity edits the IP made during the final hours there isn't much doubt in my mind. Part of why I'm bringing this here, to be candid, is that I specialize in tough investigations. The problem editors I deal with can be very dedicated to Wikipedia in their own peculiar way and one of these days some of them will probably try to build a serious malfeasance case against me. Three of the investigations I've handled are currently in arbitration. I want to avoid the fate of <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> - yet I've made myself open to recall.

<dd>I think I've found conclusive proof that the anon is JB196 - The articles linked after the line "The anon has inserted Jonathan Barber's name into a series of wrestling articles." listed the SAT and Amazing Red as two of the articles that had had Barber's name inserted which reminded me of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Professional_wrestling_Archive_9_d797.html#User:JB196" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Professional wrestling/Archive 9">this wikiproject post from April</a>. This post shows that JB196 was trying to cite himself on both Amazing Red and the SAT (among others) even though there is nothing on the OWW pages to confirm that he wrote the move lists from all those months ago and now the IP is attempting the same thing. Either the IP knows who submitted the move lists even though OWW does not credit move list submitters and "knew" it was Jonathan Barber or the IP is JB196 and in continuing is also BooyakaDell. I think one possibility here is much more likely than the other. –– <b><a href="../../../l/i/d/User%7ELid_b8c5.html" title="User:Lid">Lid</a></b><sup><small>(<a href="../../../l/i/d/User_talk%7ELid_6320.html" title="User talk:Lid">Talk</a>)</small></sup> 02:22, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The assertion that I BooyakaDell am a "strongly deletionist toward non-North American wrestlers" is bias and totally unreasonable. Also I have already explained that I read DOI, the web site which "XPW: Bleeding was only half the job" is printed on. Lastly, as far as the evidence about the misspelling of "irrelevent," it is a very common misspelling. "Irrelevent" gets 555,000 hits on google.BooyakaDell 02:31, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No the four users signed under "Users certifying the basis for this dispute" (unless I'm missing something) which has *nothing* to do with them supporting any contention that I am "strongly deletionist toward non-North American wrestlers" (a preposterous assessment).

<p>I'll point out that BooyakaDell's posts here are in violation of <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a> because the IP is currently subject to a 48 hour block. The other two registered accounts were rampant block evaders until the checkuser result came in. I haven't reverted these posts or imposed other blocks because it seems fair to let this editor speak in his defense. Also, less than an hour before this denial he wrote <i>I don't see how there would have been any gain from being "forthcoming about being JB196."</i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:BooyakaDell&amp;diff=95430157&amp;oldid=95429509" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:BooyakaDell&amp;diff=95430157&amp;oldid=95429509" rel="nofollow">[31]</a> To me that reads like an implicit admission that they are the same person: if these were different editors I'd expect something more like <i>tell me what I can do to help clear up this misunderstanding.</i> Booyaka also left a follow-up message that stated <i>Yes this is all hypothetical but how is it possible that a sockpuppet coming clean would result in anything other than an immediate block (I can't stress the word immediate enough)?</i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABooyakaDell&amp;diff=95437448&amp;oldid=95434659" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABooyakaDell&amp;diff=95437448&amp;oldid=95434659" rel="nofollow">[32]</a> <font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charg</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><span style="color:#0c0">e!</span></a></i></sup></font> 03:03, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks Alex. I was minutes away from doing that myself based on the following:
<ul>
<li>26 April 2006: JB196 self-identifies as Jonathan Barber and credits himself for compiling signature moves.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_S.A.T.&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=50277359" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_S.A.T.&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=50277359" rel="nofollow">[33]</a></li>
<li>19 December 2006: the IP links to ObsessedWithWrestling.com and credits Jonathan Barber by name at the same article regarding signature moves.</li>
<li>Yet the referenced site does not not credit anyone for compiling for that list of moves.<a href="http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/profiles/l/los-maximos.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/profiles/l/los-maximos.html" rel="nofollow">[34]</a></li>
<li>Above, BooyakaDell (who is also this IP) claims his references are similar because he reads the same website - but he'd need supernatural powers to find a credit name the site doesn't post...unless of course he's Jonathan Barber, in which case the whole chain of events is very simple. <font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charg</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><span style="color:#0c0">e!</span></a></i></sup></font> 05:03, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yes, the site credits him in a general way as an inactive researcher. There's no particular reason to believe he compiled a list cited three days ago unless Booyaka had inside information. And beyond reasonable doubt, everyone except the sockpuppet concluded that this information was as inside as it can get. It's also perfectly obvious that an IP address with no previous edit history at all doesn't randomly come to the administrators' noticeboard and supply a link reference at the end of a long investigation - minutes after a series of accounts got banned - unless that IP address has an equally personal stake in the outcome.

<p>this editor (Serafin and 131 are same person) keeps personally attacking me despite myself and multiple other people warning him repeatedly. The latest <a href="../../../x/x/2/User_talk%7EXx236_a85f.html#Jadger_i_S.C3.BCddeutsche_Zeitung" title="User talk:Xx236">here</a> he calls me a <i>"limited essence soya bean case"</i> in Polish (according to online translator poltran.com) then states in Polish <i>"It is necessary to pound him (it) faith technically not he (it; it) oczywiscieale."</i> the last word being untranslatable I guess. See for instance <a href="../../../r/e/c/Talk%7ERecovered_Territories_bfa2.html" title="Talk:Recovered Territories">Talk:Recovered Territories</a> where he even created two sections called "exclude Jadger" and stated <i>"All of you accept the truth you will need to blame anybody. Stop spreading Jadger the Nazi garbage."</i> even calling me <i>"German Arrogant"</i> or stating <i>"Do you love anything, maybe you only love is dollar?"</i> this has been extremely offensive to me for obvious reasons, and I have asked him repeated times to stop but it continues. On another discussion page, that of <a href="../../../e/x/p/Talk%7EExpulsion_of_Germans_after_World_War_II_5ceb.html" title="Talk:Expulsion of Germans after World War II">Talk:Expulsion_of_Germans_after_World_War_II</a> he essentially calls on people to vote for blocking me at the recovered territories discussion page because I am <i>"a trouble for wiki"</i>. Also I would recommend taking a look at his <a href="../../../1/3/1/User_talk%7E131.104.218.46.html" title="User talk:131.104.218.46">talk page</a> where he states <i>"I am completely aware of you position. You attempt to equalize Polish wrong with Nazi crimes."</i> which I would view as a personal attack. also this <i>"I found also that you statements are provocative for others and actually you hate Poles."</i> the list could go on and on, he repeatedly calls me <i>revisionist</i> and claims my edits are <i>"false and twisted"</i>.</p>
<p><b>please put a stop to this</b></p>
<p>P.S. I would also like to note that this user has been banned on the German wikipedia for similar incidents, but his username is slightly different Aserafin.</p>

<p>An administrator deleted the AfD discussion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Tamaskan_Dog" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Tamaskan_Dog" rel="nofollow">[49]</a> per another user's request, and then restored it at my request, with this qualification: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Keesiewonder#AfD_page" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Keesiewonder#AfD_page" rel="nofollow">[50]</a>. I am willing to do this, but want to do so without getting myself in to more trouble.

<dd>From what I can tell this is a case of embarrassing/etc comments on an AfD page. The simple approach is to blank everything between the closed debate templates at the top and the bottom. See <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Brian_Peppers_f258.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Brian Peppers">this</a> for an example. This can be done liberally, unless there is a really good reason not to blank the page. The full debate is always available in the history (which you may want to link to when you blank it), this is mainly to prevent the contents of the debate appearing in search results. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a>&#160;(<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 13:58, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>Thanks. In my opinion, there <i><b>is</b></i> good reason to not blank the entire AfD page in this case. I will edit the AfD page directly this evening. It sounds like I do not need to worry about getting in trouble with administrators and WP politics if I simply give it my best shot.

<dd>I guess we better start writing some of these articles in languages other than English to avoid the anglo-centric accusation. The policy as I understand it is based on two issues firstly that on many browsers these characters don't render properly (happens on at least one of the computers I use) coming out as little boxes or&#160;? or some such. In article histories this is worse than meaningless. And secondly that the use of abusive names or terms can go unchecked for a long while. The former is not easily solveable and why we encourage users to use such characters in their signature where usually hovering over the link shows the underlying username and the usernames show up properly in page histories. (Though in a recent RFA there were complaints that the signature was too different from the username...). The second is also not easily soluble and single login with local blocking, may indeed make it a real issue. Personally I don't see it as unreasonable to ask people to pick a name which is legible and renders well in peoples browsers. On the question of your proposal, the way things normally seem to work is we discuss and then take action, not take action then discuss --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 16:43, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmm, something of a problem, then, when it comes to tracking the hoofprints of vandals. When a page is deleted, edits to that page no longer appear in the contributions page for a user, so it becomes difficult to gather evidence of bad behavior in the absence of detailed accounting of the targets of vandalism by persons who set warnings on the perpetrator's talk page. Am I imagining a problem where one does not exist (not unlikely)? --User:Ceyockey (<small><i><a href="../../../c/e/y/User_talk%7ECeyockey_b802.html" title="User talk:Ceyockey">talk to me</a></i></small>) 03:07, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes .. there is a whole matrix of the templates (several for CSD applications) and I use them .. but my understanding is that they are not necessarily applied for every page vandalized in a series of events as they are meant as a notification trail rather than an audit trail.

<dd>Something like a "page creation log" that listed all pages created by a user would defenently have been usefull sometimes. Granted that would still leave "regular" vandalism to pre-existing-but-since-deleted articles hidden. The ideal would probably have been a "toggle deleted edits on/off" button in the user contributions list (for admins at least), though I guess that might lead to performance issues (it's my understanding that deleted revisions are compressed and stored in a seperate, not-so-optimized-for-searching table). --<a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESherool_fe99.html" title="User:Sherool">Sherool</a> <span style="font-size:75%"><a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7ESherool_9233.html" title="User talk:Sherool">(talk)</a></span> 07:02, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If you look at my contributions, you will see that I just did a cleanup of some old pages relating to Jeff Merkey.</p>
<p>Jeff is focused on other projects which involve Wikipedia content but they are not affiliated with the Wikimedia Foundation. I removed the BAN since it is essentially become moot since Mr. Merkey has little interest or time to focus as an editor. Mr. Merkey has already told the Foundation he has little interest in being a Wikipedia Editor per se and given the amount of work he is doing in other areas, and as a courtesy for his right to vanish, I have removed these pages.</p>
<p>This is a courtesy, contingent of course on continued good behavior. I trust there will be no issues around this, but I wanted to give admins a heads up, since once upon a time there was a rather hysterical charge of a bribe being offered and accepted around this issue. Wikipedia is about many things, but one of the things it is or should be about is forgiveness and healing, as we all can become better people over time. Hopefully, there will be no further problems in this area.--<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> 19:09, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not sure where this goes, so I'll start here.</p>
<p>For the last couple of days the AfC pages have been acting very screwy.</p>
<ul>
<li>The "edit button" does not edit the line that it's on - it opens the article before!</li>
<li>The afc templates seem to be randomly putting the correct -top- and -bottom- tags on the new articles, so that sometimes editing a new article will affect the entire page!</li>
<li>When a new request comes in, ofttimes there is not a new == == heading created.</li>
<li>When there are multiple == == sections, attempting to edit the parent one opens only the top section, and not the entire submission. I've had to go through and blank out several nonsense listings that had multiple sections.</li>
</ul>
<p>If this isn't the correct forum to address this, would you please redirect it to the right place!&#160;:) Thanks... <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkierRMH_4ae2.html" title="User:SkierRMH">SkierRMH</a> 00:40, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ol>
<li>This sometimes happens on long pages - I'm not sure why, but it gets the wrong section number (probably there's a bug on the page or in the software)</li>
<li>By "article" do you mean section? There's been a problem with the databases messing up lng pages when edited recently - nothing we can do&#160;:(</li>
<li>Perhaps the IP is adding it without using the system (ie - new section) but is typing it at the bottom by mistake</li>
<li>== == sections denote new edit sections in the mediawiki software, so editing one won't open the following one for editing. This is a major problem on the AfC desk - it needs to be emphasized to IPs that they must not use levbel 2 headings! <strong><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_980f.html" title="User:Martinp23">M</a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_Esperanza_4562.html" title="User:Martinp23/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartinp23_2732.html" title="User talk:Martinp23">rtinp23</a></strong> 12:12, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I thought we do usually attribute anyway; I've seen articles that say "This article came from xxxx, which is in the public domain." Usually some 1911 encyclopedia or some Marine Corp thing. Hbdragon88 04:41, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>His concern was a link to his website ... I don't know (no idea, haven't looked into it at all) if that is actually where they are getting the information from, or even if it is the only online source of the Jewish encylopedia. Obviously, citing sources, we should credit the encyclopedia ... and if his website is the only place to find it, then a link might be appropriate, even if it is PD ... but it probably ought to be made clear that it is a courtesy, not an obligation. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 04:46, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, even public domain stuff needs an attribution if we use its text in an article. The thing is, since he just digitized a PD encyclopedia, there's not automatically proof that someone uploading text from that encyclopedia copied from his efforts, maybe the uploader to Wikipedia scanned or transcribed the article manually too. I would suggest having contributers attribute his project if they did copy from it, but otherwise just use a standard attribution as described above. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 04:49, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Basically the same as for any deleted page. If there is conversation important for re-creating it, like a re-write or discussion about finding sources, or other things like that, then it should be kept. This one looks like kids complaining "How you could you delete it! <b>It's real!</b>". It is also good to leave it for a while if there is explanation to the editors why it was deleted or a reference to <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a>. That advice has already been there for a week though, and I don't think "It is real" is a valid reason to undelete at DRV. Altogether, it is not that important though, because the talk page will be gone along with with the salted page when I delete it in a couple of months. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 08:17, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I don't think the project really needs to go away (<a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a>, as we already have an inclusionism project), but there are huge problems with it (especially the vote counting bit - if anyone went to DRV saying something like "but there are 60 points for merge and only 55 for redirect", I'm certain the DRV would be quickly dispensed with!). I think that something which will help to get more people involved in under publicised AfDs will help, but I'd prefer to see inclusionists and deletionists merged into an AfD taskforce, so we don't get blatant POV voting from each of the projects. But that isn't going to happen&#160;:) - I just think the whole project needs a cleanup - if it went to MfD now, I'd probably recommend Userfication until it's ready. <strong><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_980f.html" title="User:Martinp23">M</a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_Esperanza_4562.html" title="User:Martinp23/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartinp23_2732.html" title="User talk:Martinp23">rtinp23</a></strong> 20:51, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>The scoring system is for a bot I am going to make to identify controversial AfD's. The problem is that too many AfD's end up at DRV because admins <i>are</i> counting votes, no matter what people claim. The assertion that we'd go into an AfD discussion with a bunch of numbers I just made up is pretty funny, though. I'm testing these numbers by hand, to see if they work. If they work, I'd like to make a bot that scrapes AfD votes and spits out a table of AfD's that might need a look. If it doesn't look possible, the scoring system won't be neccessary and can go away. --<font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a4a9.html" title="User:Elaragirl"><font color="SteelBlue">Elar</font></a><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a_7dff.html" title="User:Elaragirl/a"><font color="orange"><b>a</b></font></a><font color="SteelBlue">girl</font><small><sup><a href="../../../e/l/a/User_talk%7EElaragirl_228e.html" title="User talk:Elaragirl">Talk</a>|Count</sup></small></font> 21:07, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I am merely trying to help. Incivil comments like the ones above are unwelcome here on wikipedia. Since <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> is kept, please follow it.</p>
<p>The point of ANB is it being a noticeboard. This is not the complaints department. I am merely asking impartial people to review the wikiproject page. I noticed the wikiproject at an afd... apperantly some people are advertising it with their signature. I do not believe it is Elaragirl's pet project, what makes you think that it is?</p>
<p>The meta deletion page is a page I have made one nom and few comments. I do not campaign for deletion, no. I let impartial people review it.</p>
<p>MfD/AfD is used too easily to shoot pages that can easily be improved rather than deleted. AfD/MfD is an overused procedure. I'd oppose a deletion nom (which seems to be inline with this wikiprojects guidelines).</p>
<p>I think a wikiprojects objective should not be dividing the community (I am not saying it is for this wikiproject). I would oppose a inclusionism wikiproject just as well (I do not see one nor have I looked for it). I feel there should be one afd wikiproject that includes inclusionists, deletionists, and others and its title should represent this.</p>
<p>Elaragirl, thank you. That makes sense. Elaragirl a key flaw IMHO is a bot can easily be tricked by sockpuppets, fake votes and etc. However a function that establishes the more clear cut cases might be useful but I also feel votes without a rationale should often be ignored. After all, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a democracy and Afd not a vote.</p>

<ul>
<li>Elaragirl's explanation of what this prospective bot is meant to do is perfectly satisfactory and should be left at that. The idea is not to reduce AFD to a vote, but to see if there's a quick and easy way to generate a list of problematic AFDs that need looking at. Perhaps a page-move to WikiProject Deletion? It does actually say on the project page that inclusionists are particularly welcome, I think, but I agree that this second title could be viewed as less inflammatory.
<p>And what uncivil comments? I didn't see anything. A point that was made at the Elaragirl RFC was that it basically consisted of Cool Cat being wilfully offended. Certainly a little skepticism is permitted after you come straight back from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Cool_Cat" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Cool_Cat" rel="nofollow">enforced wikibreak</a> and immediately start complaining on AN about a Wikiproject set up by the same person you earlier filed a frivolous RFC against.</p>

<p>Hi guys! I'd like to get clarification on the applicability of a <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Right_to_vanish" class="extiw" title="m:Right_to_vanish">m:Right to vanish</a> request by a banned user. XP (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_XP_cf88.html" title="Special:Contributions/XP">contribs</a>) is a sockpuppet of ArbCom banned <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">Rootology</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/o/User_talk%7ERootology_22b0.html" title="User talk:Rootology">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Rootology_5451.html" title="Special:Contributions/Rootology">contribs</a>) (see <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Archive66_0599.html#Indefinite_Block_of_User:XP" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Archive66">this thread</a> for more details about that). Rootology/XP has blanked his user talk page twice after trying to game folks into unblocking him and has requested an <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Right_to_vanish" class="extiw" title="m:Right_to_vanish">RtV</a> as a means of getting the incriminating talk page in question removed. I have concerns that this will hinder efforts to keep the user off the project. While administrators would still be able to (after a bit of hassle) view the page, non-admins (historically a grooming target by this user) would not. I've restored the talk page temporarily, but I'd like to get clarification on whether or not RtV can be used by sanctioned users who may be doing so to avoid enforcement of the ban.

In the months since then, we have had one sockpuppet after another. We find and block one and as soon as the autoblock expires, we get another one. Over and over and over and over again. Now, I can range-block RR for Chicago (I think that's the ISP, it's some provider in Chicago anyway) but this has the potential of a lot of collateral. But tracking down the sockpuppets and blocking them when they show up <i>simply is not working</i>. What other options are available to prevent banned users from simply creating a new account and continuing to edit abusively? I haven't yet contacted the ISP but I can't imagine they'll care. Even if they do, I only have access to the IPs used anonymously, not when the person was signed in, and these were some time ago.

Listen its not my fucken fault that you should of left the Pokemon images alone. The images did not make the episode lists better!! I don't care if you are a fucken 13 year old, or whatever. Stop vandalizing my page at the Japanese Wikipedia. It's your own fucking fault for impersonating me TWICE and I got my user name changed to the one that I should have had in the first place. Go edit the fucken Bulbapedia. I couldn't care less what you do over there. Just LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE YOU GOD DAMN CHILD. Will you just die!</p>
<p>Its pretty upsetting...</p>
<p>Also, when other admins unblocked my IP, which I edit truthfully, the User: Ryulong goes and ruins my experince, which leds my IP to be block again, and again, and again. So what are you going to do about this? User: Ryulong is not a good user, she sends threating emails to me and cussing at me. She's even death threating me.... I have tried to edit at home (I edit Pokemon and Yu-Gi-OH / Anime articles) and User: Benten recently told User Ryulong</p>

<p>Is there a way we can get that IP banned indefinately? 'cause it seems she was unblocked after Luna blocked her the first time. --Benten 02:01, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>So even IF it want to edit Wikipedia, user: Ryulong is always report me even IF i made good edits. I need your help!!</p>

However, isn't it still policy until it's no longer disputed? Does this mean that anytime someone disputes a policy it is automatically no longer in function? It should go the other way around. This seems like a really bad idea as any group of people who doesn't like a policy can hold it hostage at any time by declaring it disputed.

<dd>Sounds like a nonsense to me, should we dispute <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and not enforce it in the intervening time? (Yes a weak example <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> being pretty core, but the principle is their none the less). However, <a href="../../../u/_/_/WP%7EU_ebb9.html" title="WP:U">WP:U</a> isn't disputed anyway, the examples of inappropriate usernames is just that, a set of examples. Names covered by the examples maybe perfectly valid and shouldn't be blocked and similarly names not specifically covered may still be inappropriate and blocked (we aren't a bureacracy, "rules is rules" shouldn't be a feature). As <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> states an admin has to make a decision and doesn't have to block just because you list it. I would have hoped the person declining would have done just that, disagree that it's a problem and not block it on that basis rather than the stuff about "disputed policy". I would block this myself but I see they've made a fair number of edits, so at this point such a block would probably be more disruptive than helpful, I suggest you ask the user to consider changing their name if it bothers you particularly. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 09:41, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>OK, what problem would we be solving by blocking this user? For example, would admins be unable to block, revert or unblock the user because of non-Western characters in the username?

<dd>The rationale is laid out on the <a href="../../../u/_/_/WP%7EU_ebb9.html" title="WP:U">WP:U</a> page, and as noted there is an on going disucssion there about it. But there are two problems which it addresses (1) That the characters don't render properly for many people this means things like looking at an article history and seeing various names consisting of a variable number of&#160;?s or little boxes say. In some browsers/proxies the effect of such characters when edited get badly mangled. (2) The names on the English wikipedia are frequently unpoliceable. For the sake of argument we have some very sad individuals who spend hour upon hour creating usernames along the lines of "Jews did WTC lol". Can you tell me that if the Sinhalese version of that appeared you would know?

<dd>Well, since I was the admin who refused to block, let me at least give my reasoning:
<ul>
<li>First, I saw the username, and his contributions. The contributions were all in good faith, so I didn't have any problem <i>not</i> blocking.</li>
<li>Second, the policy is under <i>massive</i> fire right now, not just on the talk page, but in all sorts of mailing lists and other places. It is reasonable, at least in my eyes, that while a considerable portion of the community does not agree with a policy, and the policy is undergoing reform, to hold a moratorium to not inflame things further.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>In fact, looking at the policy, <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> already took the relevant bit out, due to the dispute. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">xd</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a>)</sup> 18:35, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's not even disputed on enwiki proper, as far as I can tell. I think it would be better to be mindful of the issues and have a conversation with the user instead of an initial block. If the user doesn't edit and doesn't respond then we could go ahead and block.. This would address the concern of sleeper accounts yet avoid biting newbies. I can setup a bot to list three-day inactive new accounts with non-latin characters so that they won't be missed. --<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 21:04, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sometimes we make mistakes (at least I do) in placing a vandalism-related notification on a user's talk page. I did that recently and when my mistake was revealed, I put a retraction on the user's talk page (see <a href="../../../3/8/2E/User_talk%7E38.139.36.119.html#.27United_States_Patent_and_Trademark_Office.27_edit" title="User talk:38.139.36.119">User_talk:38.139.36.119#.27United_States_Patent_and_Trademark_Office.27_edit</a>); I also noted in the edit summary that this was a retraction of a vandalism notification. Do you think this is over the top - not the original vandalism notification (that can be debated about whether the notice should have been put and what level it should have been) but rather the response to the revelation of an error.

<p>This AfD has descended into chaos, mainly because of the large number of individual pages included in the multiple listing, and the nature of the pages listed, being to do with online gaming. I've suggested an immediate procedural closure as no consensus and individual relisting of all nominated pages, struck-through or not. I don't see any way an admin can close this one out normally. I voted in the debate so can't really take any action myself. <b><a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><font style="verdana" color="#000000">Dei</font><font color="#FF3300">zio</font></a></b> <small><a href="../../../d/e/i/User_talk%7EDeiz_2388.html" title="User talk:Deiz">talk</a></small> 19:31, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"The nominator is kindly requested to remove the AfD tags from the articles." Eh? It's the closer's job to remove tags from articles. Colin can do it if he wishes, but it is not his responsibility as the closing summary implies; we do it that way because to do otherwise would be "punishing" people for nominating an article for deletion. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 00:50, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You are generally correct; however, in <i>abortive</i> <i>mass</i> AfDs such as this one, it appears appropriate to me that the nominator clean up after themselves, as it were.

<p>Striver put it up for AfD because his Muslim board was guilty of vote stacking, this is simply lashing out and I am surprised it hasnt been closed yet as such. The fact that Travb would come here while the AfD is leaning in the same direction as the last, after putting AfD notices on article talk pages that have been noted on the noticeboard (which Travb admitted to being vote stacking), and marking them as minor edits, is all a bit fishy. This is another attempt to go around the forming concensus, much like last time with the article deletion review, which also ended in keeping the snowball keep verdict. Also oddly Travb isnt even linking to anything related to this articles MfD in his link above, its about the "allegations of terrorism by the US" article, perhaps Travb is getting his many arguements confused, or again made a post wasting peoples time in a WP:POINT violation, I will assume he is just confused.

<dd>"I may be guilty of "vote stacking" but is this any different from what User:GabrielF/ConspiracyNoticeboard does?"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>NuclearUmpf has ignored this question, repeatedly.</dd>
<dd>When I wrote "I may be guilty of "vote stacking"" (notice it is in quotes, what I meant was canvassing, which is often called canvassing) I have been very careful to follow all wikipedia rules. <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html#If_you_canvass" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM#If_you_canvass</a> states: "Don't attempt to sway consensus by encouraging participation in a discussion by people that you already know have a certain point of view. "</dd>
<dd>I did not violate <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html#If_you_canvass" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM#If_you_canvass</a> in these simple messages, as <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorton_devonshire_9599.html" title="User:Morton devonshire">User:Morton_devonshire</a> did repeatedly. Where is Nuclear's condemnation of <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorton_devonshire_9599.html" title="User:Morton devonshire">User:Morton_devonshire</a> for <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html#If_you_canvass" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM#If_you_canvass</a> violations, and for Morton's own votestacking/canvassing?</dd>
<dd>If Nuclear wants to condemn me for what he calls "votestacking"/canvanssing then what about <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETravb_vote_stacking_b771.html#Vote_spamming_case_2" title="User:Travb/vote stacking">Morton's own boot for votestacking, which was quickly overturned</a>?

<dd>And Nuclear and Morton, let me ask the question for the third time:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Why are you differenating <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_ConspiracyNoticeboard_9fa3.html" title="User:GabrielF/ConspiracyNoticeboard">User:GabrielF/ConspiracyNoticeboard</a> on the deletion page, as not being a wikiproject, but comparing <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_ConspiracyNoticeboard_9fa3.html" title="User:GabrielF/ConspiracyNoticeboard">User:GabrielF/ConspiracyNoticeboard</a> to a wikiproject here? You can't have it both ways, it is either a wikiproject, which should have "some sort of official mantle" or it is a userpage which "carry no community policy weight".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Please answer the question gentlemen.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I came here for an answer to this question:</dd>
<dd><b>My question</b>: I have read previous AfDs of userpages which join other wikipedians to push their own agenda are deleted Snowball delete. I recall reading an AfD about a year ago for an abortion group and a church group which was deleted for this reason.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I am wondering what the <b>precedence</b> is on deletion of pages such as <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_ConspiracyNoticeboard_9fa3.html" title="User:GabrielF/ConspiracyNoticeboard">User:GabrielF/ConspiracyNoticeboard</a>&#160;?

<li>There are plenty of experienced editors advocating Keep on that particular page, on the grounds that it serves an encyclopaedic purpose in managing the morass of 9/11 conspiracycruft. It's been nominated before, and in both cases the nominator has a history of argumentative behaviour in respect of this kind of content. I have no problem with the page myself, and I would not mind seeing it moved to project space as a project to monitor neutrality (and especially undue weight) in the legion of 9/11 articles. We don't actually <i>need</i> an article on each and every minor variation of "gubmint evil, therefore conspiracy". A lot of the articles on the 9/11 "truth" movement are systematically biased, even in trivial ways like saying the truthers have "concluded" that there is a coverup, whereas actually that was their starting point. Every single explanation offered by the truthers violates Occam's razor, of course. NPOV is <i>non-negotiable</i> and articles which appear to advocate conspiracy theories are not neutral, so having some kind of task force to clean them up is entirely reasonable. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 10:28, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It counts as harassment when it includes mistaken accusations of violations of bright-line rules, and when, after it becomes painfully apparent that these accusations have been made in error, the perpetrator persists in accusing the victim of violating the "spirit" of the rule, and of "gaming" the system, rather than apologizing for her own mistake and her own vindictive and inappropriate behavior. And it counts as harassment when, after it has become painfully apparent that the accusation of the bright-line violation was made in error, the perpetrator goes along as though the victim has nevertheless committed a punishable offense, and indeed is joined in this witch-hunt by other people who have difficulty respecting processes that protect those who disagree with them. That, Radiant!, is when "warning someone to stop revert warring" counts as harassment. -- DLH <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.82.9.91_b028.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.82.9.91">66.82.9.91</a> (<a href="../../../6/6/2E/User_talk%7E66.82.9.91.html" title="User talk:66.82.9.91">talk</a>) 01:26, 25 December 2006 (UTC).</small></li>

<p>OK, I don't usually come here, but this has gone too far. Today, there was a picture of a penis on the Main Page. <b>This should not be possible</b>, yet it happens.</p>
<p>I have neither the time nor the desire to check every last template myself, and I don't see why I should have to. It's not an area I have any involvement with. It is, however, an area that several other people contribute regularly to. While I hold nothing against any one of them, this is a page that is viewed millions of times a day, and people have got to start taking some kind of responsibility for it. Featured articles and pictured are scheduled, ITN and DYK are updated; these tasks require administrative action and an <i>essential</i> part of such duties is making sure <i>all</i> these pages, and any transcluded onto them, are protected, <i>before</i> they go "live". Same goes for any and all pictures appearing on the page.</p>

<p>User:IAF, without bad intentions is using Indian Air Force as his user name.

<dd>The acount name is not bad, since there are many air force organizations that go by IAF. However, what he needs to do is go into his preferences and drop the Indian Air Force as part of his signature, so it just reads <a href="../../../i/a/f/User%7EIAF_26e4.html" title="User:IAF">User:IAF</a> and the timestamp. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">User:Zscout370</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Return Fire)</a></sup></small> 10:53, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>You mean</b> to say that he will be allowed to use Indian Air Force as his signature if he does not stop and remove earlier signatures?

<dd>I first encountered this user when I noticed the edit war he was involved in at Middle Eastern American. Another user asked me to warn Technajunky about stalking, and when I did, I got the response "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Khoikhoi&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=93092343" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Khoikhoi&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=93092343" rel="nofollow">One warning was enough, kiddo. If you keep messing around with my user page, it could be considered vandalism, or at the very least, a sign that you have too much time on your hands</a>".

Finially when Technajunky started to follow Humus sapiens around, reverting all his edits and adding a {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-nonsense_a295.html" title="Template:Db-nonsense">db-nonsense</a>}} tag to an article he started, I blocked him for 24 hours. As I later reviewed the edits of 68.5.96.201, it became apparent that they were the same person, and that he actually used his Technajunky account to circumvent 3RR at <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wall_of_Shame_ce36.html" title="Wall of Shame">Wall of Shame</a>. I asked <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a> to do a check, and he confirmed that it was him, in addition to <a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElectronFlux_3eb5.html" title="User:ElectronFlux">User:ElectronFlux</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/c/User%7ESockPuppetKing_6d0c.html" title="User:SockPuppetKing">User:SockPuppetKing</a>, the former of which he used to evade 3RR on <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Escalante_945b.html" title="Joe Escalante">Joe Escalante</a>.

<p>Forgive me, because I don't mean to stir the pot. The matter has been settled, and I have no wish to re-open it. However, if I could get some clarification on the issues it raised (I haven't looked at the user's history), it would be helpful to me. My understanding is that sockpuppetry per se isn't an actionable offense as long as the sockpuppet is not abusive. I know that it can't be used to evade a block or ban, but isn't kind of a poor man's "right to disappear"? I understand wanting to nip problems in the bud, but if a user appears to be editing constructively, even on articles he/she has edited in the past, what's the harm in letting them go on for a bit just watch them? I ask because I have seen a couple of these questionable calls lately, and I don't really understand.

</ul>
<p>I'm sorry it's come to this, but he's started up his antics again and I think it's getting to the point where he's exhausting community patience. Some background: Asher, a middle schooler, originally edited under <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResources_of_Sheboygan_Club_4613.html" title="User:Resources of Sheboygan Club">Resources of Sheboygan Club</a> (<a href="../../../r/e/s/User_talk%7EResources_of_Sheboygan_Club_9aee.html" title="User talk:Resources of Sheboygan Club">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Resources_of_Sheboygan_Club_22d4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Resources of Sheboygan Club">contribs</a>), creating vanity pages such as The Resources of Sheboygan Club and Asher Heimermann. He switched over to his current Asher Heimermann username and recreated Asher Heimermann. He tried to use a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=209.103.228.127" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=209.103.228.127" rel="nofollow">meatpuppet</a> to sway the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Asher_Heimermann_4a12.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Asher Heimermann">AfD</a>. For some reason, he decided to go on a welcoming spree, welcoming blatant vandals, non-existent users, and giving blatant vandal warnings to good users. A lot of us tried to help him out (see the talk page archive) but to no avail; he just refused to listen to any of our pleas to stop his welcoming. He also used another account <a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumLee_2798.html" title="User:NumLee">NumLee</a> (<a href="../../../n/u/m/User_talk%7ENumLee_d23f.html" title="User talk:NumLee">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_NumLee_4198.html" title="Special:Contributions/NumLee">contribs</a>) to recreate his autobiography at Asher Luke Heimermann (deleted per <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Asher_Luke_Heimermann_5c22.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Asher Luke Heimermann">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Asher Luke Heimermann</a>).</p>
<p>Eventually, he moved on to actually contributing to articles, and he <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bobby_%282006_film%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=90183460" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bobby_%282006_film%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=90183460" rel="nofollow">copied and pasted</a> directly from IMDB. I warned not to do it again, but he ignored me and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bobby_%282006_film%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=90186829" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bobby_%282006_film%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=90186829" rel="nofollow">did so again</a>. At that point I gave him a harsh warning to stop his continued disruption, but was accused of <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">User:David Levy</a> gave him a final warning which seemed to work for a while. <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockpocket_2e94.html" title="User:Rockpocket">User:Rockpocket</a> was also kind enough to adopt him. Asher stopped editing for a few weeks, and we all started to move on, but he just started up revert warring on <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_H._Cox_236a.html" title="John H. Cox">John H.

<dd>Better late than never... After Asher's last round of conflicts I offered to adopt him. Its proving pretty difficult as he doesn't really engage then, when the fancy takes him, he appears to contribute in a flurry of activity. Unfortunately I missed the latest round, as I was off for a short Christmas Wikibreak. I would suggest we allow him to see out his current block then, on his return, determine whether he is willing to engage for some Wikitutoring. If he is willing to work with me, then I will make it very clear that he is close to exhausting the community's patience and that any further misbehaviour will not be tolerated. If, after numerous offers of help and even more warnings, he will not follow the rules, its difficult to see beyond an indefinate block. <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockpocket_2e94.html" title="User:Rockpocket"><font color="green">Rockpock</font></a><font color="black">e</font><a href="../../../r/o/c/User_talk%7ERockpocket_62af.html" title="User talk:Rockpocket"><font color="green">t</font></a> 03:36, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

E.g. changing "Archive12" to "Archive 12" and leaving a redirect behind.

It did not change the Werdnabot invocations to show the new file name for the current archive so Werdnabot added the archived material to the redirects which were left behind. Also, a minor point, GurchBot 2 did not change the archive lists to point at the new file names so they are now all going thru the redirects.

<dd>I'm not sure if {{<a href="../../../s/o/f/Template%7ESofixit_b7f1.html" title="Template:Sofixit">sofixit</a>}} is the appropriate response here. Archive standardization is the approved task for the bot and is probably a necessary task, but if it is conflicting with any other archiving bots, such as Werdnabot, then the latter need to be changed to update this so that the two bots do not keep on conflicting with each other. Problems with Gurchbot 2 should go to <a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurch_e84c.html" title="User:Gurch">Gurch</a>, and if Werdnabot needs to be changed, <a href="../../../w/e/r/User%7EWerdna_2947.html" title="User:Werdna">Werdna</a> needs to be informed.

<dd>In fact most of those are userspace archives, which the bot hasn't moved – as far as I'm concerned users are free to do whatever they want with their old discussions; elsewhere, though, there should be some consistency.

<p>Erk! That'll teach me to leave a job half-done. The need to check Werdnabot instructions was in the back of my mind, and I was intenting to get the "tidying up" done a lot sooner, but unfortunately other things (i.e. Christmas) have been holding me up. I'll try to find time for it later today. The bot has finished running now, though I'm going to move a few more pages manually.</p>
<p>In response to the posts above:</p>
<p>Changes to the instructions to Werdnabot on <s>some</s> five talk pages will be necessary. I take full responsibility for this and will do it as soon as I have time; of course, anyone is welcome to fix the situation if they get there first. Werdna is not at fault here, please don't pester him.</p>
<p>Neither my bot nor Werndabot will need code changes. My bot has finished running and will not run again until a new task is approved. Werdnabot simply moves comments wherever it is instructed; the instruction rather than the bot needs to be changed. If the bot has archived comments to the wrong page, revert its edits, archive the comments to the correct page and change the path of the archive in the instruction to the bot. If you don't know how to do this, don't worry; I will do it myself within the next 24 hours.</p>

<p>This isn't on AN/I because I'm not reporting anyone, in the interests of not coloring reputation unnecessarily. On the other hand, this is not a hypothetical, and does involve actual account activity.</p>
<p>In short, is there any problem with an editor who is an acknowledged real-life contact of an indef-blocked user who is known to have evaded block with a litany of socks?

<dd>Editors should not be acting as a proxy for a banned user (making edits on behalf of). In one case last year, an administrator was de-adminned for allegedly making edits at the request of a banned user. Just being acquainted with a banned user is not a problem.

<dd>It comes down to actions. If the person knows the banned user, we can't go with guilt by association, but if the person <i>acts like</i> the banned user, even just "sometimes," we have to come down with the hammer of Thor. Basically, actions got the ban, and actions indicate meat puppetry. Presumably it was never a point of view that caused a ban, but the way that a point of view was operated. Watch out for, though, the infamous "I told my password to my buddy" or the "I was in the bathroom, and my buddy must have gotten on my computer" dodge.

<p>Earlier today <a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESatyrTN_0a7c.html" title="User:SatyrTN">SatyrTN</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/t/User_talk%7ESatyrTN_2573.html" title="User talk:SatyrTN">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SatyrTN_f368.html" title="Special:Contributions/SatyrTN">contribs</a>) added speedy deletion tags to a few "19xx in gay rights" articles that presently redirect to <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_LGBT_history_ad59.html" title="Timeline of LGBT history">Timeline of LGBT history</a>. He was reverted by several administrators, including myself, because the grounds on which he was nominating them "redirect to incorrect article" didn't make sense to us. I talked to the user on his talk page and the reasoning seems logical, the methods just seem odd. SatyrTN is looking to have those deleted so that they no longer appear as blue links on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_years_in_gay_rights.html" title="List of years in gay rights">List of years in gay rights</a> and instead are redlinked so that it encourages creation of these articles.</p>
<p>When looking into this further, I found <a href="../../../u/n/d/Special%7EUndelete_Talk%7E1925_in_gay_rights_delete_a13e.html" title="Special:Undelete/Talk:1925 in gay rights/delete">Special:Undelete/Talk:1925_in_gay_rights/delete</a> this deletion log which contains the discussion in which it was decided to change a bunch of the articles to redirects to the timeline. It's slightly odd...the deletion debate was decided on December 27, 2004 at Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/1925 in gay rights. That same day, <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancs2000_6420.html" title="User:Francs2000">Francs2000</a> (<a href="../../../f/r/a/User_talk%7EFrancs2000_b4ed.html" title="User talk:Francs2000">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Francs2000_81b4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Francs2000">contribs</a>) moved the discussion to <a href="../../../1/9/2/Talk%7E1925_in_gay_rights_delete_cc5a.html" title="Talk:1925 in gay rights/delete">Talk:1925 in gay rights/delete</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/j/User%7EJoJan_2b10.html" title="User:JoJan">JoJan</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/j/User_talk%7EJoJan_552d.html" title="User talk:JoJan">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JoJan_5450.html" title="Special:Contributions/JoJan">contribs</a>) deleted the Talk page on August 29, 2005 as being a talk page for a non-existant article (which makes sense because Francs2000 moved it directly to the talk space instead of moving anything with it to the main space) and the redirect to that page created in the move was deleted in December of 2005.</p>
<p>So here's what I want to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>What should be done with the redirects?
<ul>
<li>RFD them as a group?</li>
<li>Leave them as is and suggest the LGBT wikiproject create a "To do" list with those on them?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What should be done with the deletion debate?
<ul>
<li>Was Francs2000's move common practice in late 2004?</li>
<li>Should the deleted discussion be restored?</li>
<li>If restored, should it be moved back to Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/1925 in gay rights or stay at the talk page?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Any guidance would be much appreciated. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 16:14, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wow - I didn't know there was so much history behind a couple redirect pages!&#160;:) All in all, it's probably not worth too much discussion and worry. I'm in the process of adding some things to pages in that listing, so the "Leave them alone..." option is probably best.

<li>Do some research and add the sources yourself. Or, since the sources have been provided, save yourself time by copying them into the article. You could have probably done that in less time than it took you to write the above. If you can't do any of that: try the unreferenced tag.

<dd>(<i>2x edit conflict - comment from ceyockey</i>) Well, I wouldn't suggest you step into the PROD pond as way of encouraging sourcing. There has been recent discussion around potentially inappropriate usage of PROD on articles that, though unsourced, are verifiable (the discussions surrounding the conduct of user Alan.ca). Use of PROD or deletion paths is not an appropriate alternative for application of cleanup-related templates. <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Incidents_947b.html#Mall_majors_and_anchors_-_without_source" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents">Elsewhere it has been commented</a> that people who are recalcitrant with respect to adding sources might be suitable subjects for <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a> .. though I've not been involved in going that route myself previously.

<dd>Clearly, the best way to approach the issue would be to add all of the sources yourself, but I'm assuming you don't care or don't want to spend the time on it. If <i>no one</i> cares or wants to spend the time on it, then Wikipedia probably doesn't need the article. It should also be pointed out that even if the <i>subject</i> is notable, the <i>article</i> must be verifiable, so a bad article about a good subject may very well merit deletion.</dd>

<dd>If there are editors who can find reliable sources and are willing to improve the article, it should be kept. But if you come back in a few weeks and find the article in the same shape, then go ahead and put it up for AfD again. If the same people make the same promises to improve the article, but never do, it will be deleted eventually.

<dd>I would say wait a month or two, and if by that time no-one's used the supposed sources to verify the article, there's two options: either a) the given sources are actually trivial and can't be used to verify anything that would be relevant in the article, or b) no-one cares enough to do the necessary work.

<p>A major problem with not putting the sources from the AFD discussion into the article, is that it regularly leads to the article being nominated for deletion <i>again</i>, months later. (One example: <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">Badlydrawnjeff</a> cited some sources in an AFD discussion for some drinking games, didn't cite any of them in the actual articles, and the articles ended up coming back to AFD a second time, months later.) It's in the interest of those not wanting to have the same AFD discussion all over again to put the sources in the article, so that other editors don't have to track down the deletion discussion simply in order to find them (or even to know that there actually are sources to be had in the first place — The drinking game articles didn't use the same names for the games as the sources did.) and then to improve the article using them.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it's also important to remember the principle of collaborative editing. If editor A finds and cites some sources, then editor B can <i>help to improve the article</i>, and help to reduce the repeat traffic at AFD, by copying the citations into a "Further reading" section of the article. There are editors at AFD who copy citations into the articles. There are also editors at AFD who cite sources directly in the article in the first place. (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> is one name that immediately comes to mind.)</p>
<p>Note that an editor citing sources in an AFD discussion but refusing to place the citations in the article is quite different from an editor not providing any sources at all, for material that other editors have not been able to source, and not responding, either on talk pages or in edit summaries, to any of the requests for citations made of them over a period of six months. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 14:55, 27 December 2006 (UTC) <span id="63292075196"></span> <a name="Strange_e-mail" id="Strange_e-mail"></a></p>

<dd>Hehe - yep. Any admin can remove access to the program from any user, or disable any version (from the pages linked off the checkpage). As well as deleting new pages, I've put stuff in it for admins to delete/keep prods and images, after entering the category of their choice (after a suggestion by <a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEagle_101_bfb5.html" title="User:Eagle 101">Eagle 101</a>).

<p>Many pages in Wikipedia namespace serve to explain to (novice or unfamiliar) users why we do things in a certain way. We should distinguish between pages that explain how things work in practice, and pages that give somebody's opinion on how things should work. Traditionally, we have called the former {{<a href="../../../g/u/i/Template%7EGuideline_29bd.html" title="Template:Guideline">guideline</a>}}, the latter {{<a href="../../../e/s/s/Template%7EEssay_6343.html" title="Template:Essay">essay</a>}}. Since anyone can write an essay for any reason, they are not authoritative, and people learning how Wikipedia works tend to ignore them.</p>
<p>Off late, the distinction has become problematic. A (new) page that explains how things work tends to become a locus for people who don't like the way things work. Such people vehemently object to calling such a page "guideline", generally because they think of guidelines as binding rules (even though the tag says they're not) or because they think formal process wasn't followed in creating the guideline (even though no such formal process exists, and discussion suffices).</p>
<p>Though several others exist, a good example is <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a>. Several people work that way, several others don't like that. There are no apparent objections to what the page actually <i>says</i>, but people object to the page because of the way it can (allegedly) be abused.</p>
<p>Wikipedia can be confusing, so informing and educating users is important. So how do we deal with this? Do we say that guidelines are no big deal, and being guided by practice is not problematic? Do we need a new tag for "this page explains how Wikipedia works"? Would there be a meaningful distinction between the latter and "guideline"? Should we make a formal way of writing guidelines? This dispute is flaring on several pages, so it's desirable to have a general principle about explanatory pages. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 12:37, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Perhaps it would be useful to define "Guideline" in a clear manner. E.g., and this is off the top of my bean: "Guidelines represent a set of practices that have precedence and which represent the point of view of many Wikipedians. They are not rules, and violating them is not a matter for dispute resolution, but they will inform the reader of the way things are commonly done." Something like that? Anything that does the "this is a bill which is on its way to becoming a law as soon as the president signs it" kind of talk will be off putting. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrowbait_dbc7.html" title="User:Crowbait">Crowbait</a> 17:59, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There have been several IPs editing the <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broly.html" title="Broly">Broly</a> talk page and they all sign their comments with "<i>(shadowsok)</i>" and sometimes "<i>(shadowsok@aol.com)</i>". They also seem to have the same spelling patterns. The most recent IP to edit the article claims that he has edited an article prior to the talk page but when I checked his contributions, the talk page was the only page he's edited. I've noticed that most of the other IPs have only made one or two edits to the talk page. I would be grateful if someone could go through the history and the IPs and see what's going on. // <a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESasuke-kun27_416b.html" title="User:Sasuke-kun27"><font color="blue"><b>Sasuke</b></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sasuke-kun27_a050.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sasuke-kun27"><font color="purple"><b>-kun</b></font></a><a href="../../../s/a/s/User_talk%7ESasuke-kun27_30a7.html" title="User talk:Sasuke-kun27"><font color="black"><b>27</b></font></a> 17:32, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

Rather, they're for people who have some special relevance to a religion (or <i>vice versa</i>). I've tried discussing it with him, but he seems either unable or unwilling to engage in discussion, instead accusing me of being a radical atheist who thinks that anons shouldn't edit.</p>
<p>First, am I right about religion categories? Secondly, if I am, could someone else try to reason with him? I'm getting nowhere.

<dd>To take <a href="../../../j/e/w/Category%7EJews_79b6.html" title="Category:Jews">Category:Jews</a>, there is a subcategory <a href="../../../j/e/w/Category%7EJews_by_occupation_99dc.html" title="Category:Jews by occupation">Jews by occupation</a>, the subcategories of which refer to people who are Jewish, but their notability has nothing to do with it.

<p>Yes, I suppose so. There is no category for Muslim footballers (or any other sportspeople). perhaps the anon could be persuaded to create one. (To be honest, I can't see much point in all this categorising of people in ways that are important to certain editors but not at all to the significance of the subjects, but I suppose that there's not much chance of doing anything about that.)

<p>Can I get some admin eyes on Rrcoachella (<a href="../../../r/r/c/User_talk%7ERrcoachella_4e17.html" title="User talk:Rrcoachella">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Rrcoachella_a949.html" title="Special:Contributions/Rrcoachella">contribs</a>)? I've been dealing with his contributions for a month now and it's getting frustrating. Of the 185 edits this user has made as of 00:37, December 28, 2006, 138 of them have been to his own user page. All of these edits have been to promote his own singing "career" in some way, shape, or form. Of the 185, 42 have been to the mainspace. Of those, I count <i>maybe</i> half a dozen that I'd consider valid edits (i.e. improved the article in some way and weren't reverted). About 20 or so of those mainspace edits have been to add himself to other articles like the release of his album in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007_in_music.html" title="2007 in music">2007 in music</a> and things of that nature. In addition, he also created a bunch of articles such as Heart &amp; Soul (album) which were meant to promote his own "albums." He has made 3 user talk edits, 1 to <a href="../../../k/e/t/User_talk%7EKetchuplmao_03da.html" title="User talk:Ketchuplmao">User talk:Ketchuplmao</a> who was blocked indefinitely the week before (so I reverted the comment left there) and 2 blankings of his talk page. There are 0 other edits in other wikispaces except for images where he's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Rrcoachella" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Rrcoachella" rel="nofollow">uploaded 9 photos</a> and all have (or will) be deleted.</p>
<p>I thought the issues with the vanity in the mainspace had ended awhile ago until his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=O_Holy_Night&amp;diff=96384433&amp;oldid=96288711" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=O_Holy_Night&amp;diff=96384433&amp;oldid=96288711" rel="nofollow">edits</a> to <a href="../../../o/_/h/O_Holy_Night_e345.html" title="O Holy Night">O Holy Night</a> today (which he self-reverted). I'm at a loss as to what to do here. I gave him a final warning a few weeks ago to stop creating inappropriate articles and he seems to have stopped that. And I gave him another final warning today <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Rrcoachella&amp;diff=96834774&amp;oldid=95794968" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Rrcoachella&amp;diff=96834774&amp;oldid=95794968" rel="nofollow">[80]</a> for vanity in the mainspace after the O Holy Night edits. In my message to him today I ask him to try to help us build an encyclopedia rather than concentrating on his self-promotion through his user page. The talk page was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Rrcoachella&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=96834774" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Rrcoachella&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=96834774" rel="nofollow">blanked</a> 20 minutes later. Since my message, he has made 18 edits to his user page, blanked the talk page, and uploaded a CD cover for his album without a source or license. Obviously my message went unheeded.</p>
<p>Can anyone else try talking to him or suggest something? He's obviously a teenaged kid who has an obsession with music, particular things related to <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_School_Musical_6c70.html" title="High School Musical">High School Musical</a>, but I'm not seeing anything productive coming from the account at all.

<dd>Under the Bridgeman decision, it doesn't matter who owns the painting or who took the picture. If the picture is a exacting 2D reproduction of a 2D work, then there is no new copyright created by scanning/photographing it. That said, some of these images are not simple reproductions of 2D works, they include elements like the frame and as such their status is not clarified by Bridgeman v. Corel. --<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 21:03, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If the museum has not released its rights yet (assuming it owns the copyright), the pictures have no business being on wikipedia merely on the contingency that someone has written to obtain permission from it in the future. The museum (or the real owner) might sue wikipedia when it comes to know these pictures are lifted from the site without proper license. Plus, the Bridgeman v. Corel case might not be considered valid outside the USA (even if it is valid, these images are not simple scans and include additional elements, as has been pointed out by Gmaxwell above, and not all of them are more than 100 years old either). Besides, the above are <b>not</b> all from a single website. ­</p>

I tried to come across the point that IMDB is far more reliable source rather than the site he/she provides, which appears as a personal website, hoping that my input added upon the other users would pursue ALLtheTrue to stop reintroducing the external link. ALLtheTrue view on the situation is that IMDB filmography is wrong and the external link he/she provides is far more reliable/better.

<p>By this way you say Wikipedia links reserved only for big websites&#160;? Then, why is free encyclopedia&#160;?</p>
<p>I think what the main problem here is the fact that it contains porn, not the fact that it is a smaller website. That's what I gather from this discussion. --KindGoat 03:29, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This post is a follow-up to the vandalism recently seen on the Main page. Unlike the other template vandalism seen recently, this one was because a page transcluded onto the Main page was left unprotected when it shouldn't have been. Discussion of this seems to have taken place mostly at the following three locations:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../m/a/i/Talk%7EMain_Page_649b.html#Vandalism" title="Talk:Main Page">Talk:Main_Page#Vandalism</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html#Main_Page_vandalism" title="WP:AN">WP:AN#Main_Page_vandalism</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html#Vandalism_on_Main_Page" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI#Vandalism on Main Page</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Following the vandalism and discussions described and linked above, I thought I'd look ahead through the templates and see how far ahead the protection extends for the content of the five templates with changing content, I've come up with the following regarding protection status:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../p/o/t/Wikipedia%7EPOTD_row_6c11.html" title="Wikipedia:POTD row">Wikipedia:POTD row</a> is transcluded in the form of a page with the title[[Wikipedia:POTD row/{{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTDAY}}, {{CURRENTYEAR}}]]. These pages are created for each day, and have currently been created up to and including 24th January. They seem to be edited for a bit and then protected. The current status is that they are protected up to and including 11 January 2007. Pages have been created for 12-24th January, but haven't been protected yet. I've left a note at <a href="../../../p/i/c/Wikipedia_talk%7EPicture_of_the_day_fc30.html#Protection_of_PotD_row" title="Wikipedia talk:Picture of the day">Wikipedia_talk:Picture_of_the_day#Protection_of_PotD_row</a>.</li>
<li><a href="../../../s/e/l/Wikipedia%7ESelected_anniversaries_88c4.html" title="Wikipedia:Selected anniversaries">Wikipedia:Selected_anniversaries</a> is transcluded in the form of a page with the title [[Wikipedia:Selected_anniversaries/{{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTDAY}}]]. It looks like these pages already exist for the entire year and are reused each year (ie. they do not need to be created). They are currently protected up until 31 December. As this is a cyclic system (unlike the POTD and FA systems), the pages seem to be unprotected as soon as they leave the main page, so they can be edited for the next appearance and for where-ever else they appear (other pages and via the random featured content generator).</li>
<li><a href="../../../t/o/d/Wikipedia%7EToday%27s_featured_article_6658.html" title="Wikipedia:Today's featured article">Wikipedia:Today's featured article</a> is transcluded in the form of a page with the title[[Wikipedia:Today's featured article/{{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTDAY}}, {{CURRENTYEAR}}]]. These pages are created for each day, and have currently been created up to 31 March. They have been selected up to and including 27 December, and are protected up to 31 December.</li>
<li><a href="../../../d/i/d/Wikipedia%7EDid_you_know_b520.html" title="Wikipedia:Did you know">Wikipedia:Did you know</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/_/Wikipedia%7EIn_the_news_3781.html" title="Wikipedia:In the news">Wikipedia:In the news</a> are collections of short items that are added directly to a template, and so there is not a succession of pages to protect in the same way as is done for the other three sections. The main concern here is remembering to protect images used in those templates, just as for the images used in the other three sections.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, following all this, what is the best way to make it less likely that one of these images or one of these pages is not left unprotected again in the future?</p>
<p>The current systems seem to operate in three ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) A team of people working on it. The team then has to have a way of indicating to others on the team that a protection has been done, but when protection is not done and no-one notices, then vandals notice instead.</li>
<li>(2) One person takes primary responsibility, as with the Featured Article. From what I can see, Raul, as Featured Article Director, selects the featured article for a particular day and updates the template and protects it. As long as the person responsible doesn't forget, this works fine.</li>
<li>(3) Anyone adding an image to a page or template that will appear on the Main page is expected to remember to protect it. Not sure what fail-safes are in place here.</li>
</ul>
<p>One proposal at the moment is to have a bot generate a list of transcluded items on the Main Page (and the featured article) and say whether or not they are protected, and then alert someone if they are not protected. See <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_Requests_for_approval_Shadowbot2_6a5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval/Shadowbot2">Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval/Shadowbot2</a>.</p>
<p>I posted this here, because I don't think <a href="../../../m/a/i/Talk%7EMain_page_fb00.html" title="Talk:Main page">Talk:Main page</a> is appropriate.

<dd>A few other administrators and myself used to take responsibility for this; I usually logged in right after the day changed in UTC and protected the next day's images and templates and unprotected those now off the Main Page. After a few months, the other administrators had taken some of the slack, per se, and I stopped my routine of protecting and unprotecting. This method of having a few people taking care of doing protection and unprotection worked well, as it was rare that one of us wouldn't be able to do the job. I think this method would be still be acceptable and should continue: human oversight would always be there. (Anchoress and other non-admins: if you ever notice a template or image not protected, you can notify an administrator immediately, hopefully in a non-discreet manner.) However, a bot assisting us in this capacity would make the process easier and more failproof. While I'm not too sure having the bot actually protect the page is a good idea, given vulnerabilities for technical mistakes, etc., a bot could easily double-check the work and alert certain whitelisted administrators via email if a current image or template was not protected. (See the <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_Requests_for_approval_Shadowbot2_6a5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval/Shadowbot2">bot's proposal page</a>.) On a related note, I will also attempt to help out more often now and return to my routine of protection and unprotection; the more eyes, the better it is.

When, early this morning Pacific time, I saw the first warning about the image, I had been watching my watchlist (which lists most of the major admin pages) and had noticed that there were almost no admins posting, so in the interest of getting the word out as quickly as possible, I posted in several places, including the talkpage of the admin who'd most recently posted anywhere (that I could see), and also to the AIV page, an action which resulted in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrator_intervention_against_vandalism&amp;diff=96282037&amp;oldid=96281901" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrator_intervention_against_vandalism&amp;diff=96282037&amp;oldid=96281901" rel="nofollow">this gentle scolding, in the edit summary.</a> I'm not hurt or offended by the comment, but I think it should be agreed-upon that, when these vandals strike (especially when it's early Sunday + Xmas eve morning and not a creature is stirring, not even a mouse), it is of not only primary importance, but almost sole importance, to get the giant diseased scrotum or whatever removed ASAP. Particularly since this is an unique type of vandalism, where just knowing where it is isn't enough, just knowing that it exists isn't enough, the more help the merrier is the remedy until the second the image is found and removed. I might not have been so quick to post there (AIV) at 6pm on a Wednesday night (although I probably would have after a few minutes if the image wasn't gone), but I don't think such actions should be looked upon as a misuse of the project pages, not in this specific type of instance. <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnchoress_3b7f.html" title="User:Anchoress">Anchoress</a> 04:21, 25 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Voice of All has a bot on RFP that checks for protections/unprotections; perhaps it would be possible for the same code to be used and pointed at anything transcluded to the main page. Is there a staging ground where the next day's main page is prepared, where the bot could scan the day ahead and there would be 24 hours for all the pages/images to be protected? <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">(<small>Talk</small>)</font></a></span> 23:03, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The main problem with a team system is when people drift away or move on. It needs to be made clear to whatever small team does this that there is a short, simple checklist to follow and once you have done it, you tick a list somewhere to confirm that you have done it. And the key is to make sure that if you can't do it, that you pass the baton on to someone else. Probably a buddy system would help as well. Two people marked down to do this everyday, and if one is ill or whatever, the other one should be able to step in to the breach. The bot would be good as this fail-safe system, but really needs to alert people <i>before</i> the pages are transcluded onto the Main page, so it should be given a 'future' list to work with, plus a bot to scan image links more frequently than daily. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 22:59, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Part of the problem is that images used on the main page, especially for 'In the news', are changed quite regularly, maybe every couple of hours, not just every day. The regulars at the moment know that protecting the images is essential, but you have to try and have a warning system that still works when humans make mistakes, forget things, or move on without training a replacement. There are really, though, only <b>three</b> pages that need checking 24 hours before:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../t/o/d/Wikipedia%7EToday%27s_featured_article_April_10%2C_2007_2ad8.html" title="Wikipedia:Today's featured article/April 10, 2007">TFA</a> - tomorrow's featured article section</li>
<li><a href="../../../s/e/l/Wikipedia%7ESelected_anniversaries_April_10_ff3c.html" title="Wikipedia:Selected anniversaries/April 10">SA</a> - tomorrow's selected anniversaries section</li>
<li>POTD - tomorrow's featured picture of the day section</li>
</ul>
<p>Which codes as:</p>
<ul>
<li>[[Wikipedia:Today's featured article/{{tomorrow}}, {{#switch:{{{{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTDAY}}}}|December 31={{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+1}}|#default={{CURRENTYEAR}}}}|TFA]]</li>
<li>[[Wikipedia:Selected anniversaries/{{tomorrow}}|SA]]</li>
<li>[[Wikipedia:POTD row/{{tomorrow}}, {{#switch:{{{{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTDAY}}}}|December 31={{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+1}}|#default={{CURRENTYEAR}}}}|POTD]]</li>
</ul>
<p>The other main page transclusions are watched and edited actively, but these sections are: (a) created in advance; (b) sometimes edited before protection; (c) sometimes prepared days or weeks in advance; (d) because they are prepared in advance, double-checking for protection is not always done. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 00:30, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If it's possible to detect what is protected on the page, would it be technically possible to prevent the page or any subsidiary template from saving if anything in it was unprotected, similar to the url spam blacklist?--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 00:46, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>One change which might make this alot easier would be to show the 'protection status' next to each transcluded page in the list which is given when you are editing the page they are transcluded onto. In such case any admin who clicked 'edit' on the Main page would immediately see a list of component pages and whether any of them were not protected. This would also be helpful for tracking vandalism on the 'article of the day'. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 14:41, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Is there any way to extend this to images? Is there any easy way to prevent someone accidentally inline linking to an unprotected image that is used in a sensitive area?

<dl>
<dd>Well, theoretically it might be possible to have images brought in by each template listed under them. Something like;
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../t/l/_/Template%7ETl_75f5.html" title="Template:Tl">Template:Tl</a> (semi-protected)</li>
<li><a href="../../../t/o/m/Template%7ETomorrow_947d.html" title="Template:Tomorrow">Template:Tomorrow</a> (unprotected)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../s/u/n/Image%7ESunrise.jpg_f9f3.html" title="Image:Sunrise.jpg">Image:Sunrise.jpg</a> (protected)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="../../../i/f/n/Template%7EIfnot_431d.html" title="Template:Ifnot">Template:Ifnot</a> (unprotected)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Of course, that could get to be a pretty involved list with protection status of all templates and images displayed. At that point I might suggest moving it off the 'edit' page to a separate 'page inclusion map' linked from each page. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBDunkerson</a> (<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_CBDunkerson_ea5b.html" title="Special:Contributions/CBDunkerson">contribs</a>) 19:54, 27 December 2006 (UTC).</small>
<dl>
<dd>That would be good. If done at the software level, that would detect this sort of thing faster than a bot that runs every hour or so. A bot could maybe check the list generated by the software and alert people if anything was unprotected. Could an alert be programmed into the software? Like the alerts that tell people if they've forgotten to subst a template that needs subst'ing? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 15:35, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Good analysis Carcharoth. Just as a note, the vandals do watch this stuff. I updated DYK a bit ago and bobbled the image protection. <a href="../../../u/s/_/Image%7EUS_National_Christmas_Tree_1923.jpg_e237.html" title="Image:US National Christmas Tree 1923.jpg">Image:US National Christmas Tree 1923.jpg</a> was protected on commons but I forgot to protect it here on en:wp... the updating admin for DYK is supposed to make sure that gets done properly, and in this case, I didn't do that.

We are all human and such slips will happen. That is the the important point here. The bot that has been written to check protections <i>should</i> be able to catch such human mistakes and forgetfulness in future. I think that is preferable to putting pressure on the admins responsible to not forget, and to hoping that vandals won't twig about how they can do stuff like this. The bot can check the templates that change on the Main Page, but the images (which can change anytime) are more of a problem. I wonder if there is a technical tweak that can be done so that a page can be marked to only display protected images and ignore unprotected images. Possibly something like a new namespace like Protected image:example? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 02:31, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>I'm not saying either of these is correct, but they are circumstances that might lead to the rather unusual request.</i> I will venture a speculation - if someone recognizes that they have a mental illness where they cannot effectively control their actions under some circumstances, that person having an unblocked Wikipedia account is an invitation to improper behavior that the user cannot effectively be held responsible for as it is a result of their mental illness. Another possibility is that the computer is shared among people in a household and there is no way to control use of the stated username - one of the editors is concerned about potential bad behavior on the part of another user on the same computer. --User:Ceyockey (<small><i><a href="../../../c/e/y/User_talk%7ECeyockey_b802.html" title="User talk:Ceyockey">talk to me</a></i></small>) 14:18, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A rather strongheaded newbie made the following <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Solomon%27s_Temple&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=96116479" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Solomon%27s_Temple&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=96116479" rel="nofollow">statement</a> and was blocked.

I have to seriously disagree here.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, we cannot punish for something a person didn't do.</li>
<li>Second, it should be pretty obvious that the person simply doesn't know about our 3RR policy otherwise he would not write such stupid announcement.</li>
<li>Third, this person obviously does not understand what wikipedia is (he wrote <i>"So you decide&#160;: either a creative encyclopedia or a robotintellectual encyclopedia."</i>): instead of hitting him with the sledgehammer an admin has to talk to the person. All talks a've seen in his talk page was of kind "don't do this"</li>
<li>Fourth, this action sizzled: the person doesn't edit since Dec 23, and if I were him, I'd think it was rather stupid to block a person who is not even here.</li>
<li>Fifth. While for some he may look a kook, a brief internet search revealed that the disputed issue is indeed disputed to some extent. And it is not covered in the article. I cannot evaluate the prominence of this dispute, but I see it is not even discussed in the talk page. So IMO biting this newbie is outright detrimental to the article.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever this discussion, the major question is: <b>"does the threat of disruption constitute a blockable offense"</b>?

<dd>Mikka, I see where you are coming from and agree that the user was obviously new and shows a lack of understanding to a point that being talked to may be all that is needed. However, I agree with the initial block (I haven't looked at exact timing, but in principal) based on a threat of disruption. That said, if there is no reason to believe the user would start or continue disrupting Wikipedia upon being unblocked, the block has apparently served its purpose of preventing disruption and there would be no reason to keep the block. -- <a href="../../../r/e/n/User%7ERenesis13_6b6b.html" title="User:Renesis13">Renesis</a> (<a href="../../../r/e/n/User_talk%7ERenesis13_5466.html" title="User talk:Renesis13">talk</a>) 19:35, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Sorry, Uncle G. <i>Threat</i> of disruption isn't really valid, IMO, as much as threat of <i>continued</i> disruption is. After all, everyone is a threat to disrupt (except me, of course...I'm placid as an unmuddied stream, as an azure sky). We really need to watch out for reaching for the "irremediable" label too quickly, even though 9 of 10 times we'd be right.

<dd>I don't follow your logic. You say everyone is a threat to disrupt, but surely the statement of intent to disrupt distinguishes this one user from the masses of general probability. I also do not think the user is even close to "irredeemable", that is why the block was only 24 hours. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 17:33, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Archive68_906e.html" title="Edit section: IP blocking and Internet technology awareness">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">IP blocking and Internet technology awareness</span></h2>
<p>I've been a longtime Wikipedia editor, editing from various IP addresses (home, work, on the road). I recently created this account so that I could avoid a problem I saw way too much as anonymous editor: blocked IPs. However, now I'm finding that even with an account I have difficulty finding an IP on the road that's not blocked. I've been looking into what's leading to these blocks and it does not appear to be called for in most cases (or just an overreaction). I think part of the problem has to do with misconceptions about how the internet works. Specifically an ignorance of <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1918.html" class="external text" title="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1918.html" rel="nofollow">RFC 1918</a> and it's growing ubiquity. With <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918" class="external" title="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918">RFC 1918</a>, what appears to be a single IP address affecting one machine and presumably one user.</p>
<p>This first arose for me with Tmobile hotspots which use a single IP (or maybe a few) for their 8,000 internet hotspots throughout the US. I reported this issue to <a href="../../../a/b/u/Wikipedia%7EAbuse_reports_baf1.html#208.54.95.129_.28talk_.E2.80.A2_contribs_.E2.80.A2_WHOIS_.E2.80.A2_RDNS_.E2.80.A2_RBLs_.E2.80.A2_block_user_.E2.80.A2_block_log.29" title="Wikipedia:Abuse reports">ISP reporting</a> and I am trying to work with them to get something worked out. However, there is clearly a problem of administrator awareness and misconceptions about the meaning of an IP address. Often time an IP can be cleanly associated with a single house or office. However, more and more private WAN networks make use of a single public IP address to sever thousands or millions of private IP addresses. This is a network topology decision. The network administrators could have chosen instead to purchase thousands of public IP addresses. Administrators should try to be aware of this and it would be best if Wikipedia could compile a list somewhere of these important IPs. It's not that such an IP should never be blocked, but rather the same caution should be exercised in blocking a shared IP with thousands of private IPs behind it that an admin would exercises in blocking a thousand IPs.</p>
<p>The WikiMedia foundation has a <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/XFF_project/RFC_1918" class="extiw" title="meta:XFF_project/RFC_1918">XFF-RFC1918 Project</a> that may help with this too, but it's not entirely clear because the issue I'm talking about does not involve a proxy server (a work I see thrown around a lot by admins), but is instead simply a NAT router with a single IP address and hundreds, thousand, or even millions of private IPs. Until the WikiMedia foundation and its developers can work something out the best approach is to raise awareness among admins and to try to learn where these RFC1918 IPs are and create a list of them. --<a href="../../../3/6/0/User%7E360P_eeaf.html" title="User:360P">360P</a> 23:48, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I appreciate that effort. It would probably be a good idea to develop a template specifically for that sort of shared IP address. From an administrative standpoint I don't see a reason to treat a wireless hotspot as inherently different from a school or a public library. <font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charg</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><span style="color:#0c0">e!</span></a></i></sup></font> 00:40, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If I may clarify a bit, because this is exactly the misconception I think 560P trying to overcome. Certainly a hotspot or a LAN should not be treated any differently than any other LAN (even a school ro public library). What we're trying to convey is in terms of the scale of the effects of a particular block. A block of an IP shared by a school effects that school. A block of an IP for a WFi hotspot effects everyone at that hotspot. However, a block of 208.54.95.129 or 208.54.95.1 effects a good portion of 8,000 LANs across the US. Imagine if every school shared a single IP, or every middle school. We would want to find some other way of handling that IP: to treat it with some more conern when blocking. Well this is whole heck of a lot of WiFi hotspots, so it's something that should be treated as such. It's much the same rule for such an IP as for a dynamic IP where the editors affected are largely different than the editor targeted (though in this case you should get the targeted editor too). When blocking the tmobile IP is't the same as blocking 10.0.0.0/8. It's not that this means the IP should never ever be blocked (though it's quite a pain in my ass). It just means administrators should understand the significance of the block. --<a href="../../../2/0/8/User%7E208.54.95.129.html" title="User:208.54.95.129">208.54.95.129</a> 02:02, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I just saw this after my previous post in support of 560P. Yes, I've come to see the Cplot thing everytime I try to edit and I hate it (or him or her or whatever). So my advice is either get someone to make Cplot stop or help us treat this IP the way it should be treated (like the proposed WikiMedia Foundation <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/XFF_project/RFC_1918" class="extiw" title="meta:XFF_project/RFC_1918">XFF-RFC1918 Project</a>), or both. Also be aware that a block of this IP affects other editors But above all, please stop treating us all like garbage because we use the same ISP as Cplot. At the very least administrators could provide the requested diffs that justify an IP block on the <a href="../../../2/0/8/User_talk%7E208.54.95.129.html" title="User talk:208.54.95.129">talk page</a> so we're not sitting there wondering why we've been blocked yet again.. --<a href="../../../2/0/8/User%7E208.54.95.129.html" title="User:208.54.95.129">208.54.95.129</a> 02:07, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
