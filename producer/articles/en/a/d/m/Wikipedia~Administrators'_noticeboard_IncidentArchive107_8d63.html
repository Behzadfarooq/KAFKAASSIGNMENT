<dd>Someone mentioned, I don't recall where, something along the lines of <i>Wikipedianism is emerging as a religion</i> (italicized owing to this being a paraphrase).

<dd>The user vandalised my page this morning for the same reasons; I had reverted their attempts to place pictures into articles where they have been told many times they can not because of violating fair use (as well as continually trying to change release dates in select <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phish.html" title="Phish">Phish</a> albums).

<p>Greetings, having been following the mailing list WikiEn-I, I recently caught notice of <a href="../../../r/g/u/User%7ERgulerdem_75f6.html" title="User:Rgulerdem">Resid Gulerdem</a> formulating a policy entitled: <a href="../../../o/u/r/WP%7EOURS_ceb7.html" title="WP:OURS">WP:OURS</a>. <a href="../../../r/a/p/User%7ERaphael1_183b.html" title="User:Raphael1">User:Raphael1</a> has just begun steps to put <a href="../../../r/g/u/User%7ERgulerdem_75f6.html" title="User:Rgulerdem">User:Rgulerdem</a>'s policy proposal in place on Wikipedia by starting its page and shortcut. I think it is rather obvious that permanently blocked users formulating policy is <b>bad</b> and due to this I am inclined to submit Wikipedia:OURS for speedy deletion but without previous experience concerning such a situation I've submitted it as a <a href="../../../m/i/s/Wikipedia%7EMiscellany_for_deletion_Wikipedia%7EOURS_b76a.html" title="Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Wikipedia:OURS">miscellaneous for deletion</a>. Does it make more sense to <b>speedy delete</b> this banned user's proposed policy outright to clearly demonstrate that banned user's formulating policy is <b>bad</b> or should the MfD be allowed to continue?

<dd>Large parts of this policy has been formulated by myself. Though discussions on the WikiEn-I mailing list admittedly have been my inspiration. <a href="../../../r/a/p/User%7ERaphael1_183b.html" title="User:Raphael1">Raphael1</a> 17:15, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There certainly seems to be a lot of tag-team editing between Rgulerdem and Raphael1. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 17:18, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well viewed Zoe, well viewed... I think that such editing is described as "proxy editing" no? Proxy editing for a banned user is <b>bad</b> is it not? <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott">Netscott</a> 17:21, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>That would seem a reasonable response considering the involvement of a non-blocked editor. As for "proxy editing", I don't think engaging in conversations via paraphrasing and discussion outcomes qualifies as "proxy editing" as such. In such a case as this, wouldn't assuming good faith on the part of Raphael1 be in order?

<dd>I think Irish's point that we oughtn't to be as concerned with the identity of the contributor as with the quality of the proposal is an important one.

<p>I initially blocked User:Irishpunktom for edit-warring and trying to game the system, based on this edit summary: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Peter_Tatchell&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=57024497" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Peter_Tatchell&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=57024497" rel="nofollow">self revert - gotta wait an hour or so</a>. After looking more closely at the edit history, I decided it would be more useful to lock the page. So I did that, and unblocked Irishpunktom.

<dd>I suggest that he is blocked for 24 hrs, because as the diffs show in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR#User:Irishpunktom_reported_by_User:Karl_Meier" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR#User:Irishpunktom_reported_by_User:Karl_Meier" rel="nofollow">3rr report</a> that I filed, he already violated 3rr before his <b>5th</b> revert that he himself reverted again, with the mentioned edit summary. So in any case he's in clear violation of 3rr. Another thing is that he also violated 3rr on the "islamophobia" article a few days ago, and he wasn't blocked for that eighter. He has already been blocked for 3rr 10 times, so he know the rule, but de just doesn't respect it. I am sure that if it is no longer enforced in his case, he will violate it even more than he usually do. -- <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarl_Meier_d697.html" title="User:Karl Meier">Karl Meier</a> 18:36, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>(edit conflict) This isn't particularly offering a suggestion for a solution, but just going by those blocks recorded in Irishpunktom's block log, this 3RR violation was at least his <b>10th</b> violation of the three revert rule. Most people tend to find themselves banned before reaching that number. And that edit summary does not bode well for future behavior. While the protection and unblock look like a good call, it is probably time for someone to bring an arbitration case against him for the long term solution. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 18:40, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>While I am of course not fluent in the circumstances, it is my opinion that anyone who has reached that level blocks for edit warring is probably going to be accepted with a coherent case presented to arbcom. Something can be a "last resort" a number of ways. In cases where it looks useless to go through other dispute resolution, or where the necessity of an enforceable remedy appears inevitable, we accept cases without an RFC. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 19:29, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Even without an Arbcom ruling, I think longer blocks are in order for any further violations. I initially was going to block for 24 hours, but when I saw his previous blocks I went for 31. He's been blocked for as long as 48 hours in the past. I'd say that or longer would be appropriate if there is any more edit warring. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 19:48, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Have only just come back after an evening meeting. It's sadly true that I have encountered Irishpunktom before, especially on <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Tatchell_6e4b.html" title="Peter Tatchell">Peter Tatchell</a> but also on other articles. The dispute arises because of his habit of automatically reverting without stating reasons, or stating uninformative reasons. Irishpunktom is a muslim: I often find his edits are highly POV (others may wish to check for themselves), but what sparked this recent problem was the addition of large amounts of detail on Peter Tatchell's views on Islam. This creates a POV problem of its own in that it distorts the significance of this part of Peter Tatchell's opinions, so I tried to prune the section back while not losing anything important. I'm not absolutely set on what came out, and I'm willing to debate what is the right way of the section, but I don't see why I should accept a blanket revert. Irishpunktom has not explained his objections to my edits on the talk page. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 21:13, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've found it annoying myself; Tatchell has a long history of fighting for gay rights going back 30 years, yet the current article devotes almost a third of its length to Islam, and has gone through numerous edits in a (in my view) twisted attempt by Irishpunktom to portray him as an Islamophobe rather than a simple defender of secular rights versus _all_ homophobic belief systems. --<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulmoloney_0154.html" title="User:Paulmoloney">Paul Moloney</a> 13:24, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I may add here that Irishpunktom exhibits this sort of behavior on many articles.

He moved <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_extremist_terrorism.html" title="Islamic extremist terrorism">Islamic extremist terrorism</a> without even attempting to discuss the move, just because he disliked some recent additions to the article. I could continue for several more paragraphs, but administrators' noticeboard is probably not the right place for that.

<p>I am writing this to you requesting that you forward this message to the correct forum, re appealing “speedly deletion” for (1), and suspected linkspamming’, from what I can make of it. The intent of our organization is to get our information out and not be stifled. I have looked at the mediation pages and a fair number of other methods, none of which are seemoingly clear and straightforward, that is not to say they are incoherent. If this message finds its way to someone that can help us resolve wiki problems, Great, if not then the information will be stifled until we on this end can figure the process. In any event; Thank you! Please advise. Mark, ceo, (ph 805-886-4773) The Organic Channel, Inc. The natural Channel, Inc.</p>
<p>OUR COMMENT: Our intent is to include our entry consistent with Wikipedia rule. Our organization has maintained links to wikipedia for a number of years already. There is nothing in our wiki content that seems to me to violate the four cardiinal rules. I am unaware is any url listing is contrary to wiki rules, if it is it is a rule not easily appearant, but we desire to comply with wiki rules and yet be included. We are a progressive organization that deserves simple inclusion in much the same manner as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_History_Channel" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_History_Channel" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_History_Channel</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Learning_Channel" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Learning_Channel" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Learning_Channel</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Discovery_Channel}}" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Discovery_Channel}}" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Discovery_Channel}}</a></p>

Thank you Samuel; I read what you wrote. I think there should be a distinction here at least regarding being deleted for self promotion, (is that a basis for deleteion in and of itself?) and the issue of whether a basis of being deleted for self promotion is even valid if nonetheless there is viable and valid content. There is an objective factual basis to our corporate existence, our filed trademark application(s) and the existence of video programs that can be viewed on our website, and thru limited public access televisions stationsall the result od hard and altruistic work. To be reduced to a speedly wiki deletion, is to me indicative of form over substance, maybe? We are prone to error as much as anyone else. Thank you!</p>

<p>For a long term I was an administrator here, routinely infuriating other administrators by not allowing them to abuse their power, until they finally got together &amp; gave me the boot. Since then I've had about 3,000 edits as <a href="../../../k/i/_/User%7EKI_05a2.html" title="User:KI">User:KI</a>, for the most part minding my own business and ignoring the same BS from the same people again and again.</p>
<p>Now I've been blocked for 3 months for one instance of vulgarity - which was in response to repeated vandalism of my talkpage by several administrators. Every account I've created to get around this ridiculous abuse of power has been indefinitely blocked as a "sockpuppet."</p>
<p>I caught someone using sockpuppets which is the <i>real</i> reason I was blocked. I was reblocked for longer - and note there was no justification for doing so - when I revealed that I was freestylefrappe.</p>
<p>I appealed to an administrator who has seemed reasonable in the past, but he was unwilling to unblock me because I used the phrase "bullshit."</p>
<p>I would like to be unblocked (both <a href="../../../k/i/_/User%7EKI_05a2.html" title="User:KI">User:KI</a> and <a href="../../../t/c/h/User%7ETchadienne_58ee.html" title="User:Tchadienne">User:Tchadienne</a>) so that I can run for adminship and infuriate all of you other admins asap.

<dd>Freestylefrappe, I know you're frustrated, but please remain civil at all times - you're not going to improve things by being tactless.

<p>Freestylefrappe, you are engaging in the some of the same behavior which got you deadminned, that being rude comments and removing other people's comments from your talk page. I think nobody will take you seriously unless you keep your cool and civil manners. Grand insinuations like you were given the boot because you were preventing admins from abusing their power don't help either. <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> (<a href="../../../o/l/e/User_talk%7EOleg_Alexandrov_0298.html" title="User talk:Oleg Alexandrov">talk</a>) 02:02, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Since I was heavily involved in Freestylefrappe's RfArb, I won't take admin action against him, but I urge that he be blocked for at least a week immediately -- that's the current block on the account he said he wanted to use, <a href="../../../t/c/h/User%7ETchadienne_58ee.html" title="User:Tchadienne">User:Tchadienne</a>. Sasquatch blocked <a href="../../../k/i/_/User%7EKI_05a2.html" title="User:KI">User:KI</a> indefinitely and lowered Tchadienne's block from indefinite to a week as as part of an agreement to let him make Tchadienne their main account <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Freestylefrappe&amp;curid=4063808&amp;diff=57101722&amp;oldid=57099364" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Freestylefrappe&amp;curid=4063808&amp;diff=57101722&amp;oldid=57099364" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>; he shouldn't be editing as Freestylefrappe in the meantime, especially not in the abusive manner he has so far today. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 02:51, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>We have a very interesting example of abusive editor in Bulgarian Wikipedia that is using very dirty language, threatening other editors, and using vulgar language. Recently he abused 2 of the administrators in Bulgarian Wikipedia. Unfortunately there is no Arbitration Cometee and Bulgarian Comunity in Wikipedia is not very well organizes to restrict the actions of that editor. In addition that editor has some contributions for the developement of the bulgarian project of Wikipedia and other editors are protecting him from ban.</p>
<p>The situation started 2 years ago, it escalated and a lot of new editors left the project because of the constant abuses from that editor. I tried to contact English Wikipedia 3 months ago, but I was not able to find the right procedure to report that case. The last resolution when I made the complain against that editor is in my discussion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Bogdev" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Bogdev" rel="nofollow">1</a> There are multiple examples of abuses from that editor, many discussions for that case in bulgarian Wikipedia, but all of them are in bulgarian language. Please advise what we can do to stop that abusive editor. He is proud of his actions and nobody can restrict his violations.</p>

<dd>If you don't have some sort of administrative process in the Bulgarian Wikipedia for these sorts of things, then take it to Meta (somewhere like <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Requests_for_permissions" class="extiw" title="m:Requests_for_permissions">m:Requests for permissions</a>, where a Bulgarian editor with community support could gain administrative powers and block the user).

<dd>There are administrators, that editor was blocked temporary many times and there is ongoing discussion to ban that editor permanently. But in the meantime that editor continue to abuse people, he is very proud of his actions and he is a very bad example for that comunity. I hope that bulgarian comunity will find the solution for that situation, at the same time I see that this is a problem for more that 2 years, dealing with that kind of abusive people is waste of time and energy for a lot of people. And allowinig abusive activities is also not acceptable.Bogdev 08:19, 6 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Indeed, this is true. Sounds to me like a permanent ban is a good idea. If that's a problem while disussion is ongoing, I would block him temporarily, and then if the discussion decides that he should be permanently banned, do so. I would try that and see how it works. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnoutwood_5c9e.html" title="User:Snoutwood">Snoutwood</a> <a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnoutwood_5ab6.html" title="User talk:Snoutwood">(talk)</a> 08:23, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

This is an extended rant on the talk page of a mediation I was involved in (which is why I am not taking action myself) and which has closed. You really have to read it yourself to fully appreciate it, but let's hit the highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Because there is this other policy, "No Original Research" - that can be summed up as "Wikipedia is fucked proper since its obviously run by total morons"."</li>
<li>"That person hates wikipedia and wants it to contain shitty articles"</li>
<li>"That person somehow has his head several miles up his ass"</li>
<li>"Any person that has or had opposed the inclusion of this information is a huge asshole that should not be allowed to edit anything on wikipedia, or consume my oxygen for that matter."</li>
<li>"<b>GET THE HELL OFF MY INTERNET, YOU LAME-ASS FUCKTARDS</b>"</li>

<p>This user has been warned about personal attacks before (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Dabljuh&amp;diff=37903884&amp;oldid=36500744" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Dabljuh&amp;diff=37903884&amp;oldid=36500744" rel="nofollow">here</a>).

<p>Yes they are, your completly wrong, I will be reporting you. The Cicero affidavit is a factual court file and does not in any way infringe on painting Cicero in a bad light, nor is it painting a living person in a negative light. The document should be looked at more carefully. The file is indeed a court produced document you can gain access to the COURT records by following the information at the very bottom of this page.</p>

<p>Uhm, if they are actual court documents, they can't be "solely to slander" (or rather, libel). They are, at least, factual as evidence that a court case exists and that certain allegations were made. They don't, of course, prove the claims in the case. --FOo 07:47, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This file comprises of fully verifiable information from the original public domain source. Information on how to download these documents for yourself are provided on the files pages themselves. They should not be deleted as the user that is attempting this “999” is of a rival order and is attempting to sabotage and interfere with present discussions and litigation to their own biased POV by deleting these public domain affidavits from the original source. -Frater FiatLux 16:25, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Comment by Frater FiatLux:There is minimal fee for downloading the documents through the official courts web-site. Instructions are given on the page of the file on how to do this. To make the files immediately assessable to mediators, editors and people that want to view this verifiable original and factual information. They can simply do so by clicking the link in the talk page and going right to file, where they can open and browse at their leisure, without paying for it, or applying to the court for the records. The file is linked to in many of the current talk threads and should not be deleted, as they are integral to some of the entries. Any opposition to remove these files is a clear, biased attempt at trying to interfere with the present talk, discussion dispute that is currently being considered by the mediator. Furthermore the mediator handling the disputation hasn’t made any remarks to me -whatsoever-to remove the file. -Frater FiatLux 23:55, 5 June 2006</p>
<p>I will reiterate what I told you, to in reply to your threat to me on the talk page I will be reporting you to the relevant admin pages for this threat and for also tampering with the files I uploaded. Suddenly one or two have conveniently gone missing.</p>
<p>I have already addressed the legal threat directed at myself with the relevant comment, however, I appreciate Kephera’s support. Any other comments on this matter though I feel are rather unnecessary and will only further perpetuate the schism makers, and further add to the burden of the mediator. The relevant comments have been made; I now feel it best that the outright threats by these schism makers should be treated with the appropriate disdain. I consider it very appropriate to treat such misleading, defamatory attacks on the HOGD/A+O's integrity seriously, to which I'm a member, and feel this rightly constitutes a formal and proper form of correspondence. This is not to be misinterpreted as some have in a very ill judged manner, to claim that I am legally threatening users, or that a formal comprehensive style is slanderous. User 999, your message supra however, is a direct threat and a perfect example thereof. I have only stated the facts and have not therein my posting attempted to deliberately slander Cicero, although, to biased eyes it could be appear that way. The fact that Cicero doesn’t appear to have a whiter than white background when the facts are compiled, or that these facts do not live up to expectations of Cicero supporters or licensees; frankly is not my fault. The sources in my posting cover a range of books, some of which are even written by Cicero, and original from the source court affidavits; and these aren’t all based around Cicero, or with the sole intent to slander Cicero, whatsoever. I am not interested in -anyone's- opinion of my writing style, and furthermore my writing style has nothing -whatsoever- to do with any of the matters at hand in this disputation. The fact that I treat correspondence seriously with schism makers attempting to misrepresent and defame the order I am a part. I consider is highly appropriate and should not be misrepresented as slanderous or threatening. Although, user 999 has given us a perfect example of what a direct threat constitutes.

<p>Comment: By Frater FL Your threat of informing Cicero’s lawyers doesn’t bother me -Whatsoever-; he cannot do a single thing about anything that I’ve written. I’ve back up the articles entries with comprehensive sources that are in the main, books in print that are verifiable, and even written by Cicero. The affidavits are publicly available documents and are open to anyone. I am in violation of nothing, therefore he can do nothing, so your threat is unfounded. All important points of the disputation are verifiable from books in print with relevant quotes, to which I have duly, and comprehensively given in my posting. The affidavits are only therein included to back up verifiable information that is obvious, and are the only integral documents to back certain claims in the HOGD/A+O entry. Such as the agreement between Griffin and Behman. This type of biographical information can only be soured from actual publicly available original sourced documents, that are signed by the hand of Griffin and Behman. To which I might add, is comprehensive factual, and accurate information. "/wiki/User:Frater_FiatLux" 18:04, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm getting tired of people requesting that their talk pages be deleted. Jimbo deleting... Locke Cole's page, I think it was, has set a bad precedent. User pages? Sure thing.

<dd>I agree - look at Kozlovesred and his mates talk of protecting articles from the so-called "right-wing army" - and <a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">Zleitzen</a> is hardly an innocent party given his coddling of pro-communist/socialist users at Cuba-related articles - ask Adam Carr or 172 or Rebecca. i hadn't been involved with the Lenin talk page for some time anyway - the continued behaviour of them prompted me to act.

<p>I strongly disagree with Geni's unblock.

This is a public wiki, and everyone would do well to remember that our words can and are seen. The point is not that the message was a 'private' one to you, 172, but that PMA has a conflict of interest on this issue.</dd>
<dd>PMA used the same block summary for both blocks, as well as for another six hours later of <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeSears_c50c.html" title="User:GeorgeSears"><tt class="userlinks" style="1.3em">GeorgeSears</tt></a> (<span class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../g/e/o/User_talk%7EGeorgeSears_0bfe.html" title="User talk:GeorgeSears">talk</a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GeorgeSears_4639.html" title="Special:Contributions/GeorgeSears">contribs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">logs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../b/l/o/Special%7EBlockip_GeorgeSears_dbb2.html" title="Special:Blockip/GeorgeSears">block user</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">block log</a></span>). All three editors have been editing with a similar slant on Communism-related topics; PMA, meanwhile, has also been making Communism-related edits but from the opposing perspective. He has been reverting edits that might be perceived as pro-Communist, often without edit summaries.</dd>
<dd>For none of the three blocks did PMA notify the editors blocked on their talk pages (or, apparently, elsewhere). (He added the terse explanation you quote to Kozlovesred's talk page nearly a day later and <i>after</i> prompting, and just quoted text that 172 provided.) PMA did not provide diffs or explanation of the blocks here or on the involved editors' talk pages. None of the three editors had been blocked before, for any reason. None of the editors blocked had even edited, let alone engaged in disruptive behaviour, in the three days preceding the blocks; it is difficult to argue that the matter was urgent, and such a long first-time block should have been discussed here. Neither PMA nor any other editor had warned the three about their editing practices, save for what appears to be a well-received and understood explanation of 3RR to Solidusspriggan back in January.</dd>
<dd>I strongly urge PMA to lift the remaining blocks. While he meant well, his actions are the sort that can lead to the torches and pitchforks and cries of 'rogue admin' that make it more difficult for the rest of us to enforce policy. I would encourage him to do what we're all supposed to do with a conflict of interest—bring the matter here, with appropriate diffs and explanation, and seek neutral third-party comment and action. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 13:28, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am PatCheng and I proclaim my innocence. In that Gamefaqs topic, YINever claimed that "RevolverOcelotX" and "Fenriswolf" are my alternate accounts. Looking at Fenriswolf's profile at Gamefaqs, he created his account on 11/3/2002 5:39:52 PM. I, however, did not create a Gamefaqs account until early 2005. As for RevolverOcelotX being my alt, it has been proven false by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_CheckUser#User:PatCheng" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_CheckUser#User:PatCheng" rel="nofollow">CheckUser</a>, but nevertheless YINever keeps insisting these are my alts in that topic. PatCheng is my sole Wikipedia account, which was created to organise the contributions my previous IP-based ones, and not for the purpose of "stalking" TJive. My first edit occured in late 2004 and did not even come across TJive until late early 2006. I revert some of TJive's edits because I find many of them questionable under NPOV policies, such his reference to Cuban government as "Castro regime" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carlos_Franqui&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=57099146" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carlos_Franqui&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=57099146" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, and the Tiananmen Square protests as "bloody supression" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chen_Yonglin&amp;diff=56795059&amp;oldid=49101118" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chen_Yonglin&amp;diff=56795059&amp;oldid=49101118" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>, and that he uses three different accounts to evade 3RR <a href="../../../t/j/i/User%7ETJive_a615.html" title="User:TJive">TJive</a> (<a href="../../../t/j/i/User_talk%7ETJive_d607.html" title="User talk:TJive">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TJive_2f65.html" title="Special:Contributions/TJive">contribs</a>), <a href="../../../y/i/n/User%7EYINever_743d.html" title="User:YINever">YINever</a> (<a href="../../../y/i/n/User_talk%7EYINever_ffde.html" title="User talk:YINever">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_YINever_ef50.html" title="Special:Contributions/YINever">contribs</a>), 72.65.77.79 (<a href="../../../7/2/2E/User_talk%7E72.65.77.79.html" title="User talk:72.65.77.79">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.65.77.79_c2a2.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.65.77.79">contribs</a>) --<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatCheng_566b.html" title="User:PatCheng">PatCheng</a> 14:10, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This seems like alot of hearsay. Is there any evidence that "Fenriswolf" contributes as PatCheng?

<p>He has complained to me that he has a balanced view and wants democracy but in the diff regarding inciting hatred, he says that the only wrong thing that Mao ever did was not kill <a href="../../../j/u/n/Jung_Chang_8784.html" title="Jung Chang">Jung Chang</a>. I have not extensively looked at his editing of articles, but giving the repeated racist comments that he has made, I doubt whether he is here to write an encyclopedia or to push POV and indulge in ideological head-banging. In the screenshots shown and further evidence verified by other admins who have access to GameFAQs that the screenshot is real, "Fenriswolf" brags that to "TJive"/"YINever" that he doesn't care about WP policy and his block, and has hundreds of IPs ready to sock-swamp to victory. PatCheng has admitted to clashing on the webforum (admitted by both parties) and is the only person fitting the description of being blocked on June 5 relating to a dispute with YINever/TJive and using the GAMEFAQs forum. "Fenriswolf" is then confronted as to whether he is using <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatCheng_566b.html" title="User:PatCheng">User:PatCheng</a> to stalk TJive, to which he reacts with pride. Later, a series of posts arose where "Fenriswolf" claimed to have taken control of <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatCheng_566b.html" title="User:PatCheng">User:PatCheng</a> and User:RevolverOxelot, who have been team-edit-warring on various Chinese Communist Party related political articles with no discussion from either side whatsoever. "Fenriswolf" then deleted the previous comments. As a block is a preventative measure, I feel that it can be applied to prevent sockpuppeteering. Given the serious infringements performed by PatCheng in the past, I have indefinitely blocked him as a temporary measure pending some kind of final resolution.<b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">Have your say!!!</a> 04:15, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Note that some of the edits were from an IP, which PatCheng later redirected to his user account after registering.<b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">Have your say!!!</a> 04:23, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Blnguyen, again, what hard evidence do you have that "Fenriswolf" is indeed PatCheng? That one screenshot you have only shows that the GameFAQs user "Fenriswolf" is bragging.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And Blnguyen your <i>accusation</i> that my account is taken control by this "Fenriswolf" is rediculous. On what grounds do you want to block my account? You can't block my account just because a random user on GameFAQs <i>claims</i> to "have taken control" of my account. And your accusations of me being a sockpuppet of PatCheng have already been false by this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_CheckUser#User:PatCheng" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_CheckUser#User:PatCheng" rel="nofollow">CheckUser</a>.</dd>

As I explained <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABlnguyen&amp;diff=56937822&amp;oldid=56931153" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABlnguyen&amp;diff=56937822&amp;oldid=56931153" rel="nofollow">here</a>, he has been stalking me, even leading into successive accounts of mine.

<p>There have been a couple instances where Fenriswolf has acknowledged his behavior at Wikipedia but I never thought to record them. So when "PatCheng" was blocked for personal attacks and "RevolverOcelotX" was blocked for 3RR violation the other day, I made a topic on GameFAQs mentioning the blocks to see what his response might be. Unsurprisingly, he was unrepentant and gloated that he was flagrantly violating policy:</p>
<dl>
<dd>And do you know that I don't give a **** about looney wikipedia admins? I can obtain hundreds of IP addresses to revert your trash on wikipedia. <a href="http://img303.imageshack.us/img303/6562/wiki6rv.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://img303.imageshack.us/img303/6562/wiki6rv.jpg" rel="nofollow">[42]</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>I posted his user history and examples of his reverts, and a denial of the comment he alleges that I made, which strangely he took for an admission.</p>
<dl>
<dd>So you're admitting it huh? <a href="http://img120.imageshack.us/img120/5148/wiki26ko.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://img120.imageshack.us/img120/5148/wiki26ko.jpg" rel="nofollow">[43]</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>By this time he was made aware of the posts concerning him and decided to backpeddle in a way that would throw the whole thing into confusion:</p>
<dl>
<dd>LOL PatCheng was blocked for personal attacks and RevolverOcelotX for 3RR. I really don't care about these two idiots considering that I own neither of these two accounts and merely guessed their passwords. <a href="http://img106.imageshack.us/img106/5249/fenriswolf36gu.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://img106.imageshack.us/img106/5249/fenriswolf36gu.jpg" rel="nofollow">[44]</a></dd>
</dl>

A couple administrators were sent there to verify some of these pictures. I don't believe they saw the deleted message but they did see the rest. "Ashibaka", seen in that last picture is an <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">admin here</a>. This is a flagrant admission of policy violation and disruptive intentions, looking past the braggadocio about "hundreds of IPs". Fenriswolf's half-concocted tale of merely finding the passwords for the accounts is proven false in the case of PatCheng simply by looking at his first contributions. It was not an accident that this account was following me; it started out that way.</p>
<p>As for RevolverOcelotX, he has the same posting habits as PatCheng - they both have been trolling through Asia and China-related articles watering down critical views and words about the Chinese government and communists. They both accuse me of "whitewashing", Fenriswolf's traditional description of my behavior. They discovered a mutual interest in the following articles, which they would revert in tandem.</p>

<p>At this point, "RevolverOcelotX" began to place a great deal of templates on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:YINever&amp;oldid=56924590" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:YINever&amp;oldid=56924590" rel="nofollow">the talk page of my sockpuppet</a> in an attempt to get me blocked for "vandalism" which saw two bad reports deleted. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrator_intervention_against_vandalism&amp;diff=56919152&amp;oldid=56919103" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrator_intervention_against_vandalism&amp;diff=56919152&amp;oldid=56919103" rel="nofollow">[46]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrator_intervention_against_vandalism&amp;diff=56920050&amp;oldid=56919839" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrator_intervention_against_vandalism&amp;diff=56920050&amp;oldid=56919839" rel="nofollow">[47]</a> Not only did PatCheng and RevolverOcelotX manage to trump reverts in the four mentioned articles, but RevolverOcelotX himself committed a 3RR violation. When I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR&amp;diff=56914154&amp;oldid=56913797" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR&amp;diff=56914154&amp;oldid=56913797" rel="nofollow">reported him</a>, he posted a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR&amp;diff=56915978&amp;oldid=56915667" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR&amp;diff=56915978&amp;oldid=56915667" rel="nofollow">bogus retaliatory report</a> which had to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR&amp;diff=56957521&amp;oldid=56957276" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR&amp;diff=56957521&amp;oldid=56957276" rel="nofollow">dismissed</a> as well.</p>
<p>In other words, "RevolverOcelotX" quickly took up "PatCheng"'s hobby of harassing me, immediately prior to, and during, PatCheng's 24-hour block. That may be coincidence, and "Fenriswolf" may well just be blustering to avoid wider blocks, but I seriously doubt it. If "RevolverOcelotX" was lily-white in this manner he would leave well enough alone rather than attempting to present the defense for unblocking a disruptive and hateful user whom he pretends not even to know. He has taken up the cause, not only here on ANI but PatCheng's talk page, as well as the pages of administrators where administrator <a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a> has merely asked for separate opinions, of unblocking PatCheng and launching into further polemics about my accounts. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Longhair&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=57293053" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Longhair&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=57293053" rel="nofollow">[48]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:PatCheng&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=57296137" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:PatCheng&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=57296137" rel="nofollow">[49]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Longhair&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=57297254" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Longhair&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=57297254" rel="nofollow">[50]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:PatCheng&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=57306245" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:PatCheng&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=57306245" rel="nofollow">[51]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:PatCheng&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=57307222" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:PatCheng&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=57307222" rel="nofollow">[52]</a> The difference is, I have not been demonstrated to have violated a single policy but have merely been defending my ability to edit at this site, whatsoever, without a stalker over my back every moment. As other users have noted, this warring is disruptive, is unhealthy, and many pages have been caught in the crossfire over one individual's bizarre personal feud with myself. The block should remain in effect on PatCheng and any subsequent sockpuppets. If "RevolverOcelotX" wishes to maintain any pretense of distinction from this issue then he will refrain from further violating policy and <i>not</i> simply pick up right where "PatCheng" left off. --<a href="../../../t/j/i/User%7ETJive_a615.html" title="User:TJive">TJive</a> 06:25, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>TJive, for the record, I am NOT one of PatCheng's sockpuppets as proven by the CheckUser, and I have no intentions of "harassing" you. I don't know who "Fenriswolf" is but from what you've posted here, it seems clear that "Fenriswolf" really <i>is</i> PatCheng. "Fenriswolf" aka <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatCheng_566b.html" title="User:PatCheng">User:PatCheng</a> is clearly lying about "guessing my passwords". The only reason I was edit warring with you the other day was out of concern for <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a>, not because I wanted to help YINever/TJive or PatCheng. But I haven't been edit warring with either of you ever since my block for 3RR.</dd>

<dd>Now the only reason why I presented the defense for unblocking PatCheng was because there didn't seem to be any hard evidence and his block seemed unfair. But, now that I see that "Fenriswolf"/PatCheng is clearly lying about "merely guessed my password", I don't really care if PatCheng is blocked or not, since I don't even know him or you. And I have not violated any policy ever since my block for 3RR. I know see that "Fenriswolf" really is PatCheng. --<a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolverOcelotX_fe1a.html" title="User:RevolverOcelotX">RevolverOcelotX</a> 07:14, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>User:Stephan KŒNIG was blocked on May 15 for one month for vandalism as well as continually adding blog-like, irrelevant material to talk pages as well as chronic uploading of non-fair use images (with no apparent intent to use them in articles), and finally he began vandalising the <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Haley_a641.html" title="Bill Haley">Bill Haley</a> article itself. His targets tend to be articles relating to Bill Haley such as <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Haley_a641.html" title="Bill Haley">Bill Haley</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Haley_%26_His_Comets_bb6c.html" title="Bill Haley &amp; His Comets">Bill Haley &amp; His Comets</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/d/Jodimars.html" title="Jodimars">Jodimars</a> and others. KŒNIG is apparently working from a rotating IP server as he has continued to post to the above articles (again almost exclusively their talk pages) despite the ban being in place and signs his talk page messages with his name or initials. Evidence: <a href="../../../b/i/l/Talk%7EBill_Haley_aaee.html" title="Talk:Bill Haley">Talk:Bill Haley</a> (see additions by 81.246.223.29 (reverted), 87.64.184.168, 81.245.68.169); <a href="../../../b/i/l/Talk%7EBill_Haley_%26_His_Comets_def5.html" title="Talk:Bill Haley &amp; His Comets">Talk:Bill Haley &amp; His Comets</a> (see 81.244.63.70, 81.246.205.39, 81.243.173.11, 81.244.38.179) ... you get the picture.

<p>Recently, <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexPU_ea69.html" title="User:AlexPU">User:AlexPU</a> was blocked for a week and then for a month for numerous personal attacks, 3RR violations and so on (enclosed below is original Ghirla's report).</p>
<p>However, he recently made another attack on his <a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexPU_adf9.html" title="User talk:AlexPU">talk page</a> saying "<i>Like Khruschtchev said: Ми їх поховаємо!</i>"</p>
<p>In Ukrainian, that stands for "We will bury you", and refers to Khruschtchev's speech during which he threatened to "bury" the USA. I don't think this is a stunningly constructive or neutral reply, showing that he is still quite agressive.</p>
<p>I don't know what's the exact policy for that, but I'm reporting it so you know. -- <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrafikm_fr_a2d0.html" title="User:Grafikm fr"><font color="blue"><b>Grafikm</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrafikm_fr_126e.html" title="User talk:Grafikm fr"><b><font color="red">(AutoGRAF)</font></b></a></sup> 20:10, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

His talk, which is an attack page on his opponents, a Black Book-type list compiled by him, isn't moderated, he persisted with addressing his opponents by their ethnicities (misapplying those too), calling them vandals, propagandists and whatever.</p>
<p>However, <a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexPU_adf9.html#To_my_friends_and_enemies" title="User talk:AlexPU">what he posted at his talk</a> <i>following the very last block</i> is just unspeakable. He trippled the level of his attacks and spiced them with homophobic (<i>"You, smelly faggot"</i>), ethnic (<i>"gypsy"</i>) and sexual (<i>"whore"</i>) slurs. While there is no indication that any of his opponents actually belong to any of these groups, I am calling this behavior to the admin attention.</p>
<p>The first thing that comes to mind is to lock his talk page as well so that he would have no chance to assault anyone anywhere at wiki-space but this may be counterproductive as it may prevent others from talking to him and would prevent him to censor his previos attacks and the black book should he come to senses. Warning him seems useless but something needs done. Perhaps doubling the block for the post-block activity so that he sees that his actions would have further consequences? I leave it up to the community.</p>
<p>I don't see why we need to waste the ArbCom's time for such an obvious case. ArbCom is busy enough. I don't see any sense of an RfC since, again, this is plain enough, got sufficient exposure for many people to comment already and they commented. There seems to be a need for an action rather than talk. --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#FC4339">Ghirla</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#C98726">-трёп-</font></a></sup> 17:51, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Defending another user is of course very friendly and commendable, however the editors campaigning for an unblock fail to acknowledge that Merecat/Rex was blocked for <i>disruptive editing</i> also. The fact that numerous IP addresses (sockpuppets?) have appeared that <b>1</b> ask to unblock Merecat/Rex, <b>2</b> use uncivil language, <b>3</b> one of which has filed two bogus RFCU against opponents of Merecat/Rex, makes me anxious about allowing this user back without sufficient remedies, i.e. ArbCom. Further, I would like to point out that the recent RfAr against this user was rejected on the grounds of him already being blocked.<a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_Netherlands.svg_7dec.html" class="image" title="Holland"><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/2/20/Flag_of_the_Netherlands.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_Netherlands.svg.png" alt="Holland" width="25" height="17" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_Netherlands.svg_7dec.html" /></a> <font color="green"><a href="../../../n/e/s/User%7ENescio_e53e.html" title="User:Nescio">Nomen Nescio</a></font><sup><a href="../../../n/e/s/User_talk%7ENescio_071f.html" title="User talk:Nescio"><font color="blue">Gnothi seauton</font></a></sup> 12:40, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Have you even looked at ALL the IP's involved? Second, you misrepresent the facts. The IP filed RFCU against me, and it was editing in a similar fashion as your hero.

I did however observe that your obsessive defense of a known disruptive sock (whom you do not know!?), your use of Merecat/sockpuppet in your sig, and the continuous attacks against opponents of your hero is at best an unfortunate route to take. <font color="green"><a href="../../../n/e/s/User%7ENescio_e53e.html" title="User:Nescio">Nomen Nescio</a></font><sup><font color="blue"><i><small><a href="../../../n/e/s/User_talk%7ENescio_071f.html" title="User talk:Nescio">Gnothi seauton</a></small></i></font></sup> 12:42, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

So what links these users that are not on the same ISP, not in the same state? other then there support for merecat, which I also support and now have been accused by Ryan Freisling of being merecat also. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_ecbe.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults"><i><font color="blue"><sup>|sockpuppets|</sup></font></i></a> 12:48, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It appears that the real situation here is that Rex was banned and the ban has since been extended for his sockpuppeting as Merecat in an attempt to evade the ban. Merecat's edits have been highly tendentious and POV peddling. He has been insulting to other editors and made personal attacks. Regardless he does not seem to be modifying his behavior in response to the previous bans, they should continue until there is a likelihood that he will. --<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGorgonzilla_0cd8.html" title="User:Gorgonzilla">Gorgonzilla</a> 13:03, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>So how long is this ban? You say he doesn't seem to be modifying his behavior, but I do not see proof of that. Both merecat and rex cant be sockpuppets of eachother so one of them should have time limit to when they can return. Seeing as it seems rex would be the official user, when is his ban up? As for his POV peddling if you look at the articles he edits, everyone is POV peddling. For instance in the Iraq war article users are insisting only WMD's get mentioned and no other reason for going to war, undue weight? Anyway I think if Rex is banned then there should be a duration taht was issued or extended to, so what was that duration? --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_ecbe.html" title="User talk:Zer0faults"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 16:58, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've instead blocked Rex indefinitely again, this time under a more accurate reasoning- for sockpuppeting to evade an ArbCom ban, and general disruption. If any administrator disagrees, let me know, and I'll unblock, but Rex has been disruptive for a long time, and I don't feel his continued presence will in any way help build the encyclopedia. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315">talk</a>) 17:49, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Look, I'm definetely not a fan of Rex, especially since his recent sockpuppet activities when he could have simply come back as himself. But I do believe Zero is right, you can't simply say well he's sockpuppeting again, therefore indefinite block. Violating a previous arbcom decision does not earn you an indefinite ban from Wikipedia. At the very least, if we're going to extend Rex's ban, there should be an arbcom decision that mandates it and a time limit should be set on the ban, otherwise that's just irresponsible blocking. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 19:13, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Uh, for those of you who are not aware of the history, here's some details: Rex joined in July 04 to conteract extreme pro-Kerry bias at <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Kerry_b44b.html" title="John Kerry">John Kerry</a>. Now, while Rex was more or less a sh*t there several times, the ArbCom cases involved found that multiple editors - not just Rex, wee caught up in the heat of the campaign and injected campaign bias into the JK article, both pro and con. Off an on since joining, Rex got in some SNAFUs for heaping insults and 3RR and also for obstructing the prgress of the (pro-Kerry) consesnsus at that article. As it stands, there are several things still in place against Rex. a) Do not edit <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Kerry_b44b.html" title="John Kerry">John Kerry</a> b) Cite all controversial edits to a reliable source and c) If "disruptive" can be banned from an article by any admin. As for violations of these, there are specific remedies in place, noe of which include a permanent ban. So let's assume for a minute that Merecat is Rex, what did this mean? It mean that that Rex, disguised as Merecat was able to successfully edit <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Kerry_b44b.html" title="John Kerry">John Kerry</a> with no problems. Ah, then it would follow that the oppossion to Rex's edits, att least at this point is ad-hominem in that an edit by Rex071404 would be opposed, but the samee edit by another name or IP is fine. Now regarding User:Neutral aribiter and <a href="../../../w/o/m/User%7EWombdpsw_44c0.html" title="User:Wombdpsw">User:Wombdpsw</a>, I see no evidence that they are "disruptive" or have "failed to cite controversial edits" or "have edited <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Kerry_b44b.html" title="John Kerry">John Kerry</a>. This being true, there is no acceptable basis that a check user ought to be run against either of them, for at worst, they would be alternate accounts (which is allowed - <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/CheckUser" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/CheckUser" rel="nofollow">see here</a>). Of course, the argument can be made "rex has exhausted community patience", but that does not hold water because Merecat (who is said to be Rex) had consensus on his side at the RfC (see here: <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Merecat_3be5.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Merecat">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Merecat</a>). Also the argument can be made that Rex evaded/sockpuppeted with Merecat, so he should be banned. PErhaps, but there are specified sanctions already in place by ArbCom which, if a penalty is applied to Rex, must be what's applied. Ad Hoc, shoot-from the-hip sanctions against Rex in the form of a permenant block is bust unsupportedable by process and flat out wrong. But let's suppose for a minute that Rex ends up permanently barred. I suggest to you that this is precisely what some editors here seek, but not for the reasons stated. Rather, the benefit of a perma-block on Rex is that for any editor who is later objected to by the known POV pushers like User:Keven Baas (see proof of that here: <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Kevin_Baas_0334.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Kevin Baas">Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Kevin Baas</a>) and his allies such as <a href="../../../n/e/s/User%7ENescio_e53e.html" title="User:Nescio">User:Nescio</a> himself currently blocked for 3rr violation at <a href="../../../h/a/d/Haditha_incident.html" title="Haditha incident">Haditha incident</a> (Kevin and Nescio both advanced the failed Rfc against Merecat), these two and their like minded cohorts can simply say "REX" and seek to do a check user against anyone - based on minor editing vagaries. Frankly, what the Rex banners actually seek is a license to witch hunt against anyone, based on the "Rex" name alone. Now for all of you who are saying Rex=bad. I am wondering if you have even studies the edits of each account / IP being accused. The edits being made are not troll-bait and the editors making them are not being tendentious - no more so than editors such as <a href="../../../m/r/2E/User%7EMr._Tibbs_efc1.html" title="User:Mr. Tibbs">User:Mr. Tibbs</a> or <a href="../../../n/e/s/User%7ENescio_e53e.html" title="User:Nescio">User:Nescio</a>. As it stands now, the wiki president for a long time editor who is being hounded off was set by <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_03fe.html" title="User:Michael">User:Michael</a>. Based on that, there is simply no reason that <a href="../../../r/e/x/User%7ERex071404_f742.html" title="User:Rex071404">User:Rex071404</a> should be denied the opportunity to transition to <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerecat_31d8.html" title="User:Merecat">User:Merecat</a>. But what's the point anyway - look at the edit history of <a href="../../../w/o/m/User%7EWombdpsw_44c0.html" title="User:Wombdpsw">User:Wombdpsw</a> and see how User:Gongonzilla is now opposing <i>him</i> based on <b>unconfirmed</b> allegations of "sockpuppet". It's as if some editors prefer to turn off their ability to think critically and instead prefer to revert and oppsed based on user name alone. This being the case, I fail to see how a rational person would <i>not</i> changed account names regularly. To sum up, from where I see, it would appear that the complainst against Merecat's edits are basically groundless and Merecat was basicaly a good, albeit somewhat dogmatic editor. No reasonable person here can honestly say that Merecat was naywhere near as bad as Rex was. And there is simply no honest basis for inquiring against any of these newly accused editors. Have they been doing 3RR? Have they been calling names? None of them have done anything wrong. This "Rex" witch-hunting is nothing more that out-of-process ad hoc pig- piling. It's not intellectually honsest and it will not accomplish the goal of making the articles on the wiki better. Take a look at <a href="../../../r/e/x/User%7ERex071404_f742.html" title="User:Rex071404">User:Rex071404</a>'s talk page history and pull up the contribution list of of a few of those who keep reverting the unblock requests posted there. For example see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Tawker" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Tawker" rel="nofollow">this</a>. Does this user <b>ever</b> make any article edits? It seems that all he does is boss others around and talk to people. A comment pool (which is what the wiki is) will eventualy coagulate if a proper ratio of article edits to bossing is not maintained. When you have too many chiefs and not enough indians, nothing gets done. Take a look at the article <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_Cracker_1dda.html" title="White Cracker">White Cracker</a>. Rex started that article and it has grown to be a valuable entry. Take a look at <a href="../../../y/t/t/Yttrium_aluminium_garnet.html" title="Yttrium aluminium garnet">Yttrium aluminium garnet</a>. Merecat started that article and it has grown to be a fine article too. What the "POPs" (political article police) around here don't understand is that people are naturally drawn to chime in on controversy. The controversial articles on the wiki are the "bait" which attract and retain editors. If you keep chasing ediors aaway from them, you will contribute to diminshing your compounding ratios. Oh well, ban away of you must, but don't fool ypurselves into thinking that you will achieve NPOV by chasing away only those who disagree with you. And if that's not what you are doing, then why are editors such as <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrometheuspan_2707.html" title="User:Prometheuspan">User:Prometheuspan</a> allowed to run amok? I suggest that it's because he pushes a POV that many liberal editors agree with and for that reason, no matter how terrible he behaves (like recently calling wikipedia "evil" on Jimbo's talk page), it's all overlooked. Same too for <a href="../../../n/e/s/User%7ENescio_e53e.html" title="User:Nescio">User:Nescio</a> and <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Baas_5807.html" title="User:Kevin Baas">User:Kevin Baas</a>.

<li>Assuming that this IP editor is also Rex/Merecat, or that Rex/Merecat is reading this debate, I would offer the following advice. Admit to switching accounts, apologize for the talk page spamming that got Merecat banned in the first place (and also outed him as the Anon Texan), and agree to use only one account in the future and to abide by the last ArbCom ruling. Under those circumstances, it shouldn't matter which account he chooses to use. If no sympathetic admin will unblock at that point, appeal the community ban to Arbcom following the example of Saladin1970, <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 21:03, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>What about the fact that there is no true "anon texan" user account and that acount was used fraudulently by certain liberal editors as a tracking device? Why do some editors get to make up sockpuppets, but others get blocked for socks and/or alternate accounts? Merecat did not create the <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnon_Texan_5450.html" title="User:Anon Texan">User:Anon Texan</a> account and neither did Rex. That account is a fraud and it enabled a FALSE check user to be run against Merecat. All the checkuser evidence against Merecat should be trown out as being unetheically obtained on an non-valid basis. What about all the false allegations about <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECantStandYa_dd9c.html" title="User:CantStandYa">User:CantStandYa</a>/<a href="../../../s/h/r/User%7EShran_b8d0.html" title="User:Shran">User:Shran</a>? Perhaps if people had just left the anonymous editor from Texas alone, Merecat not have come to life. Merecat's edit history shows him to have been idle form many months and only came to life with the IP editos from Dallas ISP were being hassled by POV warriors who made of the phony "Anon Texan" name. Thatcher, you yousrself have said that anon IP editor was not transgressing, so why should people be allowed to hassle him? There is no rule that says you have to log in to edit and frankly based on what happened to Merecat, why bother? There is a lot of finger pointing that could go around here and not all of it is on Merecat. And everyone nees to stop sayig "Rex!" "Rex!" all the time. If <a href="../../../r/e/x/User%7ERex071404_f742.html" title="User:Rex071404">User:Rex071404</a> had wanted to keep using that account, he would have been doing so since long ago.

<p>Merecat was guilty of a long list of personal attacks against nescio, guilty of stacking the RFC by means of invitation, guilty of deleting materials posted to the talk page to game the system towards drama, guilty of obstructionism and straw man arguments for the purpose of obstructionism, used sock puppets to double vote, used sock puppets to stack votes by invitation, and under no circumstances and for no reason should be allowed in any guise or incarnation to do anything other than browse wikipedia. Merecat is a flat out pov warrior, and has no redeeming quality worth the stress that merecat causes. Morton and Zero are both POV warriors, and Zero is suspiciously running around with "Merecat" in his sig for a brief while; Is Zero another Sock puppet? Even if no, this is a plea by the Republican POV warrior camp to get their guy back so that they can go wreak more havoc.</p>
<p>Merecat has done more than enough to warrant permenent banning, and the RFC against merecat only failed because it was unfair, illogical, and allowed to become an ad hominem and straw man festival. That RFC is a disgusting proof that these characters are in on a pov game with merecat, and that Wikipedia needs better rules to protect itself from pov warrior trolls.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrometheuspan_2707.html" title="User:Prometheuspan">Prometheuspan</a> 22:59, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Seckel_d44e.html" title="Al Seckel">Al Seckel</a> was largely written by Al himself (an anon IP signing himself "Al" on the talk page. Two days ago new user Tmciver (<a href="../../../t/m/c/User_talk%7ETmciver_2b13.html" title="User talk:Tmciver">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tmciver_6c1d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tmciver">contribs</a>) nominated the article for deletion; evidently he has a lot of animosity toward Seckel (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Al_Seckel_a7ff.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Al Seckel">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Al Seckel</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/_/Talk%7EAl_Seckel_7813.html" title="Talk:Al Seckel">Talk:Al Seckel</a>). At first, Tmciver's comments were helpful to me in removing various unsourced glowing claims about Seckel and providing references. However, Tmciver now persists in adding negative information based on his own original research. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Al_Seckel&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=57057189" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Al_Seckel&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=57057189" rel="nofollow">[65]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Al_Seckel&amp;diff=57125026&amp;oldid=57122936" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Al_Seckel&amp;diff=57125026&amp;oldid=57122936" rel="nofollow">[66]</a> He claims Seckel never graduated from Cornell. The article does not mention Seckel's credentials at all; Tmciver adds them in in order to make his allegations, which are based on a 1991 newsletter called <i>Saucer Smear</i> and Tmciver's own alleged phone call to the Cornell registrar. I have gone over this on the talk page, apparently to no further avail. I have to work and sleep; Tmciver seems not to be bound by these constraints.

<dd>Hi, I don't think he is <i>threatening</i> to block you for <i>opposing an rfa.</i> He is <i>warning</i> you that making <i>personal attacks</i> could lead you to getting blocked. You are free to debate if the comments you made on that rfa are personal attacks or not; I don't deem them to be, but at least a couple of users believe that they tantamount to personal attacks. However, you cannot twist the language of Bhadani's message on your talk page in this way. Also, please understand that the last time you posted here, the consensus was that your "refactoring" was wrong. (Associated thread <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=55036545&amp;oldid=55036221" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=55036545&amp;oldid=55036221" rel="nofollow">here</a>). However, you chose to ignore the messages on this forum and retained the messages as they were. Please do not expect people to give a patient hearing when you are not ready to offer the same courtesy. As the saying goes, people who live by the sword, die by the sword.

<dd>The comments were clearly not personal attacks, but commentary on a person's edit history when that person is a candidate for adminship. The reason that comments about people's personalities are discouraged in article talk pages and other general discussion is that they are not relevant. However, in reviewing a person's application for administrative access, that person's personality is <i>central</i>. The comments, by raising concern about a potential administrator's editing habits (and that <i>is</i> a lot of reverts!) are in fact praiseworthy as a contribution to the review of the application for adminship. Threatening to block was harmful and <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chilling_effect.html" title="Chilling effect">chilling</a> to the consensus-making process. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 03:22, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Fair enough; however this reasoning would apply <i>if and only if</i> the reverts fall into edit war category. Almost all of them fall under reversting vandalism category. Anyone who has even a cursory look at his edits would understand it. Anyways, it was great that you could take time to comment here. It would be much appreciated if you can also look at the reverts by him and how many of them correspond to edit warring. While I absolutely agree that commentary is essential, for an oppose vote, diffs are even more essential. In the absence of diffs and given the pattern of Anwar's voting, other editors would feel justified in forming an opinion that he is only rabble-rousing. The diff that Anwar provided doesn't refer to POV warriorship. --<a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurubrahma_62f8.html" title="User:Gurubrahma">Gurubrahma</a> 03:43, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If Anwar has made personal attacks against <b>you</b> as part of his problems, is it really wise for you to be the one placing his "last warning" on his talk page?

<dd>I thank you for your very wise suggestion, which does not smack of gloating (<i>feel or express great, often malicious, pleasure or self-satisfaction</i>) and would like to add that I have always maintained best administrative practices, but I can not compromise on the core values of the wikipedia. And, I am sure that all true wikipedians shall do the same by not using the words like "gloating" and imputing motives to me (or to others) which trangresses the wikipedia's policy of <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assuming good faith</a>.

<p>Last night, <a href="../../../a/p/p/User%7EAppleseed_fd91.html" title="User:Appleseed">User:Appleseed</a> moved <a href="../../../s/i/g/Sigismund_III_of_Poland_1241.html" title="Sigismund III of Poland">Sigismund III of Poland</a> to apparently his own preferred location, despite of the fact that a contentious vote, RM vote, was then ongoing at its talkpage. Already then it was quite clear that the alternative to which Appleseed moved the article (=the one beginning with Zygmunt...), is NOT going to win. It has a minority, practically an ethnic-Polish group of users as it supporters. The survey favored much more an alternative, that beginning with "Sigismund...". The page has earlier been subject to several moves. I am not going to ponder over those in this complaint. Whereas the move Appleseed did last night, dangerously disrupts the survey. The survey which was not ging to the direction Appleseed presumably wants. Appleseed is known to be a bit possessive and obstinate editor, which offers some background explanation why he did now what he did. This sort of moving simply must not allow to happen when RM is ongoing, and such behavior should be disencouraged. It's disruption of Wikipedia processes. I hereby request that Appleseed is blocked for some time, week or so, to reflect his ways to act here. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarrtel_9c5d.html" title="User:Marrtel">Marrtel</a> 13:57, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

Nothing substantiated. In the discussion board, I can show quite readily through Wikipedia's own guidelines that his personal diatribes, which have no documentation other from what he himself published in the non-peer reviewed self published magazine "Saucer Smear" state. This journal rallies against anyone who speaks out against scientists and others who dismiss the accounts of extraterrestrial visits, psychics, and goes on against atheists, etc. I, on the other hand, can cite rebuttals to him from Nature, Science, Discover, Skeptical Inquirer, NY Times, Los Angeles Times, etc., which are peer reviewed.</p>
<p>The point of this, is that the discussion board contains statements about me (from this one individual) who is clearly posting material that is not only libelous, but threatens my credibility and financial status, as I am involved in many business affairs, and someone reading this sort of thing could pull away from business deals. This could cause serious legal ramifications not only for Wikipedia, but for McIver. I am already starting to take legal action against McIver for slander and libel. It is quite easy to go to reliable sources (Wikipedia approved) to verify that his information is not only negative, but false. It is important for the credibility of Wikipedia to remove this discussion (and its history) entirely because it will cause irreputable harm not only to myself, but also to the credibility of Wikipedia. Although, Wikipedia is excellent as an "open source" document, it can not survive as a credible document in the world of scholarship, if it freely allows people to add information (or delete information) that is untrue for purposes of disparagment.</p>
<p>It is obvious from reading the discussion board, that the editor (who now seems to have caught on and refered me to you), has stated that in my original posting on the cite, that no incorrect information from me was stated, and that McIver was adding material that was not stated by me in order to disparage and discredit me. Nevertheless, the disparaging information can be found on the discussion page and its history. I respectfully ask that the entire history of McIver's comments (as well as my rebuttles be removed).</p>

<dd>Both Mr. Seckel and Mr. McIver have made, shall we say, questionable personal comments about one another. I advised Mr. Seckel to contact the Foundation about having them deleted from the history. If any admin would like to review them now, I have compiled a list of diffs of those that seem problematic at <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_temp_ec58.html" title="User:Thatcher131/temp">User:Thatcher131/temp</a>. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 16:33, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I took a look at this article, as well as some of the opposing material that McIver has elsewhere on the web, after McIver's failed attempt to have the Seckel article deleted. While I have no idea whether there is substance to McIver's allegations, he is right on one thing: this article makes a great example in favor of <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a>. Although it's very well-written in an encyclopedic style, I have to suspect that, in tone and content, it is totally different from what would have been written by a disinterested third party. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 19:28, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Even if this guy is notable enough for an article, I must say the current version doesn't seem very encyclopedic. It seems to impossibly overstate his importance, if I was actually immodest enough to write an article about myself, I think I would at least try to write from a npov. This guy has really thrown that out the window. I thought this level of pretention was actually fatal. Although I have never heard of this guy, nor edited "his" article, and if I had to take a position I would probably support the so called "skeptical one", but I must say this situation kinda upsets me.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 22:13, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Basically, Seckel wrote a very long article, JDoorjam radically trimmed it, and I found some references to try and improve it. I got distracted into other things, while Seckel continued to work on it. To his credit, he seems to have adopted a wikipedial style, and did not restore <i>too</i> much of what JDoorjam had removed. When Tmciver launched the Afd it jolted me back into action. I have been working on rewriting sections using references I find, trying to adhere to <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> as well as WP:RS, while dealing with two highly opinionated disputants who have been trying to persuade me with tales of personal letters and phone calls verifying or disputing this or that (WP:NOR of course).</li>

<p>Me and some others have problems with Johstevens5. He is constantly vandalizing articles, pushing for an extrem Turkish-nationalistic and anti-Persian POV, rejecting authoritative sources, etc.</p>
<p>He had already vandalized the articles <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babur.html" title="Babur">Babur</a> and <a href="../../../m/u/g/Mughals.html" title="Mughals">Mughals</a>, and went on with messing up the articles <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alisher_Navoi_8dd8.html" title="Alisher Navoi">Alisher Navoi</a> (here even with copy-right issues) and <a href="../../../u/l/u/Ulugh_Beg_0699.html" title="Ulugh Beg">Ulugh Beg</a>. And now, he has started to vandalize <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Farabi_ebc1.html" title="Al-Farabi">al-Farabi</a>, again pushing for a pseudo-scientific, anti-Persian, Turkish-nationalistic POV.</p>
<p>I have warned him on his talk-page that I will contact an admin if he continues <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Johnstevens5&amp;oldid=57360421#Ulugh_Beg_and_al-Farabi" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Johnstevens5&amp;oldid=57360421#Ulugh_Beg_and_al-Farabi" rel="nofollow">[68]</a>. However, he simply deleted my message <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Johnstevens5&amp;diff=57360823&amp;oldid=57360421" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Johnstevens5&amp;diff=57360823&amp;oldid=57360421" rel="nofollow">[69]</a> and continued his vandalism <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Al-Farabi&amp;diff=57361961&amp;oldid=57359618" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Al-Farabi&amp;diff=57361961&amp;oldid=57359618" rel="nofollow">[70]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Al-Farabi&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=57361961" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Al-Farabi&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=57361961" rel="nofollow">[71]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Al-Farabi&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=57362091" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Al-Farabi&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=57362091" rel="nofollow">[72]</a> . He is totally ignoring the <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Farabi_ebc1.html" title="Al-Farabi">al-Farabi</a> talk-page. He is again ignoring authoritative sources, such as <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia_of_Islam_8ed9.html" title="Encyclopaedia of Islam">Encyclopaedia of Islam</a> (THE source regarding Islamic history) and <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia_Iranica_05f3.html" title="Encyclopaedia Iranica">Encyclopaedia Iranica</a> (THE source regarding Iranian history).</p>
<p>I had already asked <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">User:Khoikhoi</a> and admin <a href="../../../n/a/c/User_talk%7ENaconkantari_6fb8.html" title="User talk:Naconkantari">User talk:Naconkantari</a> for help, and they replied that they keep an eye on this user and - if necessairy - will report him. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tajik&amp;diff=57267965&amp;oldid=57215898" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tajik&amp;diff=57267965&amp;oldid=57215898" rel="nofollow">[73]</a>.</p>
<p>I am going to revert <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Farabi_ebc1.html" title="Al-Farabi">al-Farabi</a> for a last time (because of 3RR) and then I leave it to admins to solve the problem.

<dd>I would suggest you first list the problem(s) that you want POV checking on the talk page, your explaination above only outlines wh the tag shouldn't be removed while a dispute is in progress, but you don't say what the dispute is. By placing the POV tag, you are saying "there is something that needs fixing", but, by not saying what, it makes it impossible for anyone to address your concerns.

It says he is a known sockpuppet but I thought this deserved at least a bit looking into. I'm not familiar with this at all, which is why I came here. I am NOT saying AmiDaniel did anything wrong, I'm just wondering if this is legit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>In answer to your question, we were told that all references to John and the magazine would be removed. We discovered that this page still remains on Ami's Archive. Please be so kind as to remove this page or delete the title and name headings as was done in the other instances. You know the history is still there if you need it. At this point this insignificant verbiage does not serve anyone. I don't understand what the point was for the name change; particularly since the link to the pseudonym is now posted online? This doesn't make any sense.</i> Thank you. Eliz.67.86.180.171 19:50, 7 June 2006 (UTC) 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

He seems to object to any attempt to actually describe what this company's business actually is.

<p>Hi, I'm about to block User:Vlatkoto for a week for repeatedly uploading images which he licenses as {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL-self_97c5.html" title="Template:GFDL-self">GFDL-self</a>}}, but which clearly aren't. I have tried to explain to him. He is also revert warring with <a href="../../../t/e/l/User%7ETelex_3d37.html" title="User:Telex">User:Telex</a> over the use of {{<a href="../../../n/o/l/Template%7ENolicense_18bc.html" title="Template:Nolicense">nolicense</a>}} on one of his images <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Skopje_Real1.png&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Skopje_Real1.png&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[91]</a>. If anyone disagrees, please note here. His image contributions are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?offset=&amp;limit=50&amp;target=Vlatkoto&amp;title=Special%3AContributions&amp;namespace=6" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?offset=&amp;limit=50&amp;target=Vlatkoto&amp;title=Special%3AContributions&amp;namespace=6" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Aside from maps, which may be copyvios from Google Earth, most of the images he uploads are either copyvio or inappropriate licensed. To be fair, he is from Macedonia, which as other Macedonians inform me does not have enforcement of strict copyright laws, he may simply not understand the consequences. However, it is clear from his userpage that he has been pointed at our policies many times. I am in discussion with other Macedonian users to try and determine the exact copyright status of images produced by the Macedonian government as there is some confusion as to if they are public domain or not. I won't block him just yet, but if there is no objections I'll do it in a few hours. - <a href="../../../f/-/m/User%7EF-m-t_02fb.html" title="User:F-m-t">FrancisTyers</a> <a href="../../../f/-/m/User_talk%7EF-m-t_cc17.html" title="User talk:F-m-t">·</a> 13:55, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
