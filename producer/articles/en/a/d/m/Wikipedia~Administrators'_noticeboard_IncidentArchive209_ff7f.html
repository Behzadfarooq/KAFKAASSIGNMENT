We now have a new incident. The users <a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillock65_13a1.html" title="User:Hillock65">Hillock65</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuprynka_a4fb.html" title="User:Chuprynka">Chuprynka</a> being blocked for no reason by Betacommand yesterday. I commented on that earlier <a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html#Proper_tagging_of_blocked_users" title="User talk:Akhilleus">here</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/s/Wikipedia%7ESuspected_sock_puppets_Hillock65_d7f4.html" title="Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Hillock65">here</a> but chose not pursue this further since the user blocked by Betacommand said earlier that he has left. So, ultimately, it did not matter except as another example of eager blocking by Betacommand. Today, however, the user in question posted an "unblock" template. I honestly, have nothing to do with this. Moreover, my interaction with said user haven't been pleasant but purely due to some content disputes.</p>
<p>Anyway, to summarize the issue briefly, Hillock65 was among several users who stood up to trolling by the confirmed puppeteer <a href="../../../y/a/r/User%7EYarillastremenog_c48f.html" title="User:Yarillastremenog"><tt class="userlinks" style="1.3em">Yarillastremenog</tt></a> (<span class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../y/a/r/User_talk%7EYarillastremenog_a191.html" title="User talk:Yarillastremenog">talk</a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yarillastremenog_343e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yarillastremenog">contribs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">logs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../b/l/o/Special%7EBlockip_Yarillastremenog_7480.html" title="Special:Blockip/Yarillastremenog">block user</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">block log</a></span>), see <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_checkuser_Case_Yarillastremenog_5326.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Yarillastremenog">list of confirmed puppets</a> of that user. In retaliation for the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_checkuser_Case_Yarillastremenog_5326.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Yarillastremenog">Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Yarillastremenog</a> the puppeteer submitted the frivolous report at <a href="../../../s/u/s/Wikipedia%7ESuspected_sock_puppets_Hillock65_d7f4.html" title="Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Hillock65">Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Hillock65</a> where he alleged that Hillock and Chuprynka are socks. I have edited the article in question and observed the behavior of all users involved. There was no similarity between these two accounts and report was clearly submitted in bad faith. It stood idle and unaddressed by checkusers for a while, and yesteday, when it was already too late for checkuser to give any result, Betacommand, who is neither a checkuser nor has any familiarity with the problem, decided to "close" the puppetry case himself, blocked them both as socks for no reason and placed the sockpuppet templates at both user's pages. Only after I raised the issue, he posted his "report" on the very same page where he merely says that he concludes towards sockpuppetry based on the fact that among the articles edited by the users, there was one common one (!).</p>
<p>My analysis is presented at <a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html#Proper_tagging_of_blocked_users" title="User talk:Akhilleus">User talk:Akhilleus#Proper tagging of blocked users</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/s/Wikipedia%7ESuspected_sock_puppets_Hillock65_d7f4.html#Response_to_report" title="Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Hillock65">Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Hillock65#Response to report</a>. As I said, I had my problems with Hillock65 due to the content conflicts but before he decided to leave, he wrote several articles himself. Most notably the comprehensive <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Konotop_8eab.html" title="Battle of Konotop">Battle of Konotop</a> article was written by Hillock single handily. At the same time, <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuprynka_a4fb.html" title="User:Chuprynka">user:Chuprynka</a>'s entries at the talk pages were clearly civil and measured, while Hillock's was more combative (but this is not incivility we are discussing and incivility was not a major problem anyway).</p>
<p>To conclude, whatever issues one might have with these editors, the sockpuppetry accusations were brought in bad faith (by Yarillastremenog) and decided on sloppily (by Betacommand). The users needs to be unblocked and the unblocking edit summary should include the apology for the inconvenience and false accusations.

<li>I have unblocked both. They do not look like sockpuppets just two editors having some vague pro-nationalist Ukrainian POV. (Chuprinka in more moderate form) <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">Alex Bakharev</a> 22:51, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I generally concur, especially with Betacommand going commando <i>again.</i> One person asked, "Why else would someone want to be an admin" except to block. I was aghast at that, because people who do want to be admins so that they can block can end up acting like Betacommand and causing the whole project grief. One mantra: discuss, confer, and act multilaterally. That's all a person needs. Discuss, confer, and act multilaterally, and especially <i>in public</i> and not on IRC with whoever happens to be in channel at the time. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 22:53, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>I've just stumbled across this after someone mentioned Beta being dragged in front of the Arbcom, Irpen, please relax, you seem very aggressive in tone here and there's no assumption of good faith by you on the part of anybody else here at all, it really seems your intent on dragging this to Arbcom, which to my mind is, at this time, unnecessary. We're dealing with usernames here, something that some people see as fine and others see as being excessive, it has been suggested on IRC that Beta stop blocking users for a little while (a couple of weeks) and instead, should watch others performing username blocks and looking through the RFC/N page to see what usernames are being thought of as unacceptable there too. ArbCom is really not the place to discuss the good faith functions of an admin, rather, it should be a last resort if the admin or any editor refuses to change their behavior, is seriously damaging the project, is doing nothing to help the project at all, and all other avenues to rectify the situation have been exhausted. We're not their yet and I think if you try a less confrontational approach, we might be able to make some really significant headway here. <font face="Arial">-- <b><a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHeligoland_92a7.html" title="User:Heligoland"><font color="blue">Heligo</font></a><a href="../../../h/e/l/User_talk%7EHeligoland_4c54.html" title="User talk:Heligoland"><font color="red">land</font></a></b></font> 23:45, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

After briefly looking over this issue, I think betacommand's blocks have been made in good faith in this particular instance, there has been evidence to suggest that the 2 users are sockpuppets. However there have been a number of users blocked (once again) for username violations; User:Asdf555, User:Sally catastrophe;, User:B;uedog, User:Ihatechillums which are questionable to say the least <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanpostlethwaite_bb6d.html" title="User:Ryanpostlethwaite"><font color="green">Ryan</font><font color="purple">Postlethwaite</font></a><sup>See <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ryanpostlethwaite_1aae.html" title="Special:Contributions/ryanpostlethwaite">the mess I've created</a> or <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanpostlethwaite_d7e9.html" title="User talk:Ryanpostlethwaite">let's have banter</a></sup> 23:04, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your characterization of it is inaccurate.

I posted for the purpose of bringing these links to people's attention, not for any "characterizations" of my own. The links are part—the most important part—of how I "present" (as you say) past events. They show Jimbo's endorsement of the Giano block, and they show how severely the community criticized the block of Irpen.

<li>Thank you, Friday. Given that we're seeing the very same list of names appearing in support of Betacommand's blocks this time as last, and some of the same names upset at unilateral blocking (without warning, of course) plus quite a few more, it is time for an RFC, as I don't think that the one important remedy has been accepted: confer. Confer on AN/I. Find an uninvolved person. If your last block got overturned, think twice before the next one. It's no vendetta: it's an attempt to ensure that we don't keep going over the same ground and losing people and escalating into wars. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:13, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkoppensboer_6874.html" title="User:Skoppensboer">User:Skoppensboer</a> has a chronic history of BLP violations, personal attacks, using edit summaries to tendiciously taunt other editors, general incivility, and "soapboxery", particularly revolving around the article and talk page of <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matt_Drudge_c363.html" title="Matt Drudge">Matt Drudge</a>. He appears to have no respect at all for <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>, or <a href="../../../s/o/a/WP%7ESOAPBOX_345c.html" title="WP:SOAPBOX">WP:SOAPBOX</a>, and has ignored multiple warnings over time from multiple editors to stop adding material about Drudge's alleged homosexuality, information about his mother's mental illness, (and anything else he can come up with to smear the subject), to stop adding unsourced statements, to stop reinserting previously removed unsourced statements without even attempting to source them, and to stop attacking numerous editors. (And also to stop referring to me as Crackpot). He removed a valid and well sourced NPA warning from his talk page today as well. I have tried to be civil with this editor for months, but last night, he accused me of "obsessively editing" the article in question, when the edit history shows that I had not edited the article since December 7, 2006, so I pretty much lost it and regrettably became uncivil myself. I have calmed down and am attempting to continue to be civil, but this editor just keeps on behaving badly.</p>
<p>Here are a few of the most recent examples of his incivility and attacks. A scan of <a href="../../../m/a/t/Talk%7EMatt_Drudge_c1e7.html" title="Talk:Matt Drudge">Talk:Matt Drudge</a> and examination of his edit history will no doubt reveal many more violations. I'm pretty much fed up with being nice and diplomatic with this guy. I have never asked for sanctions against him in the past, but now I am asking for a block. He may try to claim that I have violated 3RR there today, but I maintain that I am protected by <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> from a 3RR sanction.</p>

<dd>It is funny that you should say that because the vandal above has some "tells" that point to something I dealt with a while back from a group of editors. I suspected it was a group of school kids playing a game where they vandalized articles and then tried to see if they could get each other blocked. As I suspected, their IP resolved to a school.

<dd>While it is of course true that it would have been better style for dab not to do the block himself but ask others to do it, I note: (1) that this was a absolutely clear-cut case of a 3RR violation; (2) I cannot but admire dab's patience in defending this and related articles from an endless succession of obsessive POV-pushers; (3) Looking at the talkpage, dab's assessment that this particular POV-pusher had crossed the line into a state of irrational lawyering where he was beyond reach of normal rational dispute resolution is not unreasonable. It wouldn't be the first such case. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 09:59, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The above is added as a public service. As Dmcdevit said, it's a very bad idea to block someone you are in a dispute with. It may have been POV pushing and probably was 3RR (there are at least four partial reverts in that mess somewhere), but it was not patent nonsense, vandalism, or simple disruption. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 21:19, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>reading the instruction above, it seems I can post this here. He also threatened me on the page. He has been very uncivil also. The issue is WP:OR policy. Dab should be enforcing WP:OR policy, but he is adding orignal research and removing relevent, properly citied material. I have tried to involve third party, mediation cabal, and other editors on the AMT page to help resolve this issue. Every time he is asked to provide citaion, he talks OR without any verifiable content. As an admin he should be held to higher standards.<a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbhushan_3b43.html" title="User:Sbhushan">Sbhushan</a> 21:46, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My unblock request was to an independent admin. Dab is already biased. I had requested that the independent admin should define how long I should not edit. Could someone look at the issue in detail and decide who should be blocked. All my edits have removed OR and only added verifiable content relevent to topic from acceptable sources. Dab on other hand has removed properly cited material and added OR without citation. One place he did cite, he misrepresented the cited material (2 of my 4 were to fix that).<a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbhushan_3b43.html" title="User:Sbhushan">Sbhushan</a> 01:48, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Saying htat you have been libeled is not a legal threat. Saying you are going to sue for libel, is the threat. Libel is simply a legal word for lying maliciously about someone. It is not a threat but rather a description of facts as that person sees them. For example, saying that "Othello murdered Desdemona" is not a legal threat. Nor is saying "Othello libeled Desdemona". Simply changing it to second person (i.e. "You libeled me") does not change that to a threat. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 05:40, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Tbeatty, people here are neither stupid nor slow. Jayzel did not simply say "you libeled me". The threat part was "libel is not taken lightly" (in bold) ... "you better have a strong case". Many reasonable would, and have, taken that as a very thinly veiled legal threat. It was certainly a threat of <i>some</i> kind, and the choice of legal words makes a legal threat a reasonable inference. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 09:35, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dt>Derex, comments which are "legal threats" in order to be a bona-fide "threat", must pass muster as having two key elements 1) ability and 2) intention. If a person says "I am going to fart the world out of existance", that's not a threat, because it's not possible (ability). If a person says, "I hope you leave wiki sooner rather than later", that's also not a threat, because nothing is stated as to what the speaker might actually <b>do' <i>to cause that wish to come to fruition (intention). Another way of loking at it would be this: A person of faith says to an Atheist "I pray that God strikes you dead". To the prayer-maker, that may indeed be a threat, but since the Atheist does not believe in God, a key element (ability) is missing. From the Atheistic standpoint, the prayers have no effect and therefore, no ability. The point of this is that I feel threats must be only seen as such if A)they are explicit ("I am going to sue you") and B) obviously not rag-time ("I am going to petition the UN to have you imprisoned"). Of these though, the explicit element I feel is most key. There is no threat if the speaker does not state a</i></b> <i>specific action <b>he/she intends to undertake so as to</b> advance</i> the legal action. Allusions to various legal-themed terminology does not rise to the level of a threat. In this case, the choice of words was poor, but no threat was made. 64.74.153.189 16</dt>

<dd>I thank you all for inviting me to this discussion. This user has had a vendetta against me for quite some time.

<dd>Well, at least the cart didn't come before the horse (badabing!) But seriously, folks, your comment above: "'libel' has a meaning outside of jurisprudence, which, while true" shows you need to take a step back and take a deep breath before taking such drastic actions as permanently banning a long-time contributor. The "don't make legal threats" rule is for searious violations like "I will sue you" or "I will call the police on you". Not for uses of a legitimate English word "libel". The bold lettering in my original statement was in response to Jiffy putting in bold lettering # <b>Warning to all concerned</b> User Jayzel is drumming up support on other pages trying to influence the vote and also adding unsigned comments to this page in order to persuade the discussion.

<dd>Really think here. I responded by saying: "As for your other charge, <b>libel is not taken lightly</b>. You'd better have a solid case." I am only guilty of carelessly leaving off the word "here". As in, Libel is not taken lightly HERE. At Wikipedia. Lieing about someone can be seen as a personal attack. That was the intention of my comment. As for the political charge, it is being pointed at Derex. Check our histories going back to October and maybe before. He has been itching to get at me. He has been obsessed over the campaign finance article. The same battles I am getting into with his puppet AllanBColson the last couple months are the exact same battles I have had with Derex at the article. In fact, Colson's edits there began the moment Derex's ended. Now that Colson has violated the revert rule I suspect once a admin gets around to blocking him, Derex will be blocked as well. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayzel68_b0f1.html" title="User:Jayzel68">Jayzel</a> 23:24, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have just agreed to a request for full protection of this article, the reason being is that its has attracted a lot of vandalism from non IP accounts recently.

<p>There is borderline vandalism going on at <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> for several days now, with a problem editor who repeatedly blanks out the Norwegian flag with the listings of Svalbard and Jan Mayen from the list of regions within Europe, but refuses to account for this action on the discussion. In his latest edit summary, he said there is no need for him to discuss or explain his views because he is simply right and all the editors who revert him are wrong, so with one party refusing to come to the table for discussion, the edit war just drags on and on. What else can be done? <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 00:07, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well I say borderline because he may have some content dispute, but he isn't making it on the discussion page. I had to do my own investigation, and found the same editor has proposed the article <a href="../../../s/v/a/Svalbard_and_Jan_Mayen_cc13.html" title="Svalbard and Jan Mayen">Svalbard and Jan Mayen</a> for a deletion, so that sems to afford some clues, but when I asked him (via edit summary) to wait for the outcome of that afd, he replied (via edit summary) that it was "irrelevant"... As best as I can piece together from his summaries, his beef seems to be that because Norway considers them sovereign and fully integrated parts of Norway, there is no need to mention them at all in a list of geographic areas found within Europe. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 00:43, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's because there is no "conflict of interest". It's simply something invented by <a href="../../../d/o/k/User%7EDoktor_Who_a947.html" title="User:Doktor Who">Doktor Who</a> to harrass me. He keeps telling people that I have a commercial conflict of interest because I've been an ambient music radio broadcaster for 18 years - despite the fact that I work as an unpaid volunteer for a not-for-profit organisation. The only reason he's doing this is because I removed a number of unreferenced statements which he'd written into <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_music.html" title="Space music">Space music</a>, one article among many in which he continually flouts <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>.</dd>

<p>The following usupported personal attacks have been made against me on User Talk Pages "Sethswirsky" and "Athaenara":</p>
<p>"It's quite unfair of one wikipedia contributor to continue to try and label me something other than what i am. as an aside, it's a tad creepy considering the personal email I have also received from this person and the amount of times it seems they continue to try and revert the page to who they think i am. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Sethswirsky" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Sethswirsky" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Sethswirsky</a>)"</p>
<p>"i write political articles that this guy has a very hard time with, clearly. i've gotten repeated emails from him --i will post them to prove it. they are quite nasty."</p>
<p>"But, I'm telling you, this guy doesn't have a problem "following guidelines". He knows exactly what he's doing. It started with a very nasty, personal email to me on february 9th, from him . It was very, shall we say, "angry" sounding aboout a political piece I had written. A few days later is when he started changing a well researched Wikipedia entry someone started on me awhile ago and others have added to. For four days, he has labeled me something I'm not without citing a single source."</p>
<p>"Keep your chin up, Seth! You have been subjected to a great deal of unpleasantness through no fault of your own. You are, I believe, behaving extremely well, especially considering the lengths to which one user has gone to cause you to suffer. — Athænara ✉ 09:03, 20 February 2007 (UTC)"</p>
<p>I would ask that these be removed. I have not sent any such e-mails to this Swirsky person and the comment about "suffering" by Athaenara could not be more over-the-top. I attempted to address this issue on Athaenara's talk page myself but she repeatedly deleted my responses and left "Seth Swirsky's" slanderous comments about me in place.

<p>Latest incident in long-standing content dispute on David Westerfield article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Westerfield" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Westerfield" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>. The above user has repeatedly removed (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Westerfield&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Westerfield&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>) a short but important and well-sourced addition to the article which was approved by a third party (Girdag) a month ago (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:David_Westerfield/Archive2#A_Proposal" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:David_Westerfield/Archive2#A_Proposal" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>). Interestingly, FfJ’s response at the time to Girdag’s suggestions was “I think that is an excellent proposal”. But he has now done an about-turn.</p>
<p>This user has a history of misbehavior. Just a few days ago, he deleted all recent criticism of himself from his Talk page (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Fighting_for_Justice&amp;oldid=107927063" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Fighting_for_Justice&amp;oldid=107927063" rel="nofollow">[26]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Fighting_for_Justice&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Fighting_for_Justice&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>), then promptly archived the CENSORED version of that page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Fighting_for_Justice/Archive_1" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Fighting_for_Justice/Archive_1" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>. (That criticism was by LexiLynn, NowIAmGeorge and Wooyi.) So a casual observer would think he was perfect, or at least that he had reformed. (He apparently tried to do something similar on the Westerfield Talk page at about the same time, but then claimed he just “messed up” - see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Wknight94#DW_again" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Wknight94#DW_again" rel="nofollow">[29]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:David_Westerfield&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:David_Westerfield&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>.) In early January, Wknight94 referred to him as “the king of personal attacks” <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:David_Westerfield/Archive2#Article_protected_again" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:David_Westerfield/Archive2#Article_protected_again" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>. He seems determined to retain his crown, as can be seen from his latest descriptions of me: “troll” (he’s used that several times) and “child-murderer fan” <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Westerfield&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Westerfield&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>. I am a TRUTH fan. Some of his comments are just plain childish, such as “impressive you can use the caps lock button on your keyboard. ME TOO. &lt;----- see??? ” and “ooooh all capital letters like you use” (that was because I put ONE word, “truth”, in capitals).</p>
<p>He first appeared in Wikipedia in September last year, soon after TripleH1976 was banned and, even though he denies it, I still suspect he’s just another sockpuppet of that user. They have such similar interests and methods, for example: both hold strong views, both launch frequent personal attacks, both are active on the Westerfield and Eric Rudolph articles, and both delete or archive whatever they don’t like.196.15.168.40 09:03, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I believe and should always take precedence over ampersands, and the same for full spellings over contractions; it's an encyclopaedia, after all. I've never heard of something like this... perhaps you can continue to warn, until it gets to the level where they'd be blocked, like with say spam or vandalism?

To me, both of these indicated that the editor doesn't "get it" and is just trying to be disruptive. Per his talkpage however, he seems to feel that I was trolling him here on ANI and that I should not have reviewed his block. So... I'm bringing it here. If anyone wants to review the block again, feel free to. I'd suggest contacting Proto before unblocking. I assumed that the block had nothing to do with the username and was more related to the series of unhelpful comments User:MoeLarryAndJesus was making on ANI in the midst of some admins trying to difuse the situation.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 14:13, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree the user was making poor comments here, however, in that thread there were comments that were saying he was close to a username block. I think possibly the block was for trolling and a username violation.

<li>Correct, I blocked him for his blatant and self-evident trolling. For a purported new user, this was a very specific and unusual place to suddenly show up and start sniping at editors and making disruptive, smartass comments. Nothing to do with the name - I'm probably one of the more lenient on usernames. If someone has a urgent, burning need to undo or reduce the block, fine, but as far as I'm concerned, it can stay. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a>&#160;<a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></a> 14:31, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Maybe my comment on ANI was misunderstood; I wasn't making a judgment either way on his username. My point was that while you are undergoing a username review, drawing attention to yourself with disruptive, unhelpful edits is probably not a good idea. My decision to endorse Proto's block had way more to do with what he said here on ANI. The fact that he chose another provocative username to change to just suggested to me that he was trying to make a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> and an unblock was probably not the best idea.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 14:50, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

He has repeatedly blocked IP addresses for prolonged periods following very small amounts of vandalism with very few if any warnings. Raul654 is one of our most experienced administrators, which makes this all the more concerning. <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBLOCK_89b0.html" title="WP:BLOCK">WP:BLOCK</a> says: "Blocks should not be used against isolated incidents of vandalism." That description definitely applies to at least some of Raul's recent blocks. I have discussed this with him on <a href="../../../r/a/u/User_talk%7ERaul654_d9a5.html" title="User talk:Raul654">his talk page</a> and, while acknowledging he may have overreacted is trying to come up with various excuses, none of which are particularly persuasive, and he still hasn't unblocked any of them.

<dd>I'm not sure I'd characterise the brief discussion on his talk as a "policy does not apply to me" attitude, though your own attitude seems to be a bit off (IMO). I haven't looked closely into the blocks, but as a general note the block stuff is often a guideline and a judgement call needs to be made, looking at individual blocks in isolation can miss patterns of vandalism the blocker may note (though Raul654 hasn't suggested this to be the case). --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 20:34, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I believe Raul is fine here; a lot of that vandalism was made to the main page, and he was just making sure they wouldn't do it again. The last thing we want is to give a person three chances to blank a <i>main page FA</i> - one of our key publicity points. I applaud Raul for having the correct mindset when it comes to TFA vandalism. — <b><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_96c6.html" title="User:Deckiller">Deckill</a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User_talk%7EDeckiller_aecd.html" title="User talk:Deckiller">er</a></b> 20:37, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I suggest you do look closely into the blocks. Take the block of User:129.67.128.222, for example. One edit, blanking the day's featured article, is the only thing in the IP's contribs, and Raul blocked it for a week with no warnings. As I said on his talk page, it being the featured article may justify not issuing a warning first, but it doesn't justify a longer block than 24 hours (the article is only featured for that long, for a start). It's not the discussion on his talk page that suggests his attitude, it's his logs - policy says one thing, he's done the other and apparently has no intention of changing his ways. I can't see any reason for him doing that unless he feels above policy. --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> 20:43, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The IP given looks static to me, it's an Oxford Uni IP blanking a featured article about an Oxford Uni College. Policy doesn't give absolutes, but even if I agree it seems a long block one on it's own doesn't seem to indicate a huge problem. I'd have to look through mutiple, filter out ones where similar vandalism is going on and so maybe connected, filter out any where there is suspected "sockpuppetry" (I'll assume Raul marks those resulting from his checkuser privileges as such). I'm not sure how you can divine an attitude from looking at a block log. What I can see from the dicussion is Raul admit an overreaction, you following up with some rather patronising comments a bit more discussion where Raul doesn't appear to be being obstructive and again your comments seem far from constructive in trying to reach a reasonable conclusion. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 21:24, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I trust his judgment too, but it wouldn't be a horrible idea to have a reasonbale explanation. Without prejudice, I went back over his recent blocks and made the list below. This list contains all of his blocks over the last two or so weeks. The bolded ones look, on the surface, like they could use additional explanation. I flagged those blocks that were either of a likely dynamic IP (in which case the block is useless) or where there was only one edit and no obvious reason to block. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 22:06, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

Two of those are editorials that Some Guy On The Internet (tm) wrote and none of them are what I would call reliable. Jimbo himself has said that instead of slapping a "citation needed" tag on unsourced facts, we ought to remove it. One of the passages started off with, "It is unknown whether the number of supportive or critical letters is indicative ...". Well, Wikipedia isn't a crystal ball - our job isn't to guess what Bill O'Reilly's letter selection process might be. Unless I'm missing something, not only was this a good faith edit, but there's little question that it was the right edit. I have removed most of the passage that the IP removed.

<li>While that might be true of the first paragraph, you have conveniently ignored the fact that he removed *three* paragraphs, not one, and that the latter two were sourced to reliable sources (Media watchdog Mediamatters, and the documentary they produced, Outfoxed), and that those paragraphs should not have been removed. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> 01:22, 28 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>He explained his removal in the edit summary. He had removed three paragraphs - I only removed two of them. I left in place the one about "Outfoxed" as it is the most meaningful and sourced of the three ... but even that is barely worth having in the article. That's an editorial decision that I don't see how anyone could be faulted for removing it. There's a whole article on criticism of O'Reilly and a section in the main article accusing him of conservative bias when he doesn't claim to be anything but a conservative doesn't make too much sense. If you have to argue about which paragraphs should have been removed, it's a content dispute, not vandalism. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 13:57, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>You removed one of the above paragraphs, not two.</li>
<li><i>There's a whole article on criticism of O'Reilly and a section in the main article accusing him of conservative bias when he doesn't claim to be anything but a conservative doesn't make too much sense.</i> - Had you read the article before removing that information, you would have noticed that it says "O'Reilly disagrees with a common claim that he is a conservative, preferring to call himself a traditionalist and a populist." That cited information about his conservative leanings is there specifically because it refutes his laughably-hollow claim that he's an independent. And, in fact, that's subsantially the onus for the "Allegations of Bias" section, which this anon basically shredded. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> 02:20, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

The second edit wasn't a spectacular edit, but it certainly wasn't vandalism - it was a newbie making a newbie mistake.</i></b>
<ul>
<li>This summary is wrong on both counts. The block was for 48 hours, and the second edit wasn't POV, it was flatly, factually incorrect (it removed a citation and changed the sentence to say the exact opposite of what it had previously said). This is subtle vandalism by definition. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> 02:51, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>That's fine and that's a reasonable explanation ... but if that's the case, it should be noted as a {{<a href="../../../c/h/e/Template%7ECheckuserblock_bb3f.html" title="Template:Checkuserblock">checkuserblock</a>}} so that if the vandal later comes along and claims that their IP is dynamic, an admin won't unblock, not realizing that there was a checkuser reason for the block. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 23:07, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Precisely. The blocks I'm questioning have block reasons like "vandalism" despite the blocks clearly being for something more than that (assuming they are justifiable blocks). If Raul has a good reason for the blocks, he should be including it in his block reason - that's what the box is there for. --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> 12:32, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If I block someone based on checkuser results, I note that either explicitly or implicitly (if I state it's a sockpuppet of a certain user, that can be taken as implicit checkuser). One of these blocks was based on checkuser ("Troll known as 40 year old tenured professor"), the rest were not. Nor, for that matter, has there been any evidence presented here that any of them were in error. I stand by every one of them, and nobody here has presented a scintilla of evidence that these users were engaged in anything but the misdeeds I noted in the block summary. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> 02:17, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Marked as vandalism in the block summary, too. I checked the diffs, and though I don't agree with the edits, it's not like he put a penis picture in the middle of the article. just a typical POV edit that should have been reverted and the user welcomed to Wiki and given the generic letter referring to policies. ~I notice it was a FA, and wonder if Raul is just <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">very protective</a> of those articles. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffpw_23d5.html" title="User:Jeffpw">Jeffpw</a> 14:46, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, I agree with the edit. The original sentence IS misleading... it's a poorly worded statistical shell game. What it really <b>means</b> is that Israel suffered a higher average 'casualties per day' over the course of three weeks than the US did over the course of ten years in Vietnam. Hardly surprising given that those ten years weren't intense fighting every day. If you don't parse the 'proportionately' properly the sentence <i>seems</i> to say, "Israel suffered three times as many casualties in 3 weeks of fighting as the United States did during almost a decade of <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam_War_129f.html" title="Vietnam War">fighting in Vietnam</a>"... which would be grossly incorrect. The sentence is POV through statistical misrepresentation. You could as easily say, 'Proportionately, Israel suffered only a third of the casualties in those three weeks as the United States did on the worst day of fighting in Vietnam'... just as 'true' and just as obviously slanted to express a particular POV. It would be better to just cite how many Israelis were killed (per day or in total) and leave off the statistically biased comparisons entirely. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 12:43, 1 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You are wildly wrong on what the sentence means. The sentence is saying that if you take the casualties Israel suffered in the war (which lasted 3 weeks) and divide by the population, you get a value very close to what you get if you take the casualties suffered by the US in the Vietnam war (which lasted ~10 years) and divide by the US population. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> 22:29, 1 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If so, then the fact that the sentence says <b>nothing</b> about 'total population figures' rather proves the point about it being poorly worded and misleading... and it remains a statistical shell game. The US population is roughly 42 times that of Israel... so if Israel lost one soldier and the US lost 14 then 'by proportion of population' Israel lost three times as many. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 12:42, 2 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The total casualty figures are given in the warbox at the very beginning of the article. But in talking about war wariness and such, absolute numbers like that are not terribly meaningful unless you know either the total population they relate to, or the proportion. So, to rebuff your point, it's not a shell game, it's EXACTLY how you are supposed measure the impact of a war. That's exactly how the cited sources DOES measure it. And the novel aspect of that sentence is that to convey that Israel suffered as many casualties per capita in three weeks what the US suffered in ten years, which is extremely relavant to describing reaction to the war. Furthermore, changing the sentence to say the opposite is not biased, it's simply objectively wrong. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> 15:40, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree. It is quite poorly worded. Regardless....I'm struggling to get my head around how User:68.253.217.64's edits can reasonably be described as vandalism <i>at all</i>, let lone vandalism so severe and blatant as to merit an immediate 48 hour block without any warning...initially he removed the entire sentence (whilst leaving the bit about high Israeli casualties), was then <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yom_Kippur_War&amp;diff=111084084&amp;oldid=111037014" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yom_Kippur_War&amp;diff=111084084&amp;oldid=111037014" rel="nofollow">reverted</a>, and possibly intended the second edit as some sort of compromise. At the very least, this block is really very harsh....unless Raul654 was privy to some line of evidence (e.g. as to previous vandal edits) that is not generally obvious? <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 14:43, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It's vandalism for the same reason it's vandalism to go to the world war II article and change it to say Germany won - e.g, changing objectively true facts to false ones.

<p>Personally, I think Raul654 should cut this out. We already have a good-sized group of vandal fighters who do the job well. We don't need someone else entirely doling out week-long blocks for single incidents. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> <a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">(tock)</a> 01:50, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I find this all disturbing. Almost more disturbing is the fact that some people seem to think that Raul's long standing here would somehow exempt him from following established procedures for warning, blocking and block length. Raul's comment on his talk page in response to Tango <i>"I really don't like people vandalizing my artilces"</i> indicates a <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a> in applying his admin actions in at least some of these cases. I don't think this is something to just give a pass on and I commend Tango for persuing this despite the potential backlash. —<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Bell_8398.html" title="User:Doug Bell">Doug&#160;Bell</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoug_Bell_81b5.html" title="User talk:Doug Bell">talk</a></sup> 02:33, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>(B) I will respond to allegations when someone makes one that's actually valid. Consider the latest one - an anon vandalizes an article to remove a cited statement, I revert, he comes back and changes it to say the exact opposite (aka, subtle vandalism), I revert and block him. Then I have to come here to argue with people who apparently (a) cannot tell the difference between a biased edit and one that is objectively wrong, and (b) are more concerned with the letter of the blocking policy than making sure our articles stay factually correct. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> 02:55, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Where you see subtle vandalism, I see a newbie making a newbie making a newbie mistake. He made exactly two edits. With no message on his/her talk page before or after the fact, you blocked him/her for a week. Even if we were to presuppose that the edit was not in good faith, a message to his/her talk page could have opened the door to a possible discussion on the subject. Any time you encounter someone with a redlinked talk page, it's important to engage that user. If they are making good faith edits, {{<a href="../../../w/e/l/Template%7EWelcome_2ac1.html" title="Template:Welcome">welcome</a>}} them. If you speedy an article they created in good faith, give them {{<a href="../../../f/i/r/Template%7EFirstarticle_3e50.html" title="Template:Firstarticle">firstarticle</a>}}. If you revert them and it isn't obvious vandalism, use an appropriate template like {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest_d929.html" title="Template:Test">test</a>}}, {{<a href="../../../u/w/-/Template%7EUw-delete1_7265.html" title="Template:Uw-delete1">Uw-delete1</a>}}, etc. The whole idea of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> is that we give people the benefit of the doubt, at least temporarilly. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 05:01, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wikipedia is now one of the top ten largest sites in the world. Disruptive trolls know exactly what they are doing, and they play it like a game because we allow them to. It flat out disgusts me when I see an administrator, someone who should be setting an example for others, tell someone off for reporting an occurence of blatant vandalism to <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> because the vandal hasn't been "warned enough" for adding what is generally libellous, racist, or otherwise highly offensive material to one of our articles. Raul654 did the right thing here, and troublemakers who intentionally vandalize the wiki in such a manner need to be shown the door immediately. <a href="../../../r/f/e/User%7ERFerreira_c585.html" title="User:RFerreira">RFerreira</a> 06:41, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Who are you talking about? I don't think I've editing AIV in a month. At any rate, we're not talking about "libellous, racist, or otherwise highly offensive material". There are two distinct issues that I raised, both of which are unrelated to your point. (1) Blocking of dynamic IP addresses for a week is unhelpful. (2) Blocking anyone when the edits <i>might</i> not have been vandalism is unhelpful. If someone adds "libellous, racist, or otherwise highly offensive material" to an article, don't expect me to shed tears when they are blocked without warning. But that's a red herring here - the blocks in question involve nothing of the sort. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 06:49, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

As to the dynamic IP address issue, I also disagree. There is a difference, a huge difference, between a dynamic address assigned to a DSL subscriber versus a dial-up modem user.

<p><b>Issue:</b> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">User:Antaeus Feldspar</a> continues his long-runnning attacks of me and attempts to get me in trouble with admins that I am very used to dealing with on Scientology Series talk pages (and in his edit summaries) but now he has brought his venom to the noticeboards and it needs to stop now. Recently he has disrupted the BLP noticeboard, and this board, in addition to his usual talk page performances. He also recently violated 3RR on the BLP noticeboard in addition to making an unjustified allegation of <a href="../../../p/a/_/WP%7EPA_04e2.html" title="WP:PA">WP:PA</a> against me there.

<p><b>Request:</b> I, of course, cannot require it but would appreciate it if the highly POV and involved editors/admins on both sides of the Scientology issue abstain from commenting here. That means the three or more known admins with heavy off-site activity in attacking Scientology and those editors that are involved in the perpetual arguing and edit-warring that goes on in those articles. I mean <b>both</b> "sides". Why? Because all that will do is carry the same poisonous invective over here and this AN/I report is, if anything ,about that invective. Let's let the neutral uninvolved parties have their say, for a change. I promise that I will try my hardest to not say a lot more than I am saying now and, of course, Antaeus will have his say but if we could limits the POV "helpers" for either of us then that would great.</p>
<p><b>Heads-up:</b> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">User:Antaeus Feldspar</a> will likely bring up any and all incidents of my being less that respectful to him as a perceived "defense". I am not going to respond to those; if <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">User:Antaeus Feldspar</a> feels that he has a case then he should bring it; but not in this incident report. If I have been short or sarcastic with him, my only defense is that I tired quickly of the attacks and I think it will be clear that my comments are not nearly in the same league as <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">User:Antaeus Feldspar</a>'s calcuated disruptions. But this is not about me despite any upcoming attemps to make it so.</p>
<p><b>Incidents:</b> I am just bringing up the most recent incidents and concentrating on those that are disruptive of the noticeboards as they are off-topic and are, IMO, intended to get an admin to sanction me without due process. Note that no admin has done that to me so it has been in vain.</p>

Justanother seems to believe that <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Wikipedia:Assume good faith</a> simply <i>does not apply</i> to him. He believes that he can make as many personal attacks as he wants, and make them as vicious as he wants, as long as they are in the form of attacks upon the integrity of other editors. To start with just the accusations directed at me: Accusations that I am a religious bigot: "I can only assume [his motivation] is my being an open Scientologist". "While <i>some</i> might feel justified in treating Scientologists like second-class wiki-citizens..." <i>(emphasis added)</i> Accusations that I aid and abet trolls to further this alleged religious bigotry: "Please notice Feldspar's use of the word "our" rather than "your" when describing the trolls claims and opinions"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons/Noticeboard&amp;diff=110599171&amp;oldid=110553928" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons/Noticeboard&amp;diff=110599171&amp;oldid=110553928" rel="nofollow">[37]</a> (The post where I supposedly would have made my loyalties clear by using "your" is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:L._Ron_Hubbard&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=110370732" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:L._Ron_Hubbard&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=110370732" rel="nofollow">here</a>, BTW.)

Accusations that I engage in "calculated disruptions" and "[bring my] venom to the noticeboards" and "run roughshod over wikipedia talk pages and noticeboards" to "get him". What is deeply ironic is that Justanother seems absolutely horrified at the idea that his behavior could <i>ever</i> be questioned ("As part of his disruption of the BLP board by the above activity, he each time accused me of WP:PA") but at the same time seems to take it as his <i>right</i> to not just <i>question</i> other editors' behavior but declare the question settled and <i>label</i> the other editors on the basis of his assumptions.

Since there are many like-minded people here and since Scientology has a bad reputation and there are only very few people who actually are interested in Scientology outside of anti-cultists and Scientologists, there is absolutely no chance to get a neutral article here.

<p>As far as I can tell, just about everything that Justanother is accusing others of, he himself is in fact the person who has done. It is particularly problematic that he has, while in the middle of making heated accusations against others, has labeled others' better-grounded concerns about his own conduct as <i>personal attacks</i> and <i>disruption</i>.</p>
<p>As Antaeus notes above, it is as if Justanother feels he has the right to criticize others' work (and quite forcefully), but others do not have the same right in return. What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander; it is not acceptable to proclaim (as Justanother seems to be with his <i>"this is not about me"</i>) that oneself must be held above criticism.</p>
<p>I agree, by the way, that the problem here is probably largely one of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. Justanother behaves as if anyone who disagrees with him on certain issues -- particularly the relevance of certain information pertaining to Scientology, some of which the Scientology operation itself has long tried to suppress -- is thereby demonstrated to be malicious, or at least deficient in good judgment. This is not acceptable conduct for a Wikipedia editor. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 19:00, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've already said all I need to say. The supposed "5RR" did not exist and it is challenging to say the least, to try and figure out under what standard (if <i>any</i> such single standard exists) it is <i>perfectly okay</i> to accuse someone of being a religious bigot, it is perfectly okay to claim they're guilty of "calculated disruptions", it is perfectly okay to fulminate about their "belittlement" and "marginalization" and "venom" and "invective", <b>but</b> for the person accused of all this, to identify a statement that similarly makes accusations of bad faith as a personal attack is somehow <i>itself</i> a personal attack.

<dd>Well that certainly makes two of us that are tired of "the treatment".

<dd>Well, I can't stop what I never started. If you actually perceive "attempted belittlement and marginalization" perhaps it's because of your tendency (<i>very</i> apparent in this, the section of <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> that you are trying to <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">OWN</a>) that when someone sees a situation in any other way than you, you cannot or will not consider any good-faith explanations but immediately jump to (and loudly broadcast) the conclusion that it has to do with you being a Scientologist and the person you disagree with not being one, and as shown by your continuing repeated references to a non-existent 3RR violation, facts simply play no role in the process.

<dd>Calton, just because it worked doesn't mean it wasn't premature. You abused him, sneered at him, and accused him falsely of lying. He got upset and overreacted. You then asked for a community ban, and he got more upset and overreacted even more. Perhaps someone will accuse you of lying, sneer at you, belittle you, call you Calty boy, revert you with popups, call you a "not-very-bright troll", post a link to a blog that ridicules you, so that others can see it, and then ask for a community ban when you get upset and overreact.

<li>Oh dear. It was pretty much inevitable that he'd end up blocked, since the whole problem in the first place was that he refuses to accept what he doesn't want to hear, it's just unfortunate that what I see as genuine good-faith efforts to help him avoid this have been killed off by his own behaviour. Even his friends seem to have stopped supporting him. It's hard to dispute that Gordon has a serious problem accepting that people have heard what he has to say and rejected it and also that he really <i>really</i> does not believe us when we say that there is a consensus for restricting his disruption, but I'd still say we could consider unblocking him if he shows that he has <a href="../../../s/t/i/WP%7ESTICK_4a45.html" title="WP:STICK">put down the stick and backed away from the horse</a> - but not before. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 09:41, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Unlike blocked users, <i>banned</i> users are not welcome, period, and that includes the use of their own talk pages. This was recently discussed at Talk:RFAR, and appears to be an issue that slipped through the cracks when the developers changed the software to allow blocked users to edit their own talk pages. Remember that a ban is a decision that someone in not welcome, a block is merely the technical means of enforcing the ban. If and when consensus for a permanent ban seems to have solidified, it would be appropriate to protect his user talk page. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 12:33, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Endorse block, though I'd support limiting this particular one to a month or so. After that, unblock him, keep the existing Schiavo-related restrictions in place and see how he does. If he goes right back to the same behavior, make it permanent. I also suggest that he read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:GordonWatts&amp;curid=1861997&amp;diff=111812702&amp;oldid=111810152" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:GordonWatts&amp;curid=1861997&amp;diff=111812702&amp;oldid=111810152" rel="nofollow">Ann's comments</a> and really take the advice to heart.

<p>I oppose an indefinite block. I agree that his behaviour has been pretty bad recently, but it has been partly brought on because he was upset at Calton's behaviour. Somebody (NOT Gordon) added a link to a website that Gordon likes (but NOT his own site) in January. <s>An anon, very likely Amorrow, made numerous edits in February, with massive undiscussed changes, one of which was to remove that link. Gordon reverted back to the last edit from a previous editor; therefore, the link was reinserted.</s> [Change to: An anon made numreous edits in February, with several changes, including reinsertion of the link, and was reverted by another editor. Gordon reverted back to the last edit from the anon; therefore, the link was reinserted.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Terri_Schiavo&amp;diff=104281750&amp;oldid=103921498" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Terri_Schiavo&amp;diff=104281750&amp;oldid=103921498" rel="nofollow">[46]</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">Musical L</a><a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist">inguist</a> 16:05, 2 March 2007 (UTC)] Calton removed the link, accusing Gordon of attempting to sneak it in. Gordon was upset. Calton was abusive, aggressive, sneering, hostile, accused him falsely of lying, shouted at him (with capitals), called him Gordy boy, reverted his edits with popups, and generally played a role in precipitating this. As could be predicted, Gordon overreacted and behaved very badly, so now Calton is vindicated, and can continue to assert that he doesn't need to treat such editors with respect, because when they get banned, they prove that he's right about them. I suggest leaving this for a week (I'm very busy anyway), and then seeing if someone can nicely ask Gordon to agree to stop arguing, for his own sake, and to agree to stop mentioning his links, and to accept that he can make just one post a day on Schiavo-related talk pages. At this stage, I'd support also restricting it to one post per day on Jimbo's talk page, admin noticeboards, community noticeboards, and ArbCom or RfC pages that don't involve him. I also think that JzG to it wrong in saying that the agreement was that he was banned from Schiavo articles. Everybody agrees either that his article edits are not problematic at all (if he stops promoting his links, which I think he has agreed to do) or that they're much less problematic than his massive talk page posts. The Community Noticeboard <a href="../../../c/o/m/Wikipedia%7ECommunity_noticeboard_Archive2_e838.html#Motion_to_close" title="Wikipedia:Community noticeboard/Archive2">discussion</a> showed some support for a complete ban from anything to do with Schiavo and also some support for a restriction to one post a day on Schiavo talk pages and unlimited edits on articles. I think we need to look into that again, though of course his recent behaviour may result in some of the people who initially would have allowed a Schiavo restriction switching over to a Schiavo ban. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">Musical L</a><a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist">inguist</a> 13:23, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I wonder, how many potential contributors decide to withhold images because attribution doesn't appear alongside the image itself? <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 16:40, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>User:Roaster2008, has been removing nn and speedy delete tags from vanity pages without sources that he has created, two of his pages have already been deleted today and he just recreated it again. Additional he has been vandalising my talk page, here is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Vintagekits&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Vintagekits&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">history</a>. Can admin please put a stop to this. Also I believe that IP:199.43.13.101 and IP:199.43.14.101 is a sockpuppet of Roaster and has engaged in similar behaviour.--<a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVintagekits_cef4.html" title="User:Vintagekits">Vintagekits</a> 13:48, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
