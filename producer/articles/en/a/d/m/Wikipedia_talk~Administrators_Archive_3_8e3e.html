<p>. Really, if one is to go, both should go. This is the kind of decision that makes me draw the conclusion that Wikipedia is hopelessly biased in favor of "consciousness-raising" and political correctness. I put that box up to indicate my language preference, not to advertise my political beliefs. If it is unacceptable, that's fine with me as long as the other one goes too.

I just wonder, why should we not do so? I easily understand that we should not use rollback on other people's good-faith but misguided edits, because reverting without explanation is rude and discourteous. But If I see an admin using rollback on their own edits, then I immeditately assume that it is a mistake they want to take back quickly, and it is not rude and discourteous to anyone but him- or herself. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 11:56, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I certainly agree with that. I've used rollback on my own errors. The only reason I could see to not use it would be if the MediaWiki software were recording how often the rollback feature is being used to do some sort of statistical analysis. If that's the case, then admins using it on their own edits would skew the results. <span style="font-family:Verdana;"><b><a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowcheng_1863.html" title="User:Howcheng"><span style="color: #33C;">howch</span></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><span style="color:#0F0"><i>e</i></span></a><a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowcheng_1863.html" title="User:Howcheng"><span style="color:#33C">ng</span></a></b> <small>{<a href="../../../h/o/w/User_talk%7EHowcheng_f4d4.html" title="User talk:Howcheng">chat</a>}</small></span> 23:49, 27 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The written rule is quite clear, without or without my addition: rollback is only for fighting vandalism. The question is, is there an unwritten rule that overrides the written rule? If so, we should fix that: reverse my change and make the exception(s) explicit.</dd>
<dd>That said, I do believe that the rule as written is correct: rollback is for fighing vandalism. It is not there for the convenience of priveledged users, even if the person being rolled back might not mind being rolled back.

<dd>I prefer the explanation at <a href="../../../r/e/v/Wikipedia%7ERevert_d321.html#Administrator_feature_.28rollbacks.29" title="Wikipedia:Revert">Wikipedia:Revert#Administrator feature (rollbacks)</a>. There is no "rule" as such against using rollback on non vandalism edits, but it may be considered a breach of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>. Originally I think rollback was only intended for vandalism, but times have changed. I use it when on RC patrol for reverting good-faith newbie tests, but I always leave a message on the user's talk. As for rolling back your own edits, if it saves time and doesn't really need an explanation then I don't see the problem. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_wub_6388.html" title="User:The wub">the wub</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_wub_1807.html" title="User talk:The wub"><font color="green">"?!"</font></a> 16:57, 20 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So I guess the middle ground is that one should be really careful when using the rollback against other editors when reverting good faith but mistaken edits. May send a very powerful message that the boys with the big guns find it below their dignity to explain their reversions, and we don't want editors, especially newbie editors, to think that way. <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> (<a href="../../../o/l/e/User_talk%7EOleg_Alexandrov_0298.html" title="User talk:Oleg Alexandrov">talk</a>) 20:53, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There are too many policies and rules, they change too often, and they are not always intuitive to find.

<p>Now that we have the procedure of marking the best articles through the {{<a href="../../../f/e/a/Template%7EFeatured_article_6eaa.html" title="Template:Featured article">featured article</a>}} template, I would like to propose that we also mark the user pages of our best users, i.e. administrators, by using the <a href="../../../a/d/m/Image%7EAdmin_mop.PNG_7afc.html" title="Image:Admin mop.PNG">admin mop image</a> (<a href="../../../a/d/m/Image%7EAdmin_mop.PNG_7afc.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/9/96/Admin_mop.PNG/20px-Admin_mop.PNG" alt="" width="20" height="22" longdesc="../../../a/d/m/Image%7EAdmin_mop.PNG_7afc.html" /></a>) through a new template: {{<a href="../../../a/d/m/Template%7EAdministrator_07f3.html" title="Template:Administrator">administrator</a>}}.

<dd>Admins are not necessarily 'our best users' (that's not a dig at admins, that's a recognition that we have some excellent non-admins, who are also amongst the best). That doesn't mean I object to having a template for this. Might be best to have it optional like the admin userbox?

<p>I don't personally like drawing attention to admin status. It's fine as a choice, but not as a requirement. I don't want people to automatically assume I know what I'm talking about by virtue of having admin access- I make mistakes, just like anybody, and I want them to be pointed out to me when I do. I also don't want newbies to think they're not allowed to disagree. I think we should de-emphasize the difference between "admins" and "normal users", not emphasize it. We're all just editors, when it comes down to it. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 17:01, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In the interests of transparency I would like to have <i>some</i> authoritative way to identify admins, whether it's a category, a list, a userbox, or some combination of the above. Since admins have been granted special priveleges by the community, their behaviour ought to be held to a higher standard. When a casual editor sees someone doing something "wrong", it should be possible to determine whether that person is an admin. --<a href="../../../s/a/f/User%7ESaforrest_5781.html" title="User:Saforrest">Saforrest</a> 17:25, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Awards for "best picture", "best actor", "Best scientist", "Best Wikipedia editor" make sense to me. But "Best janitor"? Per Friday, being an admin is not something to brag about, and its just a set of tools and assumes admins are somewhat more experienced. It is hard to judge what makes one a "good admin", unlike deciding what is a good article. So, I am opposed to the idea. <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> (<a href="../../../o/l/e/User_talk%7EOleg_Alexandrov_0298.html" title="User talk:Oleg Alexandrov">talk</a>) 17:34, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I like it, and would suggest that it be used by all admins. It's not a trophy, it's a simple icon that shows whether someone has admin status or not. It's a very useful thing to know about someone. The mop icon is good because it's particularly un-trophy-like. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevage_a8b0.html" title="User talk:Stevage">Stevage</a> 15:27, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Per Stevage; it doesn't look like a trophy. A user could easily look in the upper right corner of the page to find an admin for help; a user would have to scroll through an entire userpage to find an admin userbox, and even then, some admins don't use userboxes because they don't like them. Keep the mop icon. <a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><i><b>(^'-')^</b></i></a> <a href="../../../c/o/v/User%7ECovington_6d97.html" title="User:Covington">Covington</a> 02:46, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I like the idea - &lt;sarcasm&gt;also, it's a pain to <i>scroll down</i> and see if a user is in the category of admins&lt;/sarcasm&gt; - but if an admin isn't already in the category and doesn't carry the admin userbox, then they're not going to add the code to make the icon appear. So admins that do will have now have ±3 indications; admins that don't will continue to have none; and time and effort will have been spent for little net benefit.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">I'm feeling really unwelcomed by admins.</span></h2>
<p>Let's see. So far today - Someone speedied my article. An admin blocked me for an inappropiate username User:People=Shit immediately afterwards, preventing me from contesting the deletion, and blocking my IP so I couldn't create a new account to do it with either. After much grief, I got my IP unblocked and created a new account, but of course by this time the article (and associated images) was long gone. So, naively I guess, I decided to follow the advice left on my previous user talk page by an admin and list the article at deletion review. Shortly after I listed it, another admin removed the listing and accused me of trolling. Now one's left an attack on my new user talk page. I'm seriously considering just giving up, I'm getting attacked left, right and centre by the admins here. Killerman 18:20, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The article on William Hamlet Hunt was appropriately speedied. While Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia, we do not have an article on everyone. Thus, some standards of notability are applied. Mr. Hunt has not been the focus of any particular media attention because of his crime, and there does not appear to be anything in the article you created which asserts his notability for any other purpose.

<p>Here is what was sent to my personal discussion page:</p>
<p>Edward Capehart O'Kelley was speedy-deleted by User:Kungfuadam. If you have not yet talked to him/her, I recommend leaving a polite note on the admin's requesting clarification. Looking at the deleted content, I understand why the tag was added but looking at the page history, this does seem to have been carried out a bit precipitously. We've been fighting a fairly persistent vandal lately and your stub may have just gotten caught in the crossfire.</p>
<p>If talking to the deleting admin doesn't answer your questions, you have the option to petition for a review of the deletion decision at Wikipedia:Deletion review. Rossami (talk) 02:05, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>(copy of what I wrote there) Edward Capehart O'Kelley (edit|talk|links|history|watch) was deleted by Kungfuadam (talk • contribs • blocks • protects • deletions • moves). You are correct that it shouldn't have been speedy deleted, as it had the {{hangon}} template, and has 2 existing article references. The Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion explicitly states: "Before nominating an article for speedy deletion, please consider whether an article could be improved or reduced to a stub. Also, please note that some Wikipedians create articles in multiple saves, so try to avoid deleting a page too soon after its initial creation." You are incorrect as to the place to complain. That should have been Wikipedia:Deletion review. Unfortunately these days, just re-posting the same article again is sometimes considered a form of vandalism, so complain first, and during the review the old article will be undeleted so everybody can see it. --William Allen Simpson 03:06, 23 June 2006 (UTC) And to follow up, don't give up quite yet.... --William Allen Simpson 03:13, 23 June 2006 (UTC) Retrieved from "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jeff_Soapy_Smith" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jeff_Soapy_Smith" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jeff_Soapy_Smith</a>" <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff_Soapy_Smith_5669.html" title="User:Jeff Soapy Smith">Soapy</a> 05:11, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>User:Homeontherange is currently engaged in deleting people on the UK Conservative Right who have biographies. I suggest it is a politically motivated exercise. For instance, how could anyone say that Sam Swerling, one of England's leading law lecturers, and well-known political activist and writer, was not notable. Yet his bio article has vanished. Something needs to be done here. 81.129.155.181 22:53, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Admin Stalking</span></h2>
<p>I have been online for over 10 years 'playing' all through the ether. In that time I have never had my ip blocked once though I have come across all types in some programs. I have never been targeted online for anyhting apart from a couple of gentle 'boots' from one galah who wasnt viscious or kept it up night after night after night after night. In the last couple of weeks here my ip has been blocked several times when I objected to admin vandalism of stuff I had posted where meaning etc were changed making what I put up a heap of lies. I have made a lot of contributions to wik. I did make some errors as I had no idea what I was doing to start. They were not intentional. I cite most posts immediately, with references on the way in next couple of days re those I dont have the reference immediately to hand. (I have an arm injury so can't pull my cardboard box other filing cabinet off the top of the cupboard to get a couple of things out.) Since I have been on wik I have been continuously stalked by an admin who has been very rude, keeps vandalising stuff I put up, seems to be very fixated on following me around the ether and trying to control my every moove. Of course I told that admin to get lost. I am a former professional stalking/violence worker so have seen how it happens and where it ends up, and dont have regard for that sort of rot. I have never seen it to the extent that I have seen it happen on wik. I will tell any stalker to get lost. Its behaviour that isnt needed anywhere and if I am targeted to the point I am continuously being harassed and my health affected then it needs to stop. WHAT IS GOING ON HERE? IS IT ALWAYS LIKE THIS? I was going to put a heap of valuable stuff up but given how here is then its best to steer clear of the palce for the sake of my personal wellbeing.</p>
<p>I would be delighted if somebody reviewed either my admin actions or my contributions to the wikipedia - with reference to articles this anon user has also edited. I will take the issues to WP:AN/I for review by other admins. In the mean time I have blocked the user again for ongoing personal attacks.--A Y Arktos\talk 09:09, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Now for that admin to find I put the above there that admin had to stalk me again as I had to log off, then come back to be able to post. Fair enough if those admins watching some wik articles do keep an eye on them but this post here shows that where I go all over wik is beign minutely watched. There is no need for that. The admin knows I am not a hoon vandel as such so no need for 24/7 watching and stalking. To post the above post, I came here first after logging back on to the Internet, cut and pasted the already written note above, then I went to the site where the admin was vandalising stuff I had put up (this has now stopped after I sadly had to remove most of the post in dispute - it contained important content). It seems that from me going to that article after here, my new ip has been reg and picked up on then tracked back to here to see what else I had posted under that ip log on number. This is totally ridiculous. Its also stalking. Its that that is uncalled for and highly irregular.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Request for Policy Clarification</span></h2>
<p>Following a speedy deletion I discussed the matter with the administrator concerned and take issue with his views.</p>
<p>The administrator claims to speedy delete about 60 articles a day and maintains that it is unnecessary (unproductive of his time) to make any communication with the authors concerned. While I agree that this is appropriate in the case of hoax material/vandalism, I think that obviously genuine authors who fall short in some of the deletion criteria at least deserve a short note to explain to them what has happened. Based on the administrator's own figures this would only apply to half a dozen cases a day and not take more than a few minutes.</p>
<p>I think that this a minimum level of courtesy that newbie editors deserve (it is most likely to occur to newbies who are unfamiliar with the criteria).</p>
<p>Apart from leaving a very sour taste in the mouth, having ones work disappear like this also leaves one feeling bewildered since one can find no trace of it - the administrator argued that all the relevant information was available in the deletion log, but I think he forgets how large and confusing a place Wikipedia can be for the newbie - I finally found out what had happened to my article after making a post at the Village Pump.</p>
<p>I would be grateful to hear some authoritative views on the matter.</p>

<dd>I would prefer that in ANY case except pure vandalism/author request, the deleting admin leave a note on the creator/substantial author's user talk page, but I may be alone in that... -- <i><a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae</a>'<a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">blis</a></i> 02:48, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>It depends on my mood. I sometimes communicate with the creators of articles I speedy, but I'm not terribly consistant about it, and it's subjective. If the article makes no attempt to be encyclopedic ("My cat is phat" or "Mr. jameson is a crappy shop teacher") then I probably issue a {{<a href="../../../w/e/l/Template%7EWelcome_2ac1.html" title="Template:Welcome">welcome</a>}} + {{finger wagging}}. If it's the first edit they've ever made and it's woeful but good faith ("Smash brothers is an x-box game, it has a really good soundtrack") I'll give {{<a href="../../../w/e/l/Template%7EWelcome_2ac1.html" title="Template:Welcome">welcome</a>}} + <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a>.

<dd>Further to that (having just logged out and tried it) if you put the title of a deleted article into the search bar you get the "no article" message <i>but</i> the article appears as blue right below that. When you click it, it says "may have been deleted" and links to the deletion log. Thus making me slightly more confident that anyone but the very nobbiest noob will be able to figure out if I deleted his page.

<p>I think what all <b>experienced wikipedians forget</b> is how large and complicated WP is, and how mysterious are its ways. I was (still am) a noob and honestly had no idea what had happened. I looked at deletion pages but still couldn't work out what had happened. I did put the title into the search and (as I recall) got the 'no such article'. I don't remember seeing a blue link - but I was probably too confused by that stage to proceed calmly and rationally.</p>
<p>I think therefore that Admins should assume assume noobs to be extremely nobby and give them a helping hand if the work appears genuine.</p>
<p>I tend to agree with you on experienced editors - they'll know what's happened, although with what you refer to as unencyclopedic entries I'd tend to be harsher - they too are likely to know what's happened.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">admin hegemony</span></h2>
<p>Centrx, what is speculative about the text you removed? The previous sentence says that standards have risen, which presumably you agree with. Is it not true that existing admins are then not required to go through any process to see if they meet the new standard - something that I think most people would expect to logically follow after a change in standards. It answers the a reasonable question one might have after reading that sentence, "Well, then do existing admins have to go through any process to see if they meet this new standard?" The only speculative part is that admins are the ones mainly responsible for raising of these standards - I admit I have not gone to much length to document this but have rather assumed it to be true based on casual browsing of discussion pages about raising of standards.</p>
<p>As for admins protecting their own userpages - that's negative-true? What's negative about it? I'm not arguing that the above is negative, but why can't this article contain things that are negative? Your argument is that "this page is not a list of all the negative-true things about Admins" attempts to equate my addition of one sentence to turning a medium sized article in to a list of negative-true things about Admins is a <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logical_fallacy.html" title="Logical fallacy">logical fallacy</a>, particularly a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strawman.html" title="Strawman">strawman</a>.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Note the 3 people to remove this text are admins, with the following "reasons"&#160;:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Jim Douglas - Removed clumsily phrased and not particularly helpful editorial commentary.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>perhaps you could rephrase better; it's helpful for those that wish to understand admins' place within the wikipedia power structure</dd>

<li>Steel359 - Really isn't worth noting</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>to the surprise of no one, you can't be bothered to mention why</dd>

<ul>
<li>Centrx - This is mostly speculation, but even if it were true this page is not a list of all the negative-true things about Admins, we don't need to say, e.g., that some admins protect their user pages</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>at least you bother to explain, even if it's a strawman</dd>

<p>I don't suppose any other admins would care to weigh in with anything but a response predictable for this hegemony? --<a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParaphelion_56c8.html" title="User:Paraphelion">Paraphelion</a> 18:53, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Paraphelion, I'm not an admin, as you can tell in an instant from glancing at my user/talk page. (I don't even *have* a user page; it's just a redirect to <a href="../../../j/i/m/Talk%7EJim_Douglas_bbbb.html" title="Talk:Jim Douglas">Talk:Jim Douglas</a>. And I stand by that checkin. Here's the sentence:
<dl>
<dd><i>However, administrators existing prior to this raising of standards are not subjected to any kind of formal process to see if they themselves meet the new standard, despite that many of these administrators are instrumental in raising of standards.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>"clumsily phrased", well, that speaks for itself. ("despite that..." isn't even grammatically correct).</dd>
<dd>"not particularly helpful" also speaks for itself. It wouldn't occur to me to ponder whether new standards are retroactively applied...you learn as you go, adapt the standards as necessary, and move on.</dd>
<dd>"editorial commentary" also speaks for itself. Frankly, the sentence sounds like whining, and it has no place here.</dd>

<dd>My apologizes for thinking you were an admin, though really there is no way to tell from looking at your lack of user page or talk page that you are not an admin. I took no issue with the sentence being clumsily phrased as I have invited you to change it yourself. 'not particularly helpful' is your opinion and of course a valid one, as you claim you don't wonder about whether new stadards are retroactively applied, however I think that is a reasonable thing to wonder, and of course that is my opinion. 'editorial commentary' is purely your opinion and I see nothing about the sentence that is whining, it's just stating fact. Perhaps an ugly fact, that when stated rather plainly, is so ugly that it sounds like whining. The statement passes no judgement about whether or not this fact is good or bad. Though by yours and Centrx's remarks it seems likely you view it as bad.--<a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParaphelion_56c8.html" title="User:Paraphelion">Paraphelion</a> 19:19, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What are these "new standards" of which you speak? Why do you think they are initiated by admins, and not agreed to by non-admin users? How would current admins not meet these standards? You must justify why this should be included, rather than imply that it is part of some sort of weird conspiracy. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 19:22, 3 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Have you read this article? &#160;: "Over time, standards to getting appointed administrator have risen". Much of the discussion about admin changes and policy changes is by people with admin priviledges. Current admins might not meet these standards - nobody knows for sure because there is no process to see if they do when standards are raised. What conspiracy are you talking about?--<a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParaphelion_56c8.html" title="User:Paraphelion">Paraphelion</a> 19:37, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Not to put too fine a point on it, but it <i>is</i> obvious I'm not an admin. If I was, it would be clearly stated on my (nonexistent) user page. QED.
<dl>
<dd>Is there anything that forces you to state such a thing on your user page?--<a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParaphelion_56c8.html" title="User:Paraphelion">Paraphelion</a> 19:37, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>Do I view it as good or bad that new standards aren't retroactively applied? No, I don't regard it as anything. But going out of our way to point it out, in phrasing that <i>reads to me</i> as whining, detracts from the professionalism of the article. That sentence grated on me (as in <b>this doesn't belong here</b>) when I read the article. So I yanked it. Anyway, that's probably enough from me. -- <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim_Douglas_5faf.html" title="User:Jim Douglas">Jim Douglas</a> <a href="../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJim_Douglas_038e.html" title="User talk:Jim Douglas"><sup><font color="green">(talk)</font></sup></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jim_Douglas_9618.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jim Douglas"><sub><font color="gray">(contribs)</font></sub></a> 19:28, 3 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Your opinion is understood. However since I feel the sentence in question was writen in a neutral tone and describes a fact, that you interpret it as whining and that you are so opposed to the inclusion of a harmless fact into the article suggests that you indeed view the fact as negative. To put it another way, suppose you agreed with this fact, how less whiney could you phrase it?--<a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParaphelion_56c8.html" title="User:Paraphelion">Paraphelion</a> 19:37, 3 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>In fact, if it had occurred to me to ponder the point, I would have assumed that new standards <i>are not</i> retroactively applied. And honestly, how would you propose to do so? Let's say the new standard is (for the sake of argument) that you must have 5,000 edits on the English Wikipedia before you can be considered for being an admin. How would you propose to retroactively apply that standard? Fire any existing admins who have 4,700 edits? Or who only had 3,000 edits at the moment when they became an admin? The whole question is kind of theoretical unless you want to enumerate the standards you're talking about. And I still assert that it doesn't belong here. It's tangential at best, and adds nothing to the article. -- <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim_Douglas_5faf.html" title="User:Jim Douglas">Jim Douglas</a> <a href="../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJim_Douglas_038e.html" title="User talk:Jim Douglas"><sup><font color="green">(talk)</font></sup></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jim_Douglas_9618.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jim Douglas"><sub><font color="gray">(contribs)</font></sub></a> 19:45, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Or if the raising of standards is a more subjective thing, and given fairly ambiguous process to be an admin (discussion and vote), one might just expect a similar process with corresponding discussions with regards to new standards.--<a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParaphelion_56c8.html" title="User:Paraphelion">Paraphelion</a> 19:59, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
