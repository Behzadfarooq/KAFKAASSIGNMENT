<p>This editor had an article about his micronation speedily deleted and protected from re-creation. Instead of filing a deletion review, the editor is complaining to me and several others in a very insulting, abusive, and arrogant tone we are trying to offer help. S/he is on other users' user talk pages calling them "anti-socialist" and "10-year-old swashbucklers" (examples: <a href="../../../f/a/n/User_talk%7EFan-1967_07f3.html" title="User talk:Fan-1967">User talk:Fan-1967</a>, <a href="../../../r/i/d/User_talk%7ERidG_5b69.html" title="User talk:RidG">User talk:RidG</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">User talk:Friday</a>), and has blanked his/her user talk page.

We're here to write an encyclopedia, and keeping pages like that is, at best, a waste of time, and at worst causes unnecessary ill feeling. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 07:39, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I will try my best. He says "It is useful to gather evidence regarding people's conduct as part of the overall process of building an encyclopedia". I take this to mean that he is using the page as a tool to catalog edits which he characterizes as problematic. This helps him both by allowing him to later study similar trends in problematic edits to improve his own writing and conduct, and to keep track of possible evolving problems much the same way you might use a watchlist or recent changes. <a href="../../../7/4/2E/User%7E74.136.222.198.html" title="User:74.136.222.198">74.136.222.198</a> 07:51, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Given that Hillman's dig pages (see above) seem to be getting the all-clear, a page of this type is nowhere near as problematic, and I don't see why it needs to go. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">type</span></a></small> 07:59, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmmmm. Hillman's page tracks long-term problems with pushing of POV in certain well-defined areas. The page under discussion seesm to be a random collection of "OMG! <a href="../../../r/o/u/WP%7EROUGE_ace2.html" title="WP:ROUGE">Rouge admin abuse</a>!" But I could be wrong. For example, calling Magabund a holocaust denier was harsh, but as it turns out Magabund has made numerous edits supportive of holocaust deniers, so although it's a poor kind of an edit summary it is not without a basis in truth, especially since Magabund seems to me to have been deliberately ratcheting up the tension in Talk. If you want to trawl the database looking for edits where people are accused of being holocaust deniers I suspect you will find a large number, almost all form editors with a less illustrious edit history than Jayjg. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 14:12, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, since he hasn't actually denied the holocaust, accusing him of being a holocaust denier is a baseless personal attack.

<dd>You can say what you'd like, but in this case you'd be wrong. It's a page designed to engender bad feelings among users, often filled with inaccurate and false statements, much like this page: User:Deuterium/Timothy Usher and this page: User:Deuterium/Andjam and this page: User:Deuterium/JayJG. In the latter, the first edit, which he describes as "Deleting relevant, sourced, correct information" is actually the deletion of completely unsourced and factually incorrect material, and the second edit, which he describes as "Removing perfectly good link" in fact involved removing a link to a POV blog. On top of that, he seems to be creating <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">attack biographies</a> - e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kevin_Haas&amp;oldid=66679982" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kevin_Haas&amp;oldid=66679982" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>, and has started wikistalking me (e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hasbara&amp;diff=66626105&amp;oldid=65862274" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hasbara&amp;diff=66626105&amp;oldid=65862274" rel="nofollow">[25]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Israel_Shahak&amp;diff=66675980&amp;oldid=66651814" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Israel_Shahak&amp;diff=66675980&amp;oldid=66651814" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>) It's a disturbing pattern of behavior for one so quick to inaccurately point fingers. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 19:14, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Material has been placed in the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Michael_Langan_7c4b.html" title="Christopher Michael Langan">Christopher Michael Langan</a> bio that comes from an poor source. The material is "hype" for a documentary film on Langan. The paragraph appears only in a mouse rollover on a picture of Langan on a website. There is no author given. This can hardly be a reliable source and the presentation of the material is insensitive. Seems like a clear violation of WP:LIVING. <a href="../../../d/r/l/User%7EDrL_2b82.html" title="User:DrL">DrL</a> 06:20, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Futher explanation</b> The source in question is the production company of a documentary about the biographee. One would think a production company gets to say on their own website what they construe the documentary as showing, and the statement is attributed to the correct source. I do not understand what the problem is, except that it is less than flattering to the biographee (although by no means harmful or abusive)...I think that perhaps DrL would like to look at the box over <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:VAIN#Effectiveness_of_vanity_articles" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:VAIN#Effectiveness_of_vanity_articles" rel="nofollow">here</a>, which clarifies some matters to do with vanity articles. The <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> articles do not imply that every biography should be a <a href="../../../h/a/g/Hagiography.html" title="Hagiography">hagiography</a>; rather, they are there to keep libelous and defamatory material out, and the statement in question is neither.</dd>
<dd>She has been using the documentary to establish the notability of the subject, so it is only appropriate to include information about what the documentary portrays. And I can imagine few more <i>reliable sources</i> of that information than the production company that made the documentary; DrL seems to be of the opinion that her personal viewing of the documentary affords a better and more neutral source, which is obviously not correct. <a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> 06:30, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The technical details of the construction of the website are not relevant to the issue. As for the author, the website, errolmorris.com, is the website of Fourth Floor Productions, Earl Morris' production company.

<li>I do not think that a mouse rollover at a website (that has no contact information other than an info@ email address) could possibly constitute a reliable source. NPOV and WP:V are very important in a bio, particularly wrt living persons. According to WP:LIVING</li>

<dd>It is not "obvious", DrL. As I explained on the talk page, the fact that the webpage is contructed like that is irrelevant: <i>all</i> of the information about that series is included in that manner; and it is not a <i>random</i> website either, it is the website of the production company which produced the documentary in question. As has been pointed out, there can be few higher quality sources of information about a documentary than the people who made it. Personal testimony by one (biased) person who has merely seen the documentary is a far less reliable source than that. The source is not unreliable, it is just not flattering, and I think <i>that</i> is why DrL is so adamant it must be removed from Langan's <a href="../../../h/a/g/Hagiography.html" title="Hagiography">hagiography</a>. Please read the link I gave to the vanity policy, DrL - I see you included the vanity policy in your own comment on a second thought, but it doesn't strike me that you have read and understood it at all, particularly that clause to which I have drawn your attention. <a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> 06:49, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please read <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">Biographies of Living Persons</a>. <i>Noncontroversial material</i> about a living person may be taken from that person's own statements or an authorized web site. This is not to say that it shouldn't be significantly rewritten to meet NPOV, encyclopedic tone, etc. If there is some reason the statements may be considered controversial or factually doubtful (and not <i>just</i> because it it self-sourced, but for some other legitimate reason) then it can be removed pending more dependable sources. Also, this is not a good forum for this dispute. Admins can block accounts and delete pages, but are not content referees.

<dd>I don't believe that a rollover on a website could be considered a "high quality reference". This is because it is more a part of the interface and the browsing experience rather than the content. Also, it is unauthored, the comments in the Wiki article are inaccurate, plus they speculate on state of mind, rather than factual material. I've edited it a little more accurately and will wait to see if it is satisfactory to all concerned before I take the matter further. Thanks for your advice as to where to bring my complaints if this inaccurate editing persists. <a href="../../../d/r/l/User%7EDrL_2b82.html" title="User:DrL">DrL</a> 14:20, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm afraid I don't understand the fixation on the material being in a "rollover". First of all, not all browsers interact with the page source material in the same way; what's a rollover for you may appear as "alt text" for someone else (or be read out loud by an audio speech generator for a browser used by a blind user). In the absence of contradictory evidence, there is a presumption that the material was published by the web site owner in its normal course of editorial production and was not some secret unauthorized material snuck in by a hacker. Or are you arguing otherwise? And given the prominence of <a href="../../../e/r/r/Errol_Morris_117d.html" title="Errol Morris">Errol Morris</a> and his documentary production company, I see no reason to doubt his own official web site as a reliable primary source as to the content of a film about the subject of the article. Moreover, I'm not sure what this is doing here (with the request for administrator intervention), since it looks to me like a garden-variety content dispute. --<a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 17:49, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Not long ago, I came across <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academic_seduction.html" title="Academic seduction">Academic seduction</a>. This area is outside my expertise, but I noticed that the article dealt with the topic only in a rather limited number of cultures. Thus, I added a {{globalize}} tag to the article. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Academic_seduction&amp;diff=66794546&amp;oldid=66564041" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Academic_seduction&amp;diff=66794546&amp;oldid=66564041" rel="nofollow">diff</a>). I was mistaken in writing then that the article dealt only with academic seduction in the United States; it does not. <a href="../../../a/i/n/User%7EAine63_4c1a.html" title="User:Aine63">User:Aine63</a> pointed this out while removing the {{globalize}} tag (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Academic_seduction&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=66794546" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Academic_seduction&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=66794546" rel="nofollow">diff</a>). (S)he then messaged me regarding the removal of the tag (see <a href="../../../z/a/n/User_talk%7EZantastik_58c9.html#Academic_Seduction" title="User talk:Zantastik">User_talk:Zantastik#Academic_Seduction</a>) and posted his/her rationale on <a href="../../../a/c/a/Talk%7EAcademic_seduction_b8c7.html#Global_perspective" title="Talk:Academic seduction">the article's talk page</a>.</p>
<p>At this point, I argued at length why I do not believe that this article's examples and perspective represent a world-wide view (<a href="../../../a/c/a/Talk%7EAcademic_seduction_b8c7.html#Global_perspective" title="Talk:Academic seduction">article talk page</a>).</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, I noticed that another article Aine63 had written, <a href="../../../s/h/e/She_Creature_f074.html" title="She Creature">She Creature</a>, was identical to a review of the film on amazon (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005YUNQ/103-7068875-5221405?v=glance&amp;n=130" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005YUNQ/103-7068875-5221405?v=glance&amp;n=130" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>). I messaged <a href="../../../a/i/n/User%7EAine63_4c1a.html" title="User:Aine63">User:Aine63</a> about this matter, asking if (s)he had had permission or had written the review in the first place; I also made some suggestions as to <a href="../../../s/t/y/WP%7ESTYLE_9c31.html" title="WP:STYLE">WP:STYLE</a>.

<dd>My comments on my user page are not directed at Zantastik, but common problems at Wikipedia I've experienced and witnessed on a number of articles. I've seen other such comments on user pages, including those of administators. As for his comments on the <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academic_seduction.html" title="Academic seduction">Academic seduction</a> article, his earlier critique was that there was absolutely no non-US content, which is false as much of the content comes from non-U.S. sources. He had simply not carefully read the article nor checked any of the references. Zantastic then raised the objections that the content was too "anglophone" of which I agreed, and invited him to contribute said content of which he felt should be included. If he could not do so, he needed to back off of the article and wait for me or someone else to add the content. From that point I was accused of not being civil by a friend of Zantastics, <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko">User:Jersyko</a>. Now the two of them are attacking another article I created last night, and which is still being constructed. To me, the two of them seem more intent on hounding me, and this post here in the Admin Notice board is just one more attempt. <a href="../../../a/i/n/User%7EAine63_4c1a.html" title="User:Aine63">Aine63</a> 01:47, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I made the accusation of incivility solely because Aine63 said the following to Zantastik (<i>after</i> Zantastik gave a detailed description of his rationale, which Aine63 apparently accepted, on the article talk page), "If you yourself don't have the time, or the inclination (though you seem to have much to say about the topic), then you need to step back." Additionally, while <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> perhaps might compel us to assume that Aine63's edits to your his/her user page are, in fact, unrelated to Aine63's interaction with Zantastik and me, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Aine63&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Aine63&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">timing</a> and content of the edits to the user page coincides remarkably with our interactions on the article's talk page. For examle, the statement "Any idiot can criticize", which follows "This user is really sick of . . . Wikipedians with long-winded criticisms on what is lacking in content, the time and energy for which could have been used to contribute the content that is deemed to be lacking," was written a short time after Aine63's response to Zantastik's detailed commentary on the article's talk page. I would also note that Aine63 had no userpage until today. Finally, Zantastik and my "attacks" on Aine63's <a href="../../../s/h/e/She_Creature_f074.html" title="She Creature">other article</a> are merely questions of a possible copyright violation. I said as much on the <a href="../../../s/h/e/Talk%7EShe_Creature_e4ea.html" title="Talk:She Creature">talk page</a>, and I'm still waiting for a response. · <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko"><font color="#013220">j·e·r·s·y·k·o</font></a> <i><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJersyko_3ca3.html" title="User talk:Jersyko"><font color="#465945" size="1">talk</font></a></i> · 02:05, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I concur. It's sexual abuse, and I've never heard of any department or university, in any part of the western world (mind you, western and northern) endorsing or permitting it. There have been failures to prosecute, and there have been winks &amp; nods, but by statute it's harassment in most places. I'm as mystified by an AfD keep as JzG is.

<dd>Though not necessarily relevant to whether this article is OR, Zantastik notes on the talk page of the article that French universities do not prohibit professor/student relationships and that the practice was prevalent in ancient Greece. In any event, I've become convinced that it is original research and that these topics can be adequately covered in other articles. · <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko"><font color="#013220">j·e·r·s·y·k·o</font></a> <i><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJersyko_3ca3.html" title="User talk:Jersyko"><font color="#465945" size="1">talk</font></a></i> · 15:11, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>While I agree that discussion of whether this article is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">novel synthesis</a> or not is important, the appropriate forum for this debate is on the article's talk page. I'm pleased to see that it's moving there. However, I raised some rather serious issues about <a href="../../../a/i/n/User%7EAine63_4c1a.html" title="User:Aine63">User:Aine63</a>'s beheviour that have not been dealt with. Being accused of "hounding" him/her because I raised a question about a potential copyright violation (still unanswered, by the way), the implication that I am an "idiot" and being told to "back off" if I only critique <i>Academic seduction</i> rather than massively edit it... this is a serious matter. I believe that I have demonstrated good faith in these matters but would like an outside assessment of the matter.

Looking at <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Starneptune_8568.html" title="Special:Contributions/Starneptune">Special:Contributions/Starneptune</a>, we can see the account was probably created for the sole purpose of screwing somebody over. It's unfortunate, though probably understandable, that this wasn't caught earlier. In short, we have somebody whose username was changed without their consent, and they are understandably upset. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELuna_Santin_1cab.html" title="User:Luna Santin">Luna Santin</a> 02:46, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The name change was done without my knowledge or permission. I had tried to log in a couple of days ago, and noticed my account didn't exist anymore. I think Wikipedia had just had a database error, so I assumed it was due to that and recreated my account. It was only pointed out to me today by one of my friends that my acccount was renamed due to a request by an imposter account named User:Starneptune.</dd>

<p>A new user, Abbaenok, presented a very long entry into the Talk at 02:27, 1 August 2006, defending the subject of the entry, which was reverted by Crum375. The material presented by Abbaenok included a series of personal attacks and allegations, with a name presented, and legal noises made. Similar defamatory attacks have been posted to this entry previously, by other users or via other user names, in an attempt to shape the entry, presumably by intimidation. I would think this would require admin attention, given what would seem to be legally defamatory material being posted, and having been posted before, and possible removal of the defamatory material from the History. Hence this post. <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcsincostan_51c6.html" title="User:Arcsincostan">Arcsincostan</a> 05:07, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I feel like I'm sticking my head in a lion's mouth, but here goes: While reverting vandalism from User:203.184.36.120, I came across some terrible personal attacks directed to him, on his <a href="../../../2/0/3/User_talk%7E203.184.36.120.html" title="User talk:203.184.36.120">talk page</a>, from <a href="../../../t/a/g/User%7ETagishsimon_49c0.html" title="User:Tagishsimon">User:Tagishsimon</a>. I haven't refactored them, but they are incredibly offensive and hurtful and in no way are convincing this young IP editor to contribute to the work rather than tearing it down. The IP user did tell Tagishsimon, on Tagishsimon's <a href="../../../t/a/g/User_talk%7ETagishsimon_9445.html" title="User talk:Tagishsimon">talk page</a>, that he feels he has an open invitation to vandalize any and all WP articles because of the way the welcome message is phrased, but that's no excuse for behavior like this. I felt I had to call attention to the exchange, even with all the Colbert nonsense that's happening tonight.

Normally, I'd just go "troll, do not feed", except I looked at his contributions, and I decided a note here might be in order. Given the hiatus and then the return in the same style, might a user check be in order? I suspect that he's been editing under a different account and is back to this one because of a block.

<dd>Depends on what is on them; db-ban is for any pages created by banned users, not necessarily the userpages of banned users. If the only contents of the page are notices about the user's ban, then don't db them, they are a necessary record. Also, anything created before they were banned is not subject to deletion; it's only the creation of a banned user if they create it after they are banned. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">(<small>Talk</small>)</font></a></span> 09:04, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>I saw that message on JzG's page too. I'm wondering what's going on with Sloan. I've been dealing with Sloan on Usenet for longer than Wikipedia has existed, and while I've had my differences with him, he's at least usually a good speller. He's been doing stuff here and on Usenet recently that are weird even for him, and I'm wondering about his sobriety when he posted that thing, and even about his current mental health. His personal situation (because of the USCF election stuff among other things) has to be stressful (look for his name on Susan Polgar's blog <a href="http://susanpolgar.blogspot.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://susanpolgar.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">[36]</a> to get an idea of what's going on).

<p>I disagree with this block. While it's certainly not polite to call someone "a troll pure and simple", it is not the kind of remark that has ever, in my experience, resulted in a block with no warning. I'm not familiar with this editor, or the one he's in dispute with, but I'd point out the Rex Germanus has recently been blocked three times (within a two-month period) for 3RR, so it looks as if he has a history of going against consensus, whereas CyrilleDunant had a clean block history. Rex Germanus reported the "troll pure and simple" post at <a href="../../../p/a/i/WP%7EPAIN_2701.html" title="WP:PAIN">WP:PAIN</a> without giving any warning,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Personal_attack_intervention_noticeboard&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66874778" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Personal_attack_intervention_noticeboard&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66874778" rel="nofollow">[37]</a> in violation of the PAIN instructions. His report was removed because there was no warning. He <i>then</i> sent a message to CyrilleDunant, <i>this morning</i>, not for a new attack, but for that one, warning that he would report him (he already <i>had</i> reported him and the report had been removed). Cyrille removed the comment, and Rex reverted him. Then Rex replaced it three times more.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:CyrilleDunant&amp;diff=67017006&amp;oldid=67016038" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:CyrilleDunant&amp;diff=67017006&amp;oldid=67016038" rel="nofollow">[38]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:CyrilleDunant&amp;diff=67025310&amp;oldid=67020337" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:CyrilleDunant&amp;diff=67025310&amp;oldid=67020337" rel="nofollow">[39]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:CyrilleDunant&amp;diff=67026757&amp;oldid=67026654" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:CyrilleDunant&amp;diff=67026757&amp;oldid=67026654" rel="nofollow">[40]</a></p>
<p>It seems that if Rex had reported this at <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_3RR_4b52.html" title="WP:AN/3RR">WP:AN/3RR</a>, it would have been rejected on the grounds that 3RR is not generally enforced against users on their own user space, except in cases of vandals removing genuine vandalism warnings. Only two days ago, I made that point when I dismissed a 3RR report,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66692818" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66692818" rel="nofollow">[41]</a> pointing out that warnings are not meant to be used as black marks which we give to naughty people who then, as punishment, have to display them on their talk page for a certain length of time.</p>
<p>There was a similar case last October, when a new admin blocked an established user for removing warnings from his talk page. Kelly Martin undid the block, and David Gerard commented:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>You can't hammer someone into making your comment stay on their talk page. 3RR is not in fact generally held to apply in this situation. If you put it there and he removed it, he saw it. It's not like the diff has vanished. This has been well established in many cases where annoying trolls were bugging people on their talk pages then tried to nail them with 3RR when they removed them. If he doesn't want to keep your comment there, that's up to him, not you, and you don't get to edit-war otherwise. . . . You gotta be joking. He had a 3RR warning put on his talk page, then he removed it. So he was warned and can't deny he was warned. Then what is the point of repeatedly replacing the warning except harassment? That's precisely why 3RR isn't generally applied to a user in their own userspace - people harassing others with repeatedly replacing removed additions, then trying to nail them on 3RR. (David Gerard, 10 October, 2005, this noticeboard)</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The issue of removing unwanted posts from one's talk page has been discussed often. Some people think it shouldn't be done, but there is definitely no policy against it, and there are troublesome users who seem to delight in sending unwarranted warnings to their opponents (particularly admins) and replacing them when they're removed. Alienus comes to mind in particular.</p>
<p>So, if we discount the 3RR violation (and I'd very much want to know why Rex kept replacing that post once he knew that Cyrille had seen it), we're left with the "troll pure and simple" remark. Bearing in mind that people are never blocked without warning for something as mild as this and are very seldom blocked for "attacks" that were made the previous day, that Rex had been edit warring with other users, and that no report has been given of personal attacks made by Cyrille <i>after</i> Rex began harassing Cyrille at his talk page, I do not think the block is justified.</p>
<p>I don't want to wheel war, but I'm hoping either that Will might be persuaded to lift the block himself, or that there might be some agreement here that the block can be lifted. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 16:24, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

I was particularly concerned because Rex Germanus replaced the warning on Cyrille's talk page (violating 3RR himself in the processs) <i>after he knew that Cyrille had been blocked</i>. I warned him on his talk page, and he apologized. I hope both editors will now stop squabbling and will just get back to writing an encyclopaedia.

<p>I'm not going to weigh in on whether or not these individuals are sock puppets, I'm simply going to say that this seems to be a rather unilateral decision made here with a number of blocks for which I see little basis.

An unknown user, recently appearing under names WeBeToys, It'sAparty and PauWau, and also using just IP addresses, is without any explanations vandalizing the article and today also the discussion forum.

<p>Wow, I feel like I have opened Pandora's box. Yesterday, I opened up a Suspected Sockpuppet case, <a href="../../../s/u/s/Wikipedia%7ESuspected_sock_puppets_VaughanWatch_750a.html" title="Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/VaughanWatch">Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/VaughanWatch</a>.

<p>All of a sudden, a whole bunch more socks have come out of the woodworks. For user IDs that are clearly socks (vandalism only, targetting those involved in the VaughanWatch dispute), I've been blocking indefinitely (as have other admins). I've also temporarily blocked a few IPs (again, so have other admins) that fall into the same boat.</p>
<p>In all cases, I have been logging it in the SSP noted above. Since I am now a participant in this issue, please let me know if you feel I should not be blocking these users. If this is the case, I ask a few admins to watch the SSP noted, my user page, as well as <a href="../../../p/m/_/User%7EPm_shef_cbd9.html" title="User:Pm shef">User:pm_shef</a>'s user page. -- <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesTeterenko_c1e2.html" title="User:JamesTeterenko">JamesTeterenko</a> 17:07, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Could I ask for a slightly-speedier-than-normal speedy keep of this discussion? The stub article <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monica_Coghlan_65b5.html" title="Monica Coghlan">Monica Coghlan</a> was nominated for deletion, I expanded it, the only participant changed their opinion to Keep, the nominator withdrew nomination, champagne was shared by all, <a href="../../../t/h/e/Wikipedia%7EThe_Heymann_Standard_b549.html" title="Wikipedia:The Heymann Standard">Wikipedia:The Heymann Standard</a> at its finest. But then the main author of the stub began expressing unfavorable opinions of the nomination in the first place, which isn't going to help anyone, and may cause hurt feelings. Since the discussion meets speedy keep criteria, can I ask someone to close it, and possibly nip an unproductive conflict before it escalates further?

<p>This user persistently uses Wikipedia discussion pages as a means to advocate, propagate, and debate her political beliefs, as though they are mere blogs, thereby disrupting the editing process and violating <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a soapbox</a> and <a href="../../../t/a/l/Wikipedia%7ETalk_page_guidelines_82c6.html#What_talk_pages_may_be_used_for" title="Wikipedia:Talk page guidelines">Wikipedia's talk page guidelines</a>. For evidence, one only needs to check some of her recent contributions, particularly her ones to <a href="../../../a/n/a/Talk%7EAnarchism_e72f.html" title="Talk:Anarchism">Talk:Anarchism</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/a/Talk%7EAnarcho-capitalism_6a94.html" title="Talk:Anarcho-capitalism">Talk:Anarcho-capitalism</a>. I've told her on several occassions that her use of disucussion pages for general political debate is unacceptable at Wikipedia, and that she should comment contructively on the content of articles, only. She responded to those notices by denouncing them as "assinine", "total crap", and "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:WGee&amp;diff=66461510&amp;oldid=65934491" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:WGee&amp;diff=66461510&amp;oldid=65934491" rel="nofollow">harrassing</a>"; by removing them from her talk page; and by personally attacking me: <i>removing this assinine bogus warning from a non-admin airhead</i>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lingeron&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66462077" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lingeron&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66462077" rel="nofollow">[44]</a> <i>removing further total crap left by a delusional editlor</i>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lingeron&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66465093" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lingeron&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66465093" rel="nofollow">[45]</a> I admonished her personal attacks using the appropriate template, but she removed it.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lingeron&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66572567" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lingeron&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66572567" rel="nofollow">[46]</a> Needless to say, virtually all of her comments to me and other editors (except those who agree with her political beliefs) have been uncivil.</p>
<p>She has told me that "I really don't much give a @#!&amp; what you think and I can't for the life of me see how any of this is any of your business." She has also told me not to comment on her talk page again. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:WGee&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66464859" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:WGee&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66464859" rel="nofollow">[47]</a> Accordingly, any form of mutal dispute resolution, including RFC and mediation, is out of the question, as those processes are reliant on the editor's respect for the opinions of others.</p>
<p>In summation, her disruptive conduct is analogous to that of a <a href="../../../t/r/o/WP%7ETROLL_3085.html" title="WP:TROLL">troll</a> and likewise obstructs the improvement of this encyclopedia. And, unfortunately, her evident intransigence, incivility, and disregard for the opinions of others suggests that any type of personal reform is unlikely. I believe that immediate punitive action, at the very least, is in order.</p>

<p>I made a comment in the other section pertaining to this user but I will also comment here. I would appreciate it if somebody would produce some evidence linking Lingeron with Thewolfstar. The fact that Lingeron might be doing some things inappropriately does not mean we arbitrarily select a former, banned user and pretend like they are "obviously" the same. The differences look pretty clear as far as I can tell: Lingeron is an anarchist capable of writing legible text; Thewolfstar was a borderline psycho Democratic ideologue prone to emotional rants. If you all want to give more ammunition to the critics of our community who say we arbitrarily ban people who rub the right people the wrong way, then by all means keep up this behaviour. — <i><a href="../../../g/t/_/User%7EGT_d0ac.html" title="User:GT">GT</a></i> 03:43, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was one of the first to observe that Lingeron appeared to be Thewolfstar. It's certainly fair to ask for supporting evidence though. I don't have the time or energy to do a full job right now. Here's a little:</p>
<ul>
<li>Political stance: GT said " The differences look pretty clear as far as I can tell: Lingeron is an anarchist capable of writing legible text; Thewolfstar was a ... Democratic ideologue prone to emotional rants". Thewolfstar was no Democrat: see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:The_Ungovernable_Force&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=49542196" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:The_Ungovernable_Force&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=49542196" rel="nofollow">[48]</a> for example: "I'm a life-long anarchist and environmentalist... I already stood up to an administrator and a huge troop of drooling, controlling idiots in this place. They're mainly Democrats." The confusion may stem from the fact that Thewolfstar spent her time <i>editing</i> articles on the Democrats, but she was mostly inserting stuff that the Democrats there didn't seem to care for. Example: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Democratic_Party_%28United_States%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=48049530" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Democratic_Party_%28United_States%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=48049530" rel="nofollow">[49]</a>.</li>
<li>I believe they also both frequently discuss Thomas Jefferson; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Democratic_Party_%28United_States%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=48967071" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Democratic_Party_%28United_States%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=48967071" rel="nofollow">here</a> is an example of that from Thewoldstar.</li>

<li>The Lingeron account had had I believe no interaction with Bishonen at all before Bishonen made <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lingeron&amp;diff=66130319&amp;oldid=65959466" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lingeron&amp;diff=66130319&amp;oldid=65959466" rel="nofollow">this post</a> on her page. It's fairly cryptic, and not a direct accusation: "You're making yourself increasingly easy to recognize. Again." How does Lingeron respond? At first, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lingeron&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=66130319" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lingeron&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=66130319" rel="nofollow">reasonably</a>. A little later, though, she <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lingeron&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66408668" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lingeron&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66408668" rel="nofollow">deletes</a> the section with edit summary "and removing this nut case personal attack and lame, senseless accusation". I just don't see that kind of reaction occurring unless if she knows Bishonen knows she's Thewolfstar.</li>
<li>After Bishonen warns her more directly, Lingeron posts <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lingeron&amp;diff=66570480&amp;oldid=66569617" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lingeron&amp;diff=66570480&amp;oldid=66569617" rel="nofollow">this</a>, including the fascinating "I am currently looking through (Maggie)Thewolfstar's contributions, pages, etc. and do not find this user to even be abusive". Forgive me, but if Lingeron's investigation was even cursory, that statement either makes her insane, or Thewolfstar. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 05:11, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>This user has been disruptive, see the warning I placed on their page. I think it is a Bad Practice to overturn a block without seeking consensus first, that leads to wheel warring. I'm not sure I'd characterise the correlations reported by several admins as "old speculation" either.

<dd>I understand, and believe me, either way I was stuck between a rock and a hard place on this one — I continue to endorse the block, I get in trouble. I unblock the user for further discussion, and I get a few people mad at me. The block was for sockpuppetry, but nothing had been proven; and the last thing I want is to see a huge embarrassment case made out of this if we're wrong. Either way, bad practice was not my intention; I just want to keep this resonable. By old spculation, I meant the speculation that I already read about (meaning, nothing new was proven prior to the block). — <b><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_96c6.html" title="User:Deckiller">Deckill</a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_EA_05eb.html" title="User:Deckiller/EA"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User_talk%7EDeckiller_aecd.html" title="User talk:Deckiller">r</a></b> 05:08, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not convinced it's thewolfstar, although I only had a small number of dealings with that user (which is funny since my talkpage is linked as evidence of thewolfstar calling herself an anarchist. how did you find that btw?). I actually tried to avoid her after her second post to my page. Thewolfstar never edited the anarchism articles as far as I know, which has been Lingeron's main area of editing. There do appear to be some similarities though, both politically and behavior wise (the constant ranting against socialism, saying it's just fascism for example). It looked like they might be wising up after our discussion a few days ago, but based on some of their edits to their talk page I'm not quite so sure. I say that we wait and see what happens with checkuser and with her future edits before taking such a drastic action as indefinitely blocking, but regardless of if they are a sock or not, they are on thin ice. <font color="black"><b>The</b></font> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="green"><b>Ungovernable</b></font></a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_6a81.html" title="User talk:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="black"><b>Force</b></font></a> 05:37, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If, in the opinion of the blocking admin, the sockpuppet is obvious, then checkuser is not required; we routinely decline such requests under the rubric "Obvious sockpuppets may be blocked without the need for checkuser." If someone disputes the position that the sockpuppet is obvious, then a checkuser can be requested.

<dd>Having handled hundreds of such requests (possibly thousands, I'd have to go look), I don't feel particularly conceited to style myself as somewhat of an authority on the subject. Had the immediate reaction been to list this on RfCU rather than block, and had I been the checkuser who handled it (until about a week ago, it was about a 75% chance I would be), I would have rejected it as obvious. Additionally, we do not generally perform checks of this nature (that is, to clear up questions about a block) until someone asks us to do so; given that RfCU is the appropriate location to do so, such checks are generally not done until listed there. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">(<small>Talk</small>)</font></a></span> 09:18, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have taken the liberty of reblocking indefinitely, referencing this thread, and I welcome review of my actions. I got an email from Deckiller explaing that s/he felt s/he had no choice but to lift the block. I guess I sympathise with the prudence, but don't agree it was warranted. The lift seems to have not taken, which is fortunate, no harm done, but in future, really, I think taking the word of other admins and asking for further investigation before lifting a block may be a better approach. An obvious sock is just that, obvious, and when several admins come to the same conclusion, engaging valuable Checkuser resources, while arguably prudent, and understandable, might be reconsidered. Admins need to, by default, trust each other, and to assume we're all here for the same reason, to build an encyclopedia. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 09:53, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>It's perfectly fine with me that the block was lifted. The actions that followed were all by the book, and I'm pleased that there were questions, that they generated a check user, and that a block has been reinstated. We <i>should</i> be skeptical when indefinite blocks are involved, and I welcome any review of further blocks. (In other words, no hard feelings at all. I'm glad that there were questions and that the questions prompted precisely appropriate actions.)

<li>I think questioning, skepticism, asking for clarification and all are fine but I don't see the need for rash action, there was little harm and some considerable benefit in leaving the block in place (or reducing it to a definite one for the disruption caused) and none in lifting it, in my view. As I said, we could have discussed this without one admin overturning another that way. we were fortunate this user didn't cause more disruption, but that was luck. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 17:36, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Clarification</b>: For the record, just so folks know, Wolfstar wasn't a Democrat: she was an <i>anti-Democrat.</i> Her campaign, pursued with the kind of monomania that's scary, was to alter the article on the Democratic Party to make it "socialist." I.e. she edited it a lot because she wanted to tell the world the secret truth about Democrats -- that they're all socialists.

<p>I oppose this ban against Lingeron. It has not been proven that she is a sockpuppet of TheWolfStar. A checkuser must be run, and the IP results made openly available. This ban is out of process, and appears to be negatively motivated. I request that the out of process and ill-considered ban be removed (again, it was already removed once by a discerning user) until and unless it is publicly proven that the user is a sockpuppet. - <a href="../../../m/s/t/User%7EMSTCrow_5721.html" title="User:MSTCrow">MSTCrow</a> 20:12, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Prior hostility to whom? I have not interacted with anyone involved in this entire issue previously, save Lingeron. I do not understand the thrust of your argument, and it damages your own character to stoop to questioning my motives. It is not enough for someone to claim that a checkuser was run, I'd like to see confirmation that a checkuser was run, and that the IPs matched. As banning a user is the ultimate action that can be taken against a user, the process must be as transparent and open as possible, to prevent abuses of power. - <a href="../../../m/s/t/User%7EMSTCrow_5721.html" title="User:MSTCrow">MSTCrow</a> 23:00, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>A full raw dump of a checkuser request would be akin to revealing private information about a user, most notably their IPs used and thus their ISP.

<li>Until recently, only things where the request was made at WP:RFCU did it get listed there anywhere.

How can you say, "Thewolfstar is manipulating official notice templates" and "Thewolfstar will have to use email to communicate further" I added the suspect template, not Thewolfstar. I am emailing you, not Thewolfstar. How can you make these statements when they are blantantly false?</p>
<p>As far as confirmation goes, Essjay's 'confirmation' is based on IP, not users. He says: "IP evidence is consistent with previous Thewolfstar socks. I'd call it Confirmed." Essjay (Talk) 07:23, 30 July 2006 (UTC) My apologies to Essjay but this following evidence is no kind of confirmation.</p>
<p>According to the checkuser page Thewolfstar's IP is 24.161.22.244 -- Our IP here is 24.161.28.255 The 24.161.. is part of a roadrunner range. Roadrunner is the only cable connection that people can get anymore around these parts, and in a lot of places, as this company has bought up most of the local ISPs across the country. My cousin has told me that he noticed that their IP was 24.161.28.255 back in March. From what I can gather about roadrunner IPs, they can be stable for some time or they can change fairly frequently, and this is at the discretion of Time-Warner Co. (Roadrunner). Like I said on my page, unless Thewolfstar snuck into my uncle's house at night when they were all sleeping and used their computer, it is impossible that her IP is the same as theirs. And as I have shown our IP here is not the same as hers.</p>
<p>As of yet, there has been no real comparison run between Thewolfstar's edits and my edits. On this page the ones providing evidence are saying that they doubt or are unsure if I am Thewolfstar. To block me indefinitely because Geogre and Bishonen have some sort of strong belief that I am this user is outrageous and so completely unfair. Like I said before it's a good thing that this doesn't happen in murder cases in real life!</p>
<p>Lars, this whole campaign against me, with it's accusations of being the sockpuppet of a banned user seems to be more about the fact that I voted oppose at Phaedriel's rfa, than anything else. I was exercising my right to vote. Why bother to have a vote if editors are not allowed to vote in the way that they choose? Ironically, I don't even hold any grudge to Phaedriel, nor does she seem to hold one against me. I left a friendly comment to her at her rfa. I was about to leave her a beautiful picture of some peaches on her page, and was working on the image format, which I'm not good at yet, when I found I was blocked.</p>
<p>We left friendly comments to each other at her rfa:</p>

<p>Buchofgrapes said (on the noticeboard) "A little later, though, she deletes the section with edit summary "and removing this nut case personal attack and lame, senseless accusation". I just don't see that kind of reaction occurring unless if she knows Bishonen knows she's Thewolfstar." I removed that accusation for exactly the opposite reason. It was false. I was getting pretty annoyed at these accusations as who wouldn't?</p>
<p>There are more editors who doubt that I am Thewolfstar than those who think that I am Thewolfstar. I can tell you unequivocally that I am not Thewolfstar.</p>
<p>Please, Lars, in any case, lift the protect from my page so I can at least defend myself against these false puppet accusations. Please give me a chance. I am not who Geogre and Bishonen think I am. I am a good and able editor. If I propounded about the topic 'anarchism' it was only to continue a debate about whether libertarian anarchism is a legitimate form of anarchism or not. I and many others believe it is and only desire the allowance to edit the anarchism articles, and make these articles more well-rounded and more neutral. Also, this debate has been going on for years, it seems, please see the archives on the talk:anarchism page.</p>
<p>I apologize for angry summaries. If you saw what has been going on at these articles, I believe you would be outraged at the activity of those who would dominate them, and of those who are destroying the featured article anarcho-capitalism. Compare this earlier version: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anarcho-capitalism&amp;oldid=64001277" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anarcho-capitalism&amp;oldid=64001277" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anarcho-capitalism&amp;oldid=64001277</a> with the present one after deliberate edit warring <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-capitalism" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-capitalism" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-capitalism</a> with the exact mission of making it lose it's featured status.

<p>I also apologize for nasty remarks I made. I will say that they were preceded with some real heavy insults and attacks on me. Still I promise to not personally attack again, even when attacked first. I mean this sincerely. Can you tell Phaedriel that although I voted oppose at her rfa, I have no bad feelings towards her at all and actually like her?</p>
<p>Anyway, Lar, please unprotect my talk page and give me another chance.</p>

<dd>She's not wikilawyering. I've noticed on Wikipedia that accusing someone of "wikilawyering" has become a form of name-calling without basis in fact, rather like how some people with no grasp of political philosophies will call anyone they disagree with a fascist. I do not see any willful misunderstandings present, unless they are in a non-public form. What exactly has been misunderstood? My understanding of the issue is that Lingeron was accused of being a sockpuppet with a previous user, that the IPs partially matched, but as it is on a network with a large pool of shared, dynamic IPs, it is very possible that she is not a sockpuppet, and that this possibility should be further investigated. Am I incorrect in any way here? - <a href="../../../m/s/t/User%7EMSTCrow_5721.html" title="User:MSTCrow">MSTCrow</a> 18:42, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Yes, you are incorrect in several and varied ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lingeron is a confirmed sockpuppet of Thewolfstar, per Essjay. It's not really a debatable thing here. Essjay said so, that's it, it's over. She's confirmed. No amount of explaining IP addresses or circumstances or implausible theories can explain that way.</li>
<li>This finding has been communiciated, and the nature of it explained, at length, multiple times. Arguing against the fact that this is a confirmed sockpuppet case is not going to change that finding, but IS wasting the communities time, big time.</li>
<li>Thewolfstar through her Lingeron sock is in fact arguing against this and further, in my view deliberately twisting things around to obscure reality. That's <i>wikilawyering</i>, plain and simple. Sorry if you find it pejorative to call something what it is.</li>
<li>Note: Being labeled a confirmed sockpuppet is not the end of the world... (since, after all, we're not talking about murder, we're talking about at <i>most</i> the loss of reputation built up over time with an identity... even if the allegation were incorrect it's not a lot of damage), so why argue the point? If Thewolfstar actually wants to contribute positively here, as has been noted repeatedly, <i>all</i> she need do is do so. If she edits in accordance with our policies, remains scrupulously civil, avoids edit warring, and in general behaves herself, no one would ever detect her next sock. But my bet: we can count on the next sock coming out the same way this one did. Which is too bad, but a cost of how our model works here, as annoying as the cost is, it's worth it.</li>
<li>removing warnings or findings because you don't agree with them is a no no. It's just Not On. Do it when you are banned and your page gets protected. End of story.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your tendentious arguing of this point may earn you some extra scrutiny in future as well, you might want to keep that in mind. Correct me if I'm wrong, but haven't you just come off a block for abusing warning templates? That's precisely the problem here with Thewolfstar that got the Lingeron user talk page locked, she doens't get to remove warnings or admin findings, as has, again, been explained at length, and she knows this already so it's not about warning her about it, it's about solving the problem.</p>
<p>Hope that helps and further, hope you or she don't retread the same tired things which have been thoroughly rebutted at this point. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 21:57, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, I didn't just come off a block for abusing warning templates. I was blocked due to <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a>'s abusive personal attacks and vandalism, and then when I called him on it (repeatedly, I might add), he ran off to <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a>, who then blocked me. A quick review of <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a>'s talk page, as well as the talk page history, will show that he has removed or vandalized warnings from both myself and <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will_Beback</a>.

<p>However, this template keps being deleted, with no TfD or even a note to me telling me why.

Please look into it; I follow Modern Bushido and I do not like to be told that an entire philosophy is not 'good enough' to have a userbox (which several people use).

<dd>I think you mean "As I am not an administrator" as otherwise the wording doesn't make sense. Anyway, according to template history, it was deleted as CSD's T1 "Templates that are divisive and inflammatory." and G4 "Recreation of deleted material." (even though G4 does not apply to speedy-deleted pages, but that's what <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a> is for). Anywho, on 17 July 2006, an admin placed the GUS meta-template on this, then it was deleted on the 21st. GUS is short for "German Userbox Solution" which basically means that the userbox is considered divisive and, in order to make it not look as though Wikipedia supported the userbox, it's deleted after giving people a chance to subst: the userbox onto their page.</dd>
<dd>The short version of all that is: "The admin in question gave you the opportunity to subst: the userbox and, when time was up, deleted it." If you're wondering, no, I'm not the admin who deleted it.

And it should also be noted that <i>technically</i> G4, speedy-deletion-of-previously-deleted-material, does not apply when the only previous deletion was a speedy or a prod, although of course any speedy criteria that was applied the first time will likely apply again if it's really a 'substantially identical copy.' The only time this really matters is with A7, where if you follow the rules mechanically an exact recreation of a valid A7 with the word "notable" added to it is no longer a speedy candidate and must be taken to AfD... but A7 specifically notes you're supposed to do that with disputed A7's anyway. --<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 06:11, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Oh, I see. Cyde didn't follow procedure when deleting a userbox. Why am I not surprised? But all that aside, Bushido is not "divisive" or "inflammatory". Does the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Inquisition_6caf.html" title="Spanish Inquisition">Spanish Inquisition</a> make Spain or Christianity "divisive and inflammatory"? People today follow Bushido--I know I do! It's my philosophy. Not only that, but it IS NOT recreated material. At least, it wasn't until I recreated it after you deleted it...which I will assume good faith and say that it was obviously a mistake. So I will now restore the template.

<dd>I don't see how a "Spanish pride" userbox might be divisive, but some of the Christianity ones have been, and if you'd have put a "I support the revival of the Spanish Inquisition" userbox up, I'd delete it as CSD T1 myself. The comment "Why am I not surprised?" regarding Cyde's actions seem rather <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">incivil</a>, and you may want to re-read that policy page before the problem gets worse. I'd actually suggest that using the German Userbox Solution would be in your best interests at the moment, that way we don't end up with any more of an argument on our hands. If nothing else, non-project related userboxes really shouldn't be in the Template: namespace anyway, and it wouldn't be hard to put them in userspace and remove problems before they start. <b><i><font color="#FF00FF">~Kylu (<a href="../../../k/y/l/User%7EKylu_6ad3.html" title="User:Kylu">u</a>|<a href="../../../k/y/l/User_talk%7EKylu_3741.html" title="User talk:Kylu">t</a>)</font></i></b> 03:12, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can't stress enough how important this is though. Castro's demise is perhaps the most awaited news event for millions of people and is surrounded by political tensions. For wikipedia to get something badly wrong around this issue could have serious implications for the publicity of the encyclopedia. Forget about Ken Lay, if enough people go around wrongly thinking Castro is dead - or has even resigned - then it's trouble.

<dd>You could put the {{welcomeip}} template on the talk pages of the IP's being hassled, mention to them what's going on, and remind them that if they enroll accounts, their IP addresses won't be visible. I defer to wiser minds than mine whether on-wiki sanctions against 64.7.136.166 are occasioned by that person's off-wiki activities. I see the blog post says something about external links to that person's firm. You could check whether the links are consistent with <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> and remove them if they're not. If he keeps reverting, use the spam templates progressively, and then ask for a block.

<li><b>Whoa</b> It looks like the person doing that hassling is the operator of the web site that the article is about. Looking at the article talk page and the afd that closed with no consensus a couple months ago, I'd consider opening a new afd, describing the harassment.

Of course, I'll report this as sock puppetry.

<li>Ed is misinterpreting the policy and he is persisting in his misguided efforts to force his opinion on the project. He has blatantly violated 3RR on multiple articles by removing images that have been discussed on the article talk pages and found to be usable under fair use. Rather than engage in those discussions, he has chosen to act unilaterally in violation of our policies.

<dd>I disagree. Someone convicted of a crime for assult that receives a year prison sentence, shouldn't then receive a free pass on theft occured during the same time and the 1 month jail time they would receive for that. Since the revert rule has handed out their punishment, I believe some type of punishment is in order for failing to act civil (as others here have mentioned: He failed to discuss the issue, which is the cornerstone of civility, of which all users here have a right to expect <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>).

<dd>Actually it appears that 2 of the 3 cases are the repeated removal of obvious copyright violations, while the other appears to be a matter of dispute.

<p>I was under the impression that the only exception of 3RR was for blatant vandalism? Otherwise you have multiple people reverting each under way past 3RR, each of them thinking that they're in the right because they interpret policy differently ... 3RR is designed to prevent disruptive edit warring like this. It looks like this was what happened here.

<dd>That's a tricky one. The blocking policy does not allow exceptions for image copyright cleanup. Maybe it should, but it would have to be worded in such a way that would prevent gaming the system. Everything I've seen from Jimbo on this subject points to the interpretation that he wants admins to clean up these image problems, and it's a bit worrying that someone gets blocked for this. The job is thankless enough as it is, and there are very few admins who are willing to be involved in such a job, knowing that it does <i>not</i> increase their popularity. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 22:26, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I support unblocking Ed. His error was when he reverted again when the images were reinserted after his first removal. At that point, instead of reverting he should have blocked. Editors have no right to insert violations of our unlicensed media use policy, and those who do so after having been put on notice that a given usage is not within the policy are subject to immediate blocks without further warning. Instead of continuing to revert, Ed should have blocked the miscreants for copyright abuse. Hopefully, in future similar situations, he will do the right thing and block instead of revert. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 20:16, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I support unblocking Ed. First of all, he could have avoided this block simply by blocking whoever reverted him in the first place. We're not allowed to block in order to gain an advantage in a content dispute, but a block in this case would not have been contrary to policy. Secondly, this is clearly not a case of classic edit warring, where one person wants his version, and another wants his. This has absolutely nothing to do with which picture Ed thinks looks nicer, or whether he thinks the article looks better with or without a picture. This is simply a case of an administrator trying to clean up a particular problem which Jimbo is concerned about. Thirdly, I'm worried that other admins may become less willing to help with the already thankless task of trying to enforce copyright policy. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 22:26, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A block by Ed in this case most certainly *would* have been against policy. This is a content dispute he is engaged in. The images are not copyvios and restoring them is not vandalism. Vandalism is the only excuse to violate 3RR. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 22:30, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I disagree that this is a content dispute. A lot of editors know that I'm an admirer of <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Benedict_XVI_f9c4.html" title="Pope Benedict XVI">Pope Benedict XVI</a>. Now if someone comes along and changes the image to one that makes him look senile or decrepit or bad tempered or stupid, I will probably try to change it back. Even without such obvious motivation, I would still have a preference, as someone who is involved with his article, if there's a vote as to whether we should use the photo of him in white or the one of him in red. So, in such a case, I would be acting as an editor with an interest in the article or the subject. However, if I went to the article on <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Cash_1edc.html" title="Johnny Cash">Johnny Cash</a> and removed the image there because it's an unfree image (I'm not going to, because I haven't fully informed myself about when the use of such images is considered legitimate), it would have nothing to do with a content dispute. I don't like Johnny Cash; I don't dislike him. I couldn't sing the first line of any of his songs. I know nothing about his life. My hypothetical involvement with his article would be solely on the grounds that I was trying to clean up image problems, as requested by Jimbo. I could be mistaken in a particular case, or I might be right but there might be room for disagreement. But in no case would it be a content dispute. Where is the evidence that Ed removed the image because he didn't like it, or because he liked the person that the image was unflattering to, or because he disliked the person that the image showed in a good light? I think we need to be careful about calling things content disputes when admins are just trying to clean up a mess or enforce a policy. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 08:01, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you AnnH. The reason this counts as a content dispute is that it is not at all clear-cut that the images used violate any policy. Ed is of the opinion that they were, but substantial numbers of people are of the opinion they are not. The issue was already in discussion on one page prior to Ed's actions and discussion started on several other pages as a result of Ed's first actions. Ed should have participated in those discussions rather than violate 3RR. Exemptions to 3RR are only allowed for blatant vandalism, which did not apply here. Therefore, Ed was in violation of policy and would have been in a far graver violation of policy if he has compounded his violation by issuing illigitimate blocks. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 17:15, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>At least in the case of the Colorado Buffaloes article, his removal of the other team logos was entirely correct. Fair use does not allow us to use copyrighted images for decoration, the edit summary <i>the teams are adequately identified by their names</i> is perfectly correct, and the reply <i>logos provide commentery in that they represent the team</i> demonstrates a lack of knowledge of copyright issues, and all the discussion in the world on the article talk page won't change it. I agree with Kelly Martin that not only does 3RR not apply to removing copyvios, but a short block would be appropriate for users who insist on reinserting copyvios.

<dd>Such is your view and ed's, which is in the minority. This hard-line view and your intrepretation of Fair Use. This is under discussion in many, many places, but most noteably which I see has decided this is the minority view is the Admenment 2 proposal by ed that has far more opposition than support. Nevertheless, this should be minor in the dispute here: Ed's failure to discuss in a rational manner that is expected upon all editors of Wikipedia.

<p>A number of sleeper accounts have sprung from the woodwork and demand to include Wikiality in the article about <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Colbert_Report_3547.html" title="The Colbert Report">The Colbert Report</a>, with arguments such as "this should be in the article because a bunch of people want it to be," even though there's no reason to think it's more notable than any other segment on that show. More news stories have been written about Colbert's guest last night, as have stories about Colbert's mockery of Mel Gibson, for instance, but his appearance is not included in the article, nor should it be: with four shows a week, allowing a paragraph about every guest, opening monologue, or "WØrd" segment would flood the article, leading to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">an indiscriminate collection of information</a>. It is on these grounds that, until notability rising above other Colbert segments is shown in the mainstream press (i.e., multiple news articles, not blog postings, especially more than a few days after the incident) can be demonstrated, the content has been kept out of the main article. It is a case of policy vs. vox populi, and I submit it here for admin review. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorj</a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_Esperanza_93c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">m</a> <a href="../../../j/d/o/User_talk%7EJDoorjam_230c.html" title="User talk:JDoorjam">Talk</a> 21:10, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I just looked at this and I don't see a threat. Nor do I see libel sufficient for a history purge. If there had been a threat, though, we would most certainly have been allowed to perform a CheckUser; we are permitted to reveal IP information to protect the safety or property of the Foundation, our editors, or the public, and threats against another editor would fall well within the ambit of that clause. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 04:51, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I personally wouldn't call it libel, but I am not a lawyer. When you factor in that the vandal knows who pm_shef is, knows who his father is, lives not to far from him, and has spent a great deal of effort to attack him repeatedly for sometime, I don't think that we should take the threat too lightly. I believe that the following is most definitely a threat, "Pm_shef has accused the many opponents of his one-sided edits, in this article alone, as &lt;disruptive&gt;, &lt;attacking&gt;, &lt;accusing&gt;, and &lt;stonewalling&gt;, and that they &lt;relentlessly pushed&gt;, and &lt;intrude, vandalize and prevent work from getting done&gt; . He will soon learn what all of those acts truly mean..." Given the context, it does seem to imply within Wikipedia. However, if the user does not believe he is doing these things and plans to step it up a notch, I believe that we should treat this a potential real threat outside of Wikipedia. If I had not been following the last few weeks actions of this sockpuppeteer, I probably wouldn't think much of this statement. Most of the vandalism is quite childish. But the volume, effort involved in creating the sockpuppets, and the fact that it is concentrated on one specific user is what concerns me. Who are we to say that the wiki-stalking won't turn into stalking? -- <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesTeterenko_c1e2.html" title="User:JamesTeterenko">JamesTeterenko</a> 05:21, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I apologize if you see the deletion as unwise; however, I view the deletion as something of a non-issue, basically whether the content is accessible to non-admins or not. The content is not gone forever, and should any other admin feel it better that the content be restored, then by all means feel free. User:Pm_shelf stated that he did not want the content readily accessible to others as it was libelous, inflammatory, and quite potentially a rather serious legal issue, and I saw no reason not to comply with his wishes, as personal information, offensive vandalism, and other forms of attacks are deleted from the site regularly. As Kelly Martin stated and though I'm not entirely familiar with the history surrounding this user, I do not see a truly serious threat here (perhaps because I receive about ten such attacks in my inbox every day), but rather commonplace vandalism meant to attack another editor, thus why I did not believe a CheckUser to be necessary nor permitted by the privacy policy, but that decision is not mine to make but rather the Foundation's. Again, if anyone feels my deleting the history was unwise, then please restore it, and I apologize. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 06:14, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>An Admin named Splash has twice now removed a semi protect on Fidel Castro. This is a big mistake. There have been 3 figure edits on this page in the last 24 hours - most containing misinformation or vandalism. This is a very serious political issue that if badly handled has implications for a lot of people. If, thanks to us, enough users believe that Castro is dead then all sorts of things could go off. And given Wikipedia's well publicised poor record with Cuban issues <a href="http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/14481721.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/14481721.htm" rel="nofollow">[55]</a> which is repeated in many journals discussing the failings of wikipedia, there can be no margin for error.

<dd>Now is Wikipedia really likely to cause the end of Communism in Cuba? Is Wikipedia, in fact, <i>anti-</i>Communism, and the vandal has been wrong all this time? The article is linked to from the top of the Main Page of the encyclopedia that anyone can edit. It hurts a bit when an article you work on gets lots of attention, but then if you didn't want the attention, the article should have been written on paper. There is always a margin for error, and semi-protection does not remove it. He's getting better already, says the BBC (a news site, note) so it'll be over soon. And people shouldn't be using an encyclopedia for their news, nor deciding when to instigate revolutions (which will not be edited). Having our headline articles do what the headline of the site proclaims is important. And furthermore, the origianl protection, by Jaranda specifically said it was "just in case", a use explicitly outside of policy; and it had been protected for more than 12 hours when I first lifted it. At least one other admin has also unprotected on the same grounds. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> - <a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">tk</a> 00:23, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This has nothing to do with Communism in Cuba and everything to do with the media taking a look at our page and carrying the ironic headline "wikipedia announces Castro's death". This has appeared again and again over the last 24 hours - all by unregistered users. Castro's demise isn't a common and garden death and his page isn't your average news headline - it has massive implications.

<dd>I've briefly semi-protected it to review the ongoing vandalism - it's now unprotected again (though it's move-protected). Zleitzen, <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROTECT_6d34.html" title="WP:PROTECT">WP:PROTECT</a> is pretty clear on this subject: it has (in big letters at the top of the policy statement) the advice "Articles linked from the main page should NOT be protected (full or semi) except to clean up vandalism. Protection should be kept to 10-15 minutes in these cases." If vandalism continues when it's off the main page, a longer period of semi-protection may be appropriate, but not until then. Yes, the vandalism is annoying, but it's being reverted within seconds or a few minutes at the most. It's nothing we've not seen before on other controversial articles. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 00:33, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>It's one of those "almost famous" band cases; they have some local notability, and one self-published CD, but failed <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> and the AfD. (Everyone but the article creator voted for deletion.)</p>
<p>Today, the band article was re-created as a redirect to <a href="../../../k/i/k/Kiki_Carter_9754.html" title="Kiki Carter">Kiki Carter</a>, who's in the band and has some local notability as an environmentalist. What seems to have happened is that the creator of the original article lobbied a previously uninvolved admin to override the AfD. See <a href="../../../c/r/z/User_talk%7ECrzrussian_d07a.html#Dancing_Light_and_Elephants" title="User talk:Crzrussian">User_talk:Crzrussian#Dancing Light and Elephants</a>. Effectively, they found a back door way to get a non-notable band into Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, that would be cause for a speedy delete, but the article was re-created by an administrator, made a redirect, and then protected. See <a href="../../../c/r/z/User_talk%7ECrzrussian_d07a.html#Redirect_at_Dancing_Light" title="User talk:Crzrussian">User_talk:Crzrussian#Redirect at Dancing Light</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/g/User_talk%7ENagle_c56f.html#Dancing_Light" title="User talk:Nagle">User_talk:Nagle#Dancing Light</a> for the subsequent discussion.

<dd>The question is why there is a need for a redirect. Anything having to do with the environmentalist would be a separate matter and can't be covered by the previous AfD. If <i>all</i> that exists is a redirect, then there really isn't a failed band article on Wikipedia. While the old content exists in history, only an admin can see it, as it's in the deleted history, so no Google Page Rank Boosting scheme will work this way. I.e. there isn't an article on the band and there is no advertising benefit to the band, so I'm not sure what the problem is. I agree that DRV should have been involved. Other than that, though, the band got deleted and is still not here. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:36, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>WIN has been the scourge of <a href="../../../i/n/d/Talk%7EIndo-Aryan_migration_211e.html" title="Talk:Indo-Aryan migration">Talk:Indo-Aryan migration</a> for months now. He has never shown interest in editing the article, but instead tries to prove the theory wrong on the Talk page, calling us all racists and declaring on his Talk page that he will not stop until the article disappears. Check out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Indo-Aryan_migration&amp;diff=67027237&amp;oldid=67018991" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Indo-Aryan_migration&amp;diff=67027237&amp;oldid=67018991" rel="nofollow">this diff</a> (where he challenges all to a debate on the facts of the theory itself, not the article) for a typical example of what he's doing.</p>
<p>Warnings from fellow editors and from admins that Talk pages are not general discussion forums, but are concerned with trying to better the article's reflection of scholarly opinion ("See <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>") have had no effect. He was blocked before, after the block ended he has continued the exact same thing as before. Unfortunately, the admin who blocked him before is taking some time off, so I beg and plead another admin to help. We on <a href="../../../i/n/d/Talk%7EIndo-Aryan_migration_211e.html" title="Talk:Indo-Aryan migration">Talk:Indo-Aryan migration</a> don't mind at all editors who edit the article to reflect all viewpoints, and source their additions, but WIN doesn't do this and constantly having to deal with him is demotivating for us who would be productive.</p>

<p>Several users (sockpuppets?) have added in what I feel is a blatantly sarcastic comment to the page Randy Couture intended to mock him. After my first revert the editor that originally made the addition claimed on my talk page that the edit was serious and is not vandalism, and after that an anon re-added the info, which I reverted again and made a note on the talk page about discussing the addition. It was promptly re-added and I don't want to break the 3 revert rule even though I feel this is blatant vandalism, they contest that it is legitimate so if anyone could take a look at it and take the appropriate action I would be grateful.

<dd>Obviously a troll. His "contributions" are mainly related to Balkan issues and he seems to lack a clear POV like nationalist editors — he adds Greek and Turkish names where they have nothing to do, makes Macedonian POV edits on Macedonian/Bulgarian revlutionaries articles, reverts and provides zero or insufficient sourcing. Not to mention the two sockpuppets, which are evident.</dd>
<dd>The sockpuppet accounts should be indef blocked in my opinion, and although the main account does have some minor contributions that are not trollish, I'm leaning towards it being indef blocked too. He's unlikely to get away with a short block for these socks, and it's even more unlikely that he'll return and use that same account, so it's not much of a difference anyway. <i><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">Todor</a><a href="../../../t/o/d/User_talk%7ETodorBozhinov_c2c4.html" title="User talk:TodorBozhinov">→</a><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">Bozhinov</a></i> 14:18, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Argh, this is getting painfully confusing now. We now have two very similar but subtly different CFD's, both to do with one set of subcategories of categories of UK House of Commons articles which are halfway through a general reorganisation on a different page.</dd>
<dd>Can we just stop these CFD's now, sort it all out (in one go, in one place) on the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Category_talk%7EBritish_MPs_6387.html" title="Category talk:British MPs">Category_talk:British_MPs</a> page, and then CFD all the various extraneous subcats in one go afterwards?

<dd>Aquilina, I'm not surprised it's confusing: I think that as the intention.

<dd><s>Erm, I'd wager that a lot of those have been added to articles by people other than the author/photographer. PBase is a photo community site with many many thousands of users, and many millions of photos hosted for those members. I generally don't go for gallery links on articles, but a large number of editors do think they're useful... So I don't think a cull of all pbase galleries is an anyway useful, especially based on one bad apple just spamming a link to their sub-site!

<p>Her attacks usually come in the form of sarcasm, facetiousness and targeted innuendo and derogatory remarks, mostly under the guise of outraged innocence. They have been fairly relentless since the <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Shapiro_8a56.html" title="Jim Shapiro">Jim Shapiro</a> AfD started. Recently there was an obvious personal attack on <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox">Yanksox</a> (and <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamir_%28The_Scope%29_202a.html" title="User:Samir (The Scope)">Samir</a> in passing), immediately after she said, "I'm not attacking Yanksox", although he was in her sights.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=66785256&amp;oldid=66784912" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=66785256&amp;oldid=66784912" rel="nofollow">[62]</a> This might seem relatively mild, but the cumulative relentlessness of it becomes very destructive and undermining. Here is another earlier example.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Yanksox&amp;diff=66629056&amp;oldid=66628301" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Yanksox&amp;diff=66629056&amp;oldid=66628301" rel="nofollow">[63]</a></p>
<p>I had already given her a second warning <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jgwlaw&amp;diff=66655968&amp;oldid=66655052" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jgwlaw&amp;diff=66655968&amp;oldid=66655052" rel="nofollow">[64]</a> after a derogatory comment posted about me by her on the AfD. Immediately after apologising and saying "I won't make any other comment", she then immediately, provocatively and needlessly reposted it on her own page under the pretence of making sure that it was the comment I was referring to. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jgwlaw&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66656247" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jgwlaw&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66656247" rel="nofollow">[65]</a></p>
<p>There are some manipulative counter-productive mind games going on here. However, what intensifies them is that they are often carried out in liaison with Gfwesq. They have stated that they are married. They follow each other in quick succession and alternate on Yanksox' talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Yanksox#Speedy_Delete" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Yanksox#Speedy_Delete" rel="nofollow">[66]</a> and on my talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Tyrenius#Jim_Shapiro" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Tyrenius#Jim_Shapiro" rel="nofollow">[67]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Tyrenius#Disconnect" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Tyrenius#Disconnect" rel="nofollow">[68]</a>, as well as on discussions on RfA, <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">AN</a> and elsewhere.</p>
<p>She had already been cautioned about acting in concert with her husband for joint "edit warring" by <a href="../../../w/e/r/User%7EWeregerbil_edbb.html" title="User:Weregerbil">Weregerbil</a>.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jgwlaw&amp;diff=66712670&amp;oldid=66712071" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jgwlaw&amp;diff=66712670&amp;oldid=66712071" rel="nofollow">[69]</a> This refers to a conversation to be found on <a href="../../../k/i/h/User_talk%7EKihOshk_bf22.html" title="User talk:KihOshk">User talk:KihOshk</a>, which makes unpleasant reading and starts with Jgwlaw stating, "with Gfwesq and I, it would be a consensus over the other author". This conduct is completely unacceptable, and whether they are sockpuppets or not (which they deny), their conduct is no different — actually worse, because no normal sockpuppets could get away with acting so blatantly.</p>
<p>However, although <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good faith has been assumed</a>, it has patently been abused. In the light of this, until it is proved otherwise and until this collaborative behaviour to the detriment of the project changes, I suggest we treat these two users as sockpuppets.</p>
<p>I'm bringing this up here in the interests of transparency, as I've been a particular recipient recently of their uncivil treatment, not in an editing situation, but via a rumpus from CSD, through AFD to DRV. I have only commented in the latter two and have not marked for support or oppose.</p>
<p>PS Sorry if this is a bit long.<br />

<dd>This has been appealed to unblock-en-l.</dd>
<dd>I am extremely concerned at the apparent attitude that a husband and wife cannot both be moderately controversial WP editors interested in the same subject without being accused of some sort of misdeed. The threshold for identifying <a href="../../../m/e/a/Meatpuppet.html" title="Meatpuppet">Meatpuppets</a> is far higher than this.</dd>
<dd>Tyrenius, please either justify a claim of meatpuppetry, with detailed specifics showing that they act only in concert and show no independent actions regarding these issues, or retract those specific allegations.</dd>
<dd>It is often stretching proper behavior awhen an admin blocks someone they are engaged in a content dispute with, as opposed to reporting to AN/I and asking for a review and community action by uninvolved third party admins. There are blatant cases where it's clearly called for, but the specific instance here absent the prior pattern is not clearly so to me (your mileage may vary)</dd>
<dd>I urge an independent review of the remaining user behavior claims to review whether the incivility and personal attack claims warrant a 3-day block, in the interest of having an independent review of the situation. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 02:52, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>George, I think you should refer to <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">official policy</a>, rather than an article. In addition, "the Arbitration Committee has ruled that, for the purpose of dispute resolution, when there is uncertainty whether a party is one user with sock puppets, or several users acting as meatpuppets, they may be treated as one individual."

<dd>A cursory examination of the user contributions for both accounts shows different access patterns, edit patterns, and some non-overlapping interests, though there are some apparently professional related similarities. "Uncertainty" does not equal "any claim of". Again: reinterpreting the meat puppet policy to cover related or real life connected people who have had WP accounts for some time, and who happen to have convergent interests and participation in a particular discussion, <i>is</i> a stretch of WP policy, and a horrible precedent at that.</dd>
<dd>As someone whose spouse (anon) edits WP from time to time, this issue is neither theoretical nor trivial.</dd>
<dd>If these two are functionally meatpuppeting this DRV discussion then that case has to be made with detailed edit comparisons and the like, looking at what they said, and when they were saying it. Failing to make that case but maintaining the claim is not defensible as compatible with consensus policy nor with WP's best long term interests.</dd>
<dd>I have no problem with admins taking proper action either in response to "traditional" meatpuppetry (new accounts created, not longstanding WP users), and in response to clear personal attacks and the like. I don't mind meatpuppetry claims if groups of real-life users gang up in WP on topics, if you can provide sufficient evidence. That's lacking here. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 05:08, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>George, you're worrying unnecessarily. This couple were acting incredibly immaturely, being facetious and sarcastic, and showing no respect for others.

<p>I've made it quite clear I am not engaged in a content dispute. We are not editing any articles together. I am not even involved in a "voting" dispute, as I have stated I am talking a neutral position in the current DRV and did so also in the preceding AFD. The above notice has been on this page immediately after the block was placed, i.e. over 10 hours, so I'm sure a number of admins have checked it out. Furthermore, the block was also specifically reviewed and upheld by <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_ac1a.html" title="User:NoSeptember">NoSeptember</a>, so your request of third party intervention has already been met. Otherwise, the case is as stated. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 03:57, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not sure how behavior <i>after</i> the block justifies the block, but ok. Obviously jgw responded poorly. I'm not defending that response, but I'm just not seeing any meatpuppetry here at all, and that's supposedly what the block was for. I'm also concerned that Tyrenius may have confused unfamiliarity with Wikipedia processes (as evidenced by both jgw and gfw's legalistic interpretations of policies and guidelines) for provocation ("provocatively and needlessly reposted it on her own page under the pretence of making sure that it was the comment I was referring to" -- you'll notice that jgw has reposted a LOT of stuff on Talk:jgwlaw that was said on other talk pages, and vice versa. That's not maliciousness or provocation, it's just a misunderstanding of how Wiki works.) <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> 11:36, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You've misunderstood the points:
<ul>
<li>Samir is not saying that the behaviour after the block is retrospective justification. He is saying that it merits extending the block (presumably until such time as good behaviour is evidenced and it is safe to let this person edit again).</li>
<li>The initial block was not for meatpuppetry. It was for uncivil behaviour and personal attacks.</li>
<li>The provocation is not because of misunderstanding or lack of familiary with Wikipedia processes. It is provocation pure and simple. Sarcasm, belittlement and facetious lack of respect for anyone in disagreement, or even anyone attempting a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> and not agreeing with her/them.</li>
<li>I am not referring to reposting a valid comment. I am referring to deliberately reposting a personal attack. This was the attack, initially posted on an AfD: "Unfortunately Tyrenius has removed your tag, calling it inflammatory. Sigh. Only the admin here seems to insist on muckraking." On her talk page, I drew Jgwlaw's attention to this and she apologised: "Sorry about the 'muckraking' comment about you." Having done that, she then immediately and needlessly reposted the initial insult from AfD on her talk page with the words "This is what you refer to." I can only see that this action was provocation.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jgwlaw&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66656247" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jgwlaw&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66656247" rel="nofollow">[80]</a></li>
<li>I have never made any criticism of reposting legitimate material on different pages.</li>
<li>They quite blatantly act in concert together, and when they are talking to a third person, they make scornful or sarcastic comments to each other about that other person. It is not a coincidence that a "husband and wife" turn up on the same pages all the time. I consider this to be meatpuppetry. It prevents fair dialogue. Check the diffs please in my initial statement. Look at the comment above starting "Unfortunately Tyrenius has removed your tag". It is glaringly obvious.</li>

<dd>OK, I agree with all of your points except the provocation. It's clear to me that jgwlaw was attempting to provide context for the apology for the benefit of readers who had not seen it. That's obviously inappropriate to us, but given the fact that we know jgw and gfw are not super-familiar with Wikipedia norms, it's an understandable mistake. <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> 22:57, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think the job the couple did on <a href="../../../k/i/h/User_talk%7EKihOshk_bf22.html" title="User talk:KihOshk">User talk:KihOshk</a> is not to be tolerated. They are engaging in a revert war in concert, giving 3RR warnings and calling their joint preferred version of an article "consensus". Is "ganging up" the term I'm looking for (I'm not a native English speaker...)? This is probably due to inexperience rather than malice. I would hope to see the couple to be a little bit more receptive to advice on how not to do things so that the inexperience will be replaced by understanding <i>harmonious editing</i>. I remain unconvinced that it is in Wikipedia's interest to allow families to edit in concert in revert wars. My cursory examination hasn't revealed any 3RR violations but would it be helpful for two people editing in the same apartment to consult each other to get around 3RR? The couple in this case appear to have contact outside Wikipedia, such as when I write on one participant's talk page, the other responds. This falls under the letter, and I feel under the spirit, of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:SOCK#Advertising_and_soliciting_meatpuppets" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:SOCK#Advertising_and_soliciting_meatpuppets" rel="nofollow">attracting users with known bias</a> (even if it as simple as "honey, look at what this Weregerbil dude is saying").

<p>I've had some productive interactions with User:Jgwlaw (who signs herself "jawesq") on Wikiquote over <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Shapiro_8a56.html" title="Jim Shapiro">Jim Shapiro</a> and its accompanying <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Jim_Shapiro" class="extiw" title="q:Jim_Shapiro">q:Jim Shapiro</a>. I haven't delved into all the relevant policies, nor anaylzed every edit, but I've been reading the discourse on the WP article since it was nominated for deletion. My informal take on her activities is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>She has oodles of time to post thorough replies, easily overwhelming any general editor. She also frequently posts consecutive comments to many users' talk pages to push her positions, not waiting for replies. From my own admin experience on WQ, this is enough to cause serious problems for admins trying to mediate disputes. I can understand why this would be considered <a href="../../../t/r/o/WP%7ETROLL_3085.html" title="WP:TROLL">trolling</a>, even if it were completely civil. She has shown no awareness of the problems this causes.</li>
<li>She has made many posts that are clearly uncivil, which I believe are in ignorance not only of official policy pages but of the general wiki attitude of harmonious editing. I believe she is allowing her heartfelt concerns over lawyer-bashing to override good judgment on this issue, aided by her perception that the WP community is unfairly supporting the other side of this issue (whose proponents have not trolled).</li>
<li>Much of Jgwlaw's rapid-fire editing has been in direct response to similar rapid-fire editing from the Shapiro article supporters, who have also shown little patience for Wikipedia processes. (They've already created a new version of the article, <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_J._Shapiro_19b0.html" title="James J. Shapiro">James J. Shapiro</a>, before the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_Log_2006_July_31_77ca.html#Jim_Shapiro" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review/Log/2006 July 31">deletion review</a> on the old one has run its course. They also are not immune to attacking the editor, not the issue; e.g., complaining about Jgwlaw "switch[ing] your arguments to notability" when this is always a legitimate question, regardless of who asks it or when.) It's hard to justify too much action against one combatant when the others are equally active, even if they are savvy enough to stay under the troll radar.</li>
<li>The combined efforts of her and her husband to expound on this issue are overwhelming, yes, but I'm reluctant to consider them meatpuppetry.</li>
</ul>
<p>In retrospect, I think the apeedy deletion of the original Shapiro article was probably a bad idea, given the vociferousness of the opposing parties in this debate, when an article-blanking and full AfD may have better served. On the other hand, I understand why this action was taken, and I don't think it would have prevented the <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Shapiro_8a56.html" title="Jim Shapiro">Jim Shapiro</a> deletion review, or reduced the likelihood that this argument will continue so long as a Shapiro article exists. The consequence of all this is we have two highly motivated parties, one of which is blocked from editing even her own talk page, the other allowed to recreate a speedy-deleted article (which, IMHO, fails the criteria of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> even in its current form — see <a href="../../../j/a/m/Talk%7EJames_J._Shapiro_5611.html" title="Talk:James J.

<dd>Factual correcton: Jgwlaw was only blocked from editing her own page for a 5 hour period to allow some cooling off. This ended 5 a.m. on 1 August. At all other times her talk page has been available to her.</dd>
<dd>Unblocking: NoSeptember first reviewed the block and kept it in place. Pilotguy and Samir have both been involved and I have invited them to remove the block if they feel that is the right course. They both declined to do so. Samir has previously suggested the block should be extended because of ongoing bad behaviour by Jsglaw on her talk page since the block was placed. If this behaviour does continue, it is my intention to extend the block, until such time as civility is demonstrated. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 06:24, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The bad behavior on the talk page appears pretty minor. Voluminous rather than truly uncivil.</dd>
<dd>You can't block active people and expect them not to complain about it alot. That's just an unreasonable expectation.</dd>
<dd>Given that blocks are supposed to be preventive rather than punitive, what is the rationale for extending just over the minor stuff on the talk page? She isn't launching personal attacks on admins there, and I don't see any stated claim that she is likely to abuse other articles if the block expires naturally. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 06:35, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is just a small sample. I suggest you examine also all the posts that Jgwlaw has put on her talk page since the block was in place and work through the edit history. Most of them have subsequently been deleted by her. Volume is a particular concern. Opinions that she and her husband disagree with are met with a completely disproportionate response, which appears as a tactic of simply bulldozing opposition out of the way. This too is a lack of civility and shows no respect either to other editors or the discussion process. As Jeffq put it above:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>She has oodles of time to post thorough replies, easily overwhelming any general editor. She also frequently posts consecutive comments to many users' talk pages to push her positions, not waiting for replies. From my own admin experience on WQ, this is enough to cause serious problems for admins trying to mediate disputes. I can understand why this would be considered <a href="../../../t/r/o/WP%7ETROLL_3085.html" title="WP:TROLL">trolling</a>, even if it were completely civil. She has shown no awareness of the problems this causes.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Until Jgwlaw does show such awareness, she will continue to be a disruptive and disharmonious participant in any debate. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 07:38, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I would suggest letting the current block expire when it does. She is still hostile and thinks there is a <a href="../../../r/o/u/WP%7EROUGE_ace2.html" title="WP:ROUGE">single admin</a> after her <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJgwlaw&amp;diff=67209045&amp;oldid=67207868" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJgwlaw&amp;diff=67209045&amp;oldid=67207868" rel="nofollow">[92]</a>. My guess is that when the block expires she'll continue her attacks (zero sign of it abating so far). And she will get quickly blocked, hopefully by another admin. Perhaps in time she will realize that this isn't a personal vendetta, and that her understanding of what constitutes incivility and personal attacks truly does not match Wikipedia's standards. <a href="../../../w/e/r/User%7EWeregerbil_edbb.html" title="User:Weregerbil">Weregerbil</a> 10:08, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I hoped by explaining myself that there could be a reasoned interaction, but instead it has resulted in a direct attack on me. I invite others to judge for themselves. I placed the block, NoSeptember confirmed it, Pilotguy and Samir declined my invitation to remove it if they wished. That's 4 admins in total. Accusing me of a vendetta is just emotional blackmail to stop me doing my job properly, and I'm not being bullied by it.<a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 10:29, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was hoping that there might be a mellowing by now, and even that I might be able to lift the block. Unfortunately there is no sign of that. Following the latest bout of incivility and <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a>, and bearing in mind Samir's previous suggestion to do so, I have increased the block to a total of 7 days (including the 2 days already blocked), as I do not feel Jgwlaw will be able to participate in harmonious interaction with other editors over decisions which she disputes. Some of the latest comments include: "You are obsessed with trashing me in public", "Tyrenius did not really want a 3 day ban for incivility. He wanted us gone. And when we were banned, then he could win", "HE wants us gone", "His lobby to ban me permanently would certainly be a win for him", "Even if Tyrenius did not violate the technicality of the rule (and he accuses me of being legalistic?) he has indeed violated the spirit of the process. He has violated the spirit of decency."</p>
<p>I invite any admin quite freely to amend or remove this block if they think it is incorrect, in which case I will refrain from involvement as an admin with Jgwlaw over any disputes relating to the Jim Shapiro article.</p>

<p>Because of my existing involvement and the accusations Jgwlaw has made against me, I do not think it is appropriate for me to respond to this, so I am posting it for another admin to deal with.

<dd>None of the various accounts listed above seem to have made any edits to articles, and there seems to have been an immense amount of what I can only describe as arsing around on people's talk pages. The "secret" IP address has a notice on the user page to say it's an AOL address, presumably so nobody blocks it for a long period, when in fact it's not AOL at all. I've blocked it for 24 hours, because this needs looking into further and the encyclopaedia is not going to be harmed in the slightest if nobody from that address is able to edit it for a day. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 23:10, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think this is the right place to report this, but please correct me &amp; tell me where else if it's not. The problem is basically this:</p>
<p><a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">User:Rjensen</a> is basically trying to control everything that's in the article <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confederate_States_of_America_b8e1.html" title="Confederate States of America">Confederate States of America</a> and has some very strong points of view about it. The biggest dispute involves a section called "International diplomacy" about a consul from Saxe-Coburg-Gotha named <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernst_Raven_5f4b.html" title="Ernst Raven">Ernst Raven</a>. It is a well known bit of Civil War trivia that Raven was the only European diplomat who was officially appointed to the Confederacy. This has appeared in major Civil War magazines like North and South and is in many books of civil war trivia.</p>
<p>This appointment is also well documented - Official records at the Library of Congress show that Raven's appointment papers were recorded by the Confederate government in Richmond. <a href="http://memory.loc.gov/ll/llcc/005/0400/04240422.gif" class="external autonumber" title="http://memory.loc.gov/ll/llcc/005/0400/04240422.gif" rel="nofollow">[98]</a> It names "Ernst Raven, esq., who was appointed consul for the State of Texas by his highness the Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and who applied to this government for an exequator on the 30th of July 1861." Most of the "International Diplomacy" section in the article is about the South's unofficial diplomatic relations with other countries. Since Raven was the only diplomat with official appointment status this is the appropriate place to put it.</p>
<p>The Ernst Raven bit has been in the Confederacy article for a long time. It was there the first time I looked it up months ago and the talk page then showed that it had been discussed several times and agreed to by many editors. Unfortunately every couple of weeks Rjensen comes through and deletes it without any discussion. I've restored it a couple times and so have others, but Rjensen keeps deleting it. He especially keeps deleting the Library of Congress link even though it is a clearly reputable source, and he usually replaces it with vague generic claims saying that unnamed "historians" have "proved" Raven's appointment was a myth. Then last week after I restored the link again he got into a huge revert war with some other editors and broke the 3 revert rule majorly:</p>

<p>The guy he was revert warring with here also broke 3-revert rule but did it after Rjensen did, and he also seems to have tried unsuccessfully to have gotten Rjensen to discuss it. Then a third editor restored the compromise text and link about Raven, but Rjensen came back 2 days later and reverted again at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Confederate_States_of_America&amp;diff=64594396&amp;oldid=64590476" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Confederate_States_of_America&amp;diff=64594396&amp;oldid=64590476" rel="nofollow">[105]</a>.</p>
<p>I hate to have to ask for outside help on this but I don't have time to check this article enough to stop this guy, and he also seems to be a very hostile and uncooperative person. He refuses all compromises on Raven and will only settle for deleting him completely - which he does regardless of what all the other editors think. He also uses belligerent language in his descriptions of the changes and on the talk page. Several times he's accused all the editors who want to keep Raven in there of a "hoax" and he calls us "neoconfederates" as an attack.</p>
<p>Could somebody who is a moderator please come to this article and get this guy to stop his abusive behavior? It's ruining the historical quality of the article and making it a very hostile place for every contributor who isn't Rjensen, since he just reverts without establishing any consensus. Thanks for your help. - MightyMo</p>

<dd>Rjensen replies. It's a question of repeated efforts to insert original research that makes an argument that no scholar accepts. Not a single reference book on the Civil War or the Confederacy accepts this strange claim and the major book on Confederate consuls explictly says the claim is false.<a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN081311876X&amp;id=x82ncYYwq98C&amp;pg=PA111&amp;lpg=PA111&amp;dq=ernest+raven+confederate&amp;sig=paxm8ryhesY37JPbZea0bwtODXk" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN081311876X&amp;id=x82ncYYwq98C&amp;pg=PA111&amp;lpg=PA111&amp;dq=ernest+raven+confederate&amp;sig=paxm8ryhesY37JPbZea0bwtODXk" rel="nofollow">[107]</a> I refer to <i>The British Foreign Service and the American Civil War</i></dd>

MightMo has been unable to find a single reliable source for his novel interpretation--no books, no articles, no websites, zip. All he has is an original document that says nothing whatever about recognition. As for the edit war, I was the one who issue a RFC call to help solve the mess. And yes, one of my missions is to keep historical hoaxes out of Wiki by insisting on reliable sources. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 00:40, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>While I'm not involved in any of the above conflicts, I have had to report user for <a href="../../../r/j/e/User_talk%7ERjensen_Archive_3_a6a4.html#User_notice:_temporary_3RR_block_2" title="User talk:Rjensen/Archive 3">3RR violation</a> myself (for repeated removal of POV tags during an edit war user was conducting with another user), and any causal glance at the current and archive <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a> talk pages will show numerous incidents of this nature. User consistently finds faults with each other user, and I can remember the day he conceded a point (one incident). He always knows best, repeatedly wields real-world credentials as sole authority, and often casually uses perjoratives like "hoax" and "vandalism" in order to short circuit discussion on issues of consequence. He finds no other users for building consensus; he merely reverts up to the daily maximum for each user he wars against. Finally, he taunts and disparages other users, then when this is pointed out, warns other users to expect more, and be more tolerant of his abuse. A clear pattern of behavior can be seen from his user talk archives. While I respect his basic scholarship, I often find myself at odds with his frequent rude and unkind behaviors. As a matter of fact, he's engaged in a potential 3RR violation on the ACW main page at this exact moment (see ACW History and talk for details). <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBusterD_6ff3.html" title="User:BusterD">BusterD</a> 01:24, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As with BusterD, I have not been a part of the revert wars, as I tend to focus my attention on adding new biographies of generals and certain battles, and rarely edit the larger context articles. However, I will comment that this difference in opinions on the CSA article has long ceased to be civil, and frankly, does not reflect well on Wikipedia. Some sort of cooling off period is needed, and perhaps an impartial group should look into both sides of the controversy and report through the MilitaryHistory Project team their recommendations. Honest disagreements will always occur - it's the resulting attitude wars that are not acceptable. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScott_Mingus_78b1.html" title="User:Scott Mingus">Scott Mingus</a> 03:29, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I spotted this on recent changes, decided it was mostly advertising and placed a Proposed Deletion template on it, citing "Advertising" as the reson. The creator removed the template, along with a lot of material and as the result was a stub that was mostly advertising, I placed a Speedy Deletion template on it, which was removed. I request an administrator take a look at it; I don't want to get into an edit war over the template. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperJumbo_33a0.html" title="User:SuperJumbo">Jumbo</a> 23:36, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I may have only hit the tip of this beast. In late June I <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_George_Eyre_d1ec.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/George Eyre">posted an AfD</a> on a series of articles that looked like either hoaxes, geneological research, or a vanity of latter.

It looks at first glance like the biting of a newbie. But <b>no</b>, there's some crud going down. An RFCU was opened, see <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_checkuser_Case_History21_5c34.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/History21">Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser/Case/History21</a>, which came back as positive on <a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHistory21_c579.html" title="User:History21">History21</a> (<a href="../../../h/i/s/User_talk%7EHistory21_199e.html" title="User talk:History21">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_History21_4a61.html" title="Special:Contributions/History21">contribs</a>), Joan53 (<a href="../../../j/o/a/User_talk%7EJoan53_ad90.html" title="User talk:Joan53">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Joan53_aac1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Joan53">contribs</a>), and <a href="../../../l/i/l/User%7ELilyana_2a25.html" title="User:Lilyana">Lilyana</a> (<a href="../../../l/i/l/User_talk%7ELilyana_6117.html" title="User talk:Lilyana">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lilyana_31ab.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lilyana">contribs</a>).

<p>Second, this goes.... deep?! Through the last year or so, there's been a string of articles created with what seems to have made some rather fantastic claims reguarding this family. Evidence for them is rather limited, yet articles continue to be made with claims that likely lead to hoax beliefs by many. Here's a short list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leader of the Eyre/Heller Dynasty in the United States (AfD)</li>
<li>George Eyre, <a href="../../../j/e/h/Jehu_Eyre_5c1a.html" title="Jehu Eyre">Jehu Eyre</a>, Jehu Eyre, Jr., Anne Eyre Heller, Franklin Pierce Heller, Leroy Heller (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_George_Eyre_d1ec.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/George Eyre">AfD</a></li>
<li>Knowlton_Estate (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Knowlton_Estate_2bc0.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Knowlton Estate">AfD</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The woodwork in the recent AfDs led me to</p>
<ul>
<li>Eyre Empire (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Eyre_Empire_2312.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Eyre Empire">VfD</a>, where RickK described the creator as a vandal)</li>
<li><a href="../../../t/r/u/Truelove_Eyre_0858.html" title="Truelove Eyre">Truelove Eyre</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Truelove_Eyre_f29a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Truelove Eyre">VfD</a>), rewritten</li>
<li>Image:Hellerwestwing.jpeg (uploaded by <a href="../../../l/i/l/User%7ELilyana_2a25.html" title="User:Lilyana">Lilyana</a>, looks interesting by name)</li>

Since cleaned up. I get the feeling I'm missing several articles, as this stuff goes back to early 2005. Why is there such a push to put such elaborate claims (ex. people "comming to power" in the <i>dynasty</i>, which isn't a dynasty).</p>
<p>Can there be a little sock searching through the history of some of the deleted articles to root out any other socks, esspecially the Eyre Empire one. Please note, I'm not claiming full hoaxiness of the possiblity of a shipwrite in early-US history nor a European family that may have held this name, but this material has been far too outlandish for what it should be.</p>

<p>As for what to make of History21, I'm at a loss. I had the feeling in the AfDs I saw, something is amiss, and its over a year old. The Joan53 sock, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lilyana_31ab.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lilyana">in late March 2005</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_BGK_9d19.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/BGK">knew</a> <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Bad_beat_fb6f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Bad beat">how</a> <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Bantal_dd68.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Bantal">VfD</a> worked. History21 talks to the socks. If this is, say, the same household editing, their interests and editing patterns are awfully similar to be feigning full disassociation with eachother. Given that they're socks, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Grange_Estate&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66263113" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Grange_Estate&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66263113" rel="nofollow">this diff</a>] is rather interesting. History21 would then be admitting hoaxes (that his/her sock has created). Something is definatly wrong, its been around for awhile, and I feel I haven't seen the bottom of it yet.</p>

<p>The above huge chunk of stuff, signed by me, <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Breitenstein_8775.html" title="User:Kevin Breitenstein">Kevin_b_er</a> 02:11, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have blocked Lilyana and JoanB indefinitely. If History21 wants to edit, "he" needs to edit gingerly. All good faith has been squandered.

<dd>Bah, there's a deep-seated problem here, and the <i>editors</i> involved are difficult to seperate from the <i>isssues</i> involved. I shall however attempt to go forth and sin no more.

<p>Wait, so Brenneman writes: <code>We've seen analysis of previous AfDs that clearly showed that a very small core of editors drove the long string of "no consensus" closes to AfDs. We've seen analysis that showed that many of those editors were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Nicodemus75" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Nicodemus75" rel="nofollow">monolithic</a> in their contributions, and that the perceived "enemies" of schools tended to not only have wider patterns of opinions in AfDs, but also to contribute to a wider variety of articles. It's been demonstrated that a large number of editors never contributed to <i>maintaining or improving</i> school articles beyond AfD participation.</code> And then it gets removed as "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Schools&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=67355380" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Schools&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=67355380" rel="nofollow">WP:RPA</a>"?

<p>Interesting the entry says "alleging stalkers were freely roaming Wikipedia", then Jimbo turns around, deletes the entire article about me which was the source of the controversy, and all 700 revisions, admits these trolls were violating WP policy, stalking, and libeling, and forces a total rewrite -- what a good man. The only reason it is still listed there is I have not asked for it to be lifted, or it probably would be. That was a sad series of events, but it's in the past. Fvw, the individual who started all of it broke into an off Wikipedia server with the assistance of peter anvin of kernel.org, and took sensitive account information and private materials, which also doesn't speak well for the entire sad affair. All of that being said, its in the past. I can run for the Board -- whether or not I am elected is up to the community. I have a lot to offer. Have a great day. Jeff</p>
<dl>
<dd>Presumably you could ask that the ban be lifted, then? (Or would it be lifted automatically if you were to become a board member?) It just seems a bit silly if we were to have someone on the board at the same time they were technically banned (their edits being removable on sight and such).

<dd>Well, I'll let the community decide if it should be lifted. Anyone of the administrators can lift it at any time, since it's a community based ban. "Forgive and Forget" is one of the basic foundational rules of MeatBall Wiki. I have a lot to do on the Cherokee Wikipedia and the ban does not extend to any other projects and I actively edit these projects and external projects intended to produce revenue into the Foundation, which is where my real value is. I also talk on the phone with Brad and Danny regularly on the other projects I am working on with the Foundation and there's no friction there -- only wikilove.... Jeff</dd>

<p>I suggest that our policy for Colbert Masturbators be that registered users be blocked indefinitely, and that anonymous IPs be blocked for a minimum of a week, and that this be done for a first offense.

<dd>(edit conflict) I think it gets a bit more nuanced: some editors think that, for instance, the elephant article is a good place to say, "Stephen Colbert once told people to say that the elephant population has tripled over the last three months." I think such editors need to be told to use the talk page, and roll the edits back as disruptive but not malicious. Repeated entries by the same user refusing to use the talk page should end up with one more warning and then a block. If, on the other hand, they're simply run-of-the-mill Colberrorists using vandalism-only sleeper accounts, they should be blocked on sight. But ultimately, MiB is right: the biggest mistake we could make is to overreact to this. There's a PR element to this, and so far we're doing pretty well. This is probably the most direct, focused barrage of vandalism Wikipedia's dealt with, and so far, judging by word of blog, we're actually getting high marks. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorj</a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_Esperanza_93c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">m</a> <a href="../../../j/d/o/User_talk%7EJDoorjam_230c.html" title="User talk:JDoorjam">Talk</a> 04:44, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Vandalism-only accounts should be blocked indefinitely, established users with mostly good edits should not be blocked for the first offense for more than 48h, IMHO.

<dd>I take this to mean you agree with my plan of mailing a series of doctored (GFDL) photos of bears chasing/eating Colbert, signed "Jimbo Wales," to the "Eagle's Nest."

<p>Warnings are good ideas in general, but become useless enabling when mandated for even the most unrepentant violator who clearly knows our civility and AGF policies, and has been blocked under them before. Nicodemus <i>has</i> been blocked for incivility before, and I don't personally see any reason why he shouldn't be under a kind of "zero margin" as it is, and why this block isn't a logical outgrowth of that lack of margin. It is clear to me that Nicodemus is an odious presence here who contributes little constructively, and, frankly, should never have been unblocked in the first place so many months ago. We don't need more people trying to draw the community into partisan camps for the sake of the confrontation itself, and we certainly don't need any more inserting venom into deletion discussions. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 07:26, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The only disagreement I'd have with that is that he hadn't (to my knowledge) been <i>told</i> he'd used up every bit of "margin." I know I'm straining at gnats here, but given that <b>1)</b> He's come off a long break, <b>2)</b> Feels (with some justification) that his "record" is ancient history, and <b>3)</b> reckons he hasn't been <i>that</i> uncivil... Well, I'd probably be pretty cranky if I were him right now. I'd still like to see the block lifted, with the caveat that is becomes an indefinite if he doesn't cool it. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="black">brenneman</font></a> <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" rel="nofollow"><font color="black" title="Admin actions"><sup><b>{L}</b></sup></font></a></span> 07:56, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Noting that I don't particularly care if he does have reason to be cranky, since incivility is <i>never</i> the proper reaction to <i>any</i> stimulus, Aaron's proposal is fine with me as long as Nicodemus agrees to abide by it. (At the moment, his last talk page communication was still attacks.) With that in mind, I'll remove his {{<a href="../../../u/n/b/Template%7EUnblock_0164.html" title="Template:Unblock">unblock</a>}} and wait to see how Nicodemus' response to Aaron's last message pans out.

<dd>I agree with Aaron too, but I don't have much confidence that Nicodemus will change his ways. As to the block itself, it is very hard to make a project like Wikipedia work when some people resolutely refuse to countenance any way of working other than their own, so to characterise Nicodemus as serially disruptive is, I think, entirely fair. And yes, that is following him down the path of personalising the issue. Sorry. In the end we have a set of inclusion guidelines on content of many kinds which have widespread consensus, albeit with a few dissenters and some debate around the margins, and then we have schools, where any attempt to formulate a similar set of consensus guidelines has been stymied by such absurdities as the assertion that all schools are inherently notable. What AMIB was trying to do was to intrroduce a guideline that would allow pretty much any school article which has significant verifiable information beyond the mere fact of its existence. Only in the bizarre world of the schools debate could this be seen as anything other than a good-faith attempt to extend a consistent approach across all content areas. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 10:05, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As someone recently under attack from him, all I can say is that I remain convinced that personal attacks are not a blocking criterion, but, on the other hand, I agree with MiB and others that it's the "Wikipedia is not a battleground" thing that is blockable. The guy is sure that he's fighting a war against the forces of darkness, who happen to be administrators and long time users ... or just people who don't agree with him. Whatever it is, he's puffing and swinging constantly. I felt a bit like <a href="../../../f/o/g/Foghorn_Leghorn_08c6.html" title="Foghorn Leghorn">Foghorn Leghorn</a> facing <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henery_Hawk_9d6a.html" title="Henery Hawk">Henery Hawk</a>, myself. It may be one of those things where his best bet would be to stay away from the embattled areas of the site, except that those are the ones he seems to like. &lt;shrug&gt; After a warning, I agree with blocking if he does more attacking. If he can't figure out when he's ever been uncivil, I suppose we can help him figure it out. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 21:10, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was blocked for the fourth time by admins who push POV at the <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lance_Armstrong_8148.html" title="Lance Armstrong">Lance Armstrong</a> article. Just because he is from the same country as most editors of the English wikipedia does not mean his article needs to be a fanzine. The admin who reported me even implicitly admitted I had not broken the 3 revert rule. However, I got blocked for 72 hours. Another editor who had deleted a POV tag without discussion three times, which is explicitly described as <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVandalism_79f5.html" title="WP:Vandalism">WP:Vandalism</a>, was not punished at all. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">JzG</a> who had abusively blocked me three times before even though he was in a content dispute again took advantage of the block to delete the history of two articles about journalists who wrote a book about alleged drug abuse by Armstrong. Even though his suggestion to merge the articles failed and a thir opinion had helded to get a consensus on the talk page, JzG just went and made the articles into redirects: <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre_Ballester_a42f.html" title="Pierre Ballester">Pierre Ballester</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Walsh_%28sports_reporter%29_5645.html" title="David Walsh (sports reporter)">David Walsh (sports reporter)</a>. Thus I cannot present the links any longer to show that there he had violated the same rules about biographies of living people that he had claimed to have blocked me for. There are many editors concerned about POV at the Armstrong article. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ALance_Armstrong&amp;diff=59620505&amp;oldid=58687010" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ALance_Armstrong&amp;diff=59620505&amp;oldid=58687010" rel="nofollow">[126]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Lance_Armstrong&amp;diff=57515006&amp;oldid=56246580" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Lance_Armstrong&amp;diff=57515006&amp;oldid=56246580" rel="nofollow">[127]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ALance_Armstrong&amp;diff=54251027&amp;oldid=52577712" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ALance_Armstrong&amp;diff=54251027&amp;oldid=52577712" rel="nofollow">[128]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ALance_Armstrong&amp;diff=54251027&amp;oldid=52577712" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ALance_Armstrong&amp;diff=54251027&amp;oldid=52577712" rel="nofollow">[129]</a> Please help to resolve the conflict. <a href="../../../s/o/c/User%7ESocafan_ad96.html" title="User:Socafan">Socafan</a> 11:16, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Guy, you've been blocked the last 3 times owing purely to your own behavior. The fact that no one has reversed those blocks despite your vociferous argumentation should be a clue. Take the time to reflect on their <b>real</b> meaning -- which is neither "everyone's out to get me" nor "if I make <i>just</i> the right legal argument I'll win". --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 11:45, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I showed you that the rules are very clear that no editor is allowed to remove a POV more than once in 24 hrs. You did it three times without discussion, thus vandalizing the page.

<dd>Socafan is waging a crusade to spin the doping allegations against Lance Armstrong in the most damaging way possible. His first 3RR block was after reverting three separate admins. I see no sign that he is in the least repentant, and every indication that he will continue Wikilawyering. His view appears to be that hios content should go in unless and until we can all persuade him otherwise - this is a reversal of the unambiguously stated rule at <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>.

<dd>Socafan, what I see here is the continued assertion against all the available evidence that you are (a) right and (b) a blameless victim. Is that your assertion? If so, then I propose we move to a community ban, as previously suggested by Tony, because if you won't even acknowledge the problem with your behaviour there is no realistic chance of your fixing it. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 11:58, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Having attempted to mediate a few days ago, I do not support User:Socafan's approach to editing the Lance Armstrong article. I think his behaviour is very frustrating and his edits do not reflect concensus. To accuse editors of contributing to a <i>fanzine</i> is not approprate. Most editors are editing in good faith to produce a meaningful article on a notable sportsman. Socofan's beahviour is unconstructive--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A&#160;Y&#160;Arktos</a>\<sup><a href="../../../a/y/a/User_talk%7EAYArktos_b1bb.html" title="User talk:AYArktos">talk</a></sup> 12:00, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Seeing User:Socafan's responses here has pretty much sealed my mind against him.

<dd>After two blocks for 3RR he is straight back in there edit warring over a tag whose inclusion seems to be unsupported by any other historied editor. Socafan's approach appears to be that anything he does need not be justified but may not be undone without first persuading him. Since he has never acknowledged that there is any problem with his edits, despite everybody else agreeing there is, I am not holding my breath here. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 13:33, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh indeed, the reason for the tag is absolutely plain: you refuse to accept the fact that your edits have failed to gain consensus. Oh, and you refuse to accept that Armstrong is clean. Do feel free to come back when he's been successfully prosecuted. As to the idea that merging two articles with substantially identical content into one which covers the subject of that content, when the articles themselves cover nothing else, that is a very novel interpretation of vandalism. One might almost accuse you of failing to assume good faith, but I see from your postings on Talk pages that accusations of failure to assume good faith only apply when it is <i>your</i> edits which are questioned.

<p>Sam, you beat me to it. Here is the post I wrote for AN/I.</p>
<p>IMO, Socafan is a purely a disruptive editor here to challenge Wikipedia policy and administrators. Socafan's early edits show a familarity with Wikipedia policy leading me to think the user is a sockpuppet. Why are we continuing to tolerate this users continued disruptive behavior? Socafan is adding nothing of value to the project.

<dd>This entry is at best slander. If an administrator would like to to involve in this issue I would be delighted. The user Comanche has been a test of many a merited users patience. As he has been spreading his slanderous comments about me across ceveral talk pages now I would urge any administrator to involve themselves seriously in this conflict. I am aware that many administrators are very busy, but simply leaving a warning on this users talk page has proven not to be enough. Other editors in addition to myself have tried to guide this user towards what is normal behaviour on wikipedia, but with little result. An in depth look at this users history is very much in order. If a merited administrator would involve him/her self a thorough look at the <b>problems</b> this user is causing <b>the community</b> should be weighed against his few positive edits and a long term solution should be reached. I am for one fed up with bearing the brunt of this users attacks. <a href="../../../i/n/g/User%7EInge_1e43.html" title="User:Inge">Inge</a> 01:36, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For some reason Barbamama was stalking User:Zeq, and as part of that campaign he commenced an AfD on an article Zeq had just created.

<p>I am reporting anonymously as an observer.

I always think that it's sad when people who have the potential to practice real philosophy settle for the lowest common denominator. You're nothing more than a partisan pundit. Anybody can be a mouthpiece. Anybody can latch on to any ideology and expound it throughout the world.

<dd>You are a sock puppet who was created solely to attempt to create trouble. Your first edit ever was to report me to personal attack intervention, your second edit was to "warn" me on my user page, and your third edit was this. RJII/TheIndividualist/IndividualistAnarchist/You are a banned user who has been disrupting Wikipedia and exhausting the community's patience for well over a year. While I readily admit that there was no real point to my comments, and that they were unnecessary, I made them without thinking, and you certainly deserve them, considering that you are void of good faith. I have no problem with them being erased, since you have already read them (and they seem to have had an impact), and since they do not have any merit beyond that.</dd>
<dd>The only thing that I apologize for is the disruption that this has apparently caused. There was a discussion on RJII/TheIndividualist/IndividualistAnarchist/ConcernedUser's talk page regarding his motivation for disrupting Wikipedia, and I let him know my thoughts on the matter, and my opinion of his motivations (he's searching for the secret to immortality). I didn't think that he would disrupt Wikipedia further by bothering all of you with it. So, for whatever waste of time this might be, I apologize. It was never meant to go beyond that. Now I understand why there is a policy in place against kicking people when they are down, despite how much they might deserve it. --AaronS 19:33, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Of course I am a sockpuppet. I didn't want to use my normal username in order to avoid retribution from you and rogue administrators. I know how the system works. You have to cover your tracks.

<p>I'm going to repeat my call for someone to check on the behaviour of this admin. He's been blocking several users for sockpuppetry indef with tenuous if at all existent connections. I asked about this a couple days ago and it was ignored. Another admin questions him <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASplash&amp;diff=67528389&amp;oldid=67518253" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASplash&amp;diff=67528389&amp;oldid=67518253" rel="nofollow">[141]</a> and is rewarded with a rather hostile reply for what I see as a very valid question. The sockpuppetry is not obvious if its at all existent to the depths he's claiming. I also question the need he has to blank the talk page of everyone he labels a sockpuppet then revert the talk pages when someone questions that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJos%C3%A9_is_Fluid&amp;diff=67503468&amp;oldid=67498900" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJos%C3%A9_is_Fluid&amp;diff=67503468&amp;oldid=67498900" rel="nofollow">[142]</a> without even so much as an explanation when it was questioned by the same admin. There is an evidence link on spotteddog here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Mothperson/Litterbox" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Mothperson/Litterbox" rel="nofollow">[143]</a> and I do not see the connection between for example the behaviour there and that exhibited by <a href="../../../k/r/a/User%7EKramden4700_b9a0.html" title="User:Kramden4700">Kramden4700</a> (<a href="../../../k/r/a/User_talk%7EKramden4700_067c.html" title="User talk:Kramden4700">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kramden4700_c7c5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kramden4700">contribs</a>) who's evidence is solely "contributions".--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 22:50, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What I'm showing you is the extent of it. He's blocked several users in the past little while with claims that they are sockpuppets <a href="../../../s/u/s/Category%7ESuspected_Wikipedia_sockpuppets_of_Spotteddogsdotorg_e9ed.html" title="Category:Suspected Wikipedia sockpuppets of Spotteddogsdotorg">Category:Suspected_Wikipedia_sockpuppets_of_Spotteddogsdotorg</a>. All the evidence seems to be of the nature "contributions" or "obvious". After reading through the evidence link that I gave above on spotteddogs behaviour (which mind is from a year ago), I'm not seeing this obvious connections, and he's not providing anymore justification other than "contributions". He also repeatedly blanks individuals talk pages. The second diff I showed you was him reverting another admin for unblanking the talk page. I'm not saying these individuals are or aren't all sockpuppets, I'm just saying the way he's going about it leaves much to be desired.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 23:08, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The key risk with diving in here is that i)Sockpuppeteers have a classic technique of trying to find an admin who doesn't know the details and pleading with them about User:Abusive admin and ii)<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">User:Crossmr</a> has a line on his userpage proclaiming the lovelytude of the banned User:Ste4k. The reason for blanking the talk pages is that the puppetmaster has taken to holding conversations with himself and 1 or 2 opposing users to give the impression to the opposing users that the numerics are in his favour. Crossmr didn't mention that I had already explained this fact on my talk page, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASplash&amp;diff=67503357&amp;oldid=67499225" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASplash&amp;diff=67503357&amp;oldid=67499225" rel="nofollow">[145]</a>. Really, going back over all 35 accounts and writing an essay on each of them would be an enormous waste of my time, but there are some diffs where I explain a number of them such as the particularly detailed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ADeletion_review&amp;diff=57977144&amp;oldid=57976650" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ADeletion_review&amp;diff=57977144&amp;oldid=57976650" rel="nofollow">[146]</a> and the immense amount of 'archaeological' history in Crossmr 3rd diff. It is important not to waste greater time than is absolutely required on this; Spotteddogsdotorg (possibly the puppetmaster, or possibly a puppet) is just a sockpuppeteer who has tried increasingly creative approaches and didn't succeed yet. No feeding, hmm? (PS. Crossmr didn't mention this thread to me.) -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> - <a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">tk</a> 23:29, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Proclaiming the lovelytude? I was dealing with a longterm vandal which no adminstrator wanted to address and had a mountain of pages to clean up. There were another 15 pages or so beyond what was listed on my user page for cleanup. I tagged them and am slowly working my way back through them. That user and <a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolf_ODonnell_36b5.html" title="User:Wolf ODonnell">User:Wolf_ODonnell</a> both cleaned up that page without my asking. But I notice you didn't mention him. Maybe you should start explaining the sockpuppetry allegations because it is questioned and not as obvious as you claim it to be.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 23:34, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have actually explained it in some detail for a smallish subset of the users in that diff up there; the others have their reasons in their blocklogs. To a puppet, they have been used to do a combination of i)mislead the community on AfD ii)mislead the community on policy/guideline discussion pages iii)mislead individuals as to the level of support in talk page discussions iv)appear as multiple users in Arbitration proceedings against the opponent v)complain to multiple people who don't know the detail that one of their number got blocked and iv)to do as their 20th edit or so. Really, honestly, providing a bunch of diffs for all 36 puppets is a waste of time. You can examine their contributions, your own link to Mothpersons' page, their block logs and the detailed forensics in the diff I already posted. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> - <a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">tk</a> 23:37, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The old puppets are well documented, its the new puppets that I'm questioning. Even SCZenz points out that he doesn't think its quite obvious from the contribs<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASplash&amp;diff=67535288&amp;oldid=67533686" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASplash&amp;diff=67535288&amp;oldid=67533686" rel="nofollow">[147]</a>. While some of them may have been disruptive or otherwise so, I'm not seeing the actual connection to spotteddog with all of them. This is whats being questioned here. No one is asking you to document all 36, how about a couple recent ones like Kramden7400 who actually had quite a few edits under his belt? --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 23:42, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>He matched the tendency, more specifically, to focus on TV (and sometimes other) personalities in the Philadelphia and related areas <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lisa_Scottoline&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=65448418" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lisa_Scottoline&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=65448418" rel="nofollow">[153]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Robert_Smith_%28architect%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=65448134" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Robert_Smith_%28architect%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=65448134" rel="nofollow">[154]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nick_Perri&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=65448358" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nick_Perri&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=65448358" rel="nofollow">[155]</a>.</li>
<li>He participates in all the same AfDs as a number of the other socks (not necessarily always on the same side, in an early display of the usual sockpuppeteers hallmarks): <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Angela_Russell_%28second_nomination%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66276416" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Angela_Russell_%28second_nomination%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66276416" rel="nofollow">[156]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/WCAU_Personalities&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=65119737" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/WCAU_Personalities&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=65119737" rel="nofollow">[157]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/WPVI-TV_Personalities&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=65119577" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/WPVI-TV_Personalities&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=65119577" rel="nofollow">[158]</a> and, going back much further he has even <i>nominated</i> one of them for adminship <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Rekarb_Bob&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=62315416" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Rekarb_Bob&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=62315416" rel="nofollow">[159]</a>.</li>

<li>In an attempt to acquire credibility, he makes a few sub-minor edits e.g. wikification, linkification etc to a few articles. Earlier, these would be Philadelphia related; more recently, the sophistication has risen but, like all sockpuppeteers, it wouldn't be worth his while if he avoided the areas of interest: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ithaca%2C_New_York&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=65456117" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ithaca%2C_New_York&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=65456117" rel="nofollow">[162]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fort_Wayne%2C_Indiana&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=65457604" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fort_Wayne%2C_Indiana&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=65457604" rel="nofollow">[163]</a> etc. Note also the Philadelphia theme.</li>

<dd>So a user who may be from philadelphia and thus interested in it and happens to like TV is a sock puppet of spotteddog? Philadelphia is a big city. A lot of users have been involved with CK over the months, he's a long term problem user who attacks anyone who shows the slightest disagreement with him. CK also happens to be highly interested in TV so its no wonder that he would have butted heads with Kramden or any other TV interested editor. CFIF, the one who's been feeding you several puppets it seems was the most vocal on the RfAr and without checking, I would guess involved in a lot of those AfDs. The nomination for adminship as you noticed I caught when I first encountered Kramden and checked his contribs. It seemed off to me, I'm curious why no one has removed it. One thing I didn't see from thos diffs is any big disruption. The comment you linked to on the AfD about creating two sub-pages seemed like a genuine suggestion and not something intended. While you've established this user is likely from Philadelphia and is interested in TV, there seemed to be much more to Spotteddog, which I'm not seeing here.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 00:20, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>To cap the concerns here once and for all, I'll volunteer to look at the entire list of sockpuppets. I would like to understand this set of sockpuppets. However, what is being asked for would be very time consuming, and at this point, I am inclined to think that not much will be written about them. Since there is a limited number of resources to address everyone's concerns here, the best I can do from my perspective is to say that there is certain level of trust that is involved here, and that is something that hopefully the community can still rely on. If it turns out that these accounts have been treated without proper jurisprudence, then naturally, some action needs to be taken to rectify the situation.</dd>

However, as a long time Wikipedian, I have little else to offer in this situation, and I suspect, this is why an overwhelming number of users on Wikipedia care very much about how they are treated, and how they are perceived.</dd>

<dd>I think we can skip all the ones covered in the evidence link from last year. Those appear to be well established. He's also provided some evidence for a couple of new accounts (in terms of suspicious behaviour, but no actual connection to spottedddog). I still don't think the blanking of talk pages is appropriate, regardless of whetehr or not he believes this person likes to hold conversations with himself. Some of the talk pages do have content from other editors on it. My chief concern here is the attitude shown to another admin when it was questioned and then when the question is finally acknowledged, the mud-slinging by saying I said something nice about a banned user (well I said it long before he was banned and he did something nice, so sue me), and his continually saying it would be a waste of time to check on these. If you think explaining your actions are a waste of time, maybe you shouldn't do them. It just seemed like there were a lot of these bans very rapidly, and with little to actual connection made regardless of whate else they might have done to warrant a ban. If they needed to be banned that is one thing, slapping them in with some old vandal is another if its not true.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 00:08, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, he is not a vandal, and it's important to tell the difference. He is a sockpuppeteer who makes superficially good edits with a view to misleading genuinue users and process (all the way to adminship and Arbitration, in this case). It would be a waste of time for me to repeat my evidenciary basis (now posted both here and in the diff I have to DRV (check it, it's overwhelmingy)) for all these account, and indeed, every time the socks persuade someone to feel sympathetic towards them. The series of bans come in bunches: that's how socks are naturally deployed (they're no good, otherwise, after all), and they <i>are</i> related to Spotteddogsdotorg, by simple backtracking in e.g. Kramden4700's case from the other users he is associated with, their contribs, their hallmarks and the hallmarks of the others back over a long period. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> - <a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">tk</a> 00:16, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>I'll reiterate my sentiment from <a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">User talk:Splash</a>: if this puppet master is so prolific that Splash can't even take the time to document it all to puzzled observers (like myself), then a page at <a href="../../../l/t/a/WP%7ELTA_07ef.html" title="WP:LTA">WP:LTA</a> may be in order. Then, there will be a centralized repository of information which others who get sucked in (like myself) can view and get up to speed on the situation quickly. We won't have to waste time at <a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">User talk:Splash</a> or here or wherever. We'll all know the behavior and can join in fending off the vandal rather than fighting about him. Instead, an innocent bystander, <a href="../../../j/i/a/User%7EJianLi_1744.html" title="User:JianLi">JianLi</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/a/User_talk%7EJianLi_ea6e.html" title="User talk:JianLi">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JianLi_33b9.html" title="Special:Contributions/JianLi">contribs</a>), has been accused of being a puppet even though s/he made over 1,000 edits before being singled out for using the term "cruft". What a terrible insult and what a spectacular waste of time for a half-dozen people or more just today. This vandal must be laughing his ass off. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 00:21, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ah, key point there! I <i>rejected</i> the suggestion that Jian Li should be blocked, <i>twice</i>. I'm not some sort of automaton, and I do not apply blocks when some random user I've never met before asks me to. I study things first, and then I do it, if I think it's right to do so. You don't have to fight with me, and I don't think we have fought; you just jumped into unblanking talk page of a user who uses them abusively, but you didn't know that. I'll repeat that abuse pages are a <i>bad idea</i>. They lend credibility, they provide a target, they make for competition and they give corporeality to something that should not be. And again, he <i>is not</i> a vandal. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> - <a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">tk</a> 00:27, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am inclined to trust Splash's judgement at this point. If we spend more time dealing with trolls than they spend trolling, then we are feeding them.

<dd>No, but a reasonable person should be able reach the same conclusion they did. And with the diffs provided, I Don't see it.

<dd>And a reasonable person would be able to by a little investigative journalism from the 10-odd diffs I just posted, particularly by not overlooking the fact that I explicitly said that Kramden4700 edited the same debates as a good number of other socks of the same user, also now indef blocked. But allow us to be clear, Crossmr: you want the sockpuppets unblocked. If you don't, what is the purpose of continuing this discussion, other than to put food in the foodbowl? -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> - <a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">tk</a> 00:43, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, I want to be sure that the blocks were all appropriate, and that the allegation of being puppets of spotteddog are actually correct. the 10 diffs you provided and the evidence they supposedly support, certainly doesn't do that for me. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 00:49, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>And I want to ensure this doesn't happen again. A quick point of clarification, I didn't imply that Splash accused JianLi of being a sock - but someone else did. That could have been prevented if the accuser had known something about the puppet master s/he was accusing JianLi of being. IMHO, it would be more helpful to the community if all this research and evidence of sockpuppetry were shared somewhere - rather than snippy comments like the first that Crossmr pointed out. I wouldn't have to waste my time doing the research if you simply posted yours somewhere. Otherwise, you get vigilantes like JianLi's accuser and you get very confused people like several people here, including myself. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 01:23, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Despite being asked several times to get a username, anon user refuses, on the basis that there is no obligation to register to edit WP, which is correct.

<dd>As an outside observer here who is not the same anon as the IPs above, Jossi's attitude on that article has been one of <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>, rudeness toward anyone who is not there to push a pro-immigration POV but enthusiastically welcoming toward anyone who is, misuse of the "test" script in a patronizing manner, has told several people that they need to calm down and take a break when Jossi seems to be the only person there pushing a POV and using Wikipedia as a battleground, and frequently tries to order anon editors to get accounts. Is this Wikipedia, the encyclopedia that <i>anyone</i> (anon IPs included) can edit, or is it not? I for one do not believe that anyone who thinks anon IPs should have to register to edit has any business continuing to be an admin. This also goes for admins who treat edits from anon IPs differently (as in more likely to revert) than they would do with edits from registered users. If somebody doesn't believe anonymous IPs should be editing Wikipedia, that person is unfit to be an admin on Wikipedia. Jossi should either step down as an admin or change his/her attitude toward anon IPs. 70.108.96.254 23:58, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Part of the trouble with anon editors is that we never know who we're talking to. The anon above is an example. He seems to have strong opinions, yet there is no edit history to know whether or not it's the same guy. It complicates tracking 3RR, mkaes it impossible to know if the user has been warned for previous behavior, etc. While anon editors are welcome, if someomne is going to make contentious edits, engage in talk page discussions, and hang around here then it would be very helpful if they created some kind of consistent identity. This editor seems to be going out of his way to use changing IPs, and his editing is so aggressive that it adds up to disruptive behavior. The polite requests by other users to register or otherwise identify himself have been rebuffed. That isn't helpful when the method of Wikipedia is to work to consensus. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 02:59, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm having a problem with the user AllTalking regarding the tagging of an image he uploaded. At the begining, he seemed to be acting in good faith, and just a little bit lost about image tagging in Wikipedia. But after he mentionned his willinnes to keep playing with the copyright tags "<i>forever</i>", I stepped out the case to ask for help here. The case is as follows:</p>
<p>The image was originaly marked as a {{<a href="../../../m/a/g/Template%7EMagazinecover_03ec.html" title="Template:Magazinecover">Magazinecover</a>}} (although it do not looks like a magazine cover) with no source information. Then I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:1930buttericke.jpg&amp;diff=67135979&amp;oldid=62648992" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:1930buttericke.jpg&amp;diff=67135979&amp;oldid=62648992" rel="nofollow">questioned the lack of source</a> (with {{<a href="../../../n/o/_/Template%7ENo_source_a38c.html" title="Template:No source">no source</a>}}) and user AllTalking added the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:1930buttericke.jpg&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=67135979" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:1930buttericke.jpg&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=67135979" rel="nofollow">information</a> that the image was "<i>Scanned from a Butterick catalog from 1930</i>" and used the deprecated {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairuse_cee7.html" title="Template:Fairuse">fairuse</a>}} tag, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:1930buttericke.jpg&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=67327271" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:1930buttericke.jpg&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=67327271" rel="nofollow">then</a> the {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFair_use_in_d68b.html" title="Template:Fair use in">fair use in</a>}} tag (poiting to <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930.html" title="1930">1930</a>, as it is the article where the image is used).</p>
<p>All the fair use image tags require "<i>all available copyright information</i>" and "<i>a detailed fair use rationale</i>", what was not present. So I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:1930buttericke.jpg&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=67327353" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:1930buttericke.jpg&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=67327353" rel="nofollow">marked</a> the image with {{<a href="../../../n/o/_/Template%7ENo_license_827d.html" title="Template:No license">no license</a>}}. Please, note that I had explained the issue in the <i>Edit Summary</i>". AllTalking then <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:1930buttericke.jpg&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=67335674" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:1930buttericke.jpg&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=67335674" rel="nofollow">changed his mind</a> and said the image was in public domain because it was published without a copyright notice "<i>as required by law</i>". He <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:1930buttericke.jpg&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=67337982" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:1930buttericke.jpg&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=67337982" rel="nofollow">then</a> used the also deprecated {{<a href="../../../p/d/_/Template%7EPD_b356.html" title="Template:PD">PD</a>}} tag. After that, he <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:1930buttericke.jpg&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=67338069" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:1930buttericke.jpg&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=67338069" rel="nofollow">combined this information</a> in the more appropriated {{<a href="../../../p/d/-/Template%7EPD-because_6699.html" title="Template:PD-because">PD-because</a>}} tag.</p>
<p>As the user's reasoning was not true, I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:1930buttericke.jpg&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=67339257" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:1930buttericke.jpg&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=67339257" rel="nofollow">reverted his editions</a> and explained his mistake in the "<i>Edit Summary</i>", even including a link to the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html#Copyright_notices" title="Copyright">paragraph</a> on the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">Copyright</a> article explaing why the reasoning was mistaken.</p>
<p>The user AllTalking then <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:1930buttericke.jpg&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=67344032" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:1930buttericke.jpg&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=67344032" rel="nofollow">added some info</a> on that the copyright may or may not belong to someone called "<i>Butterick</i>" and (correcly, I would say) marked it as {{<a href="../../../u/n/k/Template%7EUnknown_20cd.html" title="Template:Unknown">Unknown</a>}}. But then again he <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:1930buttericke.jpg&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=67373535" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:1930buttericke.jpg&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=67373535" rel="nofollow">changed his mind</a> and asserted the image was a {{<a href="../../../n/e/w/Template%7ENewspapercover_d7be.html" title="Template:Newspapercover">Newspapercover</a>}} (but it really doesn't look like one to me).</p>
<p>At this point, I noticed that maybe it was completely beyond AllTalking's capabilities to determine the image's real copyright status. Then I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:1930buttericke.jpg&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=67373895" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:1930buttericke.jpg&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=67373895" rel="nofollow">reverted his changes again</a> back to the original "<i>no source</i>" notice and begged him, in the <i>Edit Summary</i>, to "<i>avoid playng with the copyright tags</i>" if "<i>unsure of image origins and copyright status</i>".</p>
<p>AllTalking's only reply was to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:1930buttericke.jpg&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=67384381" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:1930buttericke.jpg&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=67384381" rel="nofollow">replace</a> the <i>No Source</i> notice with the deprecated {{<a href="../../../p/d/_/Template%7EPD_b356.html" title="Template:PD">PD</a>}} tag, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:1930buttericke.jpg&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=67420215" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:1930buttericke.jpg&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=67420215" rel="nofollow">replace</a> this one for the {{<a href="../../../p/d/-/Template%7EPD-ineligible_1151.html" title="Template:PD-ineligible">PD-ineligible</a>}} tag.</p>

<p>AllTalking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:1930buttericke.jpg&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=67450435" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:1930buttericke.jpg&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=67450435" rel="nofollow">insisted</a> on the {{<a href="../../../p/d/-/Template%7EPD-ineligible_1151.html" title="Template:PD-ineligible">PD-ineligible</a>}} tag, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:1930buttericke.jpg&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=67461380" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:1930buttericke.jpg&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=67461380" rel="nofollow">again</a> on the {{<a href="../../../n/e/w/Template%7ENewspapercover_d7be.html" title="Template:Newspapercover">Newspapercover</a>}} tag.</p>
<p>I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:1930buttericke.jpg&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=67471969" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:1930buttericke.jpg&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=67471969" rel="nofollow">explained</a> in the edit summary that (1) the image do not seems like a newspaper cover, (2) even if it was a newspaper cover, it couldn't be used the way it was being used (in the <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930s.html" title="1930s">1930s</a> article), and (3) that the image was being called both a Newspaper cover and a fashion catalog.</p>
<p>At this point, for the first time used the <i>Edit summary</i>, and decided to use that to make jokes. In his next three edits he made jokes about his willing to "<i>dance the whole night thru</i>" a "<i>NAUGHTY WALTZ</i>". In these editions, he managed to mark the image as {{<a href="../../../p/d/-/Template%7EPD-ineligible_1151.html" title="Template:PD-ineligible">PD-ineligible</a>}}, {{<a href="../../../p/d/-/Template%7EPD-Art_e4c5.html" title="Template:PD-Art">PD-Art</a>}} and even {{<a href="../../../p/d/-/Template%7EPD-self_86e2.html" title="Template:PD-self">PD-self</a>}} (what's an willing untruth).</p>
<p>At this point I gave up. Would someone have the williness to explain this user that such an beautifull image (yes, that's my opinion) may be removed from Wikipedia if he keeps avoiding to correctly tag it? --<a href="../../../a/b/u/User%7EAbu_badali_cd78.html" title="User:Abu badali">Abu Badali</a> 23:26, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I have blocked him for 24h for disruption.

Jbpo was not overly caustic for the most part, though perhaps uncivil at times.</p>
<p>Today, however, Jbpo posted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AEstate_tax_%28United_States%29&amp;diff=67541579&amp;oldid=67526242" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AEstate_tax_%28United_States%29&amp;diff=67541579&amp;oldid=67526242" rel="nofollow">these comments</a> to <a href="../../../e/s/t/Talk%7EEstate_tax_%28United_States%29_c03f.html" title="Talk:Estate tax (United States)">Talk:Estate tax (United States)</a>. In the comments, Jbpo is uncivil toward three other editors (myself included), then attacks me, (1) he/she implies that the other editors are all being illogical, or at least not using "adult logic skills", (2) Jbpo "congratulates" the editors who rephrased his/her additions to the article for making it "convoluted" and stating "If convolution is the key to harmony on Wikipedia, then I applaud the convultion", (3) Jbpo accuses me of a "disinformation campaign to make Wikipedia into his personal set of definitions", and (4) Jbpo says the following about me, "I think he has reached a point where his entries are disurptive and disinformative to the nature and goodwill of the editors of this and many other entries". Essentially all of these comments appear to violate <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> or <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>.</p>
<p>I understand that I'm supposed to warn Jbpo about this behavior, which <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jbpo&amp;oldid=67542543" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jbpo&amp;oldid=67542543" rel="nofollow">I did today</a>. In retaliation, Jbpo posted the same warning template <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jersyko&amp;curid=3968500&amp;diff=67552077&amp;oldid=66951827" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jersyko&amp;curid=3968500&amp;diff=67552077&amp;oldid=66951827" rel="nofollow">on my talk page</a>.</p>

<p>Jbpo and I do not see eye to eye on politics, it's fair for me to assume. However, I would never report someone here merely because I disagreed with a point they were attempting to argue in a logical, rational discussion on a talk page. Jbpo, through his/her persistent incvility and, now, personal attacks, has crossed the line from rational debate into unconstructive mudslinging. Because I am one of the only users, apparently, who have interacted regularly with Jbpo, I am posting this here instead of as a user conduct Rfc. Perhaps an administrator could asses the situation. · <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko"><font color="#013220">j·e·r·s·y·k·o</font></a> <i><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJersyko_3ca3.html" title="User talk:Jersyko"><font color="#465945" size="1">talk</font></a></i> · 01:57, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't see the incivility in the diff you provide from the Talk:Barack Obama page, but the Estate Tax diff is incivil. I'm not sure that I'd characterise them as personal attacks (which is the template you used on his talk page) but I can see why others might characterise it as such. If the real problem with this editor is that the sources they provide to avoid OR do not actually support the assertions made, then go ahead and gather the evidence carefully, and use it for an RFC or some such. my 2c. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete.Hurd_10f1.html" title="User:Pete.Hurd">Pete.Hurd</a> 02:42, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

May I ask, then, what you believe Jbpo to be communicating in the comment? It says "If you insist on claiming POV on any post not written in the style of a PR flak, go ahead", which I was not doing. Jbpo is mischaracterizing my position to make me sound like an extremist. I'd say that is incivil, wouldn't you?</dd>
<dd>Regarding attacks, may I ask how you interpret "I think he has reached a point where his entries are disurptive and disinformative to the nature and goodwill of the editors of this and many other entries" and accusing me of conducting a "disinformation campaign"? Even if these aren't personal attacks, and I believe they are, they are quite incivil at the very least.

<dd>I don't think that all criticism qualifies as a personal attack in the sense of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>. Note that "Calling someone a liar, or accusing him/her of slander or libel." is an example of a <i>petty</i> WP:CIVIL violation, not a <i>serious</i> WP:CIVIL violation, and not a WP:NPA violation. You &amp; Jbpo are having an disagreement, and it could, and should, be conducted with more civility, but I don't see anything that clearly has crossed the lime of WP:NPA. FWIW, I consider the accusation made against Jbpo that he misrepresents his sources to be a serious accusation. If I were you, and I could back it up, that's what I would go with.

<p><a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonsterOfTheLake_adfa.html" title="User:MonsterOfTheLake">User:MonsterOfTheLake</a> continues to blank his talk page (see <a href="../../../m/o/n/User_talk%7EMonsterOfTheLake_1833.html" title="User talk:MonsterOfTheLake">User talk:MonsterOfTheLake</a>) even after I showed him a Wikipedia message explicitly stating not to blank talk pages.</p>
<p>The dispute exists out of a personal argument over the article <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkification.html" title="Turkification">Turkification</a>. He blocked me on AIM - I listed him here for vote stuffing and listed the chat conversation (with his username), but removed it after I was told it was in bad form to post it.

<dd>I will not post the chat again. This is what happened: MOTL IM'ed me and asked me for help - he wanted me to vote "yes" to delete "Turkification" - He first asked me to vote in the article - I voted to keep the article - then he specifically told me to vote "yes" after I said "YES" on the chat - He and I debated. Then he asked me I voted yes when he told me not to, I said that I did, but I can reconsider. He blocked me from AIM.</dd>

<p>I then contacted him on his talk page, (see edit history <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MonsterOfTheLake&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MonsterOfTheLake&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[164]</a> ) - I first posted just to explain what we (the community) were going to do with the article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MonsterOfTheLake&amp;diff=66286929&amp;oldid=66285881" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MonsterOfTheLake&amp;diff=66286929&amp;oldid=66285881" rel="nofollow">[165]</a> - He removed my message and responded "Don't add messages. You're not invited to post in this talk page."</p>
<p>While talking on Wikipedia's IRC channel I was told that "vote stacking" is to be frowned upon, so I posted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MonsterOfTheLake&amp;diff=66294295&amp;oldid=66286929" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MonsterOfTheLake&amp;diff=66294295&amp;oldid=66286929" rel="nofollow">[166]</a> - A threat to put him on RFC, but I offered not to if I was unblocked. He responded: "Don't add messages to my talk page. Note to WhisperToMe: Who are you? I don't know you, nor did I ask you for in anything (who ARE you??). Piss off please." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MonsterOfTheLake&amp;diff=66294651&amp;oldid=66294295" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MonsterOfTheLake&amp;diff=66294651&amp;oldid=66294295" rel="nofollow">[167]</a> I responded that I was who I was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MonsterOfTheLake&amp;diff=66294837&amp;oldid=66294651" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MonsterOfTheLake&amp;diff=66294837&amp;oldid=66294651" rel="nofollow">[168]</a> He responded "--DO NOT ADD MESSAGES HERE-- I don't know who you are. Stop BSing my talk page please.)"</p>
<p>I found that I couldn't list him on RFC, so I opted to put him on the noticeboard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MonsterOfTheLake&amp;diff=66296814&amp;oldid=66295013" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MonsterOfTheLake&amp;diff=66296814&amp;oldid=66295013" rel="nofollow">[169]</a> - There I posted the full chat log. I notified him of what I did. He replied that the chat log was fake and asked how I got hold of his username. User:RJN reverted his blanking, and he reverted back. I removed the chat log after I learned on IRC that it was in bad form. The Notice was archived. I talked on IRC and learned that blanking user talk pages is bad, so I responded that he wasn't supposed to blank userpages. He kept reverting my edits and edits of other Wikipedians (i.e. reverting of blanks) - I know why now: he thinks that userpages and user talk pages fall under the same rules. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhisperToMe_201b.html" title="User:WhisperToMe">WhisperToMe</a> 04:50, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Considering the chat-log incident, I'd say he is entitled to blank his talk page. There's no rule against blanking, except for admin notices.

<p>Zanimum appears to have speedily deleted this image because of <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott">User:Netscott</a>’s insistence that it lacks a source and cannot be considered public domain, which is something of a stretch given the description on the image page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:IMG_3006_crop.jpg&amp;oldid=67555636" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:IMG_3006_crop.jpg&amp;oldid=67555636" rel="nofollow">as originally uploaded</a>.

<dd>I'll leave this final word and then leave WP:ANI to its business (this isn't a place for discussion). You uploaded the image originally citing the source as "My friend" then when pressed it became "my friend Clare", and when further pressed it became "My friend Clare K." ... with such a pattern of edits the true status (public domain or not) of this image is highly questionable. With no such details, no one can possibly <i>independently</i> verify the status of the original image you cropped as being in the public domain.

<li>Geez, that was a long time ago, took me a minute to remember. I could see making an exception for a longstanding contributor who was having a bit of fun (though I seem to remember giving him a 17 second symbolic block <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=Jimbo+Wales&amp;page=User%3ABoothy443" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=Jimbo+Wales&amp;page=User%3ABoothy443" rel="nofollow"><i>a la Jimbo</i></a> to remind him to avoid such things), but I don't think this really falls under the standard of giving an exception.

<p>The Polish stalker is back after me, persecuting me and revert warring on dozens articles using scores of IPs.

<dd>I might as well be a Vietnamese expat. I invite any admin to look at my contributions and judge them fairly, such as alphabetical orders, language tweaks, etc. Today's harvest: 83.5.221.19 07:52, 4 August 2006 (UTC) P.S. I am setting up an account to knock the sockpuppet argument out, having attained veteran IP status. I would ask that a neutral admin (Mikka&#160;;))judge this "persecution". P.S.S. You might want to tone down the sterotyping and racial inflammatory remarks. Regards.</dd>

<dd>Your talk is cheap. Even if you set another account like <a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReichenbach_0794.html" title="User:Reichenbach">User:Reichenbach</a>, it wouldn't change your ways of scanning my contributions and reverting arbitrarily every other one. That's what is called disruption and stalking here. Although all the IPs that you abuse are based in Warsaw, I don't rush to conclude that the Poles continue their crusade aimed at ousting me from editing Wikipedia, although that's what it looks like. If you think that the Poles are a different race from Russians and that my complaint at your stalking and inexplicable revert warring is "racial inflammatory", I congratulate you with it. --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#FC4339">Ghirla</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#C98726">-трёп-</font></a></sup> 07:59, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The discussion page for Matrixism has been protected and can only be accessed by administrators. I can understand why someone might want to protect the Matrixism entry itself but to protect the discussion page seems to be very much against the spirit of Wikipedia.

<dd>His user page says, <i>"A lot of these "activists" are "Administrators" on Wikipedia and if following the orders of the Israeli Gov't will collude to ban and intimidate you, despite how it affects Wikipedia."</i> I think I'm supposed to suggest that someone on good terms with him ask nicely that he rephrase that. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 23:48, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Moshe, let's review one of your edit messages: "...you have shown nothing but contempt for good faith, civility, and indeed reason and common sense, I implore you to begin reading wikipedia policy before you make even one more contribution as you have become a literal nightmare to deal with.- User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg | Talk 04:40, 1 August 2006 (UTC)"</p>
<p>A violation of basically every rule you just accused me of breaking. Basically most of the people upset over the controversy are extremist Israelis upset to see me having adding human rights violations to a Human Rights article. On here are a lot of people bent out of shape about a controversial operation by the Israeli gov't and my opinion on its implications for Wikipedia. Rather than coming to terms with their own inner conflicts on the matter, I am labeled anti-Israeli and a bunch of other horrible things. Meanwhile this group is planning on how to best censor the information. Were any people singled out for personal name calling and ridicule? Of course not&#160;:-) There are no personal attacks, but some must go on a fishing expedition for guidelines in order to justify the deletion of information that they wish didn't exist. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarastro777_95c7.html" title="User:Sarastro777">Sarastro777</a> 04:22, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
