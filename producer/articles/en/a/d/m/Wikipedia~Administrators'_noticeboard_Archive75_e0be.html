<p>I've started a <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdminship_survey_ad61.html" title="Wikipedia:Adminship survey">survey</a> on adminship and its procedures, to find out if a substantial majority of editors believe that certain changes should be made to our procedure or precedent.

<p>The tools we use for counter vandalism have improved in leaps and bounds; and its been key to maintaining Wikipedia stability. However, I've found even with these tools blatant vandalism is getting by our overworked first responders. I stopped going counter-vandalism a while back as real life got in the way and new admins and tools seemed to be doing the job.</p>
<p>But recently I've been running <a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenna_VF_58a0.html#3.3" title="User:Henna/VF">VF 3.3</a> in the background while I browse Wikipedia then scroll through the backlog about once every hour or two. Now while there isn't a lot of vandalism to clean up; there is a significant amount of blatant vandalism I still come across like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:71.98.28.241&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=108521613" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:71.98.28.241&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=108521613" rel="nofollow">this</a> which took almost an hour to be reverted.</p>
<p>So I'd like to recruit and get a little help recruiting people to effectively use this passive tool so that we can catch this blatant stuff that slips by. I suppose a mini tutorial would help for new and experienced users alike not familiar to VF:</p>
<ul>
<li>English VF 3.3 download <a href="http://hekla.rave.org/vf/3.3/vf33-English.jar" class="external text" title="http://hekla.rave.org/vf/3.3/vf33-English.jar" rel="nofollow">here</a></li>
<li>Run file and click Connect button, ideally run VF and browser in windows next to each (overlapping) to easily switch back and forth</li>
<li>Go to configuration tab and ensure "Automatically remove old edits..." and "Show only IP edits." are enabled.</li>
<li>Change the color scheme so that it makes sense to you and draws your eye to suspicious edits, while not tiring your eyes. (I recommend a dull color like gray for normal IP edits)</li>
<li>Hopefully you have a tabbed browser, which will make opening/closing multiple pages easier</li>
<li>Then go to Live RC tab and rearrange the columns so that you can see article, editor, +/-, summary together</li>
<li>Begin looking for Admins and others (by looking for reversion edit summaries) and adding them to your whitelist (by clicking on Wlist column) so that you can focus on anon edits</li>
<li>Begin looking for vandalism, clues include: [[WP:AES| (which means there was a blank edit summary), large +/- numbers, especially for sub-sections (big changes in the article), bold edits (which are highrisk edits)</li>
<li>When you reach the bottom of the list click "clear list" button and distract yourself with real life for a while as a backlog builds and do it all again! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">RoyBoy</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RoyBoy_db71.html" title="Special:Contributions/RoyBoy">contribs</a>) 04:38, 16 February 2007 (UTC).</small></li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully we can improve and organize our 2nd-tier Counter-Vandalism response. Feedback welcome, and if I should improve/post this elsewhere. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 04:12, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Yes, because this is an invalid slippery slope argument, and you know it&#160;;) It's actually not so much the merger that I like, but the far more appropriate terminology. You will no longer have to explain to people why they can't "verify" something by their own analysis. In short, the main benefit here is that we avoids the oxymoron "verifiable, not truth", which is a source of much confusion, IMO. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzul_467c.html" title="User:Merzul">Merzul</a> 05:06, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, it changes absolutely nothing wrt current policy, but I do think attribution is a better word. This will not have any impact for any of our experienced contributors, but it will help new editors understand "verifiability" better. To make it very clear, in terms of life on Wikipedia for our main projects, I promise that nothing will change due to this policy. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzul_467c.html" title="User:Merzul">Merzul</a> 05:45, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for the report. Hopefully the warnings you've left will be sufficient. Please update us if the situation continues/worsens. Having said that, I've seen serious legal threat problem situations, and I don't think this is one in which we need to warn the Office to expect papers.&#160;:) Regards, <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 16:04, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

He has been banned from both Polish and German wikipedias (sometimes known as Aserafin, Bserafin, Cserafin), further indication that his actions are not likely to contribute anything to the English wikipedia. if that wasn't enough of a smoking gun, I would like to direct you to a talk that took place between him and another polish-speaking editor, <a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilip_Gronowski_f606.html" title="User talk:Philip Gronowski">User_talk:Philip_Gronowski</a>.

Can someone please block all his sockpuppets to allow the normal editors with good intentions to continue on wikipedia. and if he uses another anon IP, perhaps semi-protect the pages he has been seen to frequent.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../d/i/s/Category%7EDisputed_fair_use_images_c75c.html" title="Category:Disputed fair use images">Category:Disputed fair use images</a> is terribly backlogged. There are many images in there that have been tagged for many months and never taken action on.</p>
<p>I've done a first step to try to bring that category more in line with the process outlined at WP:CSD. I added instructions to {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFair_use_disputed_0413.html" title="Template:Fair use disputed">Fair use disputed</a>}} telling taggers to give the proper notice to uploaders (as required by CSD I7), and to use {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-badfairuse_643d.html" title="Template:Db-badfairuse">db-badfairuse</a>}} if the issue has not been resolved after the waiting period. I also created the user-talk notification template to go with it, {{<a href="../../../n/o/_/Template%7ENo_fair_5637.html" title="Template:No fair">No fair</a>}}. However, to reduce the process overhead, my preferred solution would really be to bring the whole thing in line with the process of {{<a href="../../../n/r/d/Template%7ENrd_af95.html" title="Template:Nrd">nrd</a>}} ("no rationale") and {{<a href="../../../r/f/u/Template%7ERfud_0ffd.html" title="Template:Rfud">rfud</a>}} ("replaceable"), i.e. create a dated category queue that leads automatically into <a href="../../../c/s/d/CAT%7ECSD_4339.html" title="CAT:CSD">CAT:CSD</a>. Right now, to get an image deleted if it is a clearly invalid fair use, i.e. a plain copyvio, is paradoxically more difficult and more work than getting an image deleted that is perfectly legal but just "replaceable" for the sake of our free-content ideals. It shouldn't be like that.

<dd>Sure thing. Trying to figure out who the stalker is on that page would be rather difficult. A number of point of view pushers got really upset that I wouldn't let them fill the article with unsourced opinion and agenda, and of course the user who's off-topic comment I removed got quite riled up as well. If I didn't communicate with IPs so often I'd ask to have my page semi-protected (as I've seen it done on occasion) but get the odd legitimate question from an IP on my talk page so I wouldn't want to lock them out.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 06:44, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My first step is usually discussion with the blocking admin -- sometimes they'll know something I don't, or there were sockpuppets/deleted edits/some other skeleton in the closet. If that doesn't yield anything fruitful, I see if they'd be willing to see the block reduced or lifted. If the two of us can't reach some sort of agreement, then bring it to the community for a larger discussion -- AN, AN/I, maybe CN now that we have another. Something like that, anyway; there's no set rules, and some people do come directly to the noticeboards. – <span style="font-family: Garamond"><a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELuna_Santin_1cab.html" title="User:Luna Santin"><font color="#1E90FF"><b>Luna Santin</b></font></a> (<a href="../../../l/u/n/User_talk%7ELuna_Santin_c747.html" title="User talk:Luna Santin">talk</a>)</span> 20:02, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>Instead of individual admins blocking accounts that have bad usernames, why doesn't Wikipedia just modify the software so that names that contain certain key words (e.g. fuck, shit) can't be created in the first place? That would save the admins a lot of time.--71.155.168.90 20:59, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Because software can't make a judgment call - many real, proper names across the world happen to have "shit" buried in the middle of them.

I've looked at the user creation log occasionally, and out of, say, 100 names, I've never seen more than 2 that were inappropriate, and more often 0.

<dd>I agree. The user was told on his talk page. This story has been mentioned on half-a-dozen blogs, and *all* have since referred to Staines legal threats and taken them down, so I think the anon's claims that he's just referring to a 1986 Guardian article innocently (and 1986 Guardian articles are not exactly something you'd just stumble on - it's only been mentioned on these blogs (and copied from one to another, and each now accompanied by legal threats)). <a href="../../../n/s/s/User%7ENssdfdsfds_5480.html" title="User:Nssdfdsfds">Nssdfdsfds</a> 13:23, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>An admin has been closing AfDs with different standards for deletion than some others expect. While specific instances can be taken to DRV (having been raised with him first), the issue is perhaps that there is lack of shared understanding as to what "rough consensus" might mean. <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_guidelines_for_administrators_a507.html#Rough_consensus" title="Wikipedia:Deletion guidelines for administrators">Wikipedia:Deletion guidelines for administrators#Rough consensus</a> perhaps gives insufficient guidance. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">Wikipedia:Consensus</a> states <i>the numbers mentioned as being sufficient to reach supermajority vary from about 60% to over 80% depending upon the decision</i>. <a href="../../../s/u/p/Wikipedia%7ESupermajority_264c.html" title="Wikipedia:Supermajority">Wikipedia:Supermajority</a> - a rejected policy but perhaps the content is useful because it reflects past decisions, states consensus is <i>two-thirds or larger majority support for Wikipedia:Articles for deletion (WP:AFD)</i>.

<dd>Please let us know what AFDs you are talking about.

<dd>When I get a moment I will post at DRV so specific merits of the case can be considered. My point in raising here is have I missed something - the standard for consensus was 75% - translated as the range 60-80%, 56% seems too far outside that standard notwithstanding the merits of the argument. If it is to do with the merits of the argument beyond numbers providing consensus then surely the closing admin should comment to that effect - he didn't, not even when asked politely on his talk page, from which I conclude a different standard applies. Is that standard agreed?--<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolden_Wattle_e28c.html" title="User:Golden Wattle">Golden Wattle</a> <sup><a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGolden_Wattle_52fc.html" title="User talk:Golden Wattle">talk</a></sup> 22:38, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It is impossible to give you a straight answer without knowing what AFD you are talking about. AFD is not a vote. If we have 50% of people in an AFD discussion arguing for deletion because the article violates all kinds of policies, and 50% arguing for it to be kept because "it is awesome", it will be deleted. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a>&#160;<a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></a> 23:11, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Surely, if the article "violates all kinds of policies" or there is some other reason for ignoring the numbers, the closing admin should specify that, not say merely, "The result was delete." and refuse to comment <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sir_Nicholas_de_Mimsy-Porpington&amp;diff=108285006&amp;oldid=108192145" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sir_Nicholas_de_Mimsy-Porpington&amp;diff=108285006&amp;oldid=108192145" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> when queried politely as to the rationale for his decision.

<dd>The deletion guideline for admins states quite clearly rough concensus should be achieved - closing AfD is not on the whim of an admin. Rough concensus is a numerical figure unless there are other factors taken into account - that figure has been expressed previously as 75% for AfD or at least in the range of 60-80%. I think admins are accountable beyond mere courtesy to explain their decisions when they are not obvious as per the guidelines -ie when they are ignoring the numbers and considering the weight of arguments. Is that not a shared view? That is the issue I am exploring here - not so much making a complaint. My complaint has been made at DRV where it belonged.--<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolden_Wattle_e28c.html" title="User:Golden Wattle">Golden Wattle</a> <sup><a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGolden_Wattle_52fc.html" title="User talk:Golden Wattle">talk</a></sup> 04:45, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Closing an AFD (or other) discussion often does require a significant amount of judgement, and numerical vote counting is certainly not required and is in fact <i>discouraged</i>. However, I do agree that the closing admin should explain his decisions, especially if queried. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small>2007-02-16 05:43Z</small></i></span>

<dd>I have no difficulty with reaching a conclusion that is not number driven, my difficulty is with the lack of explanation of that decision, including after querying. DRV does not incidentally provide the form of review necessary - <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_Log_2007_February_15_adbd.html#List_of_people_who_became_famous_only_in_death" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review/Log/2007 February 15">the DRV debate</a> for the article which drew my attention to the differing standard or lack of explanation (whichever I can't be sure since the closing admin won't reveal his reasoning, illustrates that DRV does not provide accountability, the closing admin hasn't contributed his raationale there and it is a review but not of the decision making because it can't because the rationale for the decision has not been provided (maniacal laugh). Some of that debate focuses on the issue that consensus isn't about numbers. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">Wikipedia:Consensus</a> is policy and does actually mention numbers - therefore to ignore the numbers, surely you have to explain yourself.--<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolden_Wattle_e28c.html" title="User:Golden Wattle">Golden Wattle</a> <sup><a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGolden_Wattle_52fc.html" title="User talk:Golden Wattle">talk</a></sup> 09:52, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I wouldn't push the "WP:Consensus lists numerical thresholds" point; it won't help you because anyone that has experience with AFD discussions knows that&#160;!vote percentages often don't mean anything (much more so than at RFA), and in fact hurts your cause because it's too easy to refute. I think your main concern here is the lack of explanation when asked. DRV may be the right forum in theory, but in practice, I have often seen participants of DRV say "keep deleted" if they agree with deletion, without considering whether proper procedure was followed. Refusal to explain admin actions is really a conduct issue and the forum for that would be <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a>. However, if this is an isolated incident, I would let it go, since admins do have discretion in closing AFD discussions.

<dd>I was thinking more in terms of the bot looking at one version of the page for each day, and picking up the case names from the headers, just to show what cases were open at that moment. Then the scanned headers could be alphabetized with a link to the version it came from. It would miss the exact moment the case was removed from the page, but would make it easier to find cases nonetheless. If someone doesn't remember the date that a case was filed, just having the date is good; as is being able to check the index to see if a user or an article has been the subject of a proposed case before. <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_Signature13_6820.html" title="User:NoSeptember/Signature13"><font color="green"><b>NoSeptember</b></font></a> 13:25, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, that could work. Recovering the full history will mean at least couple of hundred lookups but it won't have to be done often. Once that's done, it might be useful to use binary split to find the very last version of each case, but first things first. Good idea.

<p>Who'd have thought that a short, innocuous essay on measures by which Wikipedia could be considered to be failing would cause so much ill feeling? First people tried to re-write it so that it said Wikipedia was succeeding. I got blocked for trying to prevent them from doing that. Then the bowdlerised version got moved to my user space while I was blocked. Now <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">User:JzG</a> has deleted the link from the original location to the present location. Not only that but he's also protected it to prevent recreation.</p>
<p>Given that the essay was linked from slashdot, it seems not unreasonable to provide a redirect so that people wanting to see what was written can do so. In addition, JzG has stated that cross-namespace redirects must be deleted. However, <a href="../../../r/f/d/WP%7ERfD_9250.html" title="WP:RfD">WP:RfD</a> clearly states that 'a cross-space redirect <b>out of article space'</b> is deletable, not just any redirect that an admin decides they don't like.</p>

<dd>I see no reason why Wikipedia needs to host demolition job essays on itself. We're not a soapbox. There's plenty other sites that will only to happily host this for you. Plus, essays in project space are actually improperly so called, they are corporate works that are open to ammendment. So people are entitled to change it to whatever. So, even if it was allowed, it will not be the essay slashdot featured - but something else.

<p>Worldtraveller has done tremendous good for Wikipedia, with all his featured article writing and other efforts. His input and thoughts should be welcome, even if they are critical. We should be able to accept criticism and have discussions on how to make Wikipedia better. I think the focus on where the essay should be detracts from more constructive discussion. I'm also not interested so much on specific metrics used to judge whether an article is "good" or whatever. My main concern is about the rise in (seemingly so) in vandalism, tendentious editing, harassment, and other things that (1) make the editing environment less comfortable (2) less productive, as I'm increasingly sidetracked to deal with administrative tasks and maintaining articles.

<p>The reaction to this article probably did more to prove Worldtraveller's point than an evening of RC patrol would have done. On a good day, I may have a total of an hour to work on WP. Most of that time is taken up checking my watchlist and reverting stupid edits in those articles - and not a one of the articles on my watchlist is anywhere near as good as the ones Worldtraveller is associated with. <a href="../../../r/i/s/User%7ERisker_ce88.html" title="User:Risker">Risker</a> 00:39, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I read this when it was first linked from Slashdot, and I'm surprised to see so much angst about it. It seemed like a reasonable examination of some things the principle writer was interested in, and it just didn't seem all that controversial. I don't remember seeing anything I haven't heard others say. It seems like a more useful response would be to let the guy have his say, and then write and link to an essay of your own, <i>Why Wikipedia is Succeeding Brilliantly</i>.

<p>Anybody who is more concerned with the essay than with the reaction to it is missing the big picture. We should <i>encourage</i> this type of analysis and critique. The ability to look critically at the project is the exact thing that is needed if the title of the essay is to be proved false.

<dd><a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_failing_1d6d.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is failing">Wikipedia:Wikipedia is failing</a> was created as an essay. It was linked from Slashdot. It contained numerous points that were contested. The originator was unwilling to allow any edits to it, resulting in a lame edit war. It was userfied. I deleted the redirect as a cross-namespace redirect and because you don't get to take your ball home if someone points out you're getting the rules wrong. I suggest it stays that way. We really do not need people setting up essays, flatly refusing to allow them to be edited,. getting them on Slashdot, and then asserting ownership (by whatever means). Links back to the essay from Project space give all the coverage and publicity but without the "owner" allowing the Wikipedia community to challenge the assertions in any way, which is fundamentally against the Wikipedia ethos. <i>Fundamentally</i> against. Either it's an essay in project space and gets edited mercilessly to fix the problems which numeorus editors pointed out with is basis, or it is a user page in user space. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> MySpace, you don't get to have <i>your</i> say as the <i>only</i> authoritative version.

<dd><i>allowing the Wikipedia community to challenge the assertions</i><br />
I think you are misunderstanding the purpose of an essay. An essay is to present a <i>point of view</i>. An essay doesn't need to and in fact really shouldn't try to present all points of view. I haven't looked at the history, but if the attempts to <i>challenge the assertions</i> were for the purpose of trying to correct factual errors, then you have a point. If the purpose of the challenges was to present an alternate point of view, then you don't. —<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Bell_8398.html" title="User:Doug Bell">Doug&#160;Bell</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoug_Bell_81b5.html" title="User talk:Doug Bell">talk</a></sup> 20:53, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The 'ownership' stuff is bullshit. Everyone's happy to trumpet all this 'this is a wiki, anyone can change anything', but you all implicitly assume that <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillowW_a94c.html" title="User:WillowW">User:WillowW</a>'s altering of the essay so that it concluded that Wikipedia is succeeding was backed by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">Consensus</a>. You seem to not get that obviously, the only consensus view is that 'Wikipedia might have problems and it might not', and altering an essay so it says that is hardly useful work. Some rather more sensible people were challenging the assertions of the essay, not by removing all critical material, but by <b>discussing on the talk page</b>. That's really quite a useful thing. JzG appears to not want any discussion of a critical position to happen.</p>
<p>If someone edits <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolution</a> so that it's actually all about <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">creationism</a>, and someone else repeatedly reverts back, are they asserting ownership? <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 10:58, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I strongly believe Guy is wiki-lawyering to find any available excuse to cover from public view a widely publicized analysis of the state of Wikipedia. The soft redirect page linked to the original essay, as well as the rebuttal; how more balanced could the situation be? The talk page for the original article contains a wide variety of extremely useful discussion about the current issues with the Wikipedia model and what should be done to fix them. The censoring of the article and its associated discussion is intolerable, and if it continues it clearly indicates that wikipedia has already failed and it's community has come under the control of a <a href="../../../t/o/t/Totalitarian.html" title="Totalitarian">totalitarian</a> regime.

<dd>This is so disgusting that JzG is wikilawyering over the redirect page. Not only was the essay by Worldtraveller linked there, but so were several other opposing and "rebuttal" essays. Honestly, I have no clue where those rebuttal essays are now and can't find 'em. You are depriving me to be able to read those, in addition to scores of people coming in from bookmarks and external links into Wikipedia from reading the essay by Worldtraveller.

<dd>I understand Guy's point about ownership. I'm not saying that's what happened, because I wasn't involved in the editing, but it is a legitimate concern. I don't think Guy is wikilawyering or trying to cover up anything. At the same time, I don't expect essays to be individually balanced, but to balance out in the aggregate by other essays from other points of view. Everyone can edit it, of course, but rather than completely change the direction of the essay it would be better to write another essay elsewhere. I mean I could in theory go edit <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_climbing_the_Reichstag_dressed_as_Spider-Man_5db1.html" title="Wikipedia:No climbing the Reichstag dressed as Spider-Man">Wikipedia:No climbing the Reichstag dressed as Spider-Man</a> to be instead about Superman's obligation to save the world, but I would do better to write about that under a different title. I thought the disambiguation page was useful. Would linking to a particular version of the essay be helpful? Restore the page, and add a note at the top, "This version [link] was linked from Slashdot on Wednesday" or something? Of course someone could host it off-site, but I'm not sure that's the best outcome for Wikipedia. Let me say too that for someone from outside going to read about how 'Wikipedia is failing', it looks bad to get <i>This page has been deleted, and protected to prevent re-creation.</i> I don't think that's the best option for the long term. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 13:45, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Tom, thanks - and don't get me wrong, I don't think the essay has to be balanced or anything, we're pretty clear about essays being held to a lower standard of neutrality than other content, I just don't see how we can allow one editor to assert absolute ownership. Aude, I don't <i>want</i> to fork it, I want the original back and being edited. If Worldtraveller is content to allow the thing to be edited, and accept that some of the original critiques may be contextualised or explained, then I have no problem at all. For me, the best result is to have the essay back in project space and being edited. Sure, from time to time someone might "subvert" it, but we can deal with that in the usual way. It's not like we've never been there before. This is absolutely not about Wikilawyering, it's about <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/a/WP%7ESOAP_5cc8.html" title="WP:SOAP">WP:SOAP</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a free webhost and a whole lot of other things that get violated as soon as we allow people to start insisting on <i>their</i> version of something. It's a route down which I think many of us would rather not start. So: let's have the essay back and editable (and edited), by all means. Anyone who wants to do that is more than welcome. But please <i>please</i> let's not have any more of this disgruntled "here's the version I think was right" stuff, it's not the way Wikipedia is supposed to work. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 13:59, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Title is not especially important, it's a critique and the fact that we still have 1.6 million articles and are a top-ten website (more or less) says everything you need to know to balance it out. We all know that mathematically speaking bumble bees can't fly, and it's not like this is the first time we've been told Wikipedia can't possibly work is it? <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 14:12, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Okay; can we restore the essay and edit it normally? My first edit would be to add a link to the version that people saw from Slashdot, and any <i>See also</i> links that aren't already there. I'd like to hear from Sir Nicholas before I undo his protection, but I'd like to have something informative up again as soon as we can. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 14:07, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yup, no problem whatsoever with that, I've just done it, but linking to the Slashdotted version? No thanks. This is a Wiki, if something is broken we fix it without pointing to the broken version. Not that there's a lot broken about this, but we don't need to have ownership issues and silly "yeah, but I said it better" disputes. Just edit the thing, and if it gets subverted then some of us who agree with the original can edit it back.

<dd>I have suggested that the name be changed to "How Wikipedia can be better". That essay is simply making up criteria for success and applying it, nowhere in the mandate of Wikipedia are any of his criticisms mentioned. I could say the Apollo mission failed because they didn't go to Mars, but it carries no weight because that was not their mandate for success. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 14:25, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I think that the essay as it stands should redirect to a copy of the original in userspace. Obviously, nothing is owned on Wikipedia, but an essay in userspace should not be altered by other users. After all, because the essay is a part of the user's domain, it would be assumed that the content has been written by that user (unless it's a talk page, obviously, or a misc placeholder page). <b><a href="../../../2E/v/2E/User%7E.V._5c4f.html" title="User:.V."><span style="color:purple">.</span><span style="color:green">V</span><span style="color:purple">.</span></a></b> <sub>[</sub><sub><a href="../../../2E/v/2E/User_talk%7E.V._d46b.html" title="User talk:.V.">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_.V._ddc5.html" title="Special:Emailuser/.V.">Email</a>]</sub> 14:51, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You are correct, however, if an essay is edited in a userspace, the outside editor should mark his changes clearly on the essay (unless it fits consensus.) Not doing so would be akin to changing someone's "About Me" section; while nobody owns that section, it's still bad form to misrepresent someone's work... and chances are, things in userspace are likely to be attributed to the user unless explicitly said otherwise. <b><a href="../../../2E/v/2E/User%7E.V._5c4f.html" title="User:.V."><span style="color:purple">.</span><span style="color:green">V</span><span style="color:purple">.</span></a></b> <sub>[</sub><sub><a href="../../../2E/v/2E/User_talk%7E.V._d46b.html" title="User talk:.V.">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_.V._ddc5.html" title="Special:Emailuser/.V.">Email</a>]</sub> 11:25, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

He is creating quite a bit of content that isn't of very good quality and he seems to have something of a problem with formatting his articles, as well as what constitutes acceptable external links and sources for a biographical article.

<dd>The problem is that I don't think the <a href="../../../c/e/n/Censure.html" title="Censure">Censure</a> edit was meant to be vandalism, he just doesn't seem to understand the concept of what a good sourced edit is as opposed to opinion or rumor, even after the concept has been explained to him.

<p>I'm rather afraid that I need to give an apology to all concerned that surrounds myself sending a whole raft of messages to people who had already contributed to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_media_personalities_who_have_vandalised_Wikipedia_1cf9.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of media personalities who have vandalised Wikipedia">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of media personalities who have vandalised Wikipedia</a>. For those who aren't aware of it, I was pretty annoyed that a very clear AFD had already been held and a clear consensus to keep the article was made. The article was kept. However, it was then (IMO, pretty reasonably) moved to the Wikipedia namespace. However, it was then soon added to MFD. This really got on my goat (as has other similar AFDs) as I really saw this as deleting the article through stealth. I argued quite strenuously against those who wanted it deleted and who referred to things like <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a>, etc. as I felt that this was unfair and missing the point. I don't apologise for that, as I didn't personally attack anyone, though I did message on person to ask a question and they found this to be somewhat confrontational.</p>
<p>However, where I did go wrong was to send a message to all the people who added a keep to the discussion informing them of the new MFD. I also erred in calling it a "vote". Several people found this to be unacceptable, and yes, it was. After reflecting on my actions for some time, I would therefore like to apologise to the community at large for violating <a href="../../../c/a/m/WP%7ECAMPAIGN_9407.html" title="WP:CAMPAIGN">WP:CAMPAIGN</a>. It was wrong to do, and I should have known better. Should anyone wish to apply some sort of decision against me, I would appreciate it if they could first take it through ArbCom. I will certainly not dispute the facts, and in fact I will take any punishment that they deem necessary without protest.</p>
<p>I should note that this isn't a particularly easy thing for me to admit to, as I really felt at the time that I had no recourse but to send messages to these people. Something I now see wasn't particularly wise. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 05:34, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I believe I'm being stalked by a user who is possibly using his IP account to avoid being blocked.

<p>After a couple of user talk exchanges, I received <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mosmof&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=108537761" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mosmof&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=108537761" rel="nofollow">this message</a> from <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.184.177.78_086e.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.184.177.78">24.184.177.78</a>, titled "Loser alert".

<p>Oy vey. While I am no fan of the Brian Peppers article, it's <i>extremely</i> conclusive that an encyclopedic article about a sex offender with a congenital defect is automatically an attack article. Many people will tell you that Dick Cheney only cares about money; does that make <i>his</i> article an attack page? What about Joseph Stalin? Because he locked people up in Gulabs, that makes <i>his</i> article an attack article?

<dl>
<dd>No, it's conclusive that all the people interested in creating such an article wish to do so in order to create what would be an attack page, and that the person is not sufficiently notable for Wikipedia and that any possible notability would derive directly from online attacks against the person. Cheney and Stalin are both historically important personages for which there is a superabundance of reliable source material, because historians, authors, etc. write about them as having a major effect on the world. There is almost no reliable source material about Brian Peppers, and the only reason anyone would wish to create an article about him is because some people online amuse themselves with his physical deformity. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 16:52, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Very good. Anyways, I read the latest version of the Brian Peppers article before its deletion, and it didn't seem like an attack to me. Now, if this article had reliable source, we would maintain encyclopedicness and revert attempts at transforming it into an attack article.

<dd>I have to agree with MessedRocker. We don't have pages about non-notable people full stop, regardless of whether it is an attack page; similarly we don't delete articles about notable people because they are liable to vandalism. Although I'm not <i>au fait</i> with all the background to this, the fact Jimbo set an end date implies that the presence of this article is still open to debate. I think there should be a pre-emptive AfD (if that makes sense), where standard concerns about verifability and notability will be raised and considered. Then, on the consensus of that, we decide what to do with the page. But this should be about whether the subject deserves its own page, and attempt to avoid the trolling issues. (And in response to Centrx, this is why this article needs due consideration in the appropriate forum.) <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 17:01, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Question: Do we consider the snopes article a reliable source? If yes, I believe that an article can be made that is not an attack and asserts notability. If not, then it cannot. <a href="http://www.esorn.ag.state.oh.us/Secured/p23.aspx?oid=13753" class="external text" title="http://www.esorn.ag.state.oh.us/Secured/p23.aspx?oid=13753" rel="nofollow">Here is obviously a reliable source</a> but that site cannot verify much, only basic details that verify he is a sex offender. <a href="http://commissioners.co.lucas.oh.us/ClerkDockets/Docket.asp?selCaseType=CR&amp;NumberSearchCriteria=199802668" class="external text" title="http://commissioners.co.lucas.oh.us/ClerkDockets/Docket.asp?selCaseType=CR&amp;NumberSearchCriteria=199802668" rel="nofollow">here is another</a> but that is again only basic details that do not show why he is notable. Other than the snopes article, <a href="http://www.foxtoledo.com/index.cfm?action=dsp_story&amp;storyid=87887" class="external text" title="http://www.foxtoledo.com/index.cfm?action=dsp_story&amp;storyid=87887" rel="nofollow">there is one final reliable source that verifies notability</a> but as you can see they took the link down to the news story and now it simply leads to their main page. The only remnants of the article's contents that I found are now, sadly, on the YTMND located at http:// brianpeppersfoxtoledo dot ytmnd dot com/ (can't write out ytmnd links due to blacklist) However, as an admin I can verify that the website did indeed have that information at one time (and it definitely asserts notability). Now, this brings us to an interesting scenerio. According to <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html#What_to_do_when_a_reference_link_.22goes_dead.22" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">Wikipedia:Citing sources#What_to_do_when_a_reference_link_.22goes_dead.22</a>, this reference is still considered a reliable source and should not be removed. <i>If none of those strategies succeed, do not remove the inactive reference, but rather record the date that the original link was found to be inactive — even inactive, it still records the sources that were used, and it is possible hard copies of such references may exist, or alternatively that the page will turn up in the near future in the Internet Archive, which deliberately lags by six months or more</i>. So if we follow that guideline the link I provided should be considered a reliable source, and along with the snopes article that would be two reliable sources that assert notability, plus we have the other ones that verify he exists. I think we have ourselves enough to make an article. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 21:05, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>No, we don't have a basis for making an article that any self-respecting encyclopedia would want to contain or that has any chance of meeting reasonable standards for inclusion. There is no valid basis for asserting this person's notability whatsoever, even if the basic facts of the prior version were certified as true by a chorus of angels, which is why I have argued that the emphasis on sourcing, important though that is, is actually a digression. Valid topics for Wikipedia articles do not include persons who would otherwise be entirely non-notable, living sad and lonely lives of isolation and rejection. That such a person made a mistake and now finds himself treated as a figure of fun because of aspects of his physical appearance over which he has no control, and thereby faces the deprivation of self-respect which must be one of the few things that allows a person in such circumstances to want to remain alive, does not provide the foundation of an encyclopedia article. We do not include articles on people for the purpose of making fun of them and causing them emotional harm, and we do not include articles on people who are not notable. In this instance, I gather that the notability rationale is that the subject has become famous, and is therefore notable, precisely because people make fun of him. Famous for being made fun of, an "internet meme"—this type of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Bootstrapping.html" title="Bootstrapping">bootstrapping</a> does not impress me. The way this sad individual has been treated on Wikipedia, and on the Internet more generally, is sordid and horrible. Making sure that the Wikipedia is not used to damage people in this way is one of the most important tasks facing us as administrators. (It is a task that our detractors believe we need to place an even higher priority on than we do, which is one of the reasons I find their desire to see this article re-created so odd, but that is a digression.) The people counting down the days until they can re-create the prior article or a similar one are not here to provide information that is either educational or informative or legitimately entertaining, which are the reasons a good-faith contributor creates or edits an article. Anything on this subject is going to get speedied as db-attack on a non-notable person so far as I am concerned. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 21:26, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The notability judgement should be related to the established <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">notability guidelines for people</a>, most applicable being "The person has been a primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person". Just as it would be for any other case. Notability is not to do with "famousness" at all. Nor should it matter that this article might get vandalised, unless we now let vandals determine inclusion criteria. Just because it's an article on a person who has been attacked does not mean the article itself is an attack page, so long as it's written neutrally. And the last thing we want is a wheel war over this. A debate over the article should happen in the appropriate forum (which isn't here) and the conclusion should be drawn from that. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 21:43, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>There won't be a wheel war, but I had hoped we could arrive at an advance consensus here on what to do, because February 21st (Wednesday) is being expressly anticipated on other sites as a special day to be dedicated to trolling Wikipedia over this article. But instead, we'll let someone write something and propose that it be placed in the now-salted article space, and an admin will delete anything that gets written, and someone will take the deletion to DRV, and we can have a week of pointless discussion of this nonsense while a real-world person suffers real-world harm and those who dislike us enjoy their lulz as people try to defend the indefensible. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 21:48, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The consensus, like it or not, should be at that talk page or at DRV. Ironically enough, we probably could have avoided this nonsense without the arbitrary deadline, but now we're stuck with it. It'll be interesting to see us abandon our general guidelines again for something we don't like, though. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 22:05, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's too vague to be responded to. More importantly, Jeff, although I don't wear it on my sleeve, I am probably as reasonably strong an "inclusionist" as you are going to find among the admin corps. I think a lot of our contributors' and administrators' energy devoted to policing the borderlands of notability with respect to high schools and local bands and webcomics (I'm particularly sensitive to webcomics right now) could be better utilized, although I recognize that lines have to be drawn somewhere. But this is a different sort of situation, and I hope that reflexive advocacy of including rather than excluding content will not be carried in this instance to a troublesome and disturbing extreme. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 22:09, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(after conflict) Right, I agree with getting an advance consensus, just not here. Keeping it protected for a few more days while we discuss doesn't really matter (and may even help reduce the trolling somewhat). But there <i>are</i> arguments that the person qualifies under notability guidelines (note, I'm not necessarily saying I agree with them), and a decision <i>does</i> need to be made. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 22:04, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The person has been the primary subject of no non-trivial coverage in reliable secondary sources. He has been the secondary subject of one non-trivial article in a reliable secondary source: Snopes discusses the rumour that the picture was faked. We do not have a reliable source for whether the wheelchair visible in the picture is the result of a permanent disability, whether his residence in a nursing home is permanent or not, the nature of his physical deformity. We do not have any details of the offence (for example, we have not even one newspaper report of the case). The case was not famous or infamous, he is not in any books on notable offenders, we have found no published interviews with school fellows or other parties that give any verifiable biographical data. In fact, what we know about Brian Peppers is (1) that he is an apparently deformed man that was convicted of an offence at the low end of the severity spectrum for sexual offences and (2) a lot of juvenile idiots with too much time on their hands chose to laugh at his appearance. Of these, only the first was allowed in the article, possibly because the second was deemed too likely to hurt the feelings of the juvenile idiots. The idea of having an article on Peppers solely because of his being an unwilling freakshow exhibit is repellant, and I will do whatever I can to ensure it does not happen, out of simple human decency. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 22:07, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>(edit conflict) In fairness, in 99.99% of instances a discussion like this would not belong on this board.

<li>I think I might be misinterpreting, so could you clarify? Is there definitely going to be a deletion debate, or are some people saying there shouldn't be one at all? If the former, then arguments about whether the article should be deleted don't belong here; it should be about how to handle and manage the debate. If the latter, then I see a problem, as it implies admins have an increased say in whether we delete articles. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 22:35, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Administrators are the ones who actually perform the task of deleting articles.

<p>If you look above at my first comment and the reply afterward, we have confimation that he was the subject of both a news report on television and on their website. The written source says that he has become "one of the top urban legends on the web" which is definitely an assertion of notability that is sourced.

<li>Not to repeat everything I wrote above, but I'm saying that it's not enough to prove notability, and I'm also saying that a bootstrapped claim of notability based primarily on the fact that a living person is being mocked for his physical appearance would be a despicable basis for a Wikipedia article <i>even if true</i>. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 22:36, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I agree, but it's not Wikipedia's job to be the moral police of the internet. If it is found to be notable it should be included, if it is found to not be notable it should not be included. If we were to not include the information because we didn't like the way he became notable that would set a dangerous precedent of censorship on Wikipedia.

<dd>No comment on the "shadowing" part, I haven't looked into that, but the consensus that the page should be gone wasn't really impressive (see <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_The_Simpsons_Archive4_7a4f.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject The Simpsons/Archive4">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject The Simpsons/Archive4</a>, only three people seem to agree on this, two of them being the nominator of the AfD and a contributor to it), and doesn't really matter, as a Project doesn't <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> a page, and even if a clear consensus would have been reached, it would not overrule the AfD. Also, such a discussion should be held or at least noted at the talk page of the article under scrutiny. To redirect a page immediately after an AfD resulted in a rather clear keep seems like a way to get what you want one way or the other. The fact that you redirected it to two different pages indicates that even you feel that there is not one obvious redirect as well, but that is a minor point. If there is a good merge candidate, discuss it on the article talk page, and proceed if there is consensus for that: but please stop redirecting the article. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 10:16, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>We frequently tell people things like, 'Wikipedia is not a travel guide', 'Wikipedia is not a game guide', 'Wikipedia is not a dictionary', 'Wikipedia is not a webspace provider', et cetera... usually just before we delete something that they have been working on. Needless to say this doesn't usually go over well. As such, I thought it would be nice if people could get out of the habit of saying, 'Wikipedia is not...' and instead say, '<a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/" class="extiw" title="wikitravel:">Wikitravel</a> accepts this kind of travel guide info', '<a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/" class="extiw" title="wikibooks:">Wikibooks</a> allows game guides like this', '<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:">Wiktionary</a> is the best place to put dictionary entries', et cetera. To that end I created the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENot_Wikipedia_b811.html" title="Wikipedia:Not Wikipedia">Wikipedia:Not Wikipedia</a> page to start listing various places which <b>ARE</b> all the specific things which Wikipedia frequently <b>is not</b>.

<dd>(ec) That's a good idea for such a collection of where things <i>can</i> be posted, but I'm afraid that soon it will degenerate into either primarily just a listing of Wikimedia projects or into a place where everyone will be posting links for their own sites/ categories. Perhaps I'm being too pessimistic, though. As for telling people that their material isn't appropriate here, I usually prefer the more straightforward statement, saying that "your material isn't suitable here because Wikipedia <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">isn't a</a> [game guide, etc.], but for a list of alternatives see <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENot_Wikipedia_b811.html" title="Wikipedia:Not Wikipedia">this page.</a>" - it gets the point across, while tacking on a reference to the page you just created.

<p>Lilphil212 is apparently the subject of Phil mondiello, which has been deleted at AfD twice. Aside from the fact that he has posted the article for the third time, he removed my db-repost tag. I went to his talk page to give him a good faith note not to remove CSD tags, but I saw he had already received warnings for the same conduct. Not sure what the proper action is in such cases, but I thought it was worth mentioning here. -- <a href="../../../b/u/t/User%7EButseriouslyfolks_e848.html" title="User:Butseriouslyfolks">Butseriouslyfolks</a> 07:22, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I thought the pedophilia userbox wheel war made it quite clear taht Wikipedia was gonna go crazy on any self-identified pedophiles. Hbdragon88 03:23, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have created a proposed policy to cover this issue. 04:48, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I can see why this is controversial, and I think I can at least sympathize with everybody posting here. I <i>think</i>... to me, maybe it's an issue of <i>"Why are you here?"</i> If you're here to help build and keep a neutral, informative, free encyclopedia, then I suspect I'll have no serious qualms with you -- that is, if they're wearing their Wikipedian hat. If, however, they're wearing another hat, and here for another purpose (promoting or practicing pedophilia, neo-nazism, whatever it may be), then I suspect I will have <i>many</i> qualms with their presence. That's what it comes down to, for me, I guess -- are they here to build an encyclopedia, or not? – <span style="font-family: Garamond"><a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELuna_Santin_1cab.html" title="User:Luna Santin"><font color="#1E90FF"><b>Luna Santin</b></font></a> (<a href="../../../l/u/n/User_talk%7ELuna_Santin_c747.html" title="User talk:Luna Santin">talk</a>)</span> 06:22, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is nothing much what we can really do. While we did try to come up with some sense of the problem, based on the WEP:CHILD debates, but honestly, we cannot do much. While Pee-J is trying to do what they do, unless we catch the people in the act of preying on children, we cannot do anything administratively. Not to mention, people have a right to privacy here on Wikipedia and not everyone even decides to make an account. But I strongly urge anyone that if someone is indeed preying on children using Wikipedia, please let us know. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">User:Zscout370</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Return Fire)</a></sup></small> 06:30, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>User talk:Brooklyn5 - this is <i>definitely</i> a bad block. This user was blocked for "vandalizing" another user's page by placing a {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-author_8ff7.html" title="Template:Db-author">db-author</a>}} tag on it, but in fact, he is this other user.

<dd>Gen. von Klinkerhoffen was not blocked for censorship but being a YTMND troll, primarily with using "For Brian Peppers" in his edits. The censoring I would have not blocked for (I was going to warn him, but then I saw the edit summaries). The IP is shared, and the block has an expiry. With Brooklyn5, I have no idea what's going on (looks like an impromptu username change without edit changing), so I'm not touching that.—<a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong"><font color="blue">Ryūlóng</font></a> (<a href="../../../r/y/u/User_talk%7ERyulong_923f.html" title="User talk:Ryulong"><font color="orange">竜</font><font color="green">龍</font></a>) 09:14, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Wait, wait, wait, guys. I had a change of heart, I'm not trying to violate POINT. What I think is that we should delete categories for everyone under 18. What's wrong with that?

<dd>This is a stupid debate. Let's get back on task. Anyways... so 1ne has been wheel warring over a category. Newyorkbrad says he may have emotional connection towards that category. That makes sense to me. The wheel warring has come to an end. That is good. The wheel warring towards the 1989 category is no more. That is good. Did 1ne delete the category to begin with to disrupt Wikipedia for the sake of a point or because he's genuinely concerned about the fact that some people in that category are under 18? That is irrelevant; if we keep spending all this time on it, then it <i>will</i> have been disruptive. The problem seems to have died down. Let's get back to work.

<dd>What discussion is there to have? For a webcomic to have an article we need reliable independent sources and preferably someone at least vaguely dispassionate writing the thing, same as everything else. Webcomics aren't a special case. Ok, they're on the Internet, and we're on the Internet, and therefore it's easier to round up some fans to SPAm an AfD, but this is just a side-effect of our model - webcomics have no more reason to 'deserve' an entry in Wikipedia than they do in Britannica. It's just harder to organise a coach down to Britannica's head office, and have them tell the editors that Webcomic #15353 is number 5 on the Top 100 List Of Webcomics About Bicycling Furries Wearing Wooly Hats, than it is to post a link on a blog. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 19:45, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree completely, and have opined on both sides of webcomic debates. The problem is that there's this seemingly growing revolt among webcomic creators and their readers that is vilifying Wikipedia because their articles are being deleted, and it seems to be a significantly sized group that's out there screaming about deletionism. The comic leading this section isn't the only one that's been taking potshots at us. My question, I guess, is whether we need to have specific guidelines for webcomics that we can point to, say "If you don't meet these, then let us know when you do," and make the comics mob put down the pitchforks and torches to actually try and meet the guidelines. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Fox_1932.html" title="User talk:Tony Fox">(arf!)</a></small> 20:57, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Pace</i> badlydrawnjeff (to whom I directed some remarks on the talk page of the DRV as to which I would welcome feedback from others), the consensus against re-creating the article is overwhelming. Personally, I would prefer retention of the outright deletion over redirecting to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Internet_phenomena_9aec.html" title="List of Internet phenomena">List of Internet phenomena</a>, in part because the "People" section in that article is itself a WP:LIVING/privacy/notability horror show that needs substantial attention and clean-up.

<dd>How about the legitimate, logical, rational reason that many of us find the idea of basing an article on this subject to be horrific, despicable, and non-encyclopedic as well? And how about the fact that there are several hundred other deletion debates going on, on many of which I would like to see a strong case put for keep, instead of devoting continuing energy into continuing advocacy for an article that clearly is not coming back? <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 20:31, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for proving my point. "Horrific" and "despicable," both terms I agree with, are irrelevant to the discussion. Non-encyclopedic?

<dd>You want "legitimate, logical and rational"? How's "Any article about this guy would amount to: He is a sex offender from someplace. He got a short sentence. He has become an internet meme because a number of people think he looks funny." Come on, man. I know you're on the extreme end of the inclusion spectrum, but that's all you could write about him, and even that would probably not meet BLP because it would be slanted towards negative coverage. Having said that, however, I probably would have let it run at least 24 hours before closing; I, though, am not an admin, and I respect Sam Blanning's judgment in this case. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Fox_1932.html" title="User talk:Tony Fox">(arf!)</a></small> 21:03, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>If you want, but do take the time to pause and reflect on the fundamental fact: the sum total of verifiable information here is (a) Peppers looks funny, (b) Peppers was convicted of a technical offence at the lower end of the severity scale of sexual offences, (c) a number of people chose to make fun of his appearance, resulting in his mugshot being pulled from e-SORN. Nothing else is actually verifiable. Not the disability, not the fact that he lives in a nursing home, not the cause of his apparent deformity, not the details of the offence, nothing about the victim or the context, no contemporaneous news coverage, Factiva, Lexis-Nexis and Google News all come up blank. We know next to nothing about <i>Brian Peppers</i>, the living human being. The only things we do know are either trivial or derogatory. I paid money for searches to see if there was additional verifiable data - there isn't. This is not the Star Wars Kid, who thought he was being cool and wasn't, this is someone who ahs absolutely no control over the situation, and furthermore whose "notability" rests solely and entirely on the fact that he looks weird. Only that. It's a random picture of some guy, taken out of context and used as an object of ridicule by people with absolutely no shame. And we deleted it, and we decided to keep it deleted. It's a trade: we get raspberries from the people who like to laugh at Peppers' appearance, in return for our self-respect and the clueful application of our policy on <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">living individuals</a>.

<li>I would endorse the close as well. Article was clearly not going to be recreated. I say this, by the way, as someone who doesn't think either recreating it or salting it would be a bad thing.

<li>I also endorse the close. I already explained how trivial any sources found on this guy would be, and almost all of the deletions were valid.

<li>Well, regardless, all that can be established is that he is a sex offender, and the DRV was heavily trolled anyway. I don't really see how the "keep deleted"s were "not based in reality" - there were major <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> concerns here. This is not a <a href="../../../i/d/o/WP%7EIDONTLIKEIT_1ffb.html" title="WP:IDONTLIKEIT">WP:IDONTLIKEIT</a> issue, and even if you take any such arguments out of the equation, there still would have been consensus to endorse. --<b><a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoredesat_5b9a.html" title="User:Coredesat">Core</a><a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECoredesat_227a.html" title="User talk:Coredesat"><font color="#3399FF">desat</font></a></b> 22:30, 21 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I wasn't seeing a lot of <i>heavy</i> trolling, honestly, and there, again, were not a lot of BLP issues - certainly not so many that couldn't be dealt with via editing.

<p>Hi, I tried to exchange the Page <a href="../../../l/a/m/Lamellophone.html" title="Lamellophone">Lamellophone</a> (then a redirect page to <a href="../../../l/a/m/Lamellaphone.html" title="Lamellaphone">lamellaphone</a> with the page <a href="../../../l/a/m/Lamellaphone.html" title="Lamellaphone">Lamellaphone</a> /then the main article). I tried to do this by a ring move. The idea was to move "Lamellophone" to "Lamellophone1", then "Lamellaphone" to "Lamellophone" and finally "Lamellophoe1" to "Lamellaphone" (+ change some texts). Trying to move the redirect page "Lamellophone" to "Lamellophone11" did not work, the system complained that a page of that name already existed (I belive it did not). I then did the change instead by moving the content of the articles including the talk page content. However, the Talk page of "Lamellophone" now has the title "Talk:Lamellophone1", so it looks like the attempted move lead to an inconsistency in the data structure. It looks like there is a bug in the moove functionality. If possible, could somebody repair the problem (rename the talk page)?

<p>What isn't documented at {{<a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUsernameblock_b304.html" title="Template:Usernameblock">usernameblock</a>}}, and should be (but I can't edit it to do so, it's protected) is that the template takes an optional parameter. <b>{{usernameblock|</b><i>reason for block</i><b>}}</b>, or even <b>{{unb|</b><i>reason for block</i><b>}}</b>, will replace the rest of the sentence following "<b>blocked indefinitely</b> because", up to the parenthetical "(see our blocking and username policies for more information)", with your own specific reason for the block.</p>
<p>That is, the boilerplate text -- ..."it may be rude or inflammatory, unnecessarily long/confusing, too similar to an existing user, contains the name of an organization or website, or is otherwise inappropriate"... -- goes away and is replaced by your own text.</p>
<p><i>If you enter:</i> &#160; {{unb|"Charles Prince of Wales" too closely resembles the existing username "The Outlaw Josey Wales"}}<br />

<p>Please pass the word.
