<p>I am not certain if this is the correct place to post this, so if it needs to go elsewhere, please let me know. However, since there is an active case at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Naming_Conventions_2ebe.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Naming Conventions">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Naming Conventions</a>, this seemed the right place to start. One of the issues in the case is that one of the users has been engaging in hundreds of non-consensus page moves. The arbitration case has been accepted, but <a href="../../../y/a/k/User%7EYaksha_03f0.html" title="User:Yaksha">Yaksha</a> (<span class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../y/a/k/User_talk%7EYaksha_d46a.html" title="User talk:Yaksha">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yaksha_fc6e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yaksha"><span title="Contributions: Yaksha">contribs</span></a> • <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Log/move?user=Yaksha" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Log/move?user=Yaksha" rel="nofollow"><span title="Page moves: Yaksha"><font color="#002BB8">page&#160;moves</font></span></a> • <a href="../../../b/l/o/Special%7EBlockip_Yaksha_36b8.html" title="Special:Blockip/Yaksha"><span title="Block User:Yaksha">block&#160;user</span></a> • <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_block_4a41.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_block_4a41.html" rel="nofollow"><span title="Blocklog: Yaksha"><font color="#002BB8">block&#160;log</font></span></a></span>) is continuing to engage in more non-consensus page moves, with no attempt at RM procedure for these articles, and in violation of consensus that's already been reached as to how those articles should be named (see <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Buffy_Episodes_04a8.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Buffy/Episodes">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Buffy/Episodes</a>).

<dd>This has nothing to do with <i>this</i> page, which is for enforcement of final decisions. In any case, I would rather not see any more moves in either direction for the moment, and I have asked Yaksha to stop for the time being. But I'm not interested in reverting them either. Redirects exist, so there won't be any long term harm in waiting for the outcome of the case. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 23:56, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Arthur_Ellis is to old to check directly, but looking at the evidence in the RFAR, the technical evidence supports the conclusion that Keeperdog and 209.226.201.243 are Arthur_Ellis. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">(<small>Talk</small>)</font></a></span> 06:45, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Keeperdog should only be blocked for one month. Arthur Ellis was blocked at his own request. <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Warren_Kinsella_03b8.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Warren Kinsella">Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Warren Kinsella</a> would allow a brief block for editing his own page, he was also blocked generally for one month under <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Rachel_Marsden_c143.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Rachel Marsden">Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Rachel Marsden</a> so the one month block should be reset for block evasion. There's no point in blocking the IP longer than 24 hours because it is dynamic and he can change them as often as he wants to. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 18:25, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, those probably got transposed. 209.217.123.163 is at fault.

<li>This is complicated. The content that Intangible2.0 edit warred over was the statement that some members of a political party are neo-nazis. This is highly inflammatory, and talk pages are also subject to <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> (not to mention <a href="../../../g/o/d/Godwin%27s_law.html" title="Godwin's law">Godwin's law</a>). I have removed the comments. Further, Intangible has abandoned his original account, so Intangible2.0 is a legitimate replacement account. But, by editing via the Pinkos accounts he showed intent to evade his arbitration restrictions by using a new account without telling Arbcom, so 24 hour block on Intangible2.0, after which he may resume editing under the same limits imposed on Intangible. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 14:44, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>His actions have resulted in him being banned from many articles, including <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singapore.html" title="Singapore">Singapore</a>. After being banned from an article, he will move on to another article, and get banned from that article, and move on to another, and so on.</p>
<p>Recently, he has been POV-pushing and edit-warring on <a href="../../../s/i/n/Single-party_state.html" title="Single-party state">single-party state</a>, insisting that Singapore be included in the list of single-party states. As a Singaporean, I know that we are a <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominant-party_system.html" title="Dominant-party system">dominant-party system</a>, not a single-party state, as we have elections and the opposition has 2 seats and 33% of the votes, despite facing discrimination imposed by the ruling party.</p>

<p>I request that an administrator enforce the arbitration restrictions (such as probation) imposed on Instantnood, and if neccesary, impose further sanctions or start another arbitration case. In addition, as consensus is against him, and Singapore was not on the list of single-party states before the edit war started, I request that it be removed from the list.</p>

<dd>As the Arbcom is less interested in factual correctness, but in the appriopriateness of behavior by wikipedians, lets concentrate on the later rather then the former. In this case, may I point out that I have often noticed instantnood's tendency in engaging in disruptive behavior pertaining to Singapore-related articles, in what I strongly suspect to be a tit-for-tat move from my edits pertaining to Hong Kong-related articles. Since the entire dispute boils down to a disagreement over the political status of HK on the international arena, it dosent come as too much of a surprise when Instantnood therefore partakes in enforcing an "undemocratic" label on Singapore, a stance which has noticibly gained in aggresiveness almost in tendem with what happens to HK-related articles. For this to happen over an extended period of about 2 years or more, I doubt it would boil down to mere coincidence. Instantnood clearly could not seperate personal emotions and ego from accurate representation of fact, and the upholding of wikipedia's NPOV policy.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 16:36, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Such penalties are at the Administrator's discretion, although ArbCom or Jimbo may as always overturn them at their will. My best suggestion is to report again if he is edit warring, and he will be blocked for a greater term.

<dd>The thing you seem to keep misunderstanding is that your reverting is incredibly disruptive. You've been the subject of multiple arbitration cases and eventually banned from a number of articles because you continue to revert and edit war instead of using the <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">dispute resolution</a> processes. You need to find another way of dealing with your concerns or avoid the articles that cause you this problem. Continuing to revert, especially when no one else saw fit to revert the changes in 3 weeks, just isn't at all productive and does nothing to resolve the situation. If you're having the same issues with multiple editors over the same disputes, you need to consider that you position may not be the majority and you need to develop consensus for your changes through rational discussion. <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShell_Kinney_fd26.html" title="User:Shell Kinney">Shell</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7EShell_Kinney_fbce.html" title="User talk:Shell Kinney">babelfish</a></sup> 22:24, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have been calling for third parties to take part in discussion, yet very few people are willing to help. Administrators or members of the arbitration committee simply ask everyone to stop, without doing anything constructive to get the matter out of the trouble. There are many of these articles (and categories and templates) which the majority of editors are simply confortable in both ways I, and user:Huaiwei and user:SchmuckyTheCat prefer.

<p>There are a number of edits Instantnood makes that are genuinely useful and I'd hate to lose that because of his strong political beliefs. I don't think any time based ban on Instantnood is going to change the situation - it has not worked in the past. He returns to the same behavior and warring on the same articles. What has worked has been the page bans. An extrapolation on that would be a 0RR for Instantnood; once reverted (or changed) he cannot make the same edit again to the same article. He would be free of course, to make rational discussion for his edit on the talk page for someone else to do it. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchmuckyTheCat_0da1.html" title="User:SchmuckyTheCat">SchmuckyTheCat</a> 04:35, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I understand <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">User:Instantnood</a> is on a probation, and that there is a long history of conflicts between him, Vsion and Huaiwei and perhaps others. This is unfortunate. However, I would like to point out that lthough there has been a heated debate, I at least have not noticed any personal attacks or other bad behaviour from Instantnood (although there have been a little from some other users). The dispute, which has had a request for mediation done earlier this week, is about Singapore status, basically if it is a democracy or not. <a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHildanknight_74fc.html" title="User:Hildanknight">User:Hildanknight</a>'s claim that Instantnood is POV-pushing is simply false. There has been some editwarring regarding the title of a section in the talk page, but that was Huaiwei who started and continued that by changing a section-title that Instantnood started, where in my opinion Instantnoods title is much more appropriate. I don't know if it's normaly acceptable behaviour, but it can not be blamed on Instantnood, and it is honestly rather silly to start disputing what the section title used in the dispute should be.&#160;;)</dd>
<dd>I don't follow Instantnoods behaviour in general, but there have been no bad behaviour from him regarding <a href="../../../s/i/n/Single-party_state.html" title="Single-party state">Single-party state</a>. Therefore it is rather difficult to see why this should in anyway be escalated into an RfC against him (or anyone else). To me this feels like you are trying to use threats of RfCs to indimidate him to fold in the debate. And when you start mentioning making an RfC against me as well, that only increases that feeling.</dd>
<dd>Yes, I agree. The mediation will probably fail. But that will not be because of lack of effort from my side, and it will not be because Instantnood has done anything wrong in this dispute. --<a href="../../../r/e/g/User%7ERegebro_5b16.html" title="User:Regebro">Regebro</a> 18:47, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you read the three arbitration cases, you will know that Instantnood has been editing China-related articles to make them conform to his political views, which constitutes POV-pushing. This is why he has been placed on indefinite general probation, and banned from editing many articles.</dd>
<dd>As Huaiwei, one of the users who tried to stop his POV-pushing, is from Singapore, Instantnood started edit warring and POV-pushing on Singapore-related articles. Instantnood is trying to make the <a href="../../../s/i/n/Single-party_state.html" title="Single-party state">Single-party state</a> article conform to his political view that Singapore is a single-party state. The dispute would not have taken place if Instantnood had not started POV-pushing on <a href="../../../s/i/n/Single-party_state.html" title="Single-party state">Single-party state</a>.</dd>
<dd>Instantnood has constantly found ways to get around the restrictions that have been imposed on him. Hopefully, a fourth arbitration case would stop his edit warring and POV-pushing once and for all. In addition, the arbitrators will investigate the conduct of others involved in the dispute, especially Huaiwei and Regebro.</dd>

<dd>Yes, I used "you" as the plural here, sorry if that caused any confusion. Indeed, Huaiwei has threatened with RfC against me, and you are threatening with arbitration against Instantnood, although in fact none of us has done anything wrong in this case.</dd>
<dd>I have read the arbitration cases, and therefore I know that Instantnood and Huaiwei has been editwarring. <i>Both</i> are on probation because <i>both</i> of them used editwarring instead of discussion to push theior POV. You are incorrectly trying to blame this dispute on Instantnood, although he is not the cause to the conflict in Single-party state.</dd>
<dd>If you don't like to be involved in people politics, perhaps you should stop making this a people politics case? Up until you added it to this noticeboard it wasn't about people politics, and in fact, on the talk-page it still is about the factual issue, and I wasn't aware of your accusations against Instantnood until yesterday. Maybe we can stop this and again make it a factual debate? That would be constructive. --<a href="../../../r/e/g/User%7ERegebro_5b16.html" title="User:Regebro">Regebro</a> 15:59, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Instantnood et al are currently in Mediation regarding the Single Party State dispute, if this is what this is about, I suggest that Arbitration be stayed at least until the Mediation is closed.

<p>He is insisting against any consensus that a link to a POV timeline be included, and that a NPOV tag be added to the article. There have been a handfull of editors taking turns removing his additions but it needs to stop, none of us should have to put up with this...and I don't like his personal attacks on the talk page and edit summaries</p>

Further I have left messages on Tom Harrisons talk page which he has ignored and not responded to, yet continued to remove the link, which is the topic of the AN/I post. I ask RX Strangelove to discuss the topic based on <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> and he claimed the site was anonymous and should not be included, I gave them the registrars information and explained that "anonymous site" often referes to geocities etc. (free web hosts). They then claimed it was a wiki, which was disputed since you submit info, not edit directly, they then stated they just dont like the site ... They say there is a no concensus for its addition, but its Tom and RX disagreeing with PTR, myself, Lovelight, slipgrid and SavoirFaireIsEverywhere and SalvNaut, the concesus is clearly against them, and Tom refuses to participate on talk and RX has jumped from excuse to excuse with noone agreeing with them. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 16:52, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Outside view from uninterested party</b>: Not commenting on the applicability of the link, but Zer0faults <i>has</i> been engaged in contentious editing, almost to the point of edit warring and something should be done per his arbitration probation from last time.

<dd>I count 18 insertions of the link by 5 editors (11 from NuclearUmpf) and 17 removals by 7 editors (5 each by Tom H and Rx Strange) over the past 7 days, with no attempt at dispute resolution, by editors who should know better. When a group of editors can't come to an agreement on matters of judgement they are expected to use the dispute resolution process such as a third opinion, RFC or mediation. I'm not going to sanction one editor out of a 12-person edit war.

Why is nothing being acted upon? Even today alone on the Plasma cosmology page and talk page SA again displayed many of these traits. We should just leave him alone? Gladly, if he would leave the plasma cosmology article alone. Ban him from editing this article just as you did to E. Lerner, and you would hear a lot less complaint about the matter. -<a href="../../../i/o/n/User%7EIonized_5399.html" title="User:Ionized">Ionized</a> 00:56, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>SA was merely <i>cautioned</i> in the ArbComm--no admin has the authority to ban him from any article. Iantresman, by contrast, is on probation; if his editing becomes disruptive, he can be banned from specific articles. <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBucketsofg_06fb.html" title="User:Bucketsofg"><font color="#DF0001"><b>Buck</b></font><b><font color="green">ets</font></b><font color="grey"><b>ofg</b></font></a> 00:48, 20 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Any editor may be blocked for disruption, and I think a case could be made that flagrantly ignoring his "caution" constituted disruption, depending on the circumstances. I have not considered the details of this case. The other remedy would be to post to RFAR under requests for clarification and ask for the case to be reopened to consider probation. This would probably not get off the ground unless you can show that your position has the support of uninvolved admins or editors. Again, I have not reviewed this report. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 06:19, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If what is cited above is the worst that he's done, there is little ground for complaint. Again Iantresman is on probation.

<dd>I disagree that there is little ground for complaint. This is about a 'wolf in sheep's clothing' if you don't mind the analogy. Thatcher's statement above is the most unbiased I have seen yet and clearly contains ideas for the next step in resolution. Whether or not Ian's list is the 'worst that SA has done', the fact remains that disruption has taken place. Currently article warring has subsided while discussion takes place on the talk page (<a href="../../../p/l/a/Plasma_cosmology.html" title="Plasma cosmology">Plasma_cosmology</a>), however this pause was preceded by a large number of undiscussed and inappropriate edits made by SA. Right now is the sheep, but the wolf will inevitably return, just as it has in the past. -<a href="../../../i/o/n/User%7EIonized_5399.html" title="User:Ionized">Ionized</a> 02:04, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Urgent attention is needed in this matter. There is currently a threat to remove the entire <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plasma_cosmology.html" title="Plasma cosmology">Plasma_cosmology</a> article and merge it with an article that describes a stub from Plasma Cosmology, <a href="../../../a/m/b/Ambiplasma.html" title="Ambiplasma">Ambiplasma</a>. If anything, the reverse should happen, <a href="../../../a/m/b/Ambiplasma.html" title="Ambiplasma">Ambiplasma</a> was Alfven's original framework within Plasma Cosmology, it is not the entirety of Plasma Cosmology. Ambiplasma, if I remember right, was originally in the Plasma Cosmology article, and was removed by an editor claiming it had nothing to do with Plasma Cosmology. Now, there is much irony in this, SA is now claiming that indeed all of plasma cosmology FITS within Ambiplasma, yet if you look on the history of <a href="../../../a/m/b/Ambiplasma.html" title="Ambiplasma">Ambiplasma</a>, the top edit (at this time) is by SA with the comment "(→Analysis of Alfvén's model - taking out pc cruft. This is an article about ambiplasma which is distinct from plasma cosmology.)" How much longer must we wait before real action is taken to prevent SA from disrupting the plasma cosmology article?

<p>Seriously, the evidence is all there, just peruse the Plasma Cosmology talk pages over the past 2 weeks. Take a look at the very bottom where PC is finally defined from a broader philosophical basis. These attempts to remove, revert, discredit, disrupt, are becoming absolutely unnecessary and absurd. It is clear that PC exists as a framework, and should be given its own space. We need help stopping SA, the behavior is quite flagrant as far as I can tell. PLEASE help, what is the next step to take to get SA permanently blocked from editing the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plasma_cosmology.html" title="Plasma cosmology">Plasma_cosmology</a> article? -<a href="../../../i/o/n/User%7EIonized_5399.html" title="User:Ionized">Ionized</a> 03:36, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

His merger proposal is not a breach of the ArbComm remedy, it is, after all, merely a proposal, one that will attract a consensus or not.

<p>He is doing these edits because he doesn't want wikipedia to write about the political system of Singapore, this is a continuation of a dispute I'm involved in on <a href="../../../s/i/n/Single-party_state.html" title="Single-party state">Single-party state</a> and I even tried to appease him by not writing about Singapore. But he doesn't discuss it, but instead, as usual, just tries to make it into an editwar.</p>

<dd>Contrary to Regebro's claims, there has actually been exhausting discussions on the political status on Singapore in <a href="../../../s/i/n/Talk%7ESingle-party_state_3dc1.html" title="Talk:Single-party state">Talk:Single-party state‎</a>, where he failed to gain concensus from the majority of discussion participants. He proposed a solution to move the offending entries to <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominant-party_system.html" title="Dominant-party system">Dominant-party system</a>, which was palatable to most. However, he continues to assert his POV by insisting on keeping descriptive text (eg: lack of free speech) from the former list. Over in <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominant-party_system.html" title="Dominant-party system">Dominant-party system</a>, however, it is noted that no such description exists for every other entity, which I felt was probably so to avoid introducting value judgements. Despite repeated explanations on why I am removing these text and reformatting the new entries, he continously reverts to his preferred version by insisting that I add descriptive text for all other entries <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dominant-party_system&amp;diff=95333004&amp;oldid=95327124" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dominant-party_system&amp;diff=95333004&amp;oldid=95327124" rel="nofollow">[74]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dominant-party_system&amp;diff=95976428&amp;oldid=95913733" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dominant-party_system&amp;diff=95976428&amp;oldid=95913733" rel="nofollow">[75]</a>. He then claims he did not introduce POV, saying he is only doing a "rearrangement" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dominant-party_system&amp;diff=96314970&amp;oldid=96003386" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dominant-party_system&amp;diff=96314970&amp;oldid=96003386" rel="nofollow">[76]</a>.</dd>

<dd>Regebro continues to launch personal attacks against those who oppose him factually, such as in the above, where he claims I have an agenda to censor wikipedia's coverage on Singapore. I find this kind of comment extremely insulting and uncalled for. His blatant lies on my supposed failure to discuss my edits further gives an indication on the level of his personal integrity, and raises questions on his ability to report disputes factually and rationally, and not as a result of an emotional backlash.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 12:52, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Regarding deprecation, nothing in the ArbComm ruling on my reading of it hinders SA's freedom to deprecate, provided that he does so in a civil manner. I see nothing objectionable in the diffs you provide. On incivility, I have cautioned SA on name-calling, but most of the examples you provide are, when read within context, within the bounds of acceptable civility. On policy, nothing in SA's comments seems against policy--indeed, when he talks about POV-forks, he is advocating adherence to policy, not the opposite. On edit-warring, nothing in his edits strikes me as warring. Perhaps another admin will see it differently, but I see no grounds for action in what you've provided. <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBucketsofg_06fb.html" title="User:Bucketsofg"><font color="#DF0001"><b>Buck</b></font><b><font color="green">ets</font></b><font color="grey"><b>ofg</b></font></a> 18:22, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Regarding <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">Incivility</a>, I believe there is no defense, let alone a defense of "context". When he says "I am misleading", what he means is that my <i>sources chosen</i> may be misleading (the first is an <i>ad hominem</i>, the latter a valid criticism). And when instead of discussing an edit (civil), he threatens that my edits will be considered disruptive and I may be banned, this is a "More serious examples" given in <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> (the first is constructive and civil, the latter is an nonconstructive veiled threat and incivil).</li>
<li>WP:BOLD tells us that it "does not mean that you should make large changes or deletions to long articles on complex, controversial subjects with long histories". To do so once may be considered bad etiquette. To do so repeatedly, and following on from an ArbCom decision which stated that ScienceApologist is "cautioned to respect all policies and guidelines", I feel diverges from the ArbCom results. --<a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIantresman_3a2c.html" title="User:Iantresman">Iantresman</a> 18:53, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm sorry to hear that you are finding it difficult to assume that I'm acting in good faith in the decisions I have been making. That doesn't change the fact that I'm not convinced by your complaints: SA has a different idea about what a good article about PC is. If a consensus can be formed, great. If not, admins will have to get involved, but be careful about that, since the ArbComm ruling makes action against you more likely than against SA. Again, perhaps one of the other admins will see it differently. <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBucketsofg_06fb.html" title="User:Bucketsofg"><font color="#DF0001"><b>Buck</b></font><b><font color="green">ets</font></b><font color="grey"><b>ofg</b></font></a> 22:43, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"..since the ArbComm ruling makes action against you more likely than against SA." If that is the case, then clearly I am simply wasting my time attempting to contribute knowledge to Wikipedia, just as I was three years ago when all of the same type of warring was taking place on the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plasma_cosmology.html" title="Plasma cosmology">Plasma_cosmology</a> and associated pages. Inaction is the method for dealing with people like ScienceApologist (except for the recent Ad Hom he made against Ian, I appreciated that Bucketsofq at least said something to him about that single incident out of many), and baseless threats are the method for dealing with people like me. Now, since maybe you are just trying to give a friendly warning, I will take your comment more lightly. But I am hard pressed to imagine what logical reasons a committee could find to make an arbitrary ruling against me, taken in context my contributions are made in as professional and proper a manner as possible when dealing with these types of opponents. I was worried about the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plasma_cosmology.html" title="Plasma cosmology">Plasma_cosmology</a> article first and foremost, though indeed I have become concerned that such blatant misbehavior on the part of SA can continue because of a very improperly handled recent ArbCom case and refusal to enforce any ruling or warning made against SA within said case. All signs indeed point to a broader agenda. I admit it is a bit concerning that it appears as the recent case has set a bad precedent, if you feel that action against me is now more likely (for whatever reason.) If that is the case, so be it, I would only see irony in the situation. Regardless, my complaints really are futile after all, and I do understand this. SA is just the latest opponent to Plasma cosmology, the article has had many before he was around, and even if he was banned from the article, surely more opponents would take his place. So if you see me become less active again, it isn't because of any unwarranted threats from an admin, it is because I recognize the futility of defending real science when surrounded by technicians. In the end, I respect your decision of inaction, because the status quo demands it. -<a href="../../../i/o/n/User%7EIonized_5399.html" title="User:Ionized">Ionized</a> 21:45, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm sorry to hear that you're finding your experience at wikipedia so frustrating. I hope that you don't leave, but find a way to contribute. Be that as it may, this page is not the place for you to convince me to back your version of Plasma Cosmotology or anything else. It's a place to ask for enforcement of arbcomm decisions. SA was cautioned to be civil. If you have new reports to make about his civility, or some other policy violation, make it. Otherwise do your best to soldier on.

<li>On point #1, you say that you brought this to the attention of ArbComm, which would make it inappropriate for me to punish him now.

<li>The examples in point #1 shows a history of deleting and blanking, which other Admins have described as possibly "disruptive". His recent statement indicates further intent to do the same.</li>
<li>Again, the quote beginning "I am beginning to be of the opinion..." is current,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Electric_universe_%28concept%29&amp;diff=97141449&amp;oldid=97135315" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Electric_universe_%28concept%29&amp;diff=97141449&amp;oldid=97135315" rel="nofollow">[108]</a>, and includes the phrase "a reliable article about the pathology of these people". The subject of the sentence is "these people", and the attribute is "the pathology". Without a source, this is an emphatic <i>ad hominem</i> that fails both WP:CIVIL and WP:LIVING. It would be no different to discussing "administrators" and asking editors to write an article about "the dishonesty of these people", rather than perhaps asking editors to contribute to an article on the flaws in the Arbitration process.</li>

Since (1) this implies a certain aggressiveness, (2) <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Pseudoscience_f6ea.html#Iantresman_placed_on_Probation" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Pseudoscience">Iantresman's remedy</a> called for his being "banned from any article or subject area which he disrupts by aggressive biased editing", and (3) several, including me, have found his editing to be disruptive (cf. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97780183" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97780183" rel="nofollow">[109]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AIantresman&amp;diff=94559891&amp;oldid=94416415" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AIantresman&amp;diff=94559891&amp;oldid=94416415" rel="nofollow">[110]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AIantresman&amp;diff=92250676&amp;oldid=91709856" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AIantresman&amp;diff=92250676&amp;oldid=91709856" rel="nofollow">[111]</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AElectric_universe_%28concept%29&amp;diff=97649600&amp;oldid=97648610" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AElectric_universe_%28concept%29&amp;diff=97649600&amp;oldid=97648610" rel="nofollow">[112]</a>), I find that Iantresman has indeed disrupted through aggressive biased editing.

<li>No, I wouldn't. Such nursed slights as you seem to have are divisive, create a negative environment on the encyclopedia, and poison the well - many editors aren't going to want to touch an article where this kind of negative environment exists, for fear of becoming entangled in this whole dispute. I think it would be best for the moment if you forgot it, if not forgave it. Have some trust in the administration of Wikipedia. If he truly is disruptive, you need not be around to report it for him to be disciplined.

<p>Unfortunately policy prevents us from taking a step back and disengaging, as silence signifies 'consent' towards ScienceApologists bold changes, and we certainly don't consent. Currently he is trying to delete the Electric Universe page, and merge the Plasma Cosmology page with one of its stubs. While I have less care for what happens to the Electric Universe page, I can not sit by silently and witness the destruction of the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plasma_cosmology.html" title="Plasma cosmology">Plasma_cosmology</a> article. We have gone way past the point of assuming good faith, etc, as SA has clearly demonstrated his ill intent. -<a href="../../../i/o/n/User%7EIonized_5399.html" title="User:Ionized">Ionized</a> 18:13, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Please take a moment to consider your attitude. It comes off as combative, ("I can not sit by and silently witness the destruction of the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plasma_cosmology.html" title="Plasma cosmology">Plasma_cosmology</a> article). Consider the fact that there are millions of editors on Wikipedia, and that one editor not contributing does not mean an article will be neglected or fall into POV. You may consider requesting a peer review as a more constructive way to get more eyes on the article and avoid POV.

<dd>I've warned him in good faith to try to avoid edit and revert warring, and asked him to simply provide a link to the image and the license for 'NPC-Paul-Thompson.jpg'. I'm hopeful Zer0 can avoid a block by focusing on content (the relevant licensing requirements), and avoiding non-disruptive conduct.

<dd>I've asked him nicely about GabrielF's page. I suspect the copyright problems are a misunderstanding. If the US government <i>creates</i> an image, it is PD, but if it uses an image from elsewhere, the image is still subject to its original copyright. It is entirely possible that the Defense Dept violated someone's copyright in using the image, but since I don't know the status of official Iraqi government docs (which I suspect this is), I can't say one way or the other. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 17:14, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Please note that Nuclear Zero has just <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Thatcher131&amp;diff=98240662&amp;oldid=98218591" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Thatcher131&amp;diff=98240662&amp;oldid=98218591" rel="nofollow">[127]</a> posted a long treatise to Thatcher's talk page describing his role in organized efforts to form 'teams' to avoid 3RR while 'defending' POV - most specifically his having 'posed as neutral' as part of an organized team to defend his 'team's' version of edits. That's organized gaming of 3RR, revert and edit warring, improper use of image tags and uncivil conduct, all evident in a cursory review of Zer0's last 24 hours. What more egregious conduct is needed before this user (who is already on probation against tendentious editing) is finally perma'blocked?

<dd>The problem is, the allegations involve a wide range of editors not previously covered in arbitration. If any action were to be taken, the other named editors would have to be able to speak for themselves. Nuclear also claims to have left the group, and Morton D denies there ever was a group. You'll have to open a new arbitration case if you want to try and address that statement. The only thing I see in the last 24 hours is revert warring over his own talk page (against a British Telecom IP address) and some misunderstandings about image policy. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 03:41, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>No, the allegations involving others can be discarded. Nuclear's own admission regarding his OWN conduct is what I've mentioned. 'Some misunderstandings about image policy' is a less-than-neutral way to describe 3 reverts each on two images, wouldn't you admit? I don't need to open a new case to discuss Nuclear's own admission of his own disregard for his prior probation - that's silly. I have no interest in chasing this latest dust devil of his. -- <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanFreisling_b27b.html" title="User:RyanFreisling">User:RyanFreisling</a> <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanFreisling_aab0.html" title="User talk:RyanFreisling">@</a> 03:45, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>On the subject of the images, I don't blame him for feeling that his uploads were being targeted by his usual opponents. He clearly has a misunderstanding about the role of the US govt in publishing the deck of cards, not understanding that publication does not affect the underlying copyright of the image. (Imagine if the Fed Gvt could render any copyright into public domain simply by republishing it--it would be the mother of all unconstitutional takings.) I asked him to find some neutral copyright experts to advise him and as far as I know the issue with the images is over.</dd>
<dd>On the subject of his supposed disclosure, <i>He may be banned for an appropriate period of time from an article or set of articles which he disrupts by tendentious editing or edit warring.</i> It may be a technical point, but off-wiki coordination and gaming the system are not listed here as a prohibited activity. More generally, if edits by this "group" did not raise suspicions at the time, then they weren't disruptive, and there is no basis to hold Nuclear singularly responsible for them. (I don't see how you can dismiss the other members of the alleged group in order to hold Nuclear uniquely responsible.) He also says he is no longer part of the group (which Morton denies exists), so if we are going to accept Nuclear's word that a group exists, we have to accept his word that he left. His probation is meant to prevent continued or future disruptive editing, not punish past acts, about which you haven't been specific in any case. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 04:19, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It hasn't prevented disruptive editing.</dd>
<dd>Once again, I'm ignoring the 'foil' of whether Nuclear's cabal claims (links provided) are true and focusing on what he has said about his own conduct... 'posing as neutral' in order to game WP. His revert warring on the images (links provided) is just part of a larger picture - continued disruptive editing. Claiming a cabal exists, and accusing other users is also certainly disruptive (again, whether or not such a group exists or not is irrelevant - the <b>claim</b> is disruptive in and of itself) as is his admission of his own intent and conduct (link provided as above). Specific links have been provided. The acts in question (multiple revert wars, accusing others of cabal, intentionally gaming WP, improper use of image tags, etc.) all took place recently, well AFTER his probation, and are of course relevant... this is not 'punishing past acts', it's addressing recent acts in violation of probation. In any case (thankfully), it's ArbCom's decision, not yours. -- <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanFreisling_b27b.html" title="User:RyanFreisling">User:RyanFreisling</a> <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanFreisling_aab0.html" title="User talk:RyanFreisling">@</a> 04:31, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, I forgot about the GabrielF page. The problem is, probation is not meant to short circuit all other forms of dispute resolution, and it is not a license to keep reverting him until you can report it as a violation. No one tried to talk to him about the inclusion of the MfD, just reverted back and reported here. I feel confident you will not find a single arbitrator who feels probation should be treated this way, and I invite you to ask around. (I will gladly admit my error if I am proven wrong.) After I talked to him, he stopped. (Ultimately, GabrielF has control over his page, and if he wants the MfD listed or not listed, or wants to ban Nuclear—or anyone else—from posting, that should be respected.)</dd>
<dd>In the last week there have been two edit wars on his talk page, the nomination of one of his subages for MfD, listing two of his recent image uploads for deletion, and a 3RR block for him and Hipocrite.

<dd>In the words of a wise man, "don't start nothin', won't be nothin'." Nuclear's a big boy and we are each responsible for our own conduct. He's been through an ArbCom process, is on probation and is being held to an appropriately higher set of standards. Now, on his second screenname, he hasn't visibly made an effort to keep above the fray - he's continued to be at the center of acrimonious debate after acrimonious debate.

<dd>Nuclear's probation allows him to be banned from articles he disrupts. That means, in the present instant, GabrielF's noticeboard and the two images under consideration for deletion. The disruption, if such it was, stopped after I asked nicely, and I will not take punitive action at this time. If we take his admission at face value, he could be banned for disruptive editing of other articles. Which articles? You haven't said. All 9/11 conspiracy articles? Or would you just like him generally banned? There is no basis for that in the previous case. I maintain that there is not a single arbitrator who would enforce his current probation in the current circumstances, against either the recent edit warring (in which no attempt at dispute resolution was made before filing three near-simultaneous complaints here) or with respect to his admission. Ask them. If you can find even one to disagree with me, I will publically acknowledge my error and will recuse myself from any further dealings with NuclearUmpf and the surrounding cast of characters. In fact, I may leave arbitration enforcement entirely, my errors in judgement having been proved.

I am still processing Nuclear's "admission" and it has not influced my opinion on this enforcement request in either direction.

<dd>While I would be <i>delighted</i> if you would recuse yourself from dealings with this 'cast of characters', I made very clear that I wouldn't 'like' him banned at all - <i>and I've been clear about that from the outset. (see above in this very section).</i> I made a concerted effort to resolve this with Zer0 by posting on the pages in question, and his talk page, requesting he provide proof of the license status, rather than delete the requests and revert warring the associated tags. When I asked Zer0 as you did, he wiped my request. And then you flatly stated that he's allowed to do so, rather than doing the right thing - which would have been to neutrally encourage him to engage in dialogue with me or others to resolve the dispute. After you then asked him yourself to address the specific image status, it would appear he may have listened to you, and not to me, as he didn't wipe your request from his talk page as he did mine. Attempts at dispute resolution were made - and Zer0 wiped them out with snarky 'giggle' edit comments. I continue to be nonplussed by your representation of these events as so one-sided - you appear to discount those bringing these valid instances in favor of Zer0, so your recusal may indeed be called for. To me, as I've stated before the issue is the 'disruptive nature of his conduct', and I welcome whatever remedy will either address those instances of disruptive conduct (which have been listed here) effectively, or end them altogether. -- <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanFreisling_b27b.html" title="User:RyanFreisling">User:RyanFreisling</a> <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanFreisling_aab0.html" title="User talk:RyanFreisling">@</a> 05:14, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>He's allowed to remove messages from his own talk page. It's not particularly friendly and it's discouraged, but it is allowed, and I don't know any admin who will block over it (there have been numerous dicussions around this issue on the admin noticeboards involving many different admins and many different editors). Removing good faith notices and refusing to discuss things with certain editors is not in the spirit of wikipedia (as well as being somewhat, um, childish), but I doubt that edit warring over the notices is likely to improve his outlook. Edit warring on the image pages themselves is out of bounds, but that's resolved now and not an ongoing problem. Pages bans per the probation are intended to prevent further disruption to allow other editors to get on with editing; I don't see that banning him from editing those images would have any purpose now, as long as he allows the fair use evaluation process to proceed. What else would you like done? You say you don't want him banned, but above you cite his admissions as grounds for a permablock. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 05:41, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I never edit warred over a single notice Zer0 deleted from his user page... as doing so would be lowering myself to that same, childish level.</dd>
<dd>I certainly hope his revert warring over image tags, etc. won't be an ongoing problem - but I only have your promises to that effect and we are each alone responsible for our conduct. No one can guarantee the actions of another, and Zer0 himself has not made a commitment to try once again to avoid edit warring - in fact, he's instead <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Thatcher131&amp;diff=98216664&amp;oldid=98203762" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Thatcher131&amp;diff=98216664&amp;oldid=98203762" rel="nofollow">threatened to use proxies to avoid accountability</a> - more questionable and non-collaborative conduct that violates the spirit (if not the letter) of his probation. So I remain less confident than you may be that his conduct is 'resolved and not an ongoing problem'.</dd>
<dd>Hmmm, since it was only after Zer0 admitted misrepresenting himself and gaming AfD and 3RR in such an egregious and mean-spirited way (and accusing others of cabalistic behavior) that I made that permabanning comment, perhaps the most logical and WP-protecting response would be to block him from participation in AfD (in which I myself have rarely participated)? Can he temporarily be blocked for even 1RR, as others have been? Would that be appropriate, given his violations of probation and given your viewpoint and desire to support his 'rehabilitation'?

<dd>I cant be part fo a cabal and not part of one because it doesnt exist. You cannot take the parts you like out of a testimony as true then dismiss the rest as false. You say you have no axe to grind but I find it odd we run into eachother again when you have no interest at all in conspiracy articles, yet had great interest in me when you thought I was rex and about 5 people and 3 RFCU's later, you have been proven wrong. The fact that you would now attempt to negate all the information provided and call me a liar, then accept only information that would serve to hurt me, is quite perplexing indeed. I never accused Ryan of being part of a cabal btw because they never were, their issue with me dates way back when I defended Rex and as Thatcher has seen their accusations continued for quite some time and many many RFCU's later. I again ask Ryan to stop checking my contribs. Thanks. Also I choose to ignore Ryan because I left the debate alone, we were discussing on the image, why discuss there and on my talk page?

If I was telling the truth then you should file an Arbcom on everyone involved as its quite detrimental. Then you get to gather information on everyone involved to prove its true to ArbCom =). Do not worry I will help you. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 14:33, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Your illogical and disruptive swipes (whether against an imaginary cabal, or me) are becoming more and more foolish all the time. Zer0, you should just leave it be, stop accusing others of organized disruption of Wikipedia, and stop doing so yourself. You won't cast any hooks into me, as I stand by my actions. You, apparently, do not. -- <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanFreisling_b27b.html" title="User:RyanFreisling">User:RyanFreisling</a> <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanFreisling_aab0.html" title="User talk:RyanFreisling">@</a> 14:52, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>For what it's worth, I wouldn't assume that Nuclear is necessarily wrong about the "most wanted" image. The Department of Defense has apparently announced that the image is public domain,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Possibly_unfree_images&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=98245846" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Possibly_unfree_images&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=98245846" rel="nofollow">[128]</a>, and several companies have produced reproductions of the image without obstacle. Given that the US was the occupational government of Iraq at the time, the issue of whether the US had the right to release that image into the public domain is an interesting one. (And if they don't, we may need to start removing links to the Iraqi most wanted page as a possible copyright infringement). I'm looking forward to seeing how it plays out on the <a href="../../../p/o/s/Wikipedia%7EPossibly_unfree_images_5fcf.html" title="Wikipedia:Possibly unfree images">possibly unfree images</a> page. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheronJ_75b8.html" title="User:TheronJ">TheronJ</a> 04:56, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Tricky. Does the article ban block content or just behavior? Certainly if Devalover resumed the edit war over the linkspam, it would be a blockable offense. But if KF makes other suggestions and Devalover implements them in a non-disruptive manner, with respect for cooperation, consensus, and other good things, should that be an offense? I'm not sure. I've asked for further clarification. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 04:59, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would argue this <i>is</i> the edit war. This is not a new discussion about how to improve the article. The edits <a href="../../../k/y/n/User%7EKyndFellow_c239.html" title="User:KyndFellow">User:KyndFellow</a> is requesting are similar to those over which he has edit-warred in the past (c.f. <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Sex_tourism_Evidence_869d.html#POV_edits_by_Mr._Knodel" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Sex tourism/Evidence">/Evidence#POV edits by Mr. Knodel</a>). Without arguing whether or not there is an offence now, I would like it to be addressed before it becomes an offence that would involve sanctions toward Devalover, who probably isn't aware of the full extent of the problem.</dd>

<dd>Prior to KyndFellow's communication to Devalover, I asked about this in <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Sex_tourism_fb50.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for arbitration/Sex tourism">Wikipedia talk:Requests for arbitration/Sex tourism</a>.

<dd>KyndFellow's behavior suggests he is highly motivated to continue editing the article by whatever means is available to him.

<dd>At the very least, Devalover has to take responsibility for any edit he makes, and if they are disruptive, he falls under remedy 2. Given his user page, I expect he will avoid this trap.

<dd>As a long time advocate of KyndFellow, I would like to state that KyndFellow had cooperated with Devalover already in the past. Devalover has, in my impression, established himself as an independant editor and is (by his own account) an experienced editor (he claims he normally edits under a different account), so I don't see any problem in KyndFellow's wish to cooperate with Devalover. The relationship between KyndFellow and Devalover should not be any different, and Devalover recused himself from participating in the recent arbitration, and that decision was not questioned; so if Devalover has so far not been considered a meat-puppet, he should not be considered a meat-puppet now either... I would consider it inconsistant and possibly paranoid. So, to conclude, if Devalover wants to take advice from KyndFellow, he ought to be free to do so.</dd>
<dd>Essentially, I think we all have the same view on all of this, and that we do not dispute the ruling of the arbcom. But because I am an advocate, I feel obliged to say something on behalf of my advocee... / <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Chess_65ea.html" title="User:Fred Chess">Fred</a>-<a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFred_Chess_b7b5.html" title="User talk:Fred Chess">Chess</a> 11:37, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
