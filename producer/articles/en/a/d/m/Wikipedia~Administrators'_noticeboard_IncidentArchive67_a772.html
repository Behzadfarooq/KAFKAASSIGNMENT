<p>I've seen quite enough of wheel warring lately, and the template mentioned above only seems to encourage it. Wikipedia works on consensus, not unilateralism, and while being bold or ignoring rules may be acceptable at times, warring over it should never be. <b>Since the 3RR is enforced against revert warring, isn't it about time we enforce some rule against wheel warring?</b> Please visit <a href="../../../w/h/e/WP%7EWHEEL_fbcc.html" title="WP:WHEEL">WP:WHEEL</a> and join the discussion. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 23:59, 16 January 2006 (UTC) <small>comments about this subject here will be copied to WP:WHEEL's talk page.</small></p>

<dd>I don't think wheel warring will ever stop until the community can finally agree on a workable <a href="../../../r/f/d/WP%7ERFDA_5218.html" title="WP:RFDA">de-adminship</a> process. Many people seem to think this would be a terrible idea, that it would encourage trolls and so forth, but I see no reason why we can't come up with a sensible process for this.

<dd>Are you saying you don't trust the community Phil/Snowspinner? I am in full agreement with the rattlesnake.

<dd>One trivial implementation of this would be for adminship to be for a limited period of time -- off the top of my head, say a year. This would allow the community to deal with those who go power-mad by the appearance of a few new buttons by simply not re-appointing them, rather than creating a whole new process (which would by its nature be "trial-like") to deal with it. Not that I expect this to happen, since it is the nature of bureacracies to perpetuate themselves. But it's a thought. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 05:49, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The only problem I see with 'term limits' on adminship is that it would increase the number of RFA votes going on... adding re-appointments to the new requests. However, this would completely change the nature of adminship... to remain admins people would have to be supported by the <b>current</b> community rather than just 'being good' for three months (about the bare minimum currently) to get the appointment and thereafter having much wider lattitude to bend/break the rules than regular users. Setting the 'term clock' for all existing admins to start when the policy was implemented would give plenty of time for notification and adjusting to the new situation... but such a change would require overwhelming community support. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><sub><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></sub></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 14:19, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Remember, 90% of admins, at least, are pretty uncontentious (at least, their use of admin abilities is uncontentious - everyone gets some crank angry with them!). Is it worth essentially swamping the existing RFA system (which gets relatively little community participation, even from admins, as it is) in order to catch a small number of people?

<dd>I agree that 90% of admins are probably uncontentious. Anyone here think I'm contentious? (-: However, I'm sure that I've made a rather sizable share of potential enemies that might be vindicative enough to want to vote me out, and I'm sure that every other admin has as well. Because of that, I tend to think that this sort of thing isn't really a good idea unless someone can figure out a way of discounting vindicative votes. <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJYolkowski_a02b.html" title="User:JYolkowski">JYolkowski</a> // <a href="../../../j/y/o/User_talk%7EJYolkowski_46ed.html" title="User talk:JYolkowski">talk</a> 23:45, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>I know that I can't have a voice now, but I would like for this user to stop harassing and stalking people. When someone says to him that they don't want to talk to him, he should stop. He has a habit of following people around (myself included), writing to me, writing to other people I am talking to, leaving personal attacks galore, and general abuse. In my personal opinion, he should be permabanned over it, as it is beyond a joke, and its not just me that he has attacked. Go and have a look through my talk page history, and my user page history, and indeed through his contributions. I am sure that you will see that there is comprehensive evidence of his abuse. I had asked for him to leave me alone, but to date not a single person has even so much as had a word to him about it. It is not merely a matter of him lying about me. He is a significant harasser, and is destroying the community. I ask please for admins to deal with him before he destroys this project even more.

<dd>I do, indeed, invite any and all interested parties to very closely examine the edit history of <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">User talk:Zordrac</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/3/User_talk%7E203.122.230.206.html" title="User talk:203.122.230.206">User talk:203.122.230.206</a> and other similar pages; you will see that what Zordrac is really asking for is the right to make malicious and knowingly false accusations against other users but to have it deemed "stalking" for those other users to defend themselves against his smear campaigns. I am collecting the evidence against him at <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_Zordrac_1d9c.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar/Zordrac">User:Antaeus Feldspar/Zordrac</a>, but I'll call attention to a particularly egregious example, namely the false claims he made against me at User:Zordrac/Poetlister: "08:16, 23 December 2005 User:Antaeus Feldspar, wrote to Zordrac supporting Lulu and implying that they both would stalk Zordrac until either he stopped trying to get Poetlister's ban reversed, or else was banned from Wikipedia. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zordrac&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=32414326" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zordrac&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=32414326" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>" Of course, one only need to check the diff that Zordrac provided to see that it bears no resemblance whatever to the quite serious accusations he has levelled. Zordrac whines for sympathy, telling everyone "I had asked for him to leave me alone" but what he isn't mentioning is that he refuses to leave <i>me</i> alone, that he is continuing his malicious slander against me even now. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 19:12, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As I pointed out on his talk page when you brought this issue up, I believe (although I could certainly be mistaken) that permanent diff links are affected when page revisions are deleted. A check of the deletion log indicates that page revisions WERE deleted from <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">User talk:Zordrac</a>, so it is theoretically possible that the diff he linked to is not the one that he intended to. Then again, he did actively lie about his identity up until such point as compelling evidence was slammed under his nose, so I can't say whether or not he's doing that now. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlu_Aardvark_ff0c.html" title="User:Blu Aardvark">Blu Aardvark</a> | <sup><a href="../../../b/l/u/User_talk%7EBlu_Aardvark_4b92.html" title="User talk:Blu Aardvark">(talk)</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Blu_Aardvark_5a61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Blu Aardvark">(contribs)</a></sup> 23:51, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ah, I see, I didn't catch what you meant when you mentioned it there. Theoretically, then, yes, there could potentially have been two edits by me to <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">User talk:Zordrac</a> and a diff which pointed to one of those before the deletion-and-partial-restoration could, theoretically, have become a diff to the other afterwards. However, since the diff comes straight from User:Zordrac/Poetlister, and names a specific revision as its starting point, this means that there would have had to be <i>two</i> consecutive edits. Of those two edits, Zordrac would have had to have requested from Merovingian that Merovingian delete the very edit that Zordrac himself was providing diffs of as evidence of my wrongdoing. <b>And</b> -- this is possibly the least plausible part of all -- the edit would have had to reveal personal information about Zordrac, or presumably Merovingian would not have removed it -- but Zordrac, while going into great detail about all the nefarious things that I purportedly said in that edit, made <i>no mention</i> of such a serious offense. I hope everyone can see the implausibility of that story. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 01:09, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Repeated incivility, personal attacks, accusations of "bullying" see <a href="../../../i/a/n/User_talk%7EIanDavies_d61c.html" title="User talk:IanDavies">User talk:IanDavies</a>, sections LSHTM and Personal attacks. "Personal attacks" is only available through History now, as he's removed it with the summary "revert bullying by small dog" - I guess we have Benapgar to thank for the new trend in referring anything an Admin does that you don't like as "bullying", although I fail to see how 4 diffs of his posts is bullying. There's a good bit more, but basically I would like a non-involved admin to take a look and see if anything can be done. He's not happy about the sources for an <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_School_of_Hygiene_%26_Tropical_Medicine_9ee4.html" title="London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine">article</a>, started an edit war, I was pulled in and stated they look fine to me and to stop the edit war. He has given no specifics on content he feels may be inaccurate, although he has been asked repeatedly to do so. I suggested if he still had an issue, to try <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">WP:DR</a> or put it on Article Rfc. He seems to have confused Article Rfc with User Rfc, and taken that as a "threat". He also directly implied the other editor of the page is a "spotty little network zit". If someone would explain to him the difference between article Rfc and user Rfc, and between personal attacks and rants about Admins, I would be grateful. It may be helpful to also view his contribs to my page, the article talk page, and the page of User:Lshtm as well.

<dd>I do have one idea. I know we have a template for AOL users that we put on talk pages to explain that they use dynamic IPs and such and that warnings might not be seen by the right user, etc. Could we put a notice up for the IPs that G uses? It could prevent what happened with 212.120.225.219 today where he was warned multiple times before blocking, so Gibraltarian had free reign for half an hour. The notice wouldn't say that we block immediately, but G doesn't exactly hide himself. We'll know when it's him. Thoughts? 212.120.224.0 - 212.120.231.255 is the only IP he's ever used as far as I know. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">(cat scratches)</a></sup> 20:56, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have a better idea.........leave me alone! I will not allow racists to take over the Gibraltar articles. NO WAY!</p>
<p>Yes.....I'm a banned user.....but WHY??? Only because YOU woohookitty took it upon yourself to ban me with no justification! To TML, MY comments are not hate filled...it is Ecemaml who has the anti-Gibraltar agenda, and is proving himself to be the obsessed bigoted racist I always said he was. He has created this dispute purposely, with the sole intention of getting me banned.....now if that doesn't come under the definition of troll I don't know what will. He posted his "evidence". To be frank I felt he should be ignored.....treated with the contempt that he deserves. However I replied. I have a right not to have my reply tampered with. There is no possible justification for banning me.....and anyone actually looking into the whole history of this case will see that. Ecemaml has created this entire dispute purposely with the sole intention of getting me banned. How can it be that when I revert him it's "vandalism", but him reverting me isn't. How can it be that him openely calling me a liar (which I'm not) is not considered a personal attack, but me calling him an obsessed troll (which he is) is. How can it be that he can post anything he likes, whether true or not, whether NPOV or not........but whenever I factual and NPOV posts, he follows me around WP, reverting almost everything I do....yet does so with impunity. It is simply NOT acceptable to SP an evidence page, as I have a RIGHT to post matters in my defence (not that I have done anything requiring defending). Woohookitty, you have already proved yourself to be a beacon of unfairness, so perhaps you should leave matters of fairness to others. Ecemaml must learn to deal with his massive chip on his shoulder over Gibraltar, and also that WP is NOT the place for him to spread his fascist inspired propaganda, nor revisionist history. His sole intent on editing the Gibraltar articles has been this.........it is clear for all to see. I am sure this is not what WP is meant for. Gibraltarian</p>

<dd>I don't really care what you think Ecemaml. The edits you refer to were written by yourself, and are far from POV, in many cases invented, in other cases argumentative and POV. Whenever I write anything for an article I ensure that it is factually correct and NPOV......you do neither. BTW, note him calling me a liar above......is this not a personal attack?

<dd>(2 ecs) I've always wondered about this - in other Wikipedias, such as nl (Dutch), they have an admin only mailing list where they can discuss matters. (Of course, they have less than 100 administrators.) Would it be possible for the developers to code a page that only administrators could view (sort of like viewing deleted pages), so that we could have <i>two</i> noticeboards, one for longer discussions, and another for administrator-only discussions where we could discuss things that non-admins shouldn't be seeing, or simple straightforward requests by non-admins who could post there? (One example I can think of is when several people asked Curps for his bot's algorithm, but he couldn't because the vandals could simple read it off this page.) Thoughts on this?

<dd>I would support an administrator use only page, but i see no reason for it to be hidden. Simply making it editable only be admins should be perfectly sufficient, and thats easily accomplished by using hte current protect flags. That way legit non-admins can still watch whats going on.

It may be useful to split between notices <b>about</b> admins (e.g. "omg rouge!!!!one") and notices <b>for</b> admins. Or something. It would also help if we were a bit more stern in removing posts that don't belong here. Or <b>simply have a page per day</b>, we're pretty close to that now, anyway. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 01:41, 18 January 2006 (UTC)

But not all sock puppet issues are handled by requesting Chekuser or reporting its results, whoch is pretty much the sole purpose of the latter page. I suggest that <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Sockpuppets_ba78.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Sockpuppets">Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Sockpuppets</a> be un-redirected, and be the palce to reprot suspected sock activity, and to debate wheter known socks are or are not abusive, and what actions to take (blocks, and if so for how long, etc) while the requests for checkuser page stays strictly as a request for soemone with checkuser rights to act, and a palce for such people to report the results, or to give reasons for declining to act. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 16:23, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Allow me to also sugest the creation of Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Unblock requests where requests for removal of inappropriate blocks could be posted -- idealy we could figure out a way for the msg that a blocked user gets to offer a chance to post a request on this page, as in case the blockign admin is off-line or otherwise not availabel by email. This could also be the place for people who dispute the length or propriity of a block to discuss the matter and get soem sort of geoup approval before removing or reducing a block, as has been discussed here before. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 16:23, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I second DES's remarks about WP:AN/SOCK. Rather than "unblock requests", it should be "complaints about admins" (or something like that) to also deal with quibbles about improper deletions or protections. <b>However</b>, it may in fact be more useful to merge AN and ANI together (since the distinction is far from clear) and replace that with a page per day (Wikipedia:Admin noticeboard/2006 february 19 etc), with <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a> redirecting to the current one.

<li>Personally, I don't like the idea of a page that non-admins cannot edit, for several reasons. First, the issues are often <i>about</i> a non-admin and certainly that person should be able to address the issues. Second, there are long-term editors who are just as policy-savvy as some admins and making a page smaller is no valid reason for preventing an editor from commenting on an issue. Finally, I think that it would be a drastic solution with minimal effect since I don't see that many comments from non-admins. I agree that the page needs to be smaller (one of my comments was deleted yesterday after an apparent edit conflict caused another editor to cut and paste an entire section), but not at the cost of preventing non-admins from commenting. Remember, being an admin is supposed to be "no big deal". -- <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/s/1/User_talk%7EDS1953_dfdb.html" title="User talk:DS1953"><font color="green">talk</font></a></sup> 14:16, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Ah, it's the weekly wheel war again. Note that what Tony considers "being in communication with the redeleter" apparently consists of simply telling him to not do that again (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:R._fiend&amp;diff=35631012&amp;oldid=35630479" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:R._fiend&amp;diff=35631012&amp;oldid=35630479" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>). I would point out the <b><a href="../../../a/a/p/WP%7EAAP_7ffe.html" title="WP:AAP">Admin accountability poll</a></b>, where so far 35 users (including Tony) have stated that admins should be held more accountable, and 38 users have suggested that wheel warring is unacceptable, with Tony and a sockpuppet as the sole dissenters. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 12:14, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That argument would carry more weight had these actually been taken to DRV prior and the closure been endorsed. I notice that there was ongoing discussion involving these bulk nominations, and opportunity for a measured outcome.

<p>I don't see the point in wasting time over it. Both articles were obviously keepers. My actions made both articles available to the editing processs, to the encyclopedia (in case, you know, someone actually decided they wanted to read it), and to the deletion process, if anyone wanted to try it again. r-fiend and I settled the matter of his redeletion amicably and the articles, considerably expanded in the case of the Tally one, were a credit to the encyclopedia. To describe that as disruption is wrong. Sjakkalle's good faith action, some four hours later, in blocking me for what he perceived as ongoing disruption, was wrong. At most, it could be said that my actions disrupted an ongoing wrongful action of witholding two perfectly good articles from the encyclopedia. This of course is an admirable object to strive for. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 14:43, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The "point" in "wasting time over it" is to maintain harmony with other editors. I happen to think you're in the right here, but so what? You have to deal with reality, and reality is, you're wasting far more time and effort fighting this fight than you would have spent researching and writing good articles on these subjects in your own userspace and offering them to <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a> as new, inclusion-worthy versions of the articles in question.

<dd>I don't see how this applies. For one thing, Tony did not choose the path of least resistance, given the amount of resistance to this action. Secondly, if Tony did choose the path of least resistance, i.e. rewriting the article in his own userspace and offering it to DRV, chaos wouldn't ensue. Harmony would. Chaos is only ensuing because Tony's disregarding it, not because he's avoiding it. — <b><a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Phil</a></b> <i><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">Welch</a></i> <small><a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_Poll_b43b.html" title="User:Katefan0/Poll">Are you a fan of the band Rush?</a></small> 02:33, 19 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The problem I have here is that Tony should know better. The vote was for delete, Tony. If you had a problem with that, you could've taken it up at DR instead of acting unilaterally after deciding that the articles were "good for the encyclopedia". Sorry man, but that's not your call. It's why we have AfD and DR. It's the latest in a long line of incidents where Tony seems to ignore consensus and does his own thing without discussion. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">(cat scratches)</a></sup> 12:08, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>None of these were brought up within the guild, nor where they part of Guild work. A Wikipedian made people aware of a vote in a subject to which they believed we would like to vote in and be aware of. Maybe this was Vote Stacking, but it has nothing to do with the Guild, and I can show you at least one member of the <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_Committee_a514.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee">Arbitration Committee</a> partaking in the very same behaviour.--Irishpunktom\<sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishpunktom_3aca.html" title="User talk:Irishpunktom">talk</a></sup> 16:11, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's misleading - this isn't about informing people to get additional input. It's about informing people to get specific input that helps the case you want to make.

<dd>I'm not quite sure how to respond to the above. Let me first say that I find BYT's virtual wiki-stalking of me either very flattering or very creepy, I'm not altogether certain which. Let me also say that if urging people to vote (without a even a specific recommendation) is a violation of etiquette, then I have done so and apologize. However, after having looked at the Catholic Alliance thingie, I am not and have never been a part of any organization or cabal on WP (or anywhere else), formally or informally (unlike, I gather <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrandonYusufToropov_88ae.html" title="User:BrandonYusufToropov">BYT</a>, who is/was a member of such a cabal). The people that I contacted had all voted on the issue previously, and the vast majority of them I do not know and don't wish to know and have had no previous contact with (and not all of whom voted with me). If, even with the above caveats in mind, this is still a violation of something or other, please let me know. Ironically, the idea to do this came from <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrandonYusufToropov_88ae.html" title="User:BrandonYusufToropov">BYT</a>.

Unfortunately, I have been unsuccessful in my attempts to get the user participating on the talk page, and to get the user to understand why violation of fair use opens Wikipedia up to legal liability. Protecting the page does no good, as once the protection was removed, the fair use violation content was immediately re-inserted by Jacrosse. I would very much appreciate the help of other administrators in resolving this fair use incident. —thames 14:42, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Condemned(band) is not a sock puppet. I made the account because my account Led-zep kept logging of on my home computer, and when i made it i had no clue you couldn't have 2 or more accounts, falling under the protection of the heading newbie.i am fine without it, i dont care. i can make a web page, i dont need to use your site as free web hosting. Last I address DESiegels comments that I didn't react well to his comments. I got what you were saying and was intersted in finding out your use of the word "most", I just wanted to know why some pages that dont fit the critera are left up, you told me and i stopped asking questions. I can answer for all actions that I have done. If you want to know more about what I have done and why, post it on <a href="../../../l/e/d/User_talk%7ELed-zep_e8c0.html" title="User talk:Led-zep">User talk: Led-zep</a>. I wish to settle all matters with you to end the misundersandings. I also would like to adress the policy of banning innocent poeple. My school IP adress is banned by you from editing, The state school system seems to run off only two IP addresses, that mean you banned 1/2 the TN school population. I more over was not the one that changed the Kurt Cobain Site, Nor the Eminem site. A friend of mine, whom I am not going to metion, did both, and only after reciving the notic that vandilzim is an offence stopped. I appoligize for all offence commited by me, and wish for better relations in the futer. Thank you all: Led-zep</p>

<dd>There are over 127 million people in Japan. If you devoted three words to complaining about each of them individually, you would have 1.78 gigabytes of text ranting about Japan.

They are continuing to investigate, but a CheckUser of this range (thanks for that feature, Brion) shows basically nothing but DickyRobert vandalism; we lose little by blocking it.

<dd>I was considering waiting until Zephram jumped to the Rudolf Nixon account after Peace Inside is blocked, but sure, I have no problem with blocking both sockpuppets at the same time. Although there's only a few edits from Rudolf Nixon, I've no doubt that he was created as a "backup" sockpuppet. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 17:41, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Apparently this user is upset by bible articles on Wikipedia. He has created three simultaneous "centralized discussions" on the subject (See {{<a href="../../../c/e/n/Template%7ECent_b541.html" title="Template:Cent">cent</a>}}) which kind of defies the point of being "centralized", and has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=-Ril-&amp;limit=50&amp;namespace=3" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=-Ril-&amp;limit=50&amp;namespace=3" rel="nofollow">spammed</a> nearly a hundred talk pages on the subject. Also, he has a userpage intended for vote stacking to delete bible articles, and links to it from his signature.

<dd>I received one of Ril's messages, presumably since I have in the past voted to merge on individual Bible verses. I think it's reasonable to wonder whether we want (potentially) well over 30,000 articles on individual verses, especially since the verse construction is artificial to begin with. (And that's without getting into whether this would set a precedent for the <a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%27an.html" title="Qur'an">Qur'an</a>, <i><a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlas_Shrugged_7452.html" title="Atlas Shrugged">Atlas Shrugged</a></i>, etc.) Wouldn't it make more sense to group by topic or maybe chapter, and have the individual verses as redirects? Ril makes some sensible points here. Regardless of your view on this - and I know there are reasonable arguments on both sides - I don't see how any of this amounts to "disruptive trolling". It looks to me like a <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good faith</a> discussion on a policy issue. <tt><a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrotalus_horridus_5cc6.html" title="User:Crotalus horridus">Crotalus horridus</a> <small>(<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECrotalus_horridus_e0ed.html" title="User talk:Crotalus horridus">TALK</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Crotalus_horridus_e95d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Crotalus horridus">CONTRIBS</a>)</small></tt> 22:53, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree that the AFD's are fairly clear - e.g. <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Matthew_1%7E5_8e5d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Matthew 1:5">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Matthew 1:5</a> had the results <b>Delete</b> 19, Merge or Delete 5, Merge 6, Keep 14. Total Deletes, including Merge/Delete is 24 compared to 14 to keep. So that's a <b>delete</b> outcome, not a keep.</p>
<p>The question is whether every single one of the first 200 verses of Matthew notable in its own right? Or in other words <b>do we really need all of the following articles</b>?</p>

<p>Oh not again! Despite -Ril-'s long campaign, AfD has demonstrated over many months that there is no consensus to delete good Bible verse articles. When his AfDs failed last time he tried to 'manage' his own poll at <a href="../../../b/i/b/Wikipedia%7EBible_verses_f874.html" title="Wikipedia:Bible verses">Wikipedia:Bible verses</a> - which evidently didn't give him the result he wanted. Now, since returning from his arbcom suspension for trolling, he's back at it. Whatever your view of Bible verses, this is just troublemaking. He is, of course, free to keep nominating them - and he will keep getting 'no consensus' = default keep. This is a boring as schools debates. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><sup>ask?</sup></a> 23:46, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not sure why this is such a contentious issue. I personally do not see the study of Bible verses as much different from the study of varieties of insects or Songhai monarchs. All are obscure subjects of interest to only a small group. Perhaps this is because I personally am quite areligious and do not see them of more them of much more than academic interest. It also might be because I am not American, and failed to understand that for some that any interest in religion is an ultra political demarcation of one's position in a "culture war." - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 00:07, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agreed - as some of the comments above suggest, going through AfD sets up a false delete/don't delete dichotomy, with a strong (two-thirds) presumption in favour of keep. But take the articles on Matthew 1:1-5 - this is for me, unarguably Biblecruft. Wikipedia is not a biblical commentary. There should be articles on topics, and on the odd <i>really</i> notable verse. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/d/2/User_talk%7ERd232_56da.html" title="User talk:Rd232">talk</a></sup> 00:16, 16 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Having in the past been at the receiving end of a stalker and received various threats when reverting vandalism, I think the comment above is not merely a threat but a serious one. And yes, a threat to smear and defame another user if the person making the threat does not get their way qualifies as a legal threat. Similar threats have led to immediate indefinite blocks. Before JT imposed the week threat I had imposed an indefinite one, with a template to that effect on their user page. Their behaviour in making that threat to smear another user on an off-WP site, and engage in defamation was appalling and needs a tough response.

<dd>Well, I still don't think it's a threat of legal action <i>per se,</i> but I never disagreed that it was block-able. It was a violation of policies in two areas. I just think that "I'll add you to my black list" isn't the same thing as "I will sue you or call the cops." It's blockable, but not, I personally feel, under <i>that</i> rationale. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:58, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For any who haven't seen it, the blacklist is more than a simple listing; it includes personal information about editors, with vague threats about future actions. Since the subject recently filed a lawsuit against Wikimedia and 200 unnamed Internet posters, the vague threats may be include legal action. The disclosure of personal info should, and maybe does, have the same status as <a href="../../../n/l/t/WP%7ENLT_0807.html" title="WP:NLT">WP:NLT</a>. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 03:20, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's astounding to me the double standards and bullshit that comes from you people. Your so called policies on wikipedia change like most people change their clothes. You make up whatever you please to justify your actions, twisting off site listings into "legal threats" to justify violation of basic human rights and your commission and support of libel. I never created a page about me on your sewer porn site -- a group of internet stalkers did, and your so called "Designated Representative" is a dog in the eyes of God. By the way, he has been sent dozens of letters and emails about this article. What has he done? Nothing, he doesn't even respond. Why? Because he is a COWARD and HUMAN SLIME, IMHO.</p>
<p>BTW, JTDIRL, I know about you and what you are and you have been listed in Merkeylaw as well. ANYONE WHO GOES NEAR THE ARTICLE WILL BE LISTED. I have a suggestion, delete the article, and the site and I will go away, and you'll never be bothered with me again. Don't bother violating my free speech rights by blocking me -- I created networking when most of you were whacking off to McCalls magazine in your adolesence. I am also one of the authors of Linux. You really think that an expert in networking like me can be stopped by a group of morons like you people? Dream on. Keep libeling me, and I'll keep listing you on my site.

<p>It would be a good idea as a preface to this posting to mention that there was a previous incident which involved both myself and this user, who has made a habit of vandalizing and egregiously insulting other users. My first contact with him was when he <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:TJive&amp;diff=22590206&amp;oldid=22583572" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:TJive&amp;diff=22590206&amp;oldid=22583572" rel="nofollow">vandalized</a> my user page. He followed me around various articles I would edit, as you can see if you glance through my edit histories (mostly during September) as well as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=211.30.205.254" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=211.30.205.254" rel="nofollow">211.30.205.254</a> - Look at early September.</li>

</ul>
<p>He has edited a wide variety of articles (video games, sci-fi, and so forth) but the contentious lies in political-related topics, including the pages of <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam_War_129f.html" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a>, <a href="../../../f/i/d/Fidel_Castro_ecc2.html" title="Fidel Castro">Fidel Castro</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Endowment_for_Democracy_cbdc.html" title="National Endowment for Democracy">National Endowment for Democracy</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Chinese_sentiment_50b4.html" title="Anti-Chinese sentiment">Anti-Chinese sentiment</a>, Americofascism, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-communism.html" title="Anti-communism">Anti-communism</a>, <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult_of_personality.html" title="Cult of personality">Cult of personality</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Epoch_Times_4753.html" title="The Epoch Times">The Epoch Times</a>, and so on. I was in some cases involved in prior or ongoing disputes with other editors, who actually attempted to resolve a specific issue rather than simply follow around my contributions and undo them. He would add on reverts to the pile of others in an attempt to compound my problems. It came to the point where I was having to revert a set of a dozen articles once a day or more, simply because of this one user.</p>
<p>Regrettably, Rama decided that I was being "disruptive" in not having properly discussed my issues with this user pertaining to <i>one</i> particular article ("Anti-Chinese sentiment") and blocked me for 24 hours (though the block remained for longer). I posted a defense of my actions (mentioned at the top) on ANI to (largely) deafening silence. While I had accumulated a couple thousand edits by this point, the fetishization of ritual Wikipedian processes made it so that editing with what little time I had was fruitless as any small point of contention (literally including a change of one word) could lead to weeks' worth of involvement which I could not spare. And in the midst of this there are administrators who choose to moderate the worthiness of editors' individual content disputes, further frustrating meaningful involvement by any but the most time-possessive and fiercely determined editors.</p>
<p>I decided to dabble a little bit in Wikipedia again on New Year's Day, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=No_Gun_Ri_incident&amp;diff=33496848&amp;oldid=32417581" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=No_Gun_Ri_incident&amp;diff=33496848&amp;oldid=32417581" rel="nofollow">moving</a> an article in which the name itself featured in a previous dispute. I made a small number of minor edits in the coming days, including at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Peekskill_Riots&amp;diff=34534822&amp;oldid=32748095" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Peekskill_Riots&amp;diff=34534822&amp;oldid=32748095" rel="nofollow">Peekskill Riots</a>, which was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Peekskill_Riots&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=34534822" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Peekskill_Riots&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=34534822" rel="nofollow">changed</a> in a few hours.

<p>The "No Gun Ri incident/massacre" title dispute was resolved with other editors and with <i>no</i> input from this user.

<li>Instead of discussing on the talk pages, he resorted to removing my comments from the talk pages where I address this issue.</li>

<p>This is some extra information that is not contained in the original Talk page:</p>

<li>The list of IPs he has posted from includes: 83.237.11.151, 83.237.11.92, 83.237.60.5, 83.237.11.226, 83.237.11.152, 83.237.242.2, 83.237.108.102, 85.140.83.108, 83.237.108.242, 83.237.242.94. All of these IPs seem to be from a pool for an ISP: mtu.ru, mtu-net.ru.</li>
<li>The "revert war" has been going on since November, I only noticed it today.</li>
<li>I suspected the user was a dotgnu developer, who goes by the "krokas" irc name from googling the IP addresses. In the <a href="../../../k/e/s/User_talk%7EKesla_ebae.html" title="User talk:Kesla">User_talk:Kesla</a> he identified himself as that person.</li>

<p>I'm rather new around here, so apologies if this is not the most appropriate place to bring this up, but I have noticed lately that there have been repeated occurrences of links to the same marketing sites added to many articles. As you might expect, they all come from annonymous editors who contribute nothing but these links. All the IP addresses are similar: User:61.246.78.68, User:61.246.13.189, User:61.246.45.42,User:61.246.46.42, User:61.246.42.126, User:61.246.148.178, User:61.246.76.235... and probably others. If a range of IPs can be blocked and if it's appropriate to do so in this case, I ask that someone go ahead and do it.

<dd>My concern here is, ignoring for a moment using policy rubrics, she's poisoined the well, and disrupted the project. She could easly have stated that "I do not think this voting procedure is legitimate" or "I disagree.". The point of policy is to protect the project from disruption. This was <i>clearly</i> irellivant and she was unwilling to stop using the discussion page to discuss editors. That to me is a violation of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> (Wikipedia is not a discussion board, <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">WP:CIV</a> states that any kind of rudeness (and poisoning the well is very rude) isn't acceptable. <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> not only says repeated accusations (religious bias and vote stacking) is bad, it noticibly doesn't give a damn about the truth value of the accsations.

<dd>We're here to discuss editor action, this isn't an article's talk page. I don't know about malber's complaints, and I don't relaly care all that much to be honest. Blocking MSK certainly improved the tone of the discussion on <a href="../../../i/s/l/Talk%7EIslamofascism_0d82.html" title="Talk:Islamofascism">Talk:Islamofascism</a> and She's got a whole 24 hours to calm down.

<p>As an outsider, it seems MSK is perpetually breaking the fundamental policy of <b>Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia</b>. Users who help the encyclopaedia more than they disrupt it - we want (and with the minimum of disruption, of course:) ); users who cause more disruption than good they do, we do not want. Full stop. Whatever the reason for this is irrelevant - and I'm afraid that from what I've seen it's clear that MSK is in the latter category of users, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 23:10, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I wish the notice would include mention of which diff is alleged to violate which policy. It seems that the second diff presented in the evidence is what started the process of blankings and warnings that led to a block. In the second diff, MSK posted, <i>"Void, this section started by BYT to attempt to bypass consensus (especially regarding the vote stacking made by him for getting a false consensus): As you were already told by the admin here previously, get it listed on Articles for Deletion or Articles for Merging.. You already know about this yet you seem to be trying to ignore it.."</i> (italics mine) I fail to see how this merited removal from the Talk page in the first place.

<dd>One, It was incorrect. Two, it was a direct personal comment to BYT. Three, said comment was poisoning the well, something she was explicitly told and agreed not to do. Four, I did not remove that specificly, I removed both the second and third pullet points at once. I was not super concerned with the first, but them together I was dissapointed with. I assumed at first the first comment was irksome but made in good faith.

<dd>Hello Tznkai, thanks for your explanation. I must say however, that I still don't understand what made it OK to remove this post. You say it was incorrect - but factual disputes are not a justification for removal. Neither is making a "personal comment", unless you are alleging it constituted a "personal attack". I see no record MSK agreed not to make personal comments, the diff you provided above about here agreement seems to me to be in regard to conduct on a RfC, if one was to be opened on the limited question of whether to merge the article. And finally, it seems to me from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Islamofascism_%28term%29&amp;diff=35721369&amp;oldid=35720227" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Islamofascism_%28term%29&amp;diff=35721369&amp;oldid=35720227" rel="nofollow">this diff</a> that you did remove this bullet by itself, before the second and third bullet points even existed. Since the second and third bullet points had not even been made yet, it seems that they are irrelevant in justifying the removal of the first bullet point. Unless I am still missing something, it seems to me that their is nothing in this first bullet point by MSK that violated any agreement that she made, that constitutes a personal attack, or that in any other way merits removal from the Talk page. While I certainly disagree with a lot of MSK's behaviour, I don't think we help things by what I will characterize as an over-reation to her first bullet point. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 17:15, 19 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Its a fuzzy logic situation. No one thing is enough to put me at the point of blocking here, its my feeling that the collection of all of these actions showed her unwillingness to remain cooperative, civil, and productive. Remember, article RfCs take place on the article's talk page. It does seem you are correct that I removed it seperatly, and that is a fault of my memory. I do maintain however that the message was innappropriate, if not a blockable offense on its own. Article talk pages are no place for accusations against single editors. There was a clear violation of good faith. " You already know about this yet you seem to be trying to ignore it" and " <font color="red"><b>Void, this section started by BYT to attempt to bypass consensus (especially regarding the vote stacking made by him for getting a false consensus)</b></font>:" combined with the bad faith of the previous sentance suggested a personal attack. " <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> lists that accusitory comments, especially those made in bad faith (also see <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">WP:CIV</a>, <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> are innapropriate. They certainly no place on a user page. I made it very clear I had no patience for such comments, and I used my discretion. The edits were never deleted, they were moved to history. They never should have been made in the first place. MSK had several opportunities, and was invited and then demanded to replace them with civil productive discourse. She chose not to, and instead stand up and down screaming about her right to be nasty. Fuzzy logic kicks in and says that she needs a break from wikipedia, and wikipedia needs a break from her.--<a href="../../../t/z/n/User%7ETznkai_3625.html" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a> 17:59, 19 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you are going to be placing blocks without any specific policy basis you <b>don't</b> want to first be removing the user's vote, editing their talk page comments, threatening them, et cetera. Once you find yourself taking debatable actions (and removing someone's vote should always be 'debatable') you're going to want someone else to do any blocking which <i>might</i> be required. As to 'accusatory comments'... I didn't see similarly aggressive actions being taken towards the 'sock-puppetry' accusations being levelled at MSK by BYT there. At that, once you stretch the policies that far... haven't you made more than a few 'accusatory comments' yourself here? --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><sub><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></sub></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 00:54, 20 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with what CBD said. I don't find her comments about the motives of another user particularly wonderful, but I also don't find your response to it particularly well thought out either. You shouldn't remove her comment, that's a contentious and controversial action. If you disagree with the factual accuracy of her comment, <i>then refute it with the truth</i>, but don't <i><b>remove</b></i> it. To her that's just going to look like you're trying to censor her, which is ver upsetting. I don't think her comment about BYT was a personal attack, but it also wasn't neccessarily conducive to the discussion. On her part, I find it's best to provide a diff or something with the relevant quote if you're going to assert that another user feels a certain way. Either way, I don't think blocking was the way to go here. <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvilphoenix_c3c7.html" title="User:Evilphoenix">Ëvilphoenix</a> <sup><small><b><a href="../../../e/v/i/User_talk%7EEvilphoenix_c095.html" title="User talk:Evilphoenix">Burn!</a></b></small></sup> 03:43, 20 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>As for removing comments, I know I'm in a minority here, but I do that under the auspices of adminstrative and editorial discrestion, as suggested by <a href="../../../r/p/a/WP%7ERPA_efd5.html" title="WP:RPA">WP:RPA</a>. Furthermore, those comments should not exist because wikipedia is not a message board, it is not a battle ground, it is not a sniping area, it is an enyclopedia. The fact that we have all agreed to is that MSK's comments were <i><b>determinental to the discussion, and to the construction and development of the encylopedia</b></i> (see <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">WP:CIV</a> and for kicks, <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>).</dd>
<dd>Furthemore, MSK had several avenues open to her. My talk page, AN/I, AN, RfC, getting her favorite adminstrator to intervene, etc. Comments directed at a user's conduct belong on AN, AN/I, AN/3RR, RfC, RfAr, and <i>user</i> talk pages. That is, as far as I recall, the conclusive and exhaustive list. There is no policy that even suggests that MSK has the right to poison the well, disrupt civil discussion, or accuse BYT of sockpuppetry and vote stacking on the article talk page. She was invited explicitly to restate her objection in any number of ways. She chose not to.</dd>
<dd>Finally, and perhaps most tellingly, when warned of a block, she decided to flout it. Instead of going here on AN/I, responding on my talk page, or other dispute resolution processes, she decided continue adding off topic comments on the article talk page. These were never censored as they remain in the talk page history, and I even left a link to my removal of them. She had many options, and she chose uncivil disruption.--<a href="../../../t/z/n/User%7ETznkai_3625.html" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a> 04:08, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>- The "sockpuppet accusations" thing: <b>For a start, that was in a completely different conversation that took place several days before (the 16th)</b> you started vandalizing the talk page by deleting other peoples' comments and so had nothing to do with this at all. <i>Secondly</i>, See <a href="../../../2/4/2E/User%7E24.34.154.167.html" title="User:24.34.154.167">24.34.154.167</a> (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.34.154.167.html" title="User talk:24.34.154.167">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.34.154.167_0733.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.34.154.167">contribs</a>) - I placed the notice on the pages after finding this out, at the time both the IP's user and talk pages were redlinks and it wasn't clear at all that it was BYT editing anonymously. What happened was after BYT talked about moving the page he used the anonymous IP to make the changes and as the message about it being him on <a href="../../../i/s/l/Talk%7EIslamofascism_%28term%29_80b1.html" title="Talk:Islamofascism (term)">Talk:Islamofascism (term)</a> <i>didn't appear until a few minutes after his anonymous changes</i> and it looked like he was trying to hide the fact that it was him. Digging deeper and looking at the contributions (it seems he's used the IP quite a few times in the past, while not letting anyone know it's him), it was clear it was him, but it was very suspicious behaviour.</li>
<li>- Comments were "detrimental to the development of an encyclopedia"? This is POV-pushing. Drawing attention to vote-stacking is not "detrimental", and actually helps avoid the complete bias of consenus that BYT was aiming to achieve by mass-spamming talk pages of Muslim editors to 'come help us on this vote'. In fact, admin Demi did very much the same in a TfD discussion: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=34541951" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=34541951" rel="nofollow">[39]</a> and similar to you, I deleted it as I thought it was irrelevant to the discussion at the time: I was then reverted and blocked for "deleting other peoples' comments". It's sickening, the double-standards here.</li>
<li>"Warned of a block" - The fact is that you had no authority to block me as I did not do anything blockworthy/against policy. I did not make personal attacks, I was perfectly civil, all I did was bring attention to the fact that very dubious behaviour was going on with regards to the vote.</li>
<li>"These were never censored as they remain in the talk page history, and I even left a link to my removal of them." - The fact remains that you deleted them and so they disappeared from the page. That's censoring comments. The fact that they were in the history is irrelevant: When people read comments they look at the current version, not every change in the edit history. Also, it seems you're trying to fudge the facts here: <b>You only left a link to my deleted comments a few minutes AFTER the third deletion of my vote and comment<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AIslamofascism_%28term%29&amp;diff=35726224&amp;oldid=35725451" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AIslamofascism_%28term%29&amp;diff=35726224&amp;oldid=35725451" rel="nofollow">[40]</a></b>, so you can hardly claim that I was making "disruption": The fact is before you had blocked me you repeatedly deleted my comments and did not make any link to them, censoring any message you didn't agree with from the talk page.</li>
<li>There was no way linking to the administrators' noticeboard about a real thing going on - the diffs made it a fact not an "accusation" - is a "personal attack" and so would qualify under <a href="../../../r/p/a/WP%7ERPA_efd5.html" title="WP:RPA">WP:RPA</a>, but even then you still kept deleting anything I said, even after I made it clear to you that I didn't want you to keep deleting my comments.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Islamofascism_%28term%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=35725451" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Islamofascism_%28term%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=35725451" rel="nofollow">[41]</a> --<i><a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMistress_Selina_Kyle_f76f.html" title="User:Mistress Selina Kyle"><span style="color:#18186b;text-decoration:underline">Mistress Selina Kyle</span></a> <sup><b><span style="color:#800080">(</span></b><a href="../../../m/i/s/User_talk%7EMistress_Selina_Kyle_04f4.html" title="User talk:Mistress Selina Kyle"><span style="color:#18186b;cursor:help;">Α⇔Ω</span></a> ¦ <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Mistress_Selina_Kyle_1a28.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Mistress Selina Kyle"><span style="color:#18186b;cursor:help;">⇒✉</span></a><b><span style="color:#800080">)</span></b></sup></i> 12:06, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I first arrived on the dispute after seeing your notice on <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a> (or was it AN/I?), and subsequent complaints. I told you then to cool down and take it easy. You had been throwing around bad faith accusations and vitrol from the moment I was aware of the dispute forward. Immediatly after I came there, I protected the article, asked what was going on, and set up ground rules. Ground rules you eventually agreed to. Furthermore, my actions are well supported by the simple fact that policy dictates that this is an enyclopedia. There is no free speech, there is no right to poison the well, there is no right to link to AN/I on article talk pages on something that isn't relivant/ is accusatory. Article talk pages are for discussing the article. Occasionally, it can be used for frequent editors on that page to slap each other on the back. These are things that foster good relations and a better encylopedia. Mean nasty, spite comments, accusations of vote statckin and the like do not.</dd>
<dd>I removed no comments before I was aware of the article. I set the ground rules from the time I was adjucating the dispute to the time forward. You don't like it, call for mediation, RFC, another admin, etc. These were all great outs. In fact however, you agreed to it.</dd>
<dd>Starting from the top then: 1. User conduct including sockpuppetry has certain channels. None of them are article talk pages.</dd>
<dd>2. You are making an assumptions on someone else's character, one that you hold and I've yet to see compelling consensus or evidence for. (see, the nice thing here, is if other people think so, I get overuled. Other people include people who aren't you. Other admins, experianed wikipedians, and people who don't care about islam realted articles are preferable). Also, this is not a votes for deletion. I have no idea what Demi did or didn't do other than Demi has not said a word on the relevant talk page. Very little of what you did here was constructive, as I have pointed out time and time again, and so have other editors on this subject.</dd>
<dd>3. You accused an editor of compromised integrity. Furthermore you linked it to religious bais. Furthermore you dragged in another admin's words that were only slightly relelvant. Then you used an article's talk page to poison the well and advertise a section on AN/I. To quote the blocking policy "Sysops may, at their judgement, block IP addresses or usernames that disrupt the normal functioning of Wikipedia.". I believe strongly that no matter what we argue about the specific wordking of <a href="../../../r/p/a/WP%7ERPA_efd5.html" title="WP:RPA">WP:RPA</a> <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">WP:CIV</a>, this block falls well within my discretion and judgement that you were disrupting wikipedia, and you would continue to do so in increasingly dsiruptive ways without a cooldown period. Again, we must remind ourselves that you had several avenues of response, instead you escalated on the article talk page. You in fact did bring the block upon yourself, as you had lots of avenues to prevent it from happening, including complaining to a sympathetic adminstrator. There are a few around who are more than willing to overrule me, or better yet, talk to me politely.</dd>
<dd>4. You misunderstand. Syops have the technical ability to completely remove edits from history, or so I've been lead to believe. I removed the comments with a polite note for you to refactor them. I even left the convient little <b>oppose</b> vote. I signed that I was refactoring them. If people give a damn about what you said, they are welcome to look. It wasn't until you couldn't refactor that I linked the removed comments. This is true. I always gave you plenty of opportunity to improve instead of revert.</dd>
<dd>5. Poisoning the well! The AN/I section was your reporting. It was about user conduct. Just because it happened to be here on AN/I doesn't mean it was legitimate to insert into any conversation, let alone an article talk page. Personal attacks may infact be true. This does not mean they are constructive or helpful on article talk pages in any way. don't do them. If you want to say the vote shouldn't be carred out, say. "I don't think the vote should be carried out because there has been advertising on this vote." You don't even have to say who. People will ask, you can respond, <i>nicely</i>. In the meantime you leave a polite note on the relevant editor's talk page and say. "Please don't do this, its considered bad wikkiquette". As you see above BYT did not know, and has been informed. <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> isn't policy, but its still a good idea as a way to make sure you follow basic CIV and EQ.</dd>
<dd>Lets review. You made accusations assuming bad faith. You singled out a single editor. You used an article talk page. You had several opportunities to refactor your comments. You agreed to avoid personal commentary (article RfCs take place on talk pages so you don't get any wiggle room here), including a specific warning against poisoning the well. You discarded several better avenues (User talk, AN, AN/I, IRC, E-mail, etc.) to discuss my actions and my block warning. Your opposition vote was based solely on accusations of vote stacking, or atleast thats all you wrote. You had several better ways of saying this (as outlined above). You have disrupted wikipedia based both fair readings of the letter of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">WP:CIV</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, and while those are disputable, (as other admins have above) the spirit of the three supports my reading nicley. <a href="../../../b/p/_/WP%7EBP_c8aa.html" title="WP:BP">WP:BP</a> states that "Sysops may, at their judgement, block IP addresses or usernames that disrupt the normal functioning of Wikipedia.". Finally, Wikipedia is an enyclopedia, and a sysop's job is to protect that enyclopedia. There is no doubt in my mind that you were making the discussion increasingly worse, as I outlined above.--<a href="../../../t/z/n/User%7ETznkai_3625.html" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a> 17:20, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I'm an editor on the Shiloh Shepherd Dog site. This is my first experience with Wiki. This is currently an article in dispute. My signature is a "pen name" - MilesD. Following one of my posts a post was made with the following remark:</p>
<p><i>[snip]</i> or whoever you are, you should read Ms. Barber's replies on the Shiloh Community Forums. Boy, does she have a big one ready for you! 70.35.67.56 03:33, 7 January 2006 (UTC)Aslan</p>
<p>No where on Wiki is the name [<i>snip</i>] mentioned, as this is a private name I do not wish to share. Apparently, poster "Aslan" tracked my IP address on Wiki to another outside e-group I belong to (where I use my name) and then posted it on Wiki.</p>
<p>Can an administrator do something to help stop this person from posting my personal information and threatening me? Also, I think this "Aslan" may be a sock puppet for user Tina Barber or possibly TrillHill as this has been done before with another user, when Tina Barber contacted his supervisor to advise he had posted from his work pc to Wiki.</p>
<p>Any help you can provide is most appreciated. Thank you very much. 69.173.135.114 03:18, 19 January 2006 (UTC) MilesD.</p>

<dd>Just as another note: This guy does not have any clue. Most of the persons on his list of responsible "admins" are not admins but normal users. German wikipedia made something they call "Meinungsbild", which means users are invited to "vote" (but because "voting" on Wikipedia lacks basic democracy principles, it is not called a "vote") in favor or against some topic. His list are the users who "voted" against removal of the name in question from the article.

Semi-protection is nowhere near as prohibitive as full protection, and I believe that allowing this page to be vandalised such as this is a disservice to both Wikipedia and our readers.

<dd>Ah, you beat me to it. My thoughts on this are that today's FA is generally a showcase for Wikipedia, and so accessibility should be a priority (I seem to remember Raul654 having a template to this effect), but if I'm in a minority I'm content to leave it. <a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeithp_3c9a.html" title="User:Leithp">Leith</a><a href="../../../l/e/i/User_talk%7ELeithp_0f76.html" title="User talk:Leithp"><font color="teal">p</font></a> 19:35, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I strongly disagree with this. Semi-protection is no different to full protection here, as almost everyone who uses the main page for coming into Wikipedia is anonymous.

<p>I've been the main author of several front-page articles, and two of them (including Butter, just a few days ago) were very heavily vandalized. I was very active in fighting off the vandalism, as were a number of other good people. It was a stressful, busy day. Even if semi-protection would make it a lot less stressful, it would still be the absolute wrong thing to do. The vast majority of readers are anons; featured articles showcase what's best and unique about Wikipedia; that includes editability.</p>
<p>But you know what? Semi-protection wouldn't even make it much less stressful. Clear vandalism is <i>easy</i> to deal with. Roll it back. Tired of doing it? Someone else will usually take care of it too - good vandal hunters do tend to keep an eye on the TFA. The stress comes from the small flood of well-intentioned edits that are awkwardly written, or a little POV, or unreferenced... and semi-protection won't help there. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 22:01, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't have a big problem with semi-protection. Partially because I don't hold any "wiki" ideology... just what allows a big group like us to write a decent encyclopedia. Maximize exposure and minimize the negative aspects of that exposure. For anonymous IPs on these we usually get grammar edits and interwiki. I think anonymous editing is more important to interwiki links since I'd have an account on about 13 different wikis if I did counted everywhere I've done an interwiki. While it's on the main page I don't have a big problem with semiprotection... it's just damage reduction.

<p>Please note that while vandalism is vandalism is vandalism, not all vandalism is malicious. Often people find it hard to believe we allow anyone to edit, and not everyone's first edit contributes positively to Wikipedia. I think it's a bad idea to semi-protect the featured article of the day as per Raul. Featured article should exemplify everything about Wikipedia, including our wiki philosophy of allowing anyone to edit. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 08:49, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, I just tried to create a page entitled Fry Mumia to describe the cultural phenomenen of the Free Mumia movement and the political reaction the phrase has elicted from others. The article was just created yesterday, and has not had a chance to be properly edited, as it came under almost instantaneous attack by Mumia supporters. Could you please add some sort of tag or do something else to allow the article to mature. Much too early to delete. Now I know what it means to be "bitten" as a newcomer on Wikipedia.

It's a minor slogan to respond to a less minor slogan, and neither deserve articles.

<p>I invite all to contribute to the article. The purpose of the article is to describe the Free Mumia movement as a cultural phenomenen, rather than to discuss the case for or against the man, and rather than the narrow issue of a Fry Mumia t-shirt (which is just an expression of the phenomenen, not the subject itself -- I probably picked the wrong article title). For some, the movement has taken on much larger issues than the man himself, and that's worth exploring and describing. Have at it!

<dd>IF you can find evidence for there being a cultural phenomenon, then conceivably we could have an article about that, but certainly this T-shirt slogan hasn't had any evidence presented that it is worth an article. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 19:15, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is just silly. I put up the article for afd, though I didn't know at the time it was so new. In any case, thinking T-shirt slogans don't need individual encyclopedia articles is hardly a political position. However, instead of merely disagreeing and advocating his views, Morton Devonshire has removed the afd tag and accused the editor who restored it of "abuse" and accused those who voted delete of being sockpuppets and biased editors. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 20:46, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You're right, it is silly. Just let the article get edited without all of the Wikipedia mechanical tactics -- they just get in the way of creating an acceptable article. Make it "Free Mumia" if you wish -- the title isn't important. I don't want to fight with any of you over votes for deletion tags, neutrality tags and the like -- just edit the friggin article people.

<p>Per conversation on <a href="../../../l/e/w/Talk%7ELewes_Priory_School_e29d.html" title="Talk:Lewes Priory School">Talk:Lewes Priory School</a>, I was wondering about some policy precedent. Briefly, a content dispute ensued when an administrator of the school found the Wikipedia page about the school and changed it to conform to the "school's views". Users IDing themselves as students of the school changed it back. Protection was enacted and discussion went to the talk page. The problem is that somehow the school admin has found out which students are the contributors on the Wikipedia. Due to the admin's tone in the past, I am concerned that some sort of harrassment or coercion may occur. Thoughts on precedent or further action? — <a href="../../../s/c/m/User%7EScm83x_dc0d.html" title="User:Scm83x">Scm83x</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/m/User_talk%7EScm83x_0490.html" title="User talk:Scm83x">talk</a></sup> <a href="../../../h/o/o/Image%7EHookem_hand.gif_47a3.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/b/b9/Hookem_hand.gif/18px-Hookem_hand.gif" alt="" width="18" height="18" longdesc="../../../h/o/o/Image%7EHookem_hand.gif_47a3.html" /></a> 17:32, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Probably, he got caught by the autoblocker. When you block somebody and then they try to edit from an IP address, the IP gets blocked for 24 hours. Since it's AOL, I'm sure other people are now trying to edit Wikipedia and are getting thwarted by the autoblocker. You have to look through the blocklog to see the autoblock notice; just click on unblock and lift it. · <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0"><b>Katefan0</b></a><sup><a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKatefan0_4566.html" title="User talk:Katefan0">(scribble)</a></sup>/<small><a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_Poll_b43b.html" title="User:Katefan0/Poll">mrp</a></small> 22:54, 20 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>UN fortunately AOL changes IP with each Page viewed, so a block on an AOL user can cause the autoblock to affect lots of shared IP addresses. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 23:09, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes that would be good I'd think. Should be fairly easy to do. File a feature request/bug report. In the meantime, I think that if you unblock the first autoblock that comes up, then it turns off autoblocking for that username. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 16:12, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>We don't allow user pages to be used to maintain personal attacks against other editors, and I think the user page of <a href="../../../j/a/d/User%7EJadger_b81c.html" title="User:Jadger">User:Jadger</a> qualifies as a personal attack against <a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">User:Molobo</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpace_Cadet_187d.html" title="User:Space Cadet">User:Space Cadet</a>, <a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysy_04aa.html" title="User:Lysy">User:Lysy</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">User:Halibutt</a>.

Moreover, his comments are very close to being anti-Polish slurs: "These are the type of people that allow the Polish stereotypes to continue, by fitting perfectly the stereotype", and quoting Bismarck, apparently with approval given the context, talking about "the destruction of the Poles".</p>
