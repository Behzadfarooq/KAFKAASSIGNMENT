<dd>Simple; it's a crap idea. If you want something like this, I could make a list in minutes of articles that have a birth category but no death category, that way we won't have to go to the effort of adding another category to multiple 100,000 articles, and wont have the extra category clogging up our already over categorised articles. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 22:25, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have yet to hear rationaly how having these in a category will make wikipedia better in any way. The idea that it helps to NPOV them is not based in reality.

<dd>This is simply <i>another</i> examle of an fair-to-average idea that, since it wasn't explained or discussed with the "community" first, goes over like a lead <a href="../../../z/e/p/Zeppelin.html" title="Zeppelin">zeppelin</a>. Smashing dissent is bad, but "knee-jerk" reactions can often be avoided by a little prose beforehand. Was this talked about on the pump or signpost before its creation? As to the actual cat, it's poorly executed, but an ok concept. We shouldn't be using categories for meta-data, but having a tag of some description that allows us to identify articles that are potential "problems" is good sense. This category actually worked. While mocking it for being the dumbest thing ever (prior to its purpose being explained on IRC) I looked at the only article in the category at that time. Here's the result: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brian_Curtin&amp;diff=35824299&amp;oldid=35816176" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brian_Curtin&amp;diff=35824299&amp;oldid=35816176" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.

<p>Jimbo is right. David is right. If the procedures are so moribund that they're needlessly killing good stuff, we should rely on administrators to use their brains and look behind the numbers. Any administrator should feel proud to refuse to delete an article or other organizational component of the encyclopedia if he isn't happy that an argument has been made for its deletion. The article can always be deleted another day if it's really so bad. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 02:36, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Err, yes? That's exactly the problem. It wasn't clear what this was for, it wasn't widely discussed, and in the absence of that, asking for it to be deleted wasn't unreasonable. Looking back at ads on the wiki, then on to user boxes, and now this, it begins to appear that someone is trying to make a point. In every one of these cases, having some modicum of respect for the peons and taking a week or two to talk about it and explain it first would have been the smart thing to do. Why are things <i>continuing</i> to be done the hardest way possible, followed by cheers from some quarters of "Hooray for us!

<dd>As a matter of fact in this case nothing was deleted, and no discontinuity occurred. A few people who couldn't imagine that a category of living people could serve a useful purpose in the wake of the Seigenthaler affair came away disappointed that they didn't get to watch another category go into the memory hole, but I'm sure they'll get over it. The use of the word "disruption" here is somewhat wide of the mark.</dd>

<dd>Describing everyone who opposed this in CfD as deletionist maniacs isn't helpful, Tony.

<dd>I see a different message than Tony sees: <big><i><b>When Jimbo speaks, listen.</b></i></big></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>What the situation looks like to me (from the history; I was not involved) is that the category was nominated, and Jimbo said stop. <b>He was ignored</b>; that was inappropriate, regardless of what objections were used to justify it. Every contributor is free to disagree with Jimbo, but they are not free to act in defiance of his authority. To make matters worse, when the vote was continued in defiance of his request that the discussion be moved, he clarified himself that the vote was to end immediately, and <b>was ignored a second time.</b> If that was not disrespectful enough, when he closed the CfD, <b>he was reverted</b>. At that point, a less patient individual would have blocked the reverter and dared anyone to think about overturning it, but he did not do that.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It is unfortunate that this situation happened, but it is an opportunity for all of us to remember that <b>Jimbo is the boss.</b> When he gives orders, it is our obligation to abide by them. We are free to voice our concerns and objections, and to refuse to participate in them, but we may not act in defiance to them. In this situation, if individuals object to the category, do as you are asked and voice your objections on the talk page. If the matter is not settled to your satisfaction, then decline to participate: don't add articles to the category, and don't watch the articles in the category. But, do not act in open defiance by insisting on deleting the category; to do so is disrespectful to Jimbo, without whom we would not have this project, and is disruptive to the orderly function of the site. It has been argued that discussions such as this CfD are the operation of the rules and processes that keep the site running; however, continuing this particular CfD in opposition to Jimbo's direct orders is a disruption of <i>the most central rule to the orderly function of Wikipedia: <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Foundation_issues" class="extiw" title="m:Foundation_issues"><b>The final decision on any matter is reserved to Jimbo, and there is no appeal of his decision.</b></a> When we forget that, then we have forgotten that which is most central to Wikipedia. <font color="#696969"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> <sup><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><i>Talk</i></a> • <i>Contact</i></sup></font> 08:22, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>

<p>Being a somewhat frequenter from the C2 and MeatBall wikis I see sort of where he is coming from on the CfD thing... basically that all they are is a content management system available to the public. In reality though they are terrible discussion mechanisms due to interface problems etc., plus wikis at least originally were never designed to deal with spam and if someone wanted a page they generally got it. Oh, and in the name of wikis everywhere, I just deleted the category, because I think, at the very least in its current incarnation is really bad idea - which I think may result in good discussion (for everyone except myself, of course&#160;:)). To be honest I sort of envy the nastigrams Zoe gets, so here's to some of them on my talk page! (As well as an RfC, RfAr, Immediate de-adminship what have you).

<dd>Actually, both are completely inaccurate. I do not control the board. I do not control Tim and Michael. Tim and Michael always vote on board issues.

In general, it is not true that Tim and Michael agree with me about everything, all the members of the board are intelligent and independent voices.

<dd>My special powers within the community have nothing to do with the discussion about this category, but it is probably worthwhile to discuss where they come from: the community itself.

<p>(<i>after edit conflict</i>): As I understand it, the proposal is for a category that would in theory apply to every biographical article for a person currently living. This would be a quite large category, albiet not the largest we have. It would surely be large enoughj not to be useful for navigation. As I understand it, the arguemnt is that it could and would be used for various mantanence tasks -- for example, via "related changes" it could allow what amounts to a special version of the recent changes page specifically for biographical articles about living people. This will only work if at lest most such articles are indeed included in the category. There may be better ways to accomplish these objectives -- at least some in the various discussions have so asserted. The category does have the advantage that it does not require and code changes to MediWiki software. And it has been endorsed by Jimbo. It seems to me that setting up a project with the defined goal of monitering biographical articles and avoiding vandalism, libel, and false info there; and discussing technical methods at such a project would have been wiser. But that isn't what the people involved chose to do. The category has been created. Jimbo has intervened agaisnt its deletion. Why not <b>now</b> set up such a wiki-project? The project could be a place to discuss how to use the category, and what other tools might (right away or eventually) supplement or replace the category. If the project members, including Jimbo, finally agree that the category in unneeded, its delation will probably be uncontoversial. As long as such a project is finding or considering ways to make good use of the category, I don't see why anyone ought to be intent on trying to delete it. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 21:25, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It seems like a crazy idea to me. But when this guy said 'what about an encyclopedia anyone can edit?' most probably thought that was a crazy idea too. So this guy (even if he wasn't the boss) should be given a <b>lot</b> of latitude to try out his crazy ideas.

<dd>Yes if we could go back to focusing on the matter at hand that would be nice. I posted this at <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a> but I'll post it here again. This is probably the most broad category ever made on Wikipedia. Do you know how much of a hassle it's going to be to list EVERY single person who's alive. That's a pretty useless, if you ask me. I don't think we need a category to help us divide the people who are alive. I think Categories should group people/things that are unique. Unique in bieng able to list a few people/things into a category of something specific that not everyone has. Something that broad like if their alive or not is hardly useful. Navigation-wise it won't help at all, it lists basically everyone! IMHO, I think this should be put up for deletion. <a href="../../../s/w/d/User%7ESWD316_5e06.html" title="User:SWD316"><font color="#FF0000">S</font><font color="#EE0000">W</font><font color="#DD0000">D</font><font color="#CC0000">3</font><font color="#BB0000">1</font><font color="#AA0000">6</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/w/d/User_talk%7ESWD316_2795.html" title="User talk:SWD316"><font color="#0000FF">talk to m</font></a></sup><sup><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#00FF00">e</font></a></sup> 07:00, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>I don't think there is any harrassment going on here, it's much like the case of brandt, and wiki watch, etc... you're really just falling into a category of people who will be included on the encycolpedia... much as slimvirgin does not warrant an entry, or will beback, in slimvirgin's case it doesn't seem like she does much for her community other than online wikipedian work, so her information wouldn't need to be placed online, but as for Will mcWhinney, this is a person whose father is worthy of an entry, and who also works in the community, and was involved in an interesting skirmish in the ranks of the sierra club, so for that alone his article has merit, and isn't worth deletion<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonah_Ayers_2cd3.html" title="User:Jonah Ayers">Jonah Ayers</a></p>

<dd>Being called at home, or having one's phone number published with an admonition for others to call, is harassment, plain and simple. Revealing the private information of editors is harassment.

<p>I'm not sure what you mean baout getting called at home, and the impersonation of editors waS started by biff rose who was editing his article as sojambi pinola, and then pinela, etc... all of whom we're banned, by you I believe.

<p>Isn't that against the rules? I think you should work it out so you have one identity, and dont' seem to be some kind of sockpuppet. Please advise, I won't make anymore trouble with this one. Just have one of the administrators say that what you're doing is ok, and not being a sockpuppet, exercising admin rights via two different users, controlled by the same person.. if that is allowed, because voting in arbcom decisions is an admin duty, and theere is a consensus among admins that this is not in fact a punishable situation, then I will back off, smells fishy, but I want to see the honest standards of wiki enforced, because you seem to have a double standrad, blocking some people for 3rr violations, and not others, and then this...<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonah_Ayers_2cd3.html" title="User:Jonah Ayers">Jonah Ayers</a> 07:07, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

This username posted on the <a href="../../../b/i/f/Biff_Rose_8111.html" title="Biff Rose">Biff Rose</a> page at 00:48, 27 December 2005 (UTC). He has called my house five or six times, one of those times at 1:40 am. Two of the times he left obscene messages. One time, right after I had left a response to his writing on his talk page, the phone message was "Stay off my talk page." That strongly implies, to me, that it was him.

<p>I have blocked both Instant and Huaiwei for 7 days effective immediately for continued and incessent edit warring despite numerous warnings, pleas to reconsider, and article bans accumulating at more than one a day (not to mention what I'm sure we're missing). This blatant disregard of their probation requires a more direct response and I believe this block is in order given their continued edit warring and disturbance to Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../w/g/f/User%7EWgfinley_3fa2.html" title="User:Wgfinley">Wgfinley</a> 20:32, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>May I request that this block be reviewed. The latest incident that prompted this block, in <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singapore_Science_Centre_ad28.html" title="Singapore Science Centre">Singapore Science Centre</a>, is not a China-related article; and so I'm not sure about the validity of that ban, and therefore of this general ban as well. In addition, the ban was issued after a discussion had taken place in the talk page <a href="../../../s/i/n/Talk%7ESingapore_Science_Centre_c19f.html" title="Talk:Singapore Science Centre">Talk:Singapore Science Centre</a>, and therefore I feel that the ban is rather unnecessary, as the reverting has ceased.

<dd>They engaged in edit warring <i>first</i> and 'discussion'–one lonely comment by Huaiwei–<i>afterward</i>. Whether the <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singapore_Science_Centre_ad28.html" title="Singapore Science Centre">Singapore Science Centre</a> is an article that was covered within the narrow terms of their original probation is moot; their behaviour was disruptive and inappropriate. (There is also an amendment to their original ArbCom decision on <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFArb_d611.html" title="WP:RFArb">WP:RFArb</a>, expanding the terms of their probation to include all articles.)</dd>
<dd>Moving their destructive interpersonal conflict to non-China-related pages doesn't give them a free pass to edit war. If they can't get this through their heads after being banned from more than a dozen individual articles and receiving two or three short-term blocks in the last few weeks, a seven-day block seems regrettably necessary to get their attention. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 06:18, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As this notice states, this is not about one edit, it's about a documented pattern of behavior that shows no signs of ending. Huaiwei reverted the article 3 times in the past week without any discussion and the usual debate in the edit summaries. He didn't post anything to the talk page until <b>after</b> his latest revert. Finally, I'm pretty confident this meets the criteria of being China-related seeing as how the majority population of Signapore is ethnic Chinese. --<a href="../../../w/g/f/User%7EWgfinley_3fa2.html" title="User:Wgfinley">Wgfinley</a> 06:24, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ethnic Chinese, yes majority of Singaporeans are, but I have yet, after living here for a great deal of 15 years (I am an European migrant), I have yet to come across a Chinese here claiming to be related to China in any sense, except for ancestry. Its just a great deal of misconception, Singapore is a South-East Asian nation, the portion of the Asia continent where Chinese are considered migrants. No, Singapore Science Centre is not related to China, nor are any Singaporeans, in regardless of ethnicity, related to China. <b>Slivestré</b> <small>¦ <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlivester_47dd.html" title="User:Slivester">Pfrt</a> ¦ <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlivester_Photo_Archive_acd6.html" title="User:Slivester/Photo Archive">PAve</a> ¦ <a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlivester_8e09.html" title="User talk:Slivester">Dcn</a> ¦ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Slivester_f89c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Slivester">Cntn</a> ¦ <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Slivester_203e.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Slivester">Ei</a> ¦</small> 14:10, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nonetheless, it is clear that because of <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singapore_Science_Centre_ad28.html" title="Singapore Science Centre">Singapore Science Centre</a>, Wgfinley issued the general block. His misplaced belief that the article is china-related undeniably influenced this decision. Also in several instances, the situations had been overstated: that <i>"normal editings"</i> being stated as <i>"edit wars"</i>; <i>"simply revert"</i> being stated as <i>"revert warrings"</i>; and <i>"explanation in edit summary"</i> being described as <i>"jabs in revert comments"</i>. One clear example is in <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clock_tower.html" title="Clock tower">Clock tower</a>, where a closer examination will show that there is no revert at all. Many editors do have the occasional habit of writing long edit summaries, and there is in fact no ill-will in the edits of <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clock_tower.html" title="Clock tower">Clock tower</a> between them and other editors involved. However, Wgfinley had misinterpreted the few long edit summaries as a revert warring and issue the block, and continue to uphold it despite later clarification. As these decisions are questionable, it warrants a fresh look into the circumstances and that the length of the 7-days block be reconsidered. I earnestly request that because it is an extremely harsh penalty on two very important wikipedia contributors, as evidenced by their contribution pages; which also show that both parties have exercised considerable restraints in the past few days. An overly harsh punishment in this circumstance would not be in the interests of this community. I appeal for reconsideration, thank you. --<a href="../../../v/s/i/User%7EVsion_cd35.html" title="User:Vsion">Vsion</a> 16:35, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Come now, Instantnood and Huaiwei clearly need time out. They have been playing this cat and mouse game of reverts for ages now. They got their hands slapped at arbcon and have continued regardless. Singapore Science Centre was nothing special - it's just the article when Wgfinley finally had enough. He has been spending time and effort on individual article bans - we should be thanking him for that. Wikipedia is all about writing an encyclopedia, not warring. There are plenty of articles needing attention that if they both decided to they could have kept out of each others way.

<dd>Actually, you know, one shouldn't really put non 7-bit ASCII chars in signatures or in usernames at least on the English wikipedia, because it prevents people using console-mode browsers from ever being able to edit pages where these users have signed. This is not because console-mode browsers do not support Unicode (indeed, lynx, and most others, support a wide range of charsets) but rather because MediaWiki appears to consider all text-mode browsers to be "blacklisted", and thus transliterates all non 7-bit ASCII chars into hex codes as an attempted workaround for browsers that don't support it. Unfortunately, as far as I've tried, this workaround seems to be broken in such a manner as editing a page containing non 7-bit chars with a text browser (through no fault of the browser) causes the text to be converted into a string of broken hex codes, and thus saving any revision of the page using a text browser causes the Unicode character string to be hopelessly messed up, precluding any editing of the page without messing up their signature. I have seen cases indeed where people have savaged users for messing up their signature in this manner (although I shan't name names). People may wish to remember that some blind or partially sighted users use text-mode browsers with a screenreader, and not everyone has a graphical terminal on which to work on. In my case, I am not partially sighted as such but rather have some discomfort reading pages of computer text for prolonged periods of time, and so prefer to work using a screenreader and terminal when doing heavy editing work; I've found it impossible to edit any talk page that Miborovsky or Encyclopedist signed, for example, in Lynx, and thus have had to use Firefox for editing any page they've signed. Just thought I'd mention this.

<dd>I agree that the username should be changed–ideally by its owner–for reasons of legibility, ease of communication and to avoid confusion. I also <i>wish</i> that we hadn't enabled Unicode for usernames or signatures (spoofing problems, etc.) but it's too late to put that toothpaste back in the tube. I'm wondering, though, how Nicholas edits articles that contain Unicode...?

<dd>Now that it has come to my attention, I have reset Molobo's 24h block as a result of his blatant evasion and blocked the evading IP for 24 hours too. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 12:47, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Just a note about my reasoning: normally, it is only really ArbCom bans that get reset upon evasion: it is probably more usual to block the evading account until the end of the original block. In this case, however, Molobo's editing has been so completely unrestrained (all the way to an RfC) that I think starting over is more appropriate. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 12:54, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

This obviously needs to be deleted from the archives of wikipedia, and I have given her the chance to report it here. She hasn't done that in the few hours since I posted the {{<a href="../../../p/i/n/Template%7EPinfo4_6707.html" title="Template:Pinfo4">Pinfo4</a>}} template on her talk page, which couldn't be expected from her in such short notice. However, I don't want to wait any longer. She also claims to have told the other wikipedian's employer that he is using the company's computer and internet connection to edit wikipedia. What needs to be done about her? A block might be in order, although I'm not sure it still is an option a month after the offence. But if she needs to be blocked, for how long? 24 hours? 1 week? 1 month? Indefinitely? <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis">Aecis</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aecis_c56c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aecis"><sup>Mr.</sup></a> <a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis"><sup>Mojo</sup></a> <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_Userboxes_0d05.html" title="User:Aecis/Userboxes"><sup>risin'</sup></a> 21:58, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What's the point in blocking a month after the fact? Blocks are remedial, not punitive. However, <a href="../../../b/p/_/WP%7EBP_c8aa.html#Personal_attacks_which_place_users_in_danger" title="WP:BP">WP:BP#Personal attacks which place users in danger</a> is clear enough that a block may be imposed immediately such an attack is discovered; I rather suppose the policy has in mind that the block still be pertinent to the fact. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 22:29, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't understand; What remediation is ever provided by imposing a block after personal information has been posted?

<dd>A block will prevent the editor from adding the information again. The editor having not apparently done so, a block wouldn't be stopping anything.

<dd>I believe I have now become a bit too involved, so I won't do it myself, but I think that what Tina has said on that talk page ("... his superiors are being informed about his Vandalism! I highly doubt that he is going to consider this very funny after his system is inspected!") is consistent with {{<a href="../../../t/h/r/Template%7EThreatban_88dc.html" title="Template:Threatban">threatban</a>}}: "Users who make threats, whether legal, personal, or work-related, that in any way are seen as an attempt to intimidate another user, are immediately blocked." <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis">Aecis</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aecis_c56c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aecis"><sup>Mr.</sup></a> <a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis"><sup>Mojo</sup></a> <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_Userboxes_0d05.html" title="User:Aecis/Userboxes"><sup>risin'</sup></a>
<dl>
<dd>I emailed the victim of the attack, after I posted here, and he advised that T. Barber did indeed contact his superiors and also posted his name/work info on her own personal forums requesting those participants also contact his employer.</dd>
<dd>At the time she did this, a number of Wiki editors posted on the talk page asking T. Barber why she did this and telling her it was against Wiki policy and that an apology was in order, but she didn't offer one or remove her post.</dd>
<dd>Us being new users to Wikipedia, we didn't know what/if further action could be taken. It took a little time before I found this site to ask about this.</dd>
<dd>This caused considerable grief for the editor she "outed", but since the administrators didn't take any further action, he thought acts like that must be allowed by Wiki, so he hasn't posted since.</dd>
<dd>Will there be any further action taken? Once the person gets the Pino4 template, is there follow-up or does it just become inert if she doesn't respond to that template?</dd>
<dd>Because someone also tracked my IP address (again, being new, I sometimes was forgetting to "sign in" to Wiki)and posted my name on the page also, after that one. I don't know if that were her also or not. They used the name "Aslan" (shows IP address 70.35.67.56 03:33 before name), but I've since learned about "sock puppets", so maybe it was her and she figured nobody stopped her before so why not do it again. When it happened to me, that moderator didn't say anything about it, so again, I figured it was alright with Wiki too. I don't know if they have been able to track my employer yet.</dd>
<dd>I hope somebody can help us with these incidents because if this continues, editors are going to be pretty worried that their personal info is vulnerable if they post here.</dd>

<dd>I have wondered if maybe a technical solution might help. It seems that right now when these incidents happen there is a tension between on the one hand keeping the edit history as intact as possible for a number of reasons, not least of which is to preserve evidence that the offending editor <i>did</i> this thing, and on the other hand to preserve the privacy and thus the safety of the victim.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I wonder, what would be the practicality of the following procedure: when there is a reported attempt to "out" personal information, the page in question is temporarily pulled; the portions which represent the sensitive information are processed with one of the common hashing/checksum algorithms, and replaced with a template expression giving the length and checksum of the redacted personal information? This would preserve as much evidence as possible but still preserve the editor's privacy. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 05:05, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The two posts are as follows:</dd>
<dd>"I have put a lot of time into preparing a reply page that would clarify a LOT of the BS that has been presented via the "objections" proposed by <i>&lt;name snip&gt;</i> I certainly hope that the editors here will take the time to visit this link &amp; read the FACTS!!! <a href="http://www.shilohshepherds.info/numbers.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.shilohshepherds.info/numbers.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.shilohshepherds.info/numbers.htm</a> MaShiloh 21:52, 25 January 2006 (UTC)"</dd>

<dd>More BS ... &lt;name snip&gt;, you were there when Gary announced his *new* registry ... do I have to get others to sign statements to that effect?? That's when I brought the SSDCA, Inc. back into the picture ... not after the Grand Island standoff when I left *his* club .. but after I found out that he was starting a registry!! Granted, he didn't publish it till Feb .. but I have proof that the plan was in the works as of Nov. 97!! MaShiloh 22:56, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Oh &lt;name snip&gt;, give it up!! If everyone that walks on this earth, joins a club, visits a show, or even joins a school is called a *breeder* then everyone's stat's are way off!! I have 1087 members on our forum .. should I call all of *them* "breeders"??? I think that if you check the Wiki .. some place it's got to clearly show that only a person that BRED a litter --is a *breeder* What about the folks that go to a car lot to test drive a new car?? How many of them buy it?? Can you call all of them "buyers"?? Some are just "potential" buyers!!! Same with our LB's .. some may never breed a litter ... but they signed up to get licensed &amp; will stay there till they leave ... period!!!! MaShiloh 22:56, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm sorry but this is ridiculous and something more immediate needs to be done. These numerous personal names are all sitting out there on these Wiki pages, this poster has ignored the warning to remove them, has contacted at least one person's employer, has encouraged others to contact an employer, our administrator(s) haven't stopped it, and frankly, we want our personal info off these pages and for this person to be stopped from using them freely and obviously, without any concern that they will be stopped. Please, I am asking for someone to please take some definitive action ....enough is enough, already.</dd>

<dd>This has become a common practice for Tina M. Barber in multiple replies and no one is taking action. It seems that there have been warnings issued on December 28, 2005 and December 30, 2005, followed by a serious warning of an unknown date. It would appear that the protection of other editors continues to be threatened as she continues to disregard Wikipedia admin. warnings and continues to use personal names in her posts and threaten editors work arena by contacting editors places of work.</dd>

<dd>Tina M. Barber is getting more and more hostile and the continued use of personal names is extremely disturbing. She has crossed serious Wikipedia rules by doing this and contacting editors work arenas in attempts to get editors fired from their jobs. Are the policies truly considered serious if people can continue to break them on Wikipedia over and over and over again? If these are truly serious breeches of the Wikipedia rules and policies, can someone tell me and the other editors, why she has not been banned?</dd>

<b>:I implore you to take action - a 3rd person's name revealed</b></p>
<p>Please, please, can any of you help immediately? I'm one of the editors in the ISSDC registries working on the Shiloh Shepherd article. Editor Tina Barber just posted another message on the discussion page, revealing a third person's actual name.</p>
<p>Please – why hasn’t anything been done about her giving personal info prior to today’s incident, other than posting to her user page? Why hasn’t anything been done about her tracing an editor’s IP address to his work, contacting his work to get him in trouble, and posting his personal information on her chat lists, telling her supporters to contact his work? Again, she got a warning on her page, asking her to delete the info. It’s my understanding that she hasn’t done it.</p>
<p><b>:If Wiki policies aren’t enforced, or if they aren't going to be enforced with editor Barber, please just tell us that,</b> so we can make an informed decision about future participation.</p>

<p>Editor Barber has a long history of contacting people’s employers, threatening physical harm and even worse, improbable as it may seem, threatening lawsuits, losing control and having to be physically restrained, etc., when people cross her. The risk is real.</p>
<p>Right now, this feels nuts – to read about Wiki’s strict policies and then see no enforcement when people are put at risk.</p>

<dd>Alkivar, it's unfortunate that you got those phone calls. However, that's beyond the scope of wikipedia conduct, <b>and</b> (most importantly) we have zero evidence that timecop has anything to do with it. Furthermore, timecop lives in Japan and has stated he does not make international phone calls. Even if this was done by GNAA members in say, North America, timecop cannot be held accountable for their actions. All I can say is change your phone number. He has proven himself a legitimate user and I see nothing in his contributions tying him to DickyRobert either.

<dd>David's right. Whether Timecop is doing this stuff personally, or his friends are the actual culprits, there is absolutely no benefit to Wikipedia in allowing him or them back.

<dd>I find it rather <b>sickening</b> that we're not seeing the bigger picture here: Timecop's organization is now <b>criminally harassing</b> one of our users because he blocked their "fearless leader". Whether timecop did this or not, are we so spineless that we're going to give into this sort of internet gang war? Should our admins be afraid to take action against GNAA members if they act like retarded clowns? When I was harassed by bantown, it wasn't their leader who did most of the harassment. In fact, it was the low-level trolls who were trying to prove themselves. No, I'm sorry. This is a picture perfect example of why we should not allow GNAA to abuse our good faith, trust, and resources. Screw them, and screw anyone who thinks otherwise. If GNAA members want to actually <b>help</b> Wikipedia, then why the hell do they harass our members, both in cyberspace and real life? This "war on blogs" bullshit is not justification for their presence. If they want to truely help Wikipedia, they can do alone, not in the name of GNAA. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinuxbeak_c86a.html" title="User:Linuxbeak">Linuxbeak</a> (drop me a <a href="../../../l/i/n/User_talk%7ELinuxbeak_c40b.html" title="User talk:Linuxbeak">line</a>) 14:26, 25 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Nope, looks like Jayjg did everything by the book. What would be a violation of CheckUser (let alone a severe violation) would be if he told everyone what your IP was. All he did was say that you are a sockpuppet of ZimZum (or the other way around). There's nothing wrong with that.

<dd>First check user should never be used for no good reason. There was never any valid reason to use check user on either Scandum or ZimZum.

<dd>(edit conflict) He's been posting to RFCs and being quite incivil. I would not have blocked if ZimZum is active while Scandum is not (since the stated intention of creating the new account was because of the stigma of the old account), but both accounts are active and very incivil. Overall, I've been taking fairly uncontroversial admin actions as a newbie admin. I suppose this is my first potentially controversial action, which I decided to take because I've seen a fair number of incivil sockpuppets like this become quite abusive, and this sockpuppet shows signs of being a potentially abuse account. If this were a normal and unique account, I wouldn't have done anything. However, I believe we should keep sockpuppet accounts on a much shorter leash. If you wish to unblock, go right ahead.

<dd>*sigh* I don't know what to think. I can understand your frustration but I can also understand the case for revealing your puppet. On one hand we can say: "OMG!! Jay outed an alternative account of user he had been in a dispute with even though he did not violate <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a>!!!!11" But on the other hand we can say: "The account looked like an abusive sockpuppet so Jay was asked to check if it was a sock. Turned out it was and Jay said so." It's a judgment call. Maybe Jay should have got a second opinion on whether to reveal the connection. (And maybe he did.) But I'd say he was within his rights and did not violate the checkuser policy as written. Maybe that policy needs to address cases like this more explicitly. - <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 01:22, 26 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The account got checked for being <i>suspicious</i> cause it voted negatively for an RfC Jayjq himself was directly involved in. The votes were also highly unequal, so there was no way my vote was in any way affecting the RfC's outcome. I understand your opinion of me is as an annoying whiny abusive user due to the dirt throwing that has started right after the start of the conflict.</dd>

<dd>OK, my understanding is that you only block a sock if it's being used for <i>sockpuppet</i> abuse, such as voting twice, or for a user to "support" himself while pretending to be someone else. Blocking it for general incivility of a kind you would <i>not</i> have blocked a unique account for, as Deathphoenix did, isn't right. I'm unblocking, for now, but invite Haukurth or anybody else to reblock if they find evidence of sockpuppet abuse as such. (If there is none, incidentally, Jay shouldn't even have looked.) And of course either or both of the accounts can be blocked for general abusiveness. I wouldn't object, I just don't think DP's block, with the reason as given, ought to stand. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 15:42, 25 January 2006 (UTC).

<dd>That's fine. I'll take that as a lesson and go back to just blocking vandals and such. I was hoping my actions would prevent wasting time, as my personal opinion is that ZimZum will, in the future, create a lot of headaches and waste the time of a lot of Wikipedians. But since such preemptive actions aren't allowed, I'll just stop right now after having done it once. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">D</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><b>e</b></a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">ath</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 15:53, 25 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Such preemptive actions are indeed not allowed. I can assure you that I haven't been anywhere near the same article with the two accounts since I created ZimZum to edit controversial articles.

<p>Unlike Deathphoenix, I <i>am</i> remotely involved in this nonsense—far more so than I want to be. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that ZimZum was invented as a vehicle for Scandum to be abusive. This persona was invented 17 January, 2006, for the obvious specific purpose of endorsing Dabljuh's bizarre and incivil response to <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Dabljuh_9749.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Dabljuh">his RfC</a>. Since then, ZimZum has taken on a life of his own, which has been, like Scandum, occasionally incivil and, where <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakew_2ade.html" title="User:Jakew">Jakew</a> is concerned, clearly <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assumes bad faith</a>, although overall productive. My suspicion is that the user felt freër to use the ZimZum persona for incivility, in the belief that it would be OK to do so since he could always just create another sock in order to continue to be abusive, rather like how foreign tourists are widely perceived as rude: precisely because many tourists don't feel a great deal of accountability for their actions, they leave their civility at the border. ZimZum's record has been far more abusive over a far shorter period of time than has Scandum's, hence my supposition. For whatever reason, Scandum/ZimZum has developed a chummy relationship with Dabljuh on circumcision-related articles, which is where (along with related discussion) all of ZimZum's incivility and assumptions of bad faith are to be found. It's on this observation, in concert with their identical interests and writing styles, that my original supposition that they're the same person is based. Everywhere else I've seen S/Z operating (eugenics/racism/online gaming (which is where I assume he first ran into Dabljuh)), he is, in fact, a civil defender of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and an otherwise <i>good</i> editor.</p>

<p>Over the past few days, an anonymous contributor with a roving IP (66.81.184.xxx and 66.81.185.xxx) has made a host of POV edits to the article <a href="../../../u/d/h/Udham_Singh_2570.html" title="Udham Singh">Udham Singh</a>. Here's a relatively minor example of the kind of thing I'm talking about with POV terms italicized:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whilst living in England in 1940, Singh Shot dead Sir Michael O'Dwyer, former Governor of the Punjab. This was in revenge for the <i>heinous criminal massacre</i>, which General Reginald Edward Harry Dyer had <i>perpetrated</i> on <i>innocent</i> Indians under Michael O'Dwyer's rule, and which O'Dwyer had, <i>unfortunately</i> defended.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article has been POV from its inception, and I added the <b>{{npov}}</b> template to it a couple of weeks ago. However, this anonymous editor continues to remove the template. I'm not sure what to do here; is semi-protection warranted? I'd like to clean up the article, but I fear this person will simply revert any edits I make.

<p>I seem to have a comunication disorder with User:Snk 444, I'm afraid. Recently, on the <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_%28SNK_character%29_5894.html" title="King (SNK character)">King</a> article, I've had a little revert war with him in which I continually removed his nonsensical images from the article. I told him on his page why they weren't needed for the improvement of the article, and to please explain his concensus for them being present. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Snk_444&amp;diff=36795766&amp;oldid=31072864" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Snk_444&amp;diff=36795766&amp;oldid=31072864" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>), and shortly after, <a href="../../../n/a/c/User%7ENaconkantari_d810.html" title="User:Naconkantari">Naconkantari</a> did the same (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASnk_444&amp;diff=33318201&amp;oldid=31072864" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASnk_444&amp;diff=33318201&amp;oldid=31072864" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>). The user in question then decides to violate <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> and disregard our commments (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Snk_444&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=33318201" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Snk_444&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=33318201" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>), after which, then decides to blank them (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Snk_444&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=33318406" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Snk_444&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=33318406" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>). Meanwhile, on the article in question, Snk 444 decides to ignore concensus yet again and let loose another personal attack in his revision (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=King_%28SNK_character%29&amp;diff=31187523&amp;oldid=31050157" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=King_%28SNK_character%29&amp;diff=31187523&amp;oldid=31050157" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>).

<p>Im afraid this user has little respect for civilty and concensus, and he has violated <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> on several occasions.

<dd>Revert anonymous contributions "on sight"? That doesn't seem quite right.

<p>I have started a new topic thread as I am hoping the only reason the admins are not responding to this previous topic is they are not seeing it.</p>
<p>This is a continuation of the thread: Revealing personal information.</p>
<p>user Tina M. Barber (AKA MaShiloh) is continually and repeatedly revealing peoples personal names rather than using their screen names. see above topic for all the past infractions. Today, yet again: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Shiloh_Shepherd_Dog" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Shiloh_Shepherd_Dog" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Shiloh_Shepherd_Dog</a></p>
<p>Current page under Reply To New Draft</p>
<p>Editor Windsongkennels left a post and this followed by Tina M. Barber:</p>
<p><i>(</i>name snip<i>), you know that the OFA didn't record preliminary (under 2 yr) x-rays back then! If I had you subpoenaed into court, and you were asked (under perjury of law) if you saw the STACKS of x-rays on my dogs ... what would you have to say?? MaShiloh 19:11, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</i></p>
<p>The discussion pages are filled with her revealing personal info still left unchecked from mid Dec forward, it is filled with violations to NPA, and she is filling it with link after link to her private web site and using it to slander all people not affiliated with her.</p>
<p>There are warnings issued, but it appears no follow up. If this is not the place to report these violations could someone please at least point those of us reporting them to the correct place or format? I have to say, I am in shock that with all the requests for assistance that not only does it appear that nothing has happened to this user, but everyone's personal information including where they work is still on those discussion pages. This last post seems to be a threat of taking the other editor to court. ShenandoahShilohs 19:43, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This feels like an offsite dispute that is continuing here. Our article says that Tina M. Barber is the original breeder of these dogs. She clearly knows the people she is arguing with (and is referring to them by their first names). However I don't consider the above quote to be a legal threat. We can't fix your off Wikipedia community and we're not the article police.

<dd>I'm sorry but I disagree. Please see WP:Harrassment (template Pinfo4) "Wikipedia operates on the principle that every contributor has a right if they wish to remain completely anonymous. Wikipedia policy on that issue is strictly enforced. Posting private information about a user, specifically their (alleged) name and/or personal details, is strictly prohibited as harassment, and users who do that are often immediately blocked from editing Wikipedia." Whether she may know who some of the editors are personally or not, is not the point per Wiki policy.</dd>

<dd>Tina M. Barber (aka MaShiloh) has repeatedly published other first names, including a first and last name (mine, which she tracked through an IP address and I have never met her) and has tracked another's poster's IP address and contacted his employer. We don't expect you to "police" and we would be happy to "sort this out", but we are not administrators and we do not have the capability of blocking users who disregard and ignore (she has done both) requests that she desist from flaunting policies, nor do we have the capability to remove these names from Wiki entirely (they are all still sitting out there for viewing, including one editor's place of employment). In that sense, you are the "police", because you have the authority to do something about it.

<dd>Secertlondon, I am sorry you feel like a plea for help is an offshoot to a dispute. I am also sorry to hear that you feel just because one person knows who they are talking to that it is ok for them to reveal that info on Wiki. Was it also ok for her to track an editors Wiki IP to his employment? Contact his employer and attempt to get him fired? Post his employment info on the talk pages, and to take this info gained from Wiki and post his name and employment info on other forums encouraging people to call his employer? This information is still on the talk pages, and the way I understand, it should be removed. These actions threatened a persons livelihood, is that ok too since she may or may not know them?</dd>

<dd>Yes there is an ongoing dispute on the Shiloh Shepherd Dog, but I cannot see how that justifies breaking Wiki policy repeatedly after being warned. We are human, and we can all make mistakes, but this editor has shown a total disregard for Wiki policy. ShenandoahShilohs 22:16, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have to agree with ShenandoahShilohs and MilesD. on this. If the (first) names of contributors are to be released to the public, it should only ever be released by the contributors themselves. This should never be done by others, whether they know each other or not, whether the information is harmless or not. Disrespecting and infringing on the privacy of other users is a serious offense, and Tina M. Barber has continued to do so, despite having been warned not to. Some time ago, I requested the removal of personal information (name, job, employer) of one user. I don't know how to do this, so I'm not able to remove it myself. Another problem is that the talk page has seen many edits since the information was revealed, which means that even if the edit itself is removed, it will continue to be visible in other edits. I don't know what can be done about this. <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis">Aecis</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aecis_c56c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aecis"><sup>Mr.</sup></a> <a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis"><sup>Mojo</sup></a> <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_Userboxes_0d05.html" title="User:Aecis/Userboxes"><sup>risin'</sup></a> 22:45, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I too agree with ShenandoahShilohs and MilesD. We don't have a reason to take sides in the original dispute but we have a <i>responsibility</i> to act when the dispute is conducted on Wikipedia and the manner in which a side conducts it violates key Wikipedia principles -- not the least of which is <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>.

<p>Does Wiki have the technology to delete this person's personal info? If so, can it be done immediately? If not, what other options do we have to protect this person, even if it's several weeks later? S Scott 23:11, 26 January 2006 (UTC)S ScottS Scott</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive69_260b.html" title="Edit section: Dispute between Pamento and Pickelbarrel">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Dispute between Pamento and Pickelbarrel</span></h2>
<p>This is a rather nasty quarrel. I have to admit that I am finding it rather difficult to spot where it all began, but at the moment this much is clear (or not as the case may be!). I was contacted by a somewhat distressed User:Pamento yesterday regarding this matter on <a href="../../../d/w/i/User_talk%7EDwilke_a6f9.html" title="User talk:Dwilke">my talk page</a>. He asked me to give him advice about how to stop <a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPickelbarrel_3950.html" title="User:Pickelbarrel">User:Pickelbarrel</a> harrassing him. I then told him that he should avoid anything confrontational and to report Pickelbarrel to an Admin for harrassing him if he kept on.</p>
<p>Pickelbarrel's response to this was to start harassing <i>me</i> on my talk page and to ask <a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECenestrad_74db.html" title="User:Cenestrad">User:Cenestrad</a> how best to get rid of me.</p>
<p>Right. Now as far as I can see, on the 14th of January Pamento made a perfectly reasonable comment on <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">User:Uncle G</a>'s <a href="../../../u/n/c/User_talk%7EUncle_G_84db.html" title="User talk:Uncle G">talk page</a> asking about his opinions on <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> dictionary policy. Then Pickelbarrel makes an unsigned comment on Pamento's talk page telling him not to harass UncleG (around 5:00 UTC), for no other reason, in my opinion, than newbie jealousy. Pamento then, stupidly, rises to this making an unsigned vandalistic comment on <a href="../../../p/i/c/User_talk%7EPickelbarrel_3c4d.html" title="User talk:Pickelbarrel">Pickelbarrel's talk page</a>. This then begins a chain of events which lead to Pickelbarrel blowing this out of all proportion, attacking Pamento at every opportunity, using Uncle G's name in vain, Pamento getting nasty with Uncle G as a result... well you can see for yourselves really, all the pages I have found which link to this 'dispute' are linked above. To write it all down here would make for a dissertation.</p>
<p>I just hope that you Admins can make out of this a good and lasting peace! <a href="../../../d/w/i/User%7EDwilke_d205.html" title="User:Dwilke">Dan</a> 22:05, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Well, my problem seems to be that I seem to be the only person who has a problem with this. However... it appears to me to be a very bad thing that we let this sort of madness continue, and also if these two are separate entities then we are giving Pamento especially (as a newbie) a very raw deal. He is clearly being harrassed by Pickelbarrel, whose behaviour (as well as his spelling) is <i>atrocious</i>.

<li>Dan, his only contributions are to his own, Pickelbarrel's and some of our talkpages: <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Pamento_426b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pamento">Special:Contributions/Pamento</a>... oh, and one real edit. If these guys are making a mess of your talk pages then just clear it up - that's your choice to do on your own talk page. However I don't think there's anything much here to get excited, or waste time, about. Pickelbarrel has made a number of edits, and at least one new article, and he seems most excitable, but lets not piss on the parade of two (if they are two&#160;:) potential new editors. By taking this to this platform we're stooping to much the same level level that they are operating at - pointlessness! Lets try to encourage rather than ban, after all these guys are not vandalising the encyclopedia.

<p>I think you should go to your prefrences and under nickname rename yourself "pickelbarrel the asshole" and then go to pamentos page and talk about what an asshole you are. That should piss him off good. Also let Uncle G &amp; Wangi know that way they can speak with Pamento or maybe block him. As for working with Dan go to his user page and click on User Contributions on the left hand side of the screen in your toolbox (it's right under related changes) that will give you a list off what he is working on. Then all you have to do is pick an article and start editing. --Cenestrad The Emperor of Wikipedia 16:35, 27 January 2006 (UTC)" That appears to me to be Cenestrad egging Pickelbarrel on to vandalise pages that I have edited... <a href="../../../d/w/i/User%7EDwilke_d205.html" title="User:Dwilke">Dan</a> 18:33, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Isn't this inherrently flawed?

<dd>My question is, (and perhaps someone can point me in the right direction if it has already been asked and answered) with all of this sock activity, does Zephram's ban get lifted at the scheduled time, or is it lenghtened to include these offenses?

<dd>The ban will be lifted six months after "Zephram" (the person behind the accounts, not just <a href="../../../z/e/p/User%7EZephram_Stark_ae5d.html" title="User:Zephram Stark">User:Zephram Stark</a>) stops editing. If he never creates a another sockpuppet, the ban would be lifted six months from today (27 July 2006). If he keeps evading the ban by editing with sockpuppets, the date will keep moving back. If there comes a time when he hasn't created a sockpuppet for a few weeks, I may adjust the block expire date. Right now, it's not worth the effort to adjust the expire date every few days. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 19:49, 27 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>Also, please pay attention to what FeloniousMonk is DOING, not saying. I don't want to start defending myself against his attacks. They are distortions. What he is DOING though, is clearly inappropriate regardless of any merit he claims his attacks have. He is even claiming, based on a completely bad faith assumption, that I am changing the word "ruling" to "concluding" in the article because I find the "ruling" (he again calls it this) "unfavorable." First, I actually find the ruling favorable. Second, I am right because he clearly doesn't know the difference between what a judge orders and what a judge says. This is very very frustrating and I can't believe that I feel the need to defend myself for what is obviously malicious attacks.--<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenapgar_6305.html" title="User:Benapgar">Ben</a> 06:55, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This page has a long standing content dispute occurring with very little, make that no, discussion on the talk page. The IP party to the dispute emailed the help desk on Dec. 14 with:<br />
<i>I am complaining about the entry under Telectronics in you dictionary. I am the son of the founder of the company and the reference to Keith Jeffcoat’s alleged contribution has no published citation. He did not work at the company until 1969 6 years after commencement in ME development and was employed as a salesman not an engineer. Also my late after was an engineer at Kreisler and worked in Radar during the War he was not simply a financier of Telectronics. I have a very concerned view of the material you are publishing as it may damage me and my business that is still today in the pacemaker field. I thought that you had to have published source material to publish material in your entries?</i><br />
I don't feel comfortable getting involved directly in the dispute as the 203.* IP editor has made direct contact with and I don't feel that my involvement would be seen as unbiased. The edit summaries of "unsourced material" refer to a suggestion that I made to the editor that information that is unsourced and factually untrue could be summarily deleted. He has since deleted sources and content witht he summary "unsourced material." I would really like someone else to deal with for the reason stated above, as well as the fact that I am trying to limit my involvement in Wikipedia altogether as I have extremely limited time IRL. If nothing has been done by next weekend I may try to work on it, although I also have a much heavier courseload in school this semester. —<a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWAvegetarian_a804.html" title="User:WAvegetarian">WAvegetarian</a>•<small><sub><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WAvegetarian_0ea5.html" title="Special:Contributions/WAvegetarian">CONTRIBUTIONS</a></sub></sub><sup><sup><span style="position: relative; left:-64px; margin-right:-64px;"><a href="../../../w/a/v/User_talk%7EWAvegetarian_1514.html" title="User talk:WAvegetarian">TALK</a></span></sup></sup><big>•</big> <sup><sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_WAvegetarian_f393.html" title="Special:Emailuser/WAvegetarian">EMAIL</a></sup></sup></small><span style="position: relative; left:+6px; margin-right:+6px;">•18:43, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</span></p>

We have offered suggestions for compromise on the information, such as moving it to another article, with no response from CLyerla. Once we began to edit his/her talk page, the reverts of that same information have started to be done by an anonymous IP, again with no discussion. I and another user have left comments on the anon IP's talk page with no results so far (the anonymous IP is a machine at Washington University).

<p>Wikipedia presently claims that <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Georg_of_Bavaria_8c89.html" title="Prince Georg of Bavaria">Prince Georg of Bavaria</a> had a bastard son and has articles that feature that supposed son's supposed descendants, including one actor who is asserted to have appeared, uncredited, in <i>Amadeus</i>, and who gave away his 10 million Euro trust fund to charity. I've asked on the article's talk page for sources for this assertion, and received protestations that the assertions are true, but no actual sources. But the reason this is on the noticeboard is that in the process the contributor has now asserted that his contribution is a copyright violation of itself(!) despite having been submitted under the GFDL, and has stated that "the descendants of Prince Georg" (by which he means the putative descendants)... "may be forced to file a libel lawsuit against Wikipedia".
