... why is it being used for things other than talk about WP:AN? Could people please review the text at the top of the page? When I created WP:AN, I put a redirect on the talk page. This was removed so that we could talk about the page itself, and leave all admin related stuff to the main page. I notice that many people are using the talk page as if it were the main WP:AN page!

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Administrators' noticeboard is broken</span></h2>
<p>I have come to the conclusion that the noticeboard is badly broken. It has become an unmanaged dumping ground for rants, disputes and accusations. I am wasting a huge amount of time following irrelevant comments. I am about a hair's-breadth away from taking this page off my watchlist.</p>
<p>I propose that we <b>aggressively</b> enforce the <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_feeb.html#Dispute_resolution" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard">paragraph</a> at the top of the page which clearly states that "these pages <i>aren't</i> the place to bring disputes over content, or reports of abusive behaviour". I could live with a brief notice of a dispute and a <u>link</u> to the in-depth discussion but anything more than a mere notice should be deleted on sight. No archiving, no moving. Just delete with a comment. Any interested party can recover the dispute from the page history and create an appropriate dispute page.</p>
<p>Disputes over specific policies should also be moved. The 3RR seems to be particularly controversial right now. The proper place to be holding that dispute is at <a href="../../../t/h/r/Wikipedia_talk%7EThree-revert_rule_d7c8.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Three-revert rule">Wikipedia talk:Three-revert rule</a>, not here. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 14:16, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Yup, I agree too. This page is only for things that require <b>administrator</b> attention, as opposed to matters that require the attention of well-meaning wikipedians. (not implying that the former aren't the latter, just that they're not all of them). --<a href="../../../w/e/y/User%7EWeyes_aab8.html" title="User:Weyes">W</a>(<a href="../../../w/e/y/User_talk%7EWeyes_0fbf.html" title="User talk:Weyes">t</a>) 23:29, 2005 Jun 24 (UTC)</li>

<li>Is this for <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a> too?

<li>Well, with the current header we can hardly complain if people use it for that, but given that all the complaints about admin behaviour I've seen on WP:AN/I are "I vandalised 500 articles and the bastard cabalist admin blocked me, he's gone power mad", I'd strongly support removing that line and replacing it with directions to WP:RFC. The work involved in filling out a template RFC appears to scare off a lot of trolls, which is a good thing. --<a href="../../../w/e/y/User%7EWeyes_aab8.html" title="User:Weyes">W</a>(<a href="../../../w/e/y/User_talk%7EWeyes_0fbf.html" title="User talk:Weyes">t</a>) 03:40, 2005 Jun 26 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>RFC requires two people to be abused in the same way, which doesn't always happen. --<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_637c.html" title="User:SPUI">SPUI</a> (<a href="../../../s/p/u/User_talk%7ESPUI_234e.html" title="User talk:SPUI">talk</a>) 30 June 2005 04:29 (UTC)

<p>Alas, all, I don't think I can deal with doing the Noticeeboard archiving any more. It was taking a good chunk of my Wikipedia time, and I wasn't getting much article editing done. I just can't force myself to do it anymore. So I need to bail on doing the archiving; can someone else take it over? Thanks. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 02:08, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>PS: Since things are so behind, I'm doing a big chunk now, but that's just to get things a little caught up. Please co-ordinate the handover here, so make sure we don't step on each other's toes. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 02:43, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK, things are all caught up now, and everything's all cleaned up as well. So, I'm going to call it a day on doing the maintainence/archiving, so I can devote more of my energy to working on articles. So, now we really do need someone to take over doing the archiving. Let me know (on my Talk: page, I won't be reading here) if you want me to write up some instructions (argh, the dreaded <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/instruction_creep" class="extiw" title="m:instruction_creep">instruction creep</a>&#160;:-) on how I was doing it. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 01:05, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Hate speech graffiti maquerading as requests for admin attention</span></h2>
<p>I don't overwhelmingy care if WP:AN and WP:ANI are somewhat turning into the "Bash the admins page". It's tiresome and all, but it would IMO be very problematic to remove threads where a user complains of admin treatment, because of the ever-present risk of babies (=complaints with some substance in them) going out with the bathwater. But hate speech and racist trolling are another matter, and I would like to second Func's suggestion on the project page that these proliferating threads be removed on sight. Don't reply to them, don't move them somewhere else and link to them, just wipe them, please. We recently had a classic piece of history-encrusted Nazi rhetoric on AN in the "Is it a crime to tell a homosexual" etcetera thread, which, thinly veiled as a policy question, proposed that "you cannot include Jews and homosexuals among common humanity" and that "a Madagascar solution for them (both groups on the same island) would be a dream-come-true for humanity." (If you don't know what a Madagascar solution is, you might want to google for it.) Most of that thread is still up there on AN, along with "Certain admin's practicing censorship and/or disallowing honest contributions by labelling them "Nazism"", and, added yesterday, by a now blocked user, "Jewish racism." These hate graffiti masquerading as "requests for admin attention" tend to receive admin replies on a good faith basis and lead to long cluttered discussions on the page, but, please, as somebody once quipped (Snowspinner?), "Assume good faith" just isn't equivalent to "Let's pretend we're bloody stupid." They're offensive, they're in bad faith, please let's just remove them on sight. There are no babies in this bathwater. I've never noticed any grey zone, the cases are all egregiouos, but if something on these lines should ever appear to have a nugget of a genuine policy question in it, then of course just leave it on the page.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I paste here Func's and my comments on the latest antisemitic AN thread, "Jewish racism" from the project page, to keep it all together.</dd>
<dd><i>Sigh...the number of Jew-bashing comments AN receives is getting ridiculous. Can I suggest a policy that any and all such racist threads on <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a> simply be removed on sight?

<p>I'm not proposing a poll, polls are evil, but I ask people to please comment below, and if there is consensus for it, we can all start wiping such threads on sight.

<dd>As Wikipedia keeps growing, this problem will too. Although, I am against censorship of any kind, these kinds of attack are <i>personal attacks</i> and the concerned admin(s) should be entitled to remove them. In clear cases, few admins would dispute the removal.--<a href="../../../w/i/g/User%7EWiglaf_0500.html" title="User:Wiglaf">Wiglaf</a> 11:07, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Normally, I would advocate that we simply BE BOLD and just wipe these, as suggested, with a brief comment as to why in the edit summary and on this talk page. However, I can see that anybody doing it this way is likely to get accused of censorship, dicatorship and all the other usual abuse that flows from correcting the consequences of misbehaviour. So, despite my reservations about instruction creep, we probably need to make explicit provision for this in a policy (preferably something existing!). —<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoClarke_a891.html" title="User:TheoClarke">Theo</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheoClarke_5767.html" title="User talk:TheoClarke">(Talk)</a> 11:25, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Sure: wipe them away. They're trawling, and the neo-Nazi groups in particular have been trawling in exactly this way for 15 years or more. First, they go somewhere unrelated and shout about the dirty inferior races, then they either enjoy the site being riven with the discussion or get banned/blocked/warned. Next they complain about Them censoring. Since there are always people upset with Them over various things, <i>this</i> gets people in the net, and the site is riven. Then an hysterical ban/removal, etc., and then they get into the suppression of truth charges and the threats of lawsuits. I've seen it over and over again since 1991. The only way to deal with it is to just remove on site, and, most of all, <i>not</i> to reply, explain, warn, or any of the other things that the trawl nets are out there for. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:14, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Erase with extreme prejudice. I would have done it except for not wanting to stir up any "nonwiki behaviour" accusations.

</ul>
<p>For the egregious and obvious trolling hate speech, I'd suggest paraphrasing. Otherwise, we will end up with an ugly cycle of censorship accusations and flaming. The important thing is to leave in any specific admin-related requests, so that those can be answered (and, probably, ignored.) Something like this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>JohnQSmith (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JohnQSmith_db12.html" title="Special:Contributions/JohnQSmith">contribs</a>) has posted a request for administrative review of the actions of editors Tom2 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tom2_13f0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tom2">contribs</a>) and Dick (<a href="../../../d/i/c/User_talk%7EDick_6627.html" title="User talk:Dick">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dick_ad0a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dick">contribs</a>), and the admin <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarry_9a99.html" title="User:Harry">Harry</a> (<a href="../../../h/a/r/User_talk%7EHarry_ddcc.html" title="User talk:Harry">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Harry_8fea.html" title="Special:Contributions/Harry">contribs</a>) on the article Religious persecution of Martians. He asserts that Tom2 and Dick are biased, and that Harry has incorrectly blocked him for a <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">3RR</a> violation. He has requested that Religious persecution of Martians be restored to the version <i>link to preferred version</i>, that Tom2 and Dick be blocked, and that Harry be desysopped.</dd>

</dl>
<p>If the trolling and hate speech are readded to the thread, I would suggest that it can then be deleted in its entirety; I'd say that one good-faith attempt to deal with the situation is sufficient to discharge our obligation. Does that sound reasonable? <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 13:29, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm sorry, TenOfAllTrades, but it really doesn't. If someone wants their "admin request" to be taken seriously, then they won't infuse it with racist speech in the first place. Why should we parphrase the statements of someone who can't make their request in a civil, human/humane way? Gay/Jew/Alpha-Centari bashing is simply unacceptable, and it isn't an unreasonable standard for anyone to follow. <a href="../../../f/u/n/User%7EFunc_268d.html" title="User:Func">Func</a>( <a href="../../../f/u/n/User_talk%7EFunc_0951.html" title="User talk:Func">t</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Func_dbc4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Func">c</a> ) 16:45, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fair enough. For the clearcut cases, I don't think anyone is likely to object if the trolling is excised. For borderline instances, I'd prefer to see if paraphrasing knocks some sense into them. (It might help prevent turning a racist newbie into a recurring hardened troll.) Whatever solution editors here adopt, I'm definitely <i>not</i> going to be joining the torches-and-pitchforks mob crying "censorship!" when the remarks are removed. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 17:19, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ah, the pitchfork mob, bring 'em on. I'm just creating a special section on my talk page for receiving the "You Jew-loving bitch whore" type of message, and others who want to be involved in removing inappropriate posts might want to do the same.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Page re-naming proposal</span></h2>
<p>I'd like to propose renaming this page to Wikipedia:Community management noticeboard. I think this is better than the current title for a number of reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>Many of the issues people discuss here don't directly relate to use of admin powers.</li>
<li>Virtually everything discussed here <b>does</b> relate to the day-to-day management of the English Wikipedia.</li>
<li>"Administrators' noticeboard" implies that it is limited to use by administrators, which is not the case.</li>
<li>Words ending in apostrophes are aesthetically unpleasing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that I am not proposing ANY change to how the board is used. I just want the name to better reflect the true purpose and use. I expect that admins would continute to be the bulk of the users on this board regardless of a name change, and there's nothing wrong with that.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">AN&amp;ANI ArchiveBot</span></h2>
<p>The Admin Noticeboard (and incidents page) have a tendency to get too long and not be archived often enough. That is also because the order sections appear in does not indicate which sections are still pertinent and which are not, making archiving somewhat arduous.</p>
<p>I've discussed it at the bots page, and it is very feasible to create a bot that would automatically archive <b>any section that has not been edited for a week</b>, judging by the signature timestamps present in the section. Of course the "one week" bit is an arbitrary selection. Does anyone else think this is a good idea? <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 16:31, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think this a great idea, with the assumption that this bot would be in addition to manual archiving, not in place of it. For example, sections (usually large ones) often have a stray comment made a few days after the topic has "died". This would sometimes lead to the bot letting too many dead sections clutter the page. Other than that minor issue, I don't see any reason not to implement this bot. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 17:28, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There are some questions that I'd like clarified first. First, if the bot archived some sections now, where would it place them? Would it simply tack it on to the previous archive or create a new archive? The next day, where would it place those archives? We can't afford to have a new archive created every day. Perhaps ask the bot to store at a temp location and then have the temp location, once it reaches a certain size, manually moved to a new archive location?

<dd>I agree that it would be crazy to make an entirely new archive page every day. I haven't looked at the <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a> archives at all yet; how would you like me to handle it? The simplest way would be either to start a new archive every X amount of days, or start a new archive whenever the current one exceeds Y size (in wikitext). —<a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECryptic_b72b.html" title="User:Cryptic">Cryptic</a> <a href="../../../c/r/y/User_talk%7ECryptic_d8a7.html" title="User talk:Cryptic">(talk)</a> 22:07, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Would it be possible to accumulate all the archived messages in a temp location at a subpage, and when the size of the subpage exceeds a certain size (I don't know how large exactly is the size in Kb of a page that would need to be archived) or number of messages/subheadings (probably around 75-100) to send a message to this page that the temp needs to be moved to a new archive? That way, old messages would be continuously removed from this page and placed at the temp location, and when the temp gets to the point where it can be placed into a new archive page, a user could manually review it and then move it to the next archive page. Would that be possible?

<dd>Hmm, I must have misunderstood the initial comment. So you're saying that the bot will continuously archive, so that archive X gets bigger until it hits a certain point, when the bot will then dump to archive X+1? That sounds fine to me. But how are you going to determine when to start a new archive? What I'm saying is that using the number of ==TITLE== and setting an arbitrary cut-off point would work, though I'm sure using Kb would also work.

<dd>Yes, that was my plan. As for when to go on to the next archive, I'm pretty flexible; let me know how you want it handled, and I'll do it. It's just as easy to go by Kb or by number of level-2 section headers (I'll be treating each ==section== and all of its ===subsections===, ====subsubsections====, etc. as a single indivisible unit). Picking some actual numbers would be helpful; the size of the last few archive pages ranges all the way from 70K to 241K. (By the way, I can also make it update <a href="../../../a/d/m/Template%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_navbox_5a3a.html" title="Template:Administrators' noticeboard navbox">Template:Administrators' noticeboard navbox</a> and <a href="../../../a/d/m/Template%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_navbox_all_e14f.html" title="Template:Administrators' noticeboard navbox all">Template:Administrators' noticeboard navbox all</a> appropriately, though Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incident index obviously would still need a human to maintain it.) —<a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECryptic_b72b.html" title="User:Cryptic">Cryptic</a> <a href="../../../c/r/y/User_talk%7ECryptic_d8a7.html" title="User talk:Cryptic">(talk)</a> 22:55, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think it's a great idea, and I'd like to see the bot extensible and configurable by its creator or maintainer to handle a list of pages (including the noticeboard and subpages and possibly some day others) with configurable deadlines for each (some pages it may be appropriate to archive after a week, some longer, some shorter). <a href="../../../j/d/a/User%7EJdavidb_f8c2.html" title="User:Jdavidb">Jdavidb</a> (<a href="../../../j/d/a/User_talk%7EJdavidb_d285.html" title="User talk:Jdavidb">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jdavidb_e085.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jdavidb">contribs</a>) 21:41, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Excellent. I think the bot should actually cut off by size rather than section count (since some sections are a lot larger than others). How about 100kb? I would also appreciate it if the bot stated at the top of each archive page the dates on which it added to it (so that you can see that e.g. /Archive 12 is really for october 2005). <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 00:01, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>100 Kb seems to be a little small; this page is already 150 Kb and seems kind of short to be a full archive. How about 150 Kb or 200 Kb? <a href="../../../f/l/c/User%7EFlcelloguy_1bb8.html" title="User:Flcelloguy">Flcelloguy</a> <small>(<a href="../../../f/l/c/User_talk%7EFlcelloguy_7b23.html" title="User talk:Flcelloguy">A <font color="brown">note?</font></a>)</small> 00:08, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

<p>Just dropping in to say this is a great idea, Radiant. I would customize the number of days of inactivity in a section though: 1 week or more is about right for AN, but ANI seems to move much faster, perhaps four to five days of inactivity might be better there. As for the mechanics, how about:</p>
<ol>
<li>The bot can be set to run say every 7 days.</li>
<li>Each time it runs, it chooses sections that have been inactive for at least X days, and puts them in the last archive (currently 51 for ANI).</li>
<li>It keeps doing this until it hits a kb limit for that archive (~200kb). If the latest bit of archival material cannot be fit into the archive page without going over eg. 200kb, the bot creates the next Archive page (ie. 52 for ANI). It's probably important for the bot not to try to fit posts to the exact cut-off, because if it does it will end up splitting posts and sections in half.</li>
<li>It updates the nav template. Repeats in 7 days.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>One comment though, I think the bot should run daily. It's pretty low in overhead, anyway. If it runs every seven days, then any section can remain on there for the intended time <i>plus</i> seven days. By the way if this works we may want to do the same on other high-traffic pages, such as the village pump or reference desk. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 12:11, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The glib answer is that it won't be fooled, since you left out a comma between your 24s.

<li>One important issue is, how hard is it going to be to find a given question after it's been archived, especially for inexperienced users? Perhaps we should have a master index of all questions, linking to the relevant archive. Perhaps the bot should post a note to the original contributor's talk page when archiving. <a href="../../../b/o/v/User%7EBovlb_31b0.html" title="User:Bovlb">Bovlb</a> 16:14, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It'll be no different from when a human archives (unless those currently doing so are a whole lot more thorough than I think). Even if no one replies at all, the original poster would have to not check back in a whole week. Failing that a somewhat more experience one could search through the archives, which will still be in rough chronological order - again, no better nor worse than matters as they stand. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Jnc</a> used to maintain Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incident index, but that's been completely neglected since July.

<p>As suggested above, my bot's been updating this page for the last month. Now that we have something concrete there, does anyone actually, truly, use it (as opposed to just "I think it might be useful")? I'd just as soon kill it off. It's not scaling well, and I'm getting tired of fixing it when the formatting breaks because someone used a template in a section header (which isn't easy to fix automatically). —<a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECryptic_b72b.html" title="User:Cryptic">Cryptic</a> <a href="../../../c/r/y/User_talk%7ECryptic_d8a7.html" title="User talk:Cryptic">(talk)</a> 19:46, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Can someone think of a nice way to encourage real diffs for 3RR?</span></h2>
<p>I would work here more, but just about everytime I see a report, the diffs aren't correct. Most of the time they aren't even diffs. How can we reinforce this is the best way for people to get their reports acted on quickly? As examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_3RR_dc8f.html#User:Dbiv" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/3RR">This</a> shows diffs back to the last version</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_3RR_dc8f.html#User:WarriorScribe" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/3RR">This</a> is article versions, not even diffs</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_3RR_dc8f.html#User:HunTomy" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/3RR">This</a> shows easy to determine that they are revert diffs.</li>
</ul>
<p>I can't think of a kind way to point this out to people. Maybe the politically ept among you could help formulate something? <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikibofh_f636.html" title="User:Wikibofh">Wikibofh</a> 19:57, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I thought "version reverted to" was supposted to be a diff showing no changes between a reported version (the 4RR?) and the claimed original version. If that is the case, insert a comment in the template suggesting that link be created by clicking the 4th RV and the original versions in the History page. Also mention to use a similar process for the other links. An indirect way to encourage the desired link is if you change the 3RR format to something which can be extracted from the Diff page. The following is a cut-and-paste from the headers of a Diff, with a space added at the front of each line.</dd>

<dd>The BIG V - So you have deleted my user page. Why? I have been told that I can put any content on my user page if I wish. I wrote what I wrote for an art project. You said that I wrote the word vandilism over and over. Not true. Each word was different and had different meanings, without and within the surrounding words.

So Brookie has decided to ignore me. Great. Who can help me figure this out? When admins go and vandalise my user page (something nobody is supposed to do) and I ask why, they end up ignoring me. I don't mean to generalize all admins and I apoligize for doing so (I'll try not to do so in the future), but it's happened twice now. Shouldn't admins be leaders and show us how to properly act on wiki? The guidelines say you should warn people of deletion of content, this has not happened on my user page. All these questions go unanswered, that's why I wrote what I did further up, and certain people ignore me. I've included the rest of the conversation between him and I since brookie has deleted it from his talk page.</p>

<p>Why do admins ignore simple questions? Delete and run is the only thing I've seen them do. Maybe they're talking amongst eachother to figure out the best plan of attack. Or maybe they're re-writing policy as we act. I know they have a tough job of weeding out unnecessary content, but I have had much more productive talks with users regarding wiki policy than the admins, the people chosen to do the job, have. Please return my original content from my user page as you so gratefully offer on your user page.

<p>It also says, "Note that using the text to recreate the deleted content is speedyable, and using it to keep it hanging around in your userspace has gotten editors penalized before. But that's your problem." - as it has been speedied twice already it's best it stays that way.

<p>I read that.

Where is the appropriate place to talk about admins who ignore genuine debate, or make personal attacks, or who delete content from my user page? This wiki thing is relatively new to me and I think it's unfair to label me a troll when you can see I am genuinely interested in getting straight answers or understandable actions. Please help me out with some facts as to why my chosen user page was deleted, why people choose to ignore me, and why I have to hear personal attacks from an admin. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaviddec_1a85.html" title="User:Daviddec">Daviddec</a> 21:24, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We don't do content disputes on this page. And in most senses there is no "head admin" (although some would argue that our god-king <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimbo_Wales_1525.html" title="Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> has that role. Admins have no more authority with respect to article content than anyone else. If Wikipedia rules are being violated (incivility, <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">excessive reversion</a>, inappropriate sockpuppetry, vandalism), we are able to protect pages and block users. If there is consensus to delete a page, we're the ones who can carry out that consensus, and we also can perform some trickier page moves than others. That's about it. It doesn't sound like any of that is at issue here. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 19:39, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The current wording for the example directions for leads to some confusion. I have made minor changes to the presentation, but the text is particularly un-user-friendly. For example, what does "Use diffs, not versions, and the "compare versions" button!" refer to?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The report template is not adequate</span></h2>
<p>I've been thinking that the current report template is not adequate. Look at the following paragraphs from <a href="../../../t/h/r/Wikipedia%7EThree-revert_rule_1a38.html" title="Wikipedia:Three-revert rule">Wikipedia:Three-revert rule</a> to see why:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Reverting in this context means undoing the work of another editor. It does not necessarily mean going back into the page history to revert to a previous version. The passage you keep adding or deleting may be as little as a few words, or in some cases, just one word.</i></li>
<li><i>This policy does apply to repeatedly moving, renaming, deleting, undeleting, or recreating a page. All of these, if done excessively, are forms of edit warring.</i></li>
<li><i>Reverting doesn't only mean taking a previous version from history and editing that. It means</i> undoing the actions of another editor<i>, and may include edits that undo a previous edit, in whole or in part, or that add something new. Use common sense.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>What I am getting at is that to violate the 3RR, one does <b>not</b> have to revert to the same version of the page. A revert (quote from the policy): <i>may include edits that undo a previous edit, in whole or <b>in part</b></i>. The current template does not enable users with how have been revert warring over only part of an article to be reported. Example:</p>
<ol>
<li>I remove a word from an article</li>
<li>User:A reinserts it</li>
<li>I remove the word again and correct a mistake</li>
<li>User:A reinserts the word again</li>
<li>I remove the word again and correct a different mistake</li>
<li>User:B reinserts the word</li>
<li>I remove the word and add a picture to the article</li>
<li>User:C reinserts the word</li>
<li>I remove the word and add a table and graph to the article</li>
</ol>
<p>Assuming the above happened within the same 24 hour period, I will have violated the 3RR according to the policy, but the current template doesn't provide for such violations to be reported. Many "gaming the system" 3RR violations are also performed in this manner, but are not reported because the template seems to indicate that you have to have reverted to the same version in order to violate the rule, but that's clearly not the case.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Undoing other admins' blocks</span></h2>
<p>I've noticed a spate of wheel wars break out recently, all triggered by one admin deciding to undo another admin's block without even discussing it prior to undoing it. It has reached the point where no one's blocks are safe, and while it's a good thing that all blocks are scrutinized, it's damaging if every block is likely to be undone by a previously uninvolved admin who may not know the background. It's as though none of us can tolerate seeing anything that we disagree with. But this is a wiki. There are bound to be lots of things going on that we don't agree with.</p>
<p>It seems to me that every time this happens, all admins are undermined, because anyone who is blocked only has to keep e-mailing admins until they eventually find one who'll undo it, and that they're likely to find one, so the block may as well not have been imposed in the first place.</p>
<p>I'm posting this to start a discussion about what people think is appropriate. Clearly blocks made in error (e.g. a block for 3RR where there were only three reverts) should be undone, although even then I'd argue that the blocking admin should be consulted first and given a chance to undo it themselves if they're online. But when it comes to judgment calls, my own policy if I disagree with a block is to try to persuade the blocking admin to undo it, but otherwise not to interfere, and in exchange I hope my own blocks won't be interfered with too much either. What do others think? <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 20:59, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>My opinion: if you disagree with a block (unless it is clearly a mistake) then you should first discuss with the blocker (and if it's an indef that you think should be a week etc. then there is no hurry to get a response). Alternatively, post to ANI and get a quick consensus - a consensus of admins should trumph any individual, and make wheel wars unlikely. If a number of admins have agreed a block, no one should ever unilaterally undo it.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><sup>ask?</sup></a> 21:06, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with both SlimVirgin and Doc glasgow. If in doubt, ask questions. If the blocker is offline or responds in an unhelpful way, you basically have two options. The first is to unblock yourself. You should <i>only</i> do this if it is obvious the block is in error. The other is to seek further opinions, on ANI, IRC, or WikiEN-l. However, the first port of call should always be the blocking admin. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Korn_fe1c.html" title="User:Sam Korn">[[Sam Korn]]</a> 21:13, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Oh, this is a touchy subject. I understand that common courtesy requires one to get the blocking administrator's agreement <b>before</b> unblocking. I am not proud to say that on the rare occasion I have undone another administrator's block, I usually do and leave an explanation of my action on his/her talk page.</p>
<p>I agree with what you are saying Slim, but I am thinking that we need a bit of <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_tape.html" title="Red tape">red tape</a> here in order to avoid offence. What we need IMO is a <i>process</i> by which blocked users can appeal. The {{<a href="../../../u/n/b/Template%7EUnblock_0164.html" title="Template:Unblock">unblock</a>}} template could be used in that process and perhaps the administrator or other user who notices that the blocked user has requested to be unblocked can move his request to <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> for scrutiny and to the blocking administrators talk page. Izehar 21:08, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with you, SlimVirgin. Generally, talk first before doing actions. However, in some cases I feel that unblocking doesn't warrant notification - such as collateral damage, etc. If you're disagreeing with the <i>reason</i> for the block, then you probably should consult the other admin first. Talking won't hurt!

<dl>
<dd>(multiple ec) It's a judgement call, of course. I don't agree with the notion that sysop actions should never be undone- like an edit, you should revert it if you strongly feel that's the right thing to do. However, I think this should only happen in the case of obvious mistakes or blatantly unreasonable blocks. When there's just an honest disagreement, discuss it, don't undo it. Of course, some people consider <i>any</i> block that they disagree with to be blatantly unreasonable, which to them justfies undoing it. People who can't see that reasonable people can reasonably disagree should not be sysops, for that very reason. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 21:15, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I too agree with this. Discussing with the blocker is the best option. Otherwise if the blocker is not online then asking online uninvolved admins for opinions is the best way. I also agree with Izehar that a small process is needed where wikipedia editors can appeal for unblock and have blocking admins decide on the block. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_editor_003d.html" title="User:Anonymous editor"><font color="green"><b>a.n.o.n.y.m</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonymous_editor_95c5.html" title="User talk:Anonymous editor"><i>t</i></a></sup> 21:19, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I for one prefer a policy of fix now, talk later in regard to <b>my own blocks</b>, but when it comes to me undoing other's blocks, I always talk first (unless it's something obvious, like unblocking an IP hit by collateral damage). I think there is value in having the admin that placed the block remove it in some cases, but in others, it is senseless to make the poor blocked user wait until the blocking admin can get around to it. That is the reason that I grant carte blanche to all other admins to immediately undo my blocks and then tell me about it. But getting into wheel wars is something entirely different: just don't redo a block that someone else has undone without discussing it. Most of us are adults here, even if we don't always act like it. -- <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> · <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay">Talk</a> 21:19, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The problem I see is that it takes time to discuss a block fully, and it is frequently going to be the case that agreement can't be reached quickly. And in that time there is a block. The idea has always been to only have blocks when necessary and to err on the side of unblocking unless there is serious and immediate danger to Wikipedia - such as a major vandalism attack or a bot attack (in which case there would not be any dispute anyway). I believe in removing the block, and immediately informing the blocking admin to discuss. If agreement is reached that the block was correct, then it can be reinstated. I feel this causes less harm than unfair blocks that simply antagonise and lose us potential contributors.</dd>

<dd>This is even more important in cases of apparent mistaken identity and people caught up in blocks meant for someone else on their IP. In the case of things like AOL blocks, I don't even inform the blocking admin, I just make sure that the (innocent) contributor can get back to editing. User name blocks are of course a different matter and I will always discuss them - just not necessarily <i>before</i> blocking -- <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESannse_0094.html" title="User:Sannse">sannse</a> <a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESannse_2ae9.html" title="User talk:Sannse">(talk)</a> 21:30, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think people agree that in the case of a clear mistake, or someone getting caught in a block intended for others, the block can be undone immediately. But in the case of a judgement call, if we unblock without discussion, we're substituting our own judgement for that of the blocking admin, and that's what I'm arguing is damaging. We should elect people to be admins whose judgement we trust, and then we should trust them, even when we disagree. That doesn't mean we shouldn't try to persuade them of our point of view, or start a discussion about the block on AN/I so that others can chime in. I agree with Izehar about having some process on a special page where unblocking can be requested and discussed. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 21:42, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Agree with many of the above comments. Undoing an admin's block right away casts doubt on the competency of the admin doing the block and is bound to generate ill-will. Unless the block was clearly abuse of administrative powers, try to first voice your objections on the blocking admin's page. <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> (<a href="../../../o/l/e/User_talk%7EOleg_Alexandrov_0298.html" title="User talk:Oleg Alexandrov">talk</a>) 21:35, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>(ec) I think we can differentiate between a purposeful block on a logged in user (which is usually contraversial and needs discussion before reversing - esp PA or disruption blocks) and a routine block by an RC patroller for bog-standard vandalism. I can block two dozen IP's and 'all vandalism' accounts in an evening. If any causes collateral damage, or the user later promises to behave, I am happy for another admin to unblock. There is no need for discussion - in fact don't even bother informing me (unless you feel I 'done bad' and I need to learn for the future). I suspect most RC patrollers will feel the same. But if I judge a logged-in user to merit blocking, I don't want reversed without some discussion (with me - or between a number of admins). --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><sup>ask?</sup></a> 21:46, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, it seems there is definite agreement on one type of block. It's only user name blocks that there is any disagreement on. I think that the disagreement may be about looking from two different perspectives. My worry is the person being blocked, removing that block as quickly as possible, and leaving that block off while it is being discussed. This is different from looking at it from the blockers point of view, not reversing their decision because it may annoy them or imply that they have done wrong. Frankly, I think that all us admins can cope with disagreement with our decisions - it says nothing about our worth as admins and as Wikipedians, it just means that someone disagrees with us on a particular point. I think this better than the bad situation of leaving a disputed block up for hours (or even days) while it is discussed. In my opinion, the default should be unblocked (doesn't the blocking policy say that anyway? if not, it did). -- <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESannse_0094.html" title="User:Sannse">sannse</a> <a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESannse_2ae9.html" title="User talk:Sannse">(talk)</a> 22:03, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think we are all saying largely the same thing here, which is good. Communication is good, overzealous unilateralism is bad. So, at the risk of pointing out the obvious, I'll go a bit further. <i>If</i> your block has been undone by another admin, even in blatant violation of the courtesy discussed here, even if you think they are obviously wrong, <i>do not</i> reblock yourself. This is how wheel wars start. The proper action would be to take it to that admin's talk page, ask other uninvolved admins, take it here. Once you're in a wheel war, it's both admins who are misbehaving, regardless of the subject of the wheel war. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 22:12, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>(EC) I think Sannse is right about two points of view; some of us see it as a "help a <i>potential</i> victim" issue, and others see it as a "respect the judgement of the blocker" issue. I know I for one see it as a matter of "innocent until proven guilty": until we know the block should be there (i.e., have discussed it) it shouldn't be there. My way of seeing this done is to immediately bring it up on the blocking admins talk, but if I don't see an answer within ten minutes, I unblock (with a summary like "unblocking until I can discuss this with [admin's name]") and bring it up on AN/I. I think that solves both problems; it gives the blocking admin the chance to respond, but it also prevents the blocked user from having to sit through an undue block until the matter can be discussed. I think the easiest, and best, way to advocate for this policy is to lead by example, which is why my userpage says in bold: <b>I strongly encourage other administrators who feel I have made an action inappropriately to take the appropriate action to rectify it and follow up with a note to me.</b> -- <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> · <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay">Talk</a> 23:01, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(edit conflict twice) Would it be possible to mention <a href="../../../r/e/q/Category%7ERequests_for_unblock_4c8c.html" title="Category:Requests for unblock">Category:Requests for unblock</a> and {{<a href="../../../u/n/b/Template%7EUnblock_0164.html" title="Template:Unblock">unblock</a>}} in that message a blocked user gets when he/she tries to edit a page? I don't know if this would be a good idea though - it could be abused by vandals and would create a backlog. Perhaps there could be two of those messages, one for vandals, one for other blocked users (the class to be determined by the blocking sysop). I think that that may be in the realm of science fiction though. IMO using the mailing list and IRC to appeal to blocks is not very transparant and it would be better if things like that were discussed on Wikipedia. Izehar 22:21, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I generally agree that blocks should not be undone without prior discussion with the blocking admin. I would like to add two important caveats to my endorsement. First, sometimes unblocking can eliminate an impending conflict, and thus quickly doing so serves the purpose of wikipedia. Recently there was a case where an admin was caught in colateral damage from one of his bots being blocked. He unblocked his bot, and a wheel war ensued where another admin reinstated the block (since the user was unblocking himself). In this case I unblocked the bot immeadiately, because the conflict which led to the initial block of the bot had been resolved, and my unblocking ended the wheel war (because no one was unblocking themselves). In this case, no one objected to my actions. Second, circumstances change. I think if in the judgement of an administrator the circumstances surrounding the block have been resolved, then the block can be removed without discussion. So for instance, if I block a user for personal attacks, saying that I will unblock when the user appologies, another admin can unblock if the user appologies without discussing it with me first. This is importantly different from removing a block that another admin believes to be wrong. Here, the block is only removed once the conditions set out by the blocking admin have been satisfied. --best, kevin <b>[</b><a href="../../../k/z/o/User%7EKzollman_a660.html" title="User:Kzollman">kzollman</a><b>][</b><a href="../../../k/z/o/User_talk%7EKzollman_107b.html" title="User talk:Kzollman">talk</a><b>]</b> 22:56, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's very bad for Wikipedia if there is a division among admins about blocks. It's like a naughty boy who knows that whenever his father stops his pocket money for bad behaviour, he can just go to his mother who will take his side - it makes it impossible to enforce blocking policy. Contacting the blocking admin over your concerns is important. However there may be circumstances in which this is impractical - where the blocking admin is in another time zone and has gone to bed or work and therefore is unavailable for a substantial period. Also, admins do not inevitably follow blocking policy themselves and in the case of a clear breach of policy (such as blatant use out of process in order to win a content dispute), it would be wrong to insist on a response consenting to a commutation of the block. However, a User talk page note should always be left. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 23:22, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's extremely bad precedent for one administrator to unilaterally undo another administrator's block (except in cases of clear and obvious error, or when the blocking administrator is unreachable for an extended period of time (e.g. many, many hours). The second administrator rarely understands the full context of the block, and is thus often in a <i>worse</i> position to provide the necessary judgement as to whether a block is warranted. Also, as has been pointed out, wheelwars are starting to regularly ensue, and this kind of division encourages badly acting editors to run to their buddies when they've been misbehaving and gotten blocked. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 03:35, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think getting possessive about our blocks is a bad idea, the same way as getting possessive about our edits is (see <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>). We're all in it to create an encyclopedia, disagreeing is a perfectly natural thing to do, and getting all worked up about who's banned who and who is allowed to undo who's block and what's blocking whoever and whether admin a is interfering with block c by admin w... it all gets very confusing. I prefer to presume good faith on the contributor's behalf. It's much better that we let them contribute than not - if it turns out they are a good contributor, then we haven't soured their attitude towards the project by preventing them from contributing, but if they are a bad contributor, there's not much harm done as their edits can easily be removed. <b>If in doubt - unblock</b>.

<dd>I know. But, <i>in my own personal opinion</i>, as a general rule, admin action should be treated for these purposes like edits. Being bold is not meant to encourage edit warring, it's meant to encourage doing the right thing. We should not be so pompous with respect to use of our sysop functions that we're automatically offended when someone undoes them. What's easily done can be easily undone. That's what bold/revert/discuss is about, and I stand by my opinion that it should be applied to administrative action as well as edits. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 04:36, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I agree that admins should not expect some prerogative just because they pressed the button first, but I do not agree with "if in doubt, unblock", because there is the very real possibility that your doubt stems from incomplete knowledge of the facts. You should remove all such doubt before unblocking, or you risk making a fool of yourself <i>and</i> upsetting someone else.

I am one of those that sees an unblock to be the equivalent of a single revert. It's not a revert war if you reverse an edit - but it is if you continue to do so. I understand that one should consider carefully before reversing a block and respect the opinion of the other admin, but I don't think that should stop us from making a decision that we believe is right. -- <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESannse_0094.html" title="User:Sannse">sannse</a> <a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESannse_2ae9.html" title="User talk:Sannse">(talk)</a> 10:57, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think that a single unblock is a wheel war. I don't feel the question is about whether an admin is blocking inside policy or not, but is about what you should do if you disagree with a block. Yes, assume good faith applies to admins too, but what is better for the wiki? A wrongly blocked user and an admin who's had their ego stroked successfully, or a user who's had his mistaken block removed and an annoyed admin? I think we're underestimating the damaging the former can cause: "Yes, I tried editing that Wikipedia site, but I removed some stuff I disagreed with and then I got a message saying I was banned from using the site!" Yes, the statement is inaccurate, but it's what happens, and we should avoid it, even if it means that an admin's toes get stepped on. The admins should be above getting touchy about it. Yes, having your toes stood on hurts, but it's not worth fighting a battle about. <a href="../../../t/a/l/User%7ETalrias_6b30.html" title="User:Talrias">Talrias</a> (<a href="../../../t/a/l/User_talk%7ETalrias_9ef0.html" title="User talk:Talrias">t</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Talrias_7d2c.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Talrias">e</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Talrias_2658.html" title="Special:Contributions/Talrias">c</a>) 12:40, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It takes two to wheel war, and if trust is the issue, reinstating the block just doubles the problem. I think it makes sense to discuss unblocks with the blocking admin first, but if someone unblocks without discussing, I think it's the responsibility of other admins to discuss first, not start a wheel war. <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJYolkowski_a02b.html" title="User:JYolkowski">JYolkowski</a> // <a href="../../../j/y/o/User_talk%7EJYolkowski_46ed.html" title="User talk:JYolkowski">talk</a> 16:37, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm worried that an important line of argument has been lost here. Many of the above comments are casting this as a debate between "offending a blocking admin" and "scaring away users". While one ought not offend when possible, I don't think that this is the reason we should not undo actions of our fellow admins. The concern is that it sends the wrong message to (already marginal) contributors that what they have done (a) isn't so bad or (b) they can get away with it by causing a stink. We don't want to foster either of these attitudes. Now perhaps its not worth scaring away good contributors to prevent sending this message, its hard to tell I think. --best, kevin <b>[</b><a href="../../../k/z/o/User%7EKzollman_a660.html" title="User:Kzollman">kzollman</a><b>][</b><a href="../../../k/z/o/User_talk%7EKzollman_107b.html" title="User talk:Kzollman">talk</a><b>]</b> 20:41, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK, then, so, let an admin think very hard (and in not perfectly clear-cut cases consult with other admins) about the need for a block, and doubly so when blocking another admin. And let the admin who wishes to unblock do the same.

<p>As for the argument that we can't have "when in doubt, unblock" as an operating principal, I have only one response: <b>It is the responsibility of the blocking admin to make the reasons for the block clear.</b> If you do not want your blocks overturned, you damn well better explain yourself on the user's talk page. The message should contain enough context (use diffs when needed) that any person previously unfamiliar with the circumstances isn't left wondering why the block was applied. I personally see no problem with unblocking someone if I'm unable to find adequate justification for the block, and I shouldn't have to play detective to find that justification. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 14:41, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In general I agree with your points, but also I think there's a big difference between 1) "No reasoning at all was provided", 2) "The reasoning was unclear" and 3) "I don't agree with the reasoning".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In the first case, unless the mistake was quite obvious (3RR block for only two reverts), I'd ask the admin for their reasoning. If the admin didn't respond quickly, I'd unblock pending further information.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In the second case, I'd request clarification, but keep the block in place. Sometimes an admin has so much information on a case that they may mistakenly omit some of the context. Often a few clarifications can make the reasoning crystal clear. If the reasoning is still unclear after the blocking admin attempts to clarify, the matter should be brought to <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In the third case, an admin may still disagree with a block, even when presented with clear and detailed reasoning. I'd keep the block in place but immediately bring the matter to <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a>. Admins often disagree over what constitutes personal attacks or disruption. Unblocking without discussion should be highly discouraged in these cases.</dd>

<dd>I agree with Friday's and Carbonite's remarks, and in fact I think it wouldn't hurt to put something along those lines in policy. The only thing I'd add is that "reasoning" is a slightly nebuluous term; it's not just "what is the policy basis" but also "what is the evidential basis". Alleged behaviour that is being sanctioned should either be pretty obvious, reasonably well-documented at the time of the block (on or linked from the relevant user /talk page), or at least clarified on request. If it's too much effort to clarify (eg too complicated), admins shouldn't act unilaterally, and should demonstrate community support on WP:ANI first (allowing for short blocks whilst discussion on WP:ANI is taking place). <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/d/2/User_talk%7ERd232_56da.html" title="User talk:Rd232">talk</a></sup> 15:30, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think the blocking policy as it is should be followed. 'if you disagree with a block placed by another admin, please contact that admin to discuss the matter' unless there was a clear mistake by the blocking admin. If there was a mistake we all agree it's ok to unblock first and explain why. In absence of that it should simply be discussed first and unless there is a pretty good reason to overturn it should be left alone. It's like the instant replay rule. The decision stands unless there's clear evidence the call is wrong. Overall we should give each other deference and only reverse eachothers decisions when the decision was clearly wrong. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 19:28, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ignoring for a second that this is a probable <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> post, I think that undoing another administrator's block is a reasonable course of action as a first step. If the administrator had made the block based on an ArbCom decision (etc) with significant evidence, then the block should not be able to be unblocked. However, if the administrator just blocked with no reason, or else no substantial reason, then the user concerned should be unblocked pending review. This is the fair way to do things. The original blocking administrator should take this as a review of their decision, rather than a permanent thing, and hence should not redo their block. Depending on the type of original block, the original block can then be reinstated after review (but not unilaterally by another admin). So if it was a 24 hour block, it probably shouldn't be reblocked, but an indefinite block maybe should be. While 24 hour blocks done unfairly probably don't hurt Wikipedia too much, indefinite blocks, and long term blocks do. Except in exceptional circumstances (and obvious ones), long term blocks shouldn't be being made without discussion anyway. If admins would discuss with other admins before making a block, with an aim to get concensus, then we likely wouldn't have this kind of problem. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 01:56, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree (your text at the end) that an admin should maybe talk to other admins about issuing a block. But then, you saying that undoing a block would be "a reasonable course of action as a first step", and I find that silly rather than anything else.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Shape and size of AN/ANI</span></h2>
<p>Despite the good work of the archival bot, AN and especially ANI have grown impractically large (ANI was 450 kb yesterday). It is becoming impractical for some users to read and edit them (indeed, I find myself using a history diff rather than read the board as a whole, so that I can get the relevant info in the top few lines). Note that we already have a new noticeboard for sockcheck requests (<a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_checkuser_3b77.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser">Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser</a>).</p>

<li>A subpage for comments about admins is a bad idea indeed — it will turn into repeated impromptu RfCs, without the kind of frivolity-protection RfC currently affords. Subpages per day will make it hard to just follow running conversations, unless you meticulously watchlist every single day's subpage. It's useful to be able to just see what's afoot without having to remember to watchlist every single thing. I recognize that they get long, but the current proposal isn't the right solution.

<dd>Yes, that one might be a duplicate, but I think most of the stuff likely to go there would asctually be comments on admins who should/not have done a protection rather than requests <i>for</i> (un)protection.

Or perhaps it needs a different name, since I figure its usage would be "I need a blocking, over there, now!", but "hey, do you think this is vandalism", or "hey, so I found this and was wondering...". -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 00:17, 19 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>I thought someone had suggested this already, why not split it into "Requests for admin assistance" and "Administrator discussion"?

It could be argued that the proper place for two-thirds of AN/I <i>discussions</i> is somewhere else (a user's talk page, an article's talk page, a policy page or discussion, WP:VIP or 3RR). Users should be encouraged to submit a brief notification summarising the incident, with diffs and links to the correct place for discussion, but replies <i>on AN/I</i> should be discouraged (unless it is to update admins about escalations, or tell everyone the incident has been dealt with). All admins watching the page should still get an idea of what's going on, interested admins will follow up, and individual incidents will be less likely to get lost in the morass. --RobertG ♬ <a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobertG_9f35.html" title="User talk:RobertG">talk</a> 11:00, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Need help with a redirect for Microfinance</span></h2>
<p>Hello, I'm new to Wikipedia and need help changing a redirect. The word Microfinance currently redirects to Microcredit. That is incorrect, it's an old use of the word, but the terms are not synonymous anymore, microcredit is a narrow definition (involves only credit) and microfinance is a broader terms, that involves all types of financial services (credit, insurance, savings, loans etc.) for the poor.</p>
<p>Can you please get rid of the redirect? Alternatively, you can keep the text for Microcredit, and I can create a new entry for Microfinance.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Repeated or aggravated 3RR" &gt; 24 hour blocks</span></h2>
<p>WMC raises the very valid point that the 3RR only explicitly authorises blocks up to 24 hours. But practice seems to be that longer blocks are sometimes in order (typically after a number of 24 hour such), and there seems to be some explicit, and much tacit, support for this. If this is indeed the case, it should probably be made explicit on the policy page. Or, we could stop doing so, though I doubt they'd the arbcom'd be pleased if we start filtering all such cases to them for further sanction. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 21:43, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I wasn't able to locate any so I am posting my questions and requests here. I was blocked earlier today for creating a new user account that somehow violated Wikilaw. Whether it was the spaces, length, punctuation, or unique character usage I do not know (though I suspect it's the black box.) I do know that it not only blocked the username but also blocked my IP address too. If there are certain characteristics that a username can and can't have why doesn't PHP check for these before submitting the name to the DB. The username in question is User:Chip_off_the_ol'_█. If I can't use this new name, that is fine, it was for experimental purposes anyway, but I do think it would be prudent to add code to verify if a username is valid before submitting it and consequently blocking an entire IP address.

<p>I suggest that the standard procedure for removal of edits on a large page with very many revisions be as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Move the page to some temp name, preferably one that gives a clue as to what's going on, e.g. AN_being_recreated_shortly.</li>
<li>Edit the redirect left behind to create a brief page explain what's happening and give a time frame for when everything will be normal. Sign this page.</li>
<li>Delete and selectively restore the temp page</li>
<li>Delete the explanation so the temp page can be moved back</li>
<li>Move the temp page back to its original name (and delete the temp page redirect)</li>
</ol>
<p>This is to minimise the time/number of hits when people find a deleted page when they weren't expecting to.-<a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadfium_9104.html" title="User:Gadfium">gadfium</a> 02:58, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sure, there will be people who don't know where the delete log is - but if that's seen as a big problem, perhaps we could put a link to it on the blank page notice "to see if this page has recently been deleted, please check the <a href="../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_delete_f5f8.html" title="Special:Log/delete">deletion log</a>" -- <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESannse_0094.html" title="User:Sannse">sannse</a> <a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESannse_2ae9.html" title="User talk:Sannse">(talk)</a> 18:01, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Checking the delete log would have been a good idea, but what I actually did in this situation was to go to history and look at the deleted revision. I know non-admins can't do that, and it's much more stress on the servers, but I'm sure I'm not the only person who sometimes does things the inefficient way because something unexpected happened and I didn't sit back and consider carefully the best way to investigate.-<a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadfium_9104.html" title="User:Gadfium">gadfium</a> 23:00, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
