I just came to this board to report Armadillo, as well his allies Atomaton and others, but I see that Armadillo has already made an entry of me here. Apparently Armadillo believes that if oneself is the first person to report the dispute, then people will think that oneself is in the right, even when the evidence shows otherwise. It doesn't work like that, Armadillo... or at least I hope it doesn't.</p>
<p>I have extensively catalogged many of the policy violations of User:Atomaton in an entry that I made to this board. That entry was disruptively deleted by the admin <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">User:Ryulong</a>, who, not surprisingly, is known to have a long history of disrupting wikipedia. Look at the edit history of this page to read the deleted entry.</p>
<p>In addition to Armadillo's above lie (which can be seen to be a lie simply by following the links that he/she has provided), he has also made uncivil false accusations and threats against me on the pages that he so conveniently linked to.</p>

<p>I won't comment or reply on <a href="../../../e/m/b/User%7EEmbryoglio_db7f.html" title="User:Embryoglio">Embryoglio</a>'s rant. I've been reminded several times recently to not feed the trolls. Anyone who desires to know what is going on here can best make up their own mind by reading recent comments on the <a href="../../../b/r/e/Talk%7EBreast_903e.html" title="Talk:Breast">talk:breast</a>. Also useful might be <a href="../../../p/e/r/Wikipedia%7EPersonal_attack_intervention_noticeboard_ca1f.html" title="Wikipedia:Personal attack intervention noticeboard">Wikipedia:Personal_attack_intervention_noticeboard</a> for <a href="../../../e/m/b/User%7EEmbryoglio_db7f.html" title="User:Embryoglio">user:embryoglio</a>. Reading those will indicate that several people have complained about <a href="../../../e/m/b/User%7EEmbryoglio_db7f.html" title="User:Embryoglio">Embryoglio</a>, and that my role has been marginal.</p>
<p>As for the <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breast.html" title="Breast">breast</a> article, civil discussion between the other current editors of the article on the talk pages and elsewhere, including <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotherAmy_5698.html" title="User:MotherAmy">user:MotherAmy</a>, user:RexImperium, <a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzy_n_12cc.html" title="User:Xyzzy n">user:Xyzzy n</a>, <a href="../../../i/_/a/User%7EI_already_forgot_0fa6.html" title="User:I already forgot">user:I already forgot</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHoneymane_ba48.html" title="User:Honeymane">user:Honeymane</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmadilloFromHell_83a4.html" title="User:ArmadilloFromHell">user:ArmadilloFromHell</a>, <a href="../../../2E/v/2E/User%7E.V._5c4f.html" title="User:.V.">user:.V.</a> and <a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">user:Jpgordon</a> have led to a discussion of what images are desired on the article. We've pretty much resolved any disputes and have moved forward while <a href="../../../e/m/b/User%7EEmbryoglio_db7f.html" title="User:Embryoglio">user:embryoglio</a> seems to have become mired in arguments with every person that has disagreed with him at some point. Apparently that list now includes <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel.Bryant_22a1.html" title="User:Daniel.Bryant">Daniel.Bryant</a> and <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">User:Ryulong</a>. My approach, as is likely the approach of the other editors listed above, is to just ignore future comments from <a href="../../../e/m/b/User%7EEmbryoglio_db7f.html" title="User:Embryoglio">Embryoglio</a> and proceed onward to improve the quality of the article. I have full confidence that <a href="../../../e/m/b/User%7EEmbryoglio_db7f.html" title="User:Embryoglio">Embryoglio</a> will someday be a constructive and positive adition to Wikipedia. Several users,including myself, have recommended that he get familiar with Wikipedia policies and guidelines, including <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">WP:CIV</a>, <a href="../../../e/q/_/WP%7EEQ_4006.html" title="WP:EQ">WP:EQ</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECON_c65b.html" title="WP:CON">WP:CON</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>, <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">WP:DR</a> and <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a> <a href="../../../a/t/o/User%7EAtomaton_fe94.html" title="User:Atomaton">Atom</a> 16:52, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

" That doesn't imply that others are mired. That is, I didn't say that you were mired in arguments with Embryoglio.

(The page is more or less screaming, "<a href="../../../b/e/a/WP%7EBEANS_2a59.html" title="WP:BEANS">Don't shove beans up your nose!</a>") This, if anything, is an argument for the usefulness of real time IRC, although in this case, admins seemed to not be watching the channel. 40 edits passed on #vandalism-en-wp before I realize that I had to alert an admin, and Zoe promptly blocked it. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGracenotes_686d.html" title="User:Gracenotes"><font color="#960">Grace</font><font color="#000">notes</font></a><sup><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGracenotes_98ea.html" title="User talk:Gracenotes"><font color="#960">T</font></a></sup> § 00:50, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>And only because I caught the edit summaries on the Recent Changes page and noticed the User name. Next time they probably won't be so nice as to leave us a noticeable name.

<dd>Actually, the idea was that the automatic edit summary would make it easy to see that the script was used.

<dd>I mentioned <a href="../../../b/e/a/WP%7EBEANS_2a59.html" title="WP:BEANS">WP:BEANS</a> because having this page on Wikipedia might make mischief more accessible to those of malicious intent. <a href="../../../b/e/a/WP%7EBEANS_2a59.html" title="WP:BEANS">WP:BEANS</a> does refer to how forbidding the exploitation of a weakness can cause that exploitation, but vandals and trolls that actively search for such weaknesses may find the presence of this page an invitation. The invitation is not made by saying "do this" (black-hat hackers "helping" fellow trouble-makers) or "don't do this" (<a href="../../../b/e/a/WP%7EBEANS_2a59.html" title="WP:BEANS">WP:BEANS</a>), but made merely by the existence of that page. I hope my thoughts are somewhat more lucid to you now. Someone might not go through the trouble of writing a script themselves, but having one readily available requires less skill on the behalf of a criminal.</dd>

<dd>Perhaps I'm simply delirious with disaster fever: the mindset that "Hm, something went wrong, so something must be done about it to prevent it from ever happening again." For example, I might suggest captchas, but then there would have to be exceptions, such as <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntiVandalBot_aa84.html" title="User:AntiVandalBot">User:AntiVandalBot</a>, and thus begins instruction creep. Going through all of the above (moving to meta, etc.) is a nice gesture, but if someone wants to use this script to exploit Wikipedia, an indefinite block is warranted. End of story. While this course of actions is regrettable, I suppose that there really is no remedy.

<dd>These aren't copyviolations. The artwork in question is clearly PD, as clearly noted in the image summaries. The source should not matter, as a photograph of original artwork is not copyrightable due to the fact that there's no original content to distinguish it from the original (if it was, then anyone could walk into an art museum, photograph all of the paintings there, and then claim copyright on them). If the paintings themselves were copyrighted, then you would have a problem, but they're Public Domain. The copyvio tags are misplaced. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheQuandry_2564.html" title="User:TheQuandry">TheQuandry</a> 19:33, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I would like to revert these again, but due to <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>, I won't (something this E tac had been banned for in the past).

<p>Agree with the above. Plus, the title has to be changed from the epithet "periyar", to E.V.Ramaswamy Naicker, which was his name and the way he always called himself. Periyar is actually a river that runs in Tamil Nadu, and therefore this title is actually the name of the river and not of E.V.Ramaswamy Naicker ­ <span class="sigSrkris" style="background:gold;color:#FF0000"><a href="../../../s/r/k/User%7ESrkris_bf65.html" title="User:Srkris">Kris</a> (<a href="../../../s/r/k/User_talk%7ESrkris_6c1c.html" title="User talk:Srkris">talk</a>)</span> 23:53, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Posting following an unblock-en-l request by this user. Seems like there's a little more going on, here, than a simple open-shut case.

The image would then be deleted after a week. Reference to the deleted image would then be removed from the article. By removing them first, Oden is also tagging them as orphaned, when he is the one who orphaned them. Although it does seem against the usual etiquette in these areas, its hard to see a policy violation on his part. <a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WJB</b><i>scribe</i></a>&#160;<sup><small><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe">(<b>WJB</b> <i>talk</i>)</a></small></sup> 19:44, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Some of those edits are correct, while others are questionable. I've suggested to Oden that he discuss removing infobox images on talk pages before simply doing so: it is only his opinon that they serve a merely decorative purpose there. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 20:30, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks; he seems to be following normal procedure now.

<dd>My experience has shown that such images invariably will be deleted, so leaving them in the article will simply created many red links at some point in the future. Also, the uploader in question has uploaded over 50 copyrighted images in a short period of time. Since there are so many images, and they will all without a doubt be deleted (see the last paragraph of {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EPromophoto_9608.html" title="Template:Promophoto">Promophoto</a>}} and <a href="../../../f/u/c/WP%7EFUC_7b76.html" title="WP:FUC">WP:FUC</a> criterion #1) then there is no need to keep them in the article. The alternative is that OrphanBot does the job in seven days, but my experience is that users do not appreciate multiple warning messages (see <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">User:Jtdirl</a>). In the same manner I only post one warning on the user's talk page, even if I have tagged multiple images. If the deletion is contested I have no problem with the image returning to the article, but then the tag {{<a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_substitution_a63d.html" title="Wikipedia:Template substitution">subst</a><tt>:</tt><a href="../../../r/e/f/Template%7ERefu-c_70a3.html" title="Template:Refu-c">refu-c</a>}} has to be attached to the caption. --<a href="../../../o/d/e/User%7EOden_515b.html" title="User:Oden">Oden</a> 00:11, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><i>leaving them in the article will simply created many red links at some point in the future.</i> If people actually made sure an image wasn't in use, and removed links BEFORE deleting, as they should reasonably be expected to, that would not be a concern. I have found, without even looking, at least 4 cases where this happened in the last week, and shouldn't have (all of which just happened to be {{<a href="../../../r/e/p/Template%7EReplaceable_fair_use_fbaf.html" title="Template:Replaceable fair use">Replaceable fair use</a>}}, which seems to land itself to this by sheer value of removing a need to post a notice in the article, as is often request for IFD). <a href="../../../c/i/r/User%7ECirceus_e372.html" title="User:Circeus">Circeus</a> 00:24, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm speaking up here because if Oden is guilty, I almost certainly am also guilty. In my case, I will remove a fair-use image being used in violation of <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">WP:FU</a> solely to depict a living person immediately upon noticing it if the image was newly added. On images which have been there a while, I'll leave it for the full seven days. On an image that is a blatant violation of <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">WP:FU</a>, there's no reason not to remove it immediately. Note that there's nothing in policy that demands the image stay the full seven days. In fact, at least one of the bots if I remember correctly (and I may not) will remove images after four or five days of the image being marked. Anyway, I haven't taken a look at Oden's recent log but every time I've checked his removals in the past, they have been of images which obviously violate <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">WP:FU</a>. In my opinion, it is a good idea to remove obvious violations of Wikipedia policy as soon as they are discovered. Mel Etitis, an editor I have a great deal of respect for, may not be up-to-date on <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">WP:FU</a> and the problems with using fair-use images to depict living people. Jimbo Wales has spoken up on this topic several times though of course, that shouldn't be taken as a dictate from a deity. Note, though, that an image in an infobox <i>does</i> serve merely to depict the person. I wouldn't say that such use is purely decorative but it <i>is</i> a clear violation of <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">WP:FU</a> to use a fair-use image there. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 01:47, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>His edits violate WP:NPOV by excluding the notable views of human rights organizations and international publications. The article where conflict began involves the alleged complicity of the then Indian government in a massacre which resulted in the deahts of 2000 people. I made the case that the recollection of information from notable third parties, including newspapers, human rights organizations, and governments, need to be considered with the official statements of the same indian government. Everything I added has been repeatedly deleted in an edit war. Him and those sharing his view have simply dismissed all my sources and suggested sources by deeming their actions as being anti-Hindu (on the talk page, this includes the US State Dept which cancelled an Indian politician's diplomatic and visitors visa due to his involvement in the massacre).</p>
<p>If his edit warring to exclude WP:RS isn't enough, his justifications for his edits and his responses in edit summaries and talk pages have been extremely and repetitively offensive. He has accused me of being "Hinduphobic","racist", "indophobic", he has called me a "bigot", a "fanatic", described me as "ignorant", etc. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2002_Gujarat_violence&amp;diff=99586377&amp;oldid=99585012" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2002_Gujarat_violence&amp;diff=99586377&amp;oldid=99585012" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2002_Gujarat_violence&amp;diff=99250295&amp;oldid=99248983" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2002_Gujarat_violence&amp;diff=99250295&amp;oldid=99248983" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3A2002_Gujarat_violence&amp;diff=99592014&amp;oldid=99591702" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3A2002_Gujarat_violence&amp;diff=99592014&amp;oldid=99591702" rel="nofollow">[25]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AWikiProject_Islam&amp;diff=99255344&amp;oldid=99253536" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AWikiProject_Islam&amp;diff=99255344&amp;oldid=99253536" rel="nofollow">[26]</a> My comments in regards to the subject matter may seem hostile to one who doesn't consider that the matter in question revolves around an incident where over 2000 people were massacred, several hundred women raped and mutilated, etc. My criticisms on talk pages are limited to the government involved at the time, and the local political figure directly involved in the massacre (the US state dept even banned his visa due to his involvement in human rights violations). <b>There is no justification for the charge of racism or religious hatred whatsoever.</b> I have said nothing that could be twisted to imply a dislike of Indians or Hindus, and for the record I have no feelings against them. I have been hostile in response to these allegations, as anyone would charged with bigotry. In I have not used partisan sources to support up my edits though. Rumplestiltskin has repeatedly deleted content I added that would add the findings of internationally highly regarded (ie Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, The Guardian newspaper), which WP:NPOV suggests are essential to give ALL NOTABLE VIEWS voice in the article. His latest violation includes deleting a comment I made on the talk page and adding a warning template to my own talk page alleging 'defamation'. Please do something as I've already lost patience with this person too many times. Note: I have already been threatened by an admin for responding to this character, but no action has been taken in regards to his instigating behavior (ie his REPEATED allegations of anti-India hatred and anti-hindu bigotry) <a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFalcon2020_4eb8.html" title="User:Falcon2020">Falcon2020</a> 06:09, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>From WP:Vandalism:</b> "Talk page vandalism Deleting the comments of other users from Talk pages other than your own, aside from removing internal spam, vandalism, etc. is generally considered vandalism. Removing personal attacks is often considered legitimate, and it is considered acceptable to archive an overly long Talk page to a separate file and then remove the text from the main Talk page. The above does not apply to the user's own Talk page, where this policy does not itself prohibit the removal and archival of comments at the user's discretion."</p>

<p>While both of you have been rather harsh to eachother, I must say that after reading the talk pages and the article's disscussion, it appears that Rumpelstiltskin223 is removing acceptable content based on his own opinions, and then attacking Falcon for putting up the other side. This is obviously a violation of Wikipedia's NPOV. I may be wrong, but whether I am or not comes down to one question, does Wikipedia consider the HRW to be a reliable source. <a href="../../../f/a/l/User_talk%7EFalcon2020_49f1.html" title="User talk:Falcon2020">"Plus, HRW is not neutral or reputable.

<li>Choice quote, out of the whole bundle:I "have decided not to do anything for now, there are stuff that I wanted to merge and clean up anyway. Spending time with those irrational deletionist is just wasting my time, that is what they are seeking: editors in this project ending up with no time to improve the article and at the end making them able to try to nominate desembling this project itself. They do not even want to follow rules in WP:FICT that minor characters should get a list. (The most unreasonable nom would be the RX-78 which is already a list) They can shovel WP:ICANBULLYYOU all they want, the articles can be recreated one by one as long as we can create a process of deciding which should be kept and what should be in a long list(also what lists should there be). All the articles go through this project's editor's inspection, rewritten to a point where any of those AfD is just going to make them look more irrational and vandal/troll like. Join me, let them have their small victory over old and outdated cruff, and we will gain back a larger ground later and laugh at their short-sightedness. For the admin up there, would you kindly try to be the closing admin of RX-78 Gundam and let them know what is the realistic side of the world they do not understand.".</li>

<dd>And that is in itself another assumption of bad faith. "Rid the site of any gundam related articles"? No, that is not true in the slightest.

<dd>To be fair, if you're feeling under attack as it is, it's hard to find another interpretation of "To Do: Nominate every single article in [6+ categories] for deletion." (And yes, that was not Moreschi, to be clear.) I'm thinking it's something of a personal joke, myself, but if I were heavily invested in the articles, I might not see it that way.

<dd>Meanwhile, Moreschi has nominated several Gundam-related articles for deletion, but he's voted keep on RX-78 Gundam. Hopefully, that should send a message to Gundam supporters that there's no massive campaign to wipe every mention of Gundam from Wikipedia. If everyone toned down the language just a bit, I'm sure a fair agreement could be reached. Comments like "ignorant arrogant deletionists" are not helpful at this time. Neither are comments that a user plans to "nominate every single article" in 6 Gundam categories for deletion. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 01:17, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think this is a case study in how not to deal with "the community" as a whole. Moreschi, whether your tagging / cleanup campaign is appropriate under Wikipedia rules or not (and at a quick glance, I agree that it is), if you stir up a previously calm situation into a largescale, many hostile responses hornets nest, that's an indicator that your tactics and approach to what you did were inappropriate. It's percieved as hostile intent of high order, nigh-on blatant bad faith vandalism, by many subsets of Wikipedia's contributors if you go in and make widespread nominations like that, even <i>if</i> the articles are by all rights deletable by wider community standards. Go more slowly and talk to the editors in that sub-area more before you make such widespread change proposals next time? A crisis avoided is a lot more happy beers. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 07:35, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

It is NOT TO BLAME for the articles it has inherited with histories going back to 2004 and potentially earlier. Want to argue AGF some more?

<dd>Er, I was aware of that. That's why I mentioned "WP:GUNDAM and associated editors".

<dd>Honestly though, why do are you escalating the drama? Do you want Mythsearcher blocked? This wasn't drama on the WP:GUNDAM page, this took some searching to find.... Do you have a goal in finding these "incidents" and reporting them? Moreschi is being generous and is working with the Project in this matter, Myth's outburst is unfortunate, but honestly, what good is done by bringing up every instance where a comment in placed in the heat of passion? <a href="../../../k/y/a/User%7EKyaa_the_Catlord_f18d.html" title="User:Kyaa the Catlord">Kyaa the Catlord</a> 10:59, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Read what I actually linked to. This has nothing to do with anything Ned Scott has done. I quite clearly linked to Mythsearcher's comment on Ned Scott's talk page, which goes like this: "It is just impossible to assume good faith in the actions taken by the deletionist. What is currently happening is just like the dark ages, burn them, its something we have never heard of before, it must be heresy. With people making up rules, saying nothing counts as sources, and trying to blame people who have just a little more than a month to work on hundreds of articles, they are being dicks themselves. Especially the one who nominated dozens of articles during another AfD process saying that one is nominated as a precedent to delete others..." If that doesn't violate <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>, I don't know what does.

<dd>Once again, I point out that describing the actions being taken by others is not a personal attack. Calling them "dicks", is... I'll refactor that away, per WP:NPA. This is what is supposed to be done in these cases, not calling for blocks or bans. <a href="../../../k/y/a/User%7EKyaa_the_Catlord_f18d.html" title="User:Kyaa the Catlord">Kyaa the Catlord</a> 12:00, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>"...describing the actions being taken by others is not a personal attack" sounds like hairsplitting to me, but I'll let that slide for now. Blocks and bans are for repeat offenders, which Mythsearcher will be if he doesn't knock it off. He's had fair warning. If he stops now, then fine. The whole atmosphere of incivility and failure to assume good faith at the WP:GUNDAM talk page (and elsewhere) has got to end. I'm glad you seem to be working through an improvement campaign with Moreschi. Keep it civil and get everyone else to keep it civil and this shouldn't be a problem any more. --<a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolantin_9fb0.html" title="User:Folantin">Folantin</a> 12:11, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, I believe the use of the word "dick" in the quoted reference was a response to Ned warning Myth that he should cool down. Things are hot and Myth's venting. He's been warned, he's made constructive edits and not made further heated statements since this one. He's actually taken steps to work with Moreschi to better handle the crapload of bad articles the WikiProject inheritted.... This seems, to me, to be a non-issue at this point. <a href="../../../k/y/a/User%7EKyaa_the_Catlord_f18d.html" title="User:Kyaa the Catlord">Kyaa the Catlord</a> 12:13, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>That looks a tricky one. No edits for ages then not long after a block pops back in again. I've declined the unblock request, I can see how you drew the conclusion, and I tend to draw the same conclusion myself. The user indicates they have no desire to edit Wikipedia, so it seems a little bit like a point being made here. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 11:07, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>It is still demeaning and discourteous to keep the user blocked merely because they indicate that they have no desire to edit Wikipedia. It could be that the user actually still wants to edit Wikipedia, but would rather not admit it (I have been in a similar situation before), or that the user merely wants not to have such a strike against their name. I'm rather inclined, despite my lack of significant knowledge of the Joan of Arc vandal, to think that Cwiki is not the vandal. Cwiki's IP address puts the connection as being from Australia, not Virginia, which is consistent with the user's userpage. The user's bias seems to be quite different from that of AWilliamson, and there are many style differences between the two users. Essentially, it seems to me that they are either completely different people, or Cwiki is a sock puppet of AWilliamson for the purpose of either subtly inserting pro-Catholic/French bias while purporting to be inserting anti-Catholic/French bias or aggressively asserting an anti-Catholic bias in order to stir up those with AWilliamson's bias. These sock puppet ideas seem overly complex and unlikely to me, though I will admit again that I am not very familiar with the case. As a side note though, what happened to Cwiki's capitalisation!? Also, in response to Steve block, is it not possible that Cwiki was using the account for reading Wikipedia, but not editing, and then was greeted one day with a New Messages notice that led to the block notice? --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosophus_35c7.html" title="User:Philosophus">Philosophus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilosophus_e2d3.html" title="User talk:Philosophus">T</a></sup> 05:28, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

I reviewed it and weighed it <b>all</b> up and decided not to. I may well have been wrong. The block is still reviewable. I do take objection to the notion that I have refused the unblock request wholly on the grounds that the user indicates that they have no desire to edit Wikipedia. But please, review it yourself and make your own decision. I did note it was a tricky one. And you're right, it is possible that the user has been reading all this while whilst never editing. I've merely attempted to act in the best interests of Wikipedia. I would ask, though, that you note whichever decision you choose to make at the user's talk page to aid future reviewers of the request. Oh, never mind, I've just checked your user page and I see you are an alternative account, so it's unlikely you can unblock. I really can't stand much more of this, to be perfectly honest.

<dd>If it was open-and-shut, I would not have posted here. My IP is currently in Phladelphia, so that can't possibly be me (I edit from one of two static IPs in England). Or can it?

<p>While we're on the subject of bureaucratic instances within Wikipedia, I found the Association of Member's Advocates (AMA) as an apparent example of overcomplexity.

<dd>As far as I'm aware, the role of the co-ordinators in the AMA is merely to co-ordinate. We've never had (and, I hope, never will have) any sort of veto on anything, or any powers over and above those of others - it seems that our role is more to advise and deal with queries to the association than to decide things in closed meetings (Esperanza) or to exercise any kind of special veto. I believe that we used to have our meetings on IRC, until timezones got in the way, and now use a Wikipedia page, which, depsite its apparent complexity, does serve the job of discussion well. Finally, as we advise on policy as "advocates", we do ned to try to stick to it and have at least some procedures in place <tt>:)</tt> (I should say, I am strongly opposed to overbureaucraticization, and would immediately leave the AMA if it went in the direction of Esperanza. Fortunately, we're very open). <strong><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_980f.html" title="User:Martinp23">Mart</a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartinp23_2732.html" title="User talk:Martinp23"><font color="red">inp23</font></a></strong> 21:02, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am being accused as a sockpuppeteer and Bowsy is being accused as my sockpuppet. Llama man and Metros232 aren't using reliable evidence. They are accusing us because we have similar beliefs, userboxes and share a computer. This is not very good evidence. By accusing us for having similar beliefs and intrests, they may as well say it is illegal for any two humans to have similar beliefs and intrests. He is trying to use the edit war as an excuse, but Bowsy only contributed once and then tried to resolve it in a civilised manner. I however, continued to edit and was uncivil while doing so. Llama man has also rejected Bowsy's defence saying they are lies when he has no proof. We live in the same household so we share a computer. This is also why Bowsy created his account shortly after mine and why we edit in regular intervals. Please can you resolve this false accusation before we are unfairly blocked as the sockpuppet and sockpuppeteer we aren't. <a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenchman_2000_6976.html" title="User:Henchman 2000">Henchman 2000</a> 19:32, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am <i>not</i> an admin, just to make that clear. Anyway, I thought I'd make a comment here since I'm mentioned in this comment. I now believe you, for the most part, that you are not sockpuppets. As for a reply to your comments: You had virtually the same layout to your userpage. This is quite unlikely unless a Wikipedian asks another user on their talk page if they may use the same layout, or the users share computers. Metros and I didn't know that you and Bowsy are, or claim to be, sharing a computer, as you didn't mention it before the sockpuppet case. I accused you of being sockpuppets because you had similar layout to your userpages and were strongly opposed to <a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">WP:CRUFT</a> (which isn't really much in itself, but the fact that Bowsy&#160;!voted four minutes after your nom, and it is highly rare for that to happen, it was likely you were the same person), and I had no knowledge that you shared a computer. This does not mean that I might as well have said that it is illegal for two people to have similar interests; rather, because so many things were similar about you and Bowsy, that it seemed you were sockpuppets. –<a href="../../../l/l/a/User%7ELlama_man_ae32.html" title="User:Llama man">Llama</a> <a href="../../../l/l/a/User_talk%7ELlama_man_2dbb.html" title="User talk:Llama man">man</a><sup><span style="color:red;">sign here</span></sup> 20:31, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>86</i> is not a single-purpose account. He's been editing for a long time, at least since April 2006, through a whole host of Eircom DSL addresses, which is why I think of him as my anonymous Eircom fan. Whether he's been editing longer than that depends on whether he has, as claimed, another <i>active</i> account. If he has, I don't know what it is. <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerricco_f627.html" title="User:Jerricco">Jerricco</a> (<a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJerricco_7322.html" title="User talk:Jerricco">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jerricco_08c3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jerricco">contribs</a>) was probably him, but that account is inactive now.

<dd>Judging by another comment of his at the bottom of the page I would say he is NOT threatening war, but commenting on the current situation as a war. <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViridae_a0d4.html" title="User:Viridae">Viridae</a><a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViridae_b84f.html" title="User talk:Viridae"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 09:06, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>What is really inappropriate here is you reverting to your favored version five times in a row with no argument but blithe assertions that "we" have decided that this is the way it should be. That you made yet another revert and then came <a href="#Lame_edit_war" title="">whining about your own edit war</a> on ANI while misrepresenting everyone else's positions is absurd enough, but congratulations you succeeded in getting the page protected on your version.

<li>The fact that both you and Heros immediately resort to ad hominems indicates that you really don't have a good argument. As I recall, I asked you on the talk page what the deal was, and you said it was a dislike for {{<a href="../../../e/s/s/Template%7EEssay_6343.html" title="Template:Essay">essay</a>}} (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Process_is_important&amp;diff=98635755&amp;oldid=98632248" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Process_is_important&amp;diff=98635755&amp;oldid=98632248" rel="nofollow">[58]</a>). Since nobody agreed with you that that was a good reason, and Jeff agreed with me, there was no consensus for your removal of the tag that had been in place since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Process_is_important&amp;diff=79822164&amp;oldid=79319386" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Process_is_important&amp;diff=79822164&amp;oldid=79319386" rel="nofollow">October 6th</a>. Heros came in afterwards talking about "the reason this has no essay tag" when in fact the tag was there for several months. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 17:07, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It's possible for the <i>computer</i> to belong solely to yourself, but for the <i>IP address</i> to rotate from one machine to another. This may be the case with Road Runner which appears to be your ISP. Since Wikipedia has no way of knowing which specific anonymous Road Runner user made the problematic edit, the message you received is going to show up for any contributor who logs in from that address.

<p>The IP address has had a long history of vandalism and was blocked three times before. I was told by Cowman109 that I should post this here. I'm not sure if it would be the best to do a long term block on an IP because of the possible collateral damage. Maybe a soft block would be better?

<p>I have no wish to inflame a situation, but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=100297404" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=100297404" rel="nofollow">this threat</a> made on the Admin Noticeboard must be reported. The user called <a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> is at present the subject of a <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Husnock_7c06.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Husnock">very heated Arbitration case</a>, stemming from his having made a supposed death threat against another Wikipedia user. Husnock left this site about two to three weeks ago, but there have been reappearances of persons on various ip addresses, claiming to have known him or to be supportive of him. The evidence of these persons to the Arb case was all but dismissed, even though some of it was valid, with a group of 2 to 3 people charging Husnock with using different accounts. The ip addresses used by these persons are ranging from several spread throughout a particular region, some of them miles apart posting within minutes of each other, but all of them were being called Husnock simply because he had once lived in the area and that these addresses were giving support of him. In any event, things boiled over when a user called <a href="../../../p/a/h/User%7EPahuskahey_b112.html" title="User:Pahuskahey">Pahuskahey</a> was charged with being an alternate account for Husnock. Pahuskahey was openly called a liar about most everything he posted or said, which by the own definitions of this site qualifies as <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>. Husnock himself apparently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&amp;diff=100286517&amp;oldid=100280421" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&amp;diff=100286517&amp;oldid=100280421" rel="nofollow">returned to clear the air</a>, stating he did not want to edit on this site and that these persons over the past few weeks were not connected with him. This was immediately attacked by certain persons followed by a threat from <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesknight_2ce5.html" title="User:Charlesknight">Charlesknight</a> that Husnock better <b>“seriously think about what he was doing”</b> or there would be <b>“serious real world ramifications for you”</b> and that Husnock should <b>“think about your career and where you are”</b>. Wikipedians, what ever you may think about Husnock, that statement I just quoted is a threat pure and simple. Husnock was dragged over the coals because he made a vague reference to someone watching what they said because he was in the military, this later being called a death threat. What was said by Charlesknight is much more blatant a threat than anything Husnock ever said or did. It references Husnock’s real life, his job, and then says that he better think about where he is, as if someone is going to come and find him. Husnock’s initial actions (which I cannot defend because they have been pretty low) does not give others the right to now threaten him and throw all policies of this website to the wind. Pure neutral people need to handle this and need to end this. The same group seems to be reappearing, over and over again, trying to attack and bring down this user with this spilling over to Pahuskahey who hasn’t done a thing wrong. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Thatcher131&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=100228208" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Thatcher131&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=100228208" rel="nofollow">This business about his son</a> I cannot comment on, but I have recommended that he simply remove the offending picture.

<li>I had a quick scan at the first link - it does not seem to have any sources and any of the relevent information contained within should already be in a good quality wikipedia article. In addition, it's partly a tourist directory of hotels and where to stay - where's the encylopedic value in that?

<li>The user's combative response and wiki-lawyering when asked politely to behave leads me to believe RfC won't work. Read the type of responses he gives on his talk page. This person obviously disrespects the rules and loves taking the mickey out of anyone who engages him, playing with semantics and such-like. To go to the effort of Arbitration may be more trouble than it's worth as he will very likely repeat the pattern of non-response and obfuscation. The most frustrating thing is that he is a constructive editor most of the time, just given to a childish streak. I say slap him on the wrists with a 31 hour block, and increase it every time he repeats his dubious behaviour. It is clear-cut premeditated and deliberate vandalism. <b><a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZunaid_d3d3.html" title="User:Zunaid"><font color="red">Zun</font></a><a href="../../../z/u/n/User_talk%7EZunaid_e4f9.html" title="User talk:Zunaid"><font color="green">aid</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zunaid_cf3a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zunaid"><font color="blue">©</font></a><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Zunaid_7c6f.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Zunaid"><font color="orange">®</font></a></b> 15:20, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I don't know if this belongs on the user name page or here, because it's a bit complicated. There is an open AfD now for John Vanderleest, an article that contained some attack text and a personal phone number until recently. The article was created by User:WikipediaSucs, who was blocked; shortly thereafter, User:John Vanderleest appeared and edited the article, removing a prod and otherwise leaving the attack text. Therefore, it seems unlikely that this user really is John Vanderleest, although s/his user page clearly claims so.

<p>I think it's important to consider Radiant's comments here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Per the CFD discussion above, these three were renamed from "actors" to "cast members", to exclude the many one-time guest actors and focus instead on the actual cast. However, 90% of the members of the cats are in fact those one-time guest actors. So it would be easiest to have a bot depopulate them, and repop them from the existing articles on the series.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this context, I think it does make sense to empty the articles and restart them from scratch, making sure that only regular cast members are listed. The category for Murder She Wrote had over 500 articles in it; anyone who had ever appeared in even one segment in a single episode! That doesn't seem notable enough for categorization into a cast member category. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 18:33, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>A bot can easily depopulate a category, but it cannot repopulate it with the required items. It should be left to editors to select the members of the category through normal editing. I had already pruned the X-Files category down but now it is empty. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim%21_3c13.html" title="User:Tim!">Tim!</a> 18:40, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry about the X-Files stuff then, but for the other two categories, it's less work to empty them out automatically and just add in the ones that really need it than to remove it from the hundreds of pages that don't need it. It's not like cast lists for TV shows are hard to come by.

<dd>(after edit conflict) Are you alleging that Radiant! damaged Wikipedia, or are you just complaining that Radiant! did not follow your interpretation of what the process should be?

If 'process' is getting in the way of improving Wikipedia, then do the right thing outside of 'process'. Of course, if enough contributors disagree that the action was for the good of Wikipedia, there will be consequences. But then, that can happen even when everything is done within process.

<dd>IAR only applies to improving the encyclopedia, not massive deletion because he disagrees with the existence of certain categories and does not want to go through them to check the articles individually to see if they should be members or not.

<dd>I'm afraid I thoroughly disagree with your characterisation of Radiant's actions. I think Radiant acted in good faith. His actions in emptying the categories fall within the scope of <s><a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">being bold</a></s>. I'm unclear where the massive deletion occurred, I'm now unclear what you believe the substantive issue is, and I'm unclear as to how this is a matter for consideration here. It now appears to be a content dispute. Your frustration perhaps stems from the fact that you have different opinions on how the end result should have been achieved. That happens on Wikipedia sometimes, I think it is inevitable on such a collaborative project with often contradictory guidances and practises where the goal of producing an encyclopedia of a neutral point of view is enshrined as the most important consideration. There are many different ways of dealing with such frustration, see <a href="../../../s/t/r/WP%7ESTRESS_0c54.html" title="WP:STRESS">the tips offered at meta</a>. Also, have a look at the <a href="../../../d/i/s/WP%7EDISPUTE_d686.html" title="WP:DISPUTE">dispute resolution</a> process.

<li>Um, the outcome had been determined by a discussion so the exception doesn't apply. There was a consensus that a large number of articles were to be removed from the category, and Radiant was bold in his method of achieving the outcome, and the guideline is summed up as being "If in doubt, fix it." But I retract the link to the bold guideline. Frankly, I'm going to withdraw from this part of the discussion which is becoming utterly removed from the original point. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 20:50, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

The result of the Cfd was to rename and that had already happened. If it was so urgent to clear the category using a bot, how comes it was not urgent to repopulate the category?

Reading Wikipedia: sock puppetry, I see it states that:</p>
<p>"If an account has been shown to be a sock puppet used for policy violations, then it may be identified as such, by adding [SockpuppetProven] to the user page and [sockblock] to the talk page of the sock puppet account" (<a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppetry_eb4f.html" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppetry">Wikipedia: sock puppetry</a>)</p>
<p>I have added this to the sockpuppet (<a href="../../../d/o/w/User%7EDownDaRoad_24d3.html" title="User:DownDaRoad">User:DownDaRoad</a>), but can you confirm I did so correctly? Also, I attempted to add "Sockpuppeteerproven" to Vintagekit's user page in line with:</p>
<p>"The original or best-known account of a user that operates sock puppets may be tagged with {{<a href="../../../s/o/c/Template%7ESockpuppeteer_43b0.html" title="Template:Sockpuppeteer">Sockpuppeteer</a>}}.

<p>I have indefinitely blocked the sockpuppet. As far as I am concerned the sockpuppet was being used abusively outside of the alternate account policy. Whereas someone has to commit very major violations for their primary account to be be blocked indefinitely, it takes only a moderate level of abuse for the same treatment to be delivered to their alternate accounts. The only way I could've possibly let this slide was if the alternate account was <i>clearly</i> marked as such, but since the user has demonstrated his continued intent to deceive by trying to remove the tag, I have effectively removed the account, thus making any issue over the tag irrelevant. I would also encourage my fellow administrators to deal more strictly with alternate account abuse cases in the future, as there is no reason someone who is misusing them should be allowed to have <i>any</i> of them. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 23:25, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

The reason I sent it to them was to raise awareness of the mediation and to get others involved as it seemed that the same 4 editors were the only ones posting on the issue. I sent it from an alternate account because I did not want them be swayed by MY opinion on the issue and wanted them to see it through fresh eyes.

I really think that I did use the alternate account in a legitimate manner. Of those the were sent the messege which was in a completely neutral tone and content was sent to equal numbers of those with opposing views and of those that were sent the messege voted both in favour AND against my POV. Again I would state that I sent the messege from another account so that the recipients wouldnt not be swayed by my opinion and see the issue from fresh eyes and bring something new to the debate. Finally, I would really like the DownDaRoad account turned back on so that I can have that account to do my edits on Irish sports and this account for Irish history and politics.

<dd>As have I told you on several occasions now, I had "sockpuppets" because I could not access my old account due to me forgetting the password. I was editing from unregistered IP adresses whilst I sought to get access back. I have now created a new account as a result. This is why my "sockpuppets" (I still don't like using that name for what I was doing - sockpuppet implies I was pretending to be someone else) were legitimate, and I informed users on the mediation page who I was. Yet you continued to put 'suspected sockpuppet' tags on them, despite the fact I made it obvious in the mediation discussion. You, however, do not have such a reason for 'sockpuppets', and I question whether the users you asked were not likely to support your cause. Also, you edited the mediation page as if you were a seperate editor here (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AMediation_Cabal%2FCases%2F2006-12-02_IRA_%27Volunteer%27_usage&amp;diff=98472436&amp;oldid=98468028" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AMediation_Cabal%2FCases%2F2006-12-02_IRA_%27Volunteer%27_usage&amp;diff=98472436&amp;oldid=98468028" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AMediation_Cabal%2FCases%2F2006-12-02_IRA_%27Volunteer%27_usage&amp;diff=98472436&amp;oldid=98468028</a>). You also edited other articles relating to your interests, including the Provisional Irish Republican Army here (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army</a>) (which Vintagekits also edits), Sinn Fein here (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army</a>), and The Troubles in Crossmaglen here (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Troubles_in_Crossmaglen&amp;action=history" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Troubles_in_Crossmaglen&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Troubles_in_Crossmaglen&amp;action=history</a>).

<dd>OK, so I accepted that you had those sockpuppets in good faith but only bad faith is assumed on my behalf!??! I did not continue to put sockpuppet tags on your pages - once it was explained and taken off I left it - again acting in good faith. As for the edit - they are hardly cross edits or sockpuppetry to add a wikilink! Finally the single edit to the mediation cabal was a mistake as I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Logoistic&amp;diff=99863806&amp;oldid=99862355" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Logoistic&amp;diff=99863806&amp;oldid=99862355" rel="nofollow">explained</a> I didnt realise I was logged in as DownDaRoad - and thankfully I did not give an opinion of anything. It is clear that I was not trying to sway the vote with the messege I left or the editors I sent it to. I just want that cleared up and the account reinstated. I had already put a tag on the DownDaRoad userpage to state it was a legit sock of mine (like Logistic did on his) and I would be happy for that to remain if/when the DownDaRoad user is reinstated--<a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVintagekits_cef4.html" title="User:Vintagekits">Vintagekits</a> 19:45, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Alright, both of you guys, enough arguing. It's not accomplishing anything. Vintagekits is limited to one account for now, so stop worrying about it.

<p>I hope this is the right place to report this situation. There’s been a dispute between four editors about the redirect of an article which had its contents moved to several other articles – the original article, now empty, had to be preserved for the 2 year old edit history.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Wizard_%28fantasy%29_e1a9.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Wizard (fantasy)">Result of AfD</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_wizards_in_fantasy_4f0d.html#Redirection_of_Wizard_.28fantasy.29" title="Talk:List of wizards in fantasy">Redirection of Wizard (fantasy)</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_wizards_in_fantasy_4f0d.html#Redirection_of_Wizard_.28fantasy.29_Cont." title="Talk:List of wizards in fantasy">Redirect discussion continued</a></li>
</ul>
<p>One editor (<a href="../../../j/c/3/User%7EJc37_cfd0.html" title="User:Jc37">User:Jc37</a>) believed the redirect should go to a “lists” or “disambiguation” page, while the other three thought the article should be redirected to the main name article where the most relevant content was moved to.</p>
<p>In the middle of the dispute, the one editor (<a href="../../../j/c/3/User%7EJc37_cfd0.html" title="User:Jc37">User:Jc37</a>) took pre-emptive action to move the old redirect article under dispute to a new article, then created a new article with the old name.</p>
<p>He did this over the objections of one of the disputing editors, (<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldfritha_cc31.html" title="User:Goldfritha">User:Goldfritha</a>) and during a holiday Wikibreak of another disputing editor (me!). This completely contrary to spirit of the AfD findings, the talk page discussion on the redirect, and bypasses the entire <a href="../../../r/e/s/Wikipedia%7EResolving_disputes_9a93.html" title="Wikipedia:Resolving disputes">dispute resolution</a> process.</p>
<p>The original article was <a href="../../../w/i/z/Wizard_%28fantasy%29.html" title="Wizard (fantasy)">Wizard (fantasy)</a>, which was moved to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_wizards_in_fantasy.html" title="List of wizards in fantasy">List of wizards in fantasy</a>, which is one of the articles we asked that it not be redirected to! Then he created a brand-new <a href="../../../w/i/z/Wizard_%28fantasy%29.html" title="Wizard (fantasy)">Wizard (fantasy)</a> article with no edit history <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wizard_%28fantasy%29&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wizard_%28fantasy%29&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[79]</a>.</p>
<p>I’d like to see <a href="../../../j/c/3/User%7EJc37_cfd0.html" title="User:Jc37">User:Jc37</a> warned, so he doesn’t ignore the dispute resolution process again, and if possible have the changes he made reversed until we all come to a final decision.</p>

<dd>There are misrepresentations of the truth in this post (which I note you've cross-posted elsewhere). Though in re-reading now, perhaps some are either typos, or an oversight on your part.

<li>This looks like a content dispute to me. I can't see anything that needs the attention of people with <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators_37b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators">administrator access</a>. I suggest you follow the steps in <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">dispute resolution</a>. These include: <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_mediation_71be.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for mediation">mediation</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_dbd4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment">requests for comment</a>, and as a last resort <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_1b83.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration">requests for arbitration</a>. My suggestion is that you take it to <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">RFC</a> if you need a neutral venue, setting up a subpage of the appropriate talk page to summarise either side, and linking to that from RFC. And looking at it, I think you should consider getting a <a href="../../../m/e/d/WP%7EMEDIATION_ab51.html" title="WP:MEDIATION">mediator</a> in as well. This looks like a content dispute, and needs to go through the <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">dispute resolution</a> process. It's regrettable that pages aren't where you would like to see them, but I think at this stage it is more beneficial to solve the dispute than deleting pages and moving everything back. I can't see anything which suggests Jc abused his admin tools, as opposed to moving pages which any editor can do, and I think if that's the case this isn't really a matter for the admins. We aren't referees and we don't decide instances where users may or may not have ignored policy. Note that there is a policy, <a href="../../../i/g/n/Wikipedia%7EIgnore_all_rules_528b.html" title="Wikipedia:Ignore all rules">Wikipedia:Ignore all rules</a>, which allows us to ignore policy, but I'm not sure the problem is best served at this moment by sorting out the finger pointing. I think the best thing to do is work out where you would like to see content placed, and ask people to comment on that and build a consensus on where the content should be. I think mediation should be sought so that everyone feels their voice is heard, and I think after all that you can consider the other issues. But I think the most important issue is the content. It may be that once you get the content issue discussed, it will be easier to discuss and accept other issues. I hope that helps. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 16:59, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thanks for your response Steve, the one thing I wanted an administrator to do was to reverse the merges and changes performed by jc37. I think this can only be done by an administrator. The other was to have an administrator give an official warning to jc37 so he doesn't ignore the dispute resolution process, which includes the mediation you recommend! <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreadlocke_8280.html" title="User:Dreadlocke">Dreadlocke</a> <small><a href="../../../d/r/e/User_talk%7EDreadlocke_6c29.html" title="User talk:Dreadlocke"><span class="Unicode">☥</span></a></small> 17:33, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think the merges and the like should be undone until a consensus is decided. Think of it as a page protected in the <a href="../../../w/r/o/WP%7EWRONG_4175.html" title="WP:WRONG">wrong version</a>. It doesn't ultimately matter, what matters more is that the dispute is resolved and then we will know where to move stuff. Admin's don't really do warnings for failing to follow the dispute resolution process, that's a matter for arbitration. I suggest you ask if Jc will accept mediation, and if he is willing, find a mediator. If you can't agree to mediation, then you have to read through dispute resolution and see what the next step is. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 19:11, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The problem is that jc37 has clearly defied a consensus: the AfD was absolutely uniform in agreeing that "Wizard (fantasy)" had to be preserved to maintain the edit history. By relocating the old article to "List of wizards in fantasy" and creating a new, historyless "Wizard (fantasy)", jc37 has done an end-run about the delete consensus and gotten rid of the article's history. An editor could only find it if he knew where to look already.</dd>
<dd>The other merges and changes are a matter of content dispute, but that one -- furthermore, I don't see how it can be undone without admin intervention. <a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldfritha_cc31.html" title="User:Goldfritha">Goldfritha</a> 02:39, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That's still a dispute, and it's still a content dispute. The issue is that the page history is located at <i>a</i> as opposed to <i>b</i>. The afd only ended in keep, this makes no binding decision on the location of a page. On numerous instances an afd can be closed as keep and then a day or a week later the information is merged or moved. No abuse of admin tools appears to have occurred here, it's a content dispute, use dispute resolution. I'd note that people were pointed to dispute resolution at the time of the afd. Maybe at some point the matter will be taken through that process. Forgive me, but per the note at the top of the page "Dispute resolution: This page is not part of our Dispute Resolution process." I hope that clarifies why this isn't a matter administrators can do anything about. I'd suggest both sides agree a truce, get a mediator in and take it from there. But this page isn't the place to sort the dispute out. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 13:50, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Addendum</b>. It occurs to me, belatedly and I admit this shamefacedly, that maybe, if the issue is moving a page back, you should set up a <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_moves_b0bd.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested moves">requested move</a>. The move is, I hope you will agree, controversial, but it looks to me the best way to solve the issue. The move you desire will be performed by an admin if there is a consensus for the move. Maybe that might help. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 13:54, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
