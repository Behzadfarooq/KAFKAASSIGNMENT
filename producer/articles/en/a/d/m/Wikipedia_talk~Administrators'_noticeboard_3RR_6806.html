<p>I've noticed that this page often becomes excessively long (probably very difficult to load for those on dial-up). I'd propose that we agressively archive all reports with an administrative response.

<p>How about we just don't archive at all and run it like the similar noticeboards, like RFI and PAIN. It is much easier to see what needs to be done if every item on the page is something that needs to be acted upon, and to simply remove any that have been acted upon. â€”<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>â†’<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;â€¢ 03:14, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I put this above but maybe a new section will get some attention. How about we do not archive this page, and deal with it in the manner of <a href="../../../p/a/i/WP%7EPAIN_2701.html" title="WP:PAIN">WP:PAIN</a> and <a href="../../../r/f/i/WP%7ERFI_2cc3.html" title="WP:RFI">WP:RFI</a>, deleting entries after a short period of time when they are complete. This is simpler to see what issues need resolving, and wastes no time picking through entries to archive them. There is little need to keep this information, if anyone searches through it anyway; problem users have a record of being blocked or a warning on their talk page. â€”<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>â†’<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;â€¢ 16:52, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

I hadn't truly considered it but I suppose in a sense these removals could be considered reverts. Based upon the fact that I was following guidelines in removing these off topic non-editorial postings should I be wary of 3RR? In my mind off topic conversations are equivalent to vandalism.

<p>Reports are very time-consuming to fill out. Going back and forth from page history and noticeboard, copying all the diff urls as well as timestamps (that's a minimum of five diffs and five timestamps, back and forth makes that a minimum of twenty page switches).

<p>Please see [NCAHF]. He continues to insult, ignores consensus and reverts at will. Nobody can stop him. If I revert again, I will be blocked. Will someone tell me please why he is allowed to be so abusive and revert to WP:OWN despite every single editor disagreeing with him?Jance 20:04, 31 December 2006 (UTC) If I revert, I will be blocked. What can be done? Or are some WIkipedians simply allowed to continue abusing others, insulting, reverting despite 100% consensus, etc? I don't know what else to do. This editor is a menace.</p>
<p>He has had one warning, which was removed, by Ronz, I think out of an attempt to be conciliatory. Nobody will stop Curtis. Not one admin is talking to him about his abusiveness, continued reverts and WP:OWN. This is pathetic. Jance 20:08, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'd like to make a suggestion - wouldn't it be better if the skeleton under <b>Sample violation report to copy</b> is slightly changed - like this: the <i>User:<a href="../../../p/a/x/User%7EPaxEquilibrium_609b.html" title="User:PaxEquilibrium">PaxEquilibrium</a></i> bit changed to <i>User:USERNAME_REPORTER</i>.

The use of parser functions in templates such as {{<a href="../../../a/r/t/Template%7EArticle_66b7.html" title="Template:Article">article</a>}} makes this a matter of preference.

<p>I was wondering if we should switch this forum to a format similar to that used for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Suspected_sock_puppets" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Suspected_sock_puppets" rel="nofollow">WP:SOCK</a>, in which an evidence page is opened for a particular user. That way, if a user commits repeated violations, it's easy to see if he's done it before and the previous evidence page can be expanded (and escalating punishments applied). It would also make it possible to put a watch on one particular 3RR case, instead of watching the page as a whole. Using templates for reports and notifications would also make the process easier.

<dd>In the first three reverts of Piotrus, the previously eye-catching sentences (they were pretty eye-catching, in fact, hard to overlook <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Recovered_Territories&amp;oldid=112453047" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Recovered_Territories&amp;oldid=112453047" rel="nofollow">see</a>) were made pretty much invisible as references. This was all that was changed. The diff-page is pretty red but the popups-diff-page shows it. Jadger reverted each. Was it really just about format?

What I called the fourth revert didn't remove the sentences from the lead paragraph down as reference - it still removed some of the sentences. Same effect. Jadger wanted the sentences in the lead paragraph. He saw it fit to revert when they were a reference at the bottom of the page in small letters. And of course he saw it fit to revert when the sentences were even lost<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Recovered_Territories&amp;diff=112527035&amp;oldid=112473658" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Recovered_Territories&amp;diff=112527035&amp;oldid=112473658" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.

The discussion should be about an administrator with a long history of participating in revert wars (to the point of being on <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Climate_change_dispute_69a4.html#William_M._Connolley:_Six-month_revert_parole_on_certain_articles" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Climate change dispute">parole</a> previously) engaged in yet another revert war and using the defense of "self-reverting does not count". Obviously there is no defense in the discussion that SHOULD be discussed. For that reason those of you reading this complaint are being led to the false focus of considering ignoring 2 reverts so an admin can be relieved from sanction for violating <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>. Since this defense has worked well in the past for the accussed I feel compelled to add to the discussion on these specific 5 edits which should show any reasonable and objective person why these 5 edits all constitute a violation of <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> by <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">William M. Connolley</a>, an administrator that should know better...and espcially in light of the fact that his <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_William_M._Connolley_f7ad.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/William M. Connolley">first RfA</a> failed to earn a consensus with a large portion of the oppossing votes citing POV issues and being on parole for revert issues. In other words, he is fully aware of the reverting issue and has a long established pattern for being a participant in them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I. THE REVERTS BASED ON TIMES</dd>
<dd>Look at the Times and summaries of the reverts.
<ol>
<li>09:04 (rv the PS bit; also rm the audit bit - this is archiving, which is different.)</li>
<li>14:47 (rv to WMC - the PS bit is wrong)</li>
<li>16:03 (rv to WMC, as per talk)</li>
<li>16:10 m (self-rv: the PS bit is stupid but needs to be talked out rather than revert-warred out)</li>
<li>21:44 m (rv to WMC, as per further talk)</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Consider that we are not talking about a 24-hour period. We are actually discussing a 12 2/3 hour period for <b>five</b> reverts.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The #4 edit said the purpose of the self-rv was to "talk out" the differences. William M. Connolley gave 5 hours and 34 minutes to "talk out" the issues before "rv...per further talk" with edit #5. <u>Is 5 1/2 hours really long enough to claim a good faith effort to allow discussion?</u> That is up to everyone else to decide I guess, but that amount of time does not let anyone even finish a work shift and be able to participate in the discussion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Given Connolley's vast experience within Wikipedia there is no excuse for allowing only 5 1/2 hours for discussion before engaging in reverts. The only logical motivations for leaving such a short period of time for discussion is (a) believing 5 1/2 hours was sufficient, (b) performing the self-rv as a facade to circumvent <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>, (c) giving the appearance of working with others for harmony in response to being asked for an explanation of revert #3 on the talk page ("please explain yourself and also please see Wikipedia's rules on Reversions <a href="../../../r/e/v/Help%7EReverting_1fd5.html" title="Help:Reverting">Help:Reverting</a>") Talk:Scientific_data_archiving&amp;diff=117054988&amp;oldid=117050443</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Admittedly items (b) and (c) are not <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assuming good faith</a>. Given the history (and Wikipedia's own caveat to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, "This guideline does not require that editors continue to assume good faith in the presence of evidence to the contrary.") it should be stated clearly that the 'well of Good Faith waters' is tapped dry and <u>considering the possibility of bad faith is not a violation of any Wiki policy or guideline</u> at this point.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So, is it really reasonable to believe that any experienced editor would believe that such a time frame is acceptable when 5 days is the norm for things like <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAfD_60e1.html" title="WP:AfD">Articles for deletion</a>? I think not. That leaves only (b) and (c) as reasonable, objective and logical conclusions for WMC's actions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Therefore, in looking at just the times and the administrator's experience we should be able to conclude that all of the reverts should be counted AND severe sanctions should be sought.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>II. THE EDITS CONSIDERING THE TALK PAGE</dd>
<dd>Look at the summaries given for each of the edits.
<ol>
<li>(rv the PS bit; also rm the audit bit - this is archiving, which is different.)</li>
<li>(rv to WMC - the PS bit is wrong)</li>
<li>(rv to WMC, as per talk)</li>
<li>m (self-rv: the PS bit is stupid but needs to be talked out rather than revert-warred out)</li>
<li>m (rv to WMC, as per further talk)</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Notice the recurring thing, "PS bit is stupid/wrong". That is telling us the problems are regarding PS (Pseudo-science). Now look at the discussion page edits in this time frame Talk:Scientific_data_archiving&amp;diff=117133125&amp;oldid=116990836. The discussion between the time of edits #1 and #5 are, in summary, is a discussion between <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonCram_11d9.html" title="User:RonCram">RonCram</a> (4 edits), <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">William M. Connolley</a> (4), <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERaymond_arritt_89f0.html" title="User:Raymond arritt">Raymond arritt</a> (2), <a href="../../../z/e/e/User%7EZeeboid_0e8f.html" title="User:Zeeboid">Zeeboid</a> (6), <a href="../../../m/n/y/User%7EMnyakko_2c09.html" title="User:Mnyakko">myself</a> (3), <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephan_Schulz_3024.html" title="User:Stephan Schulz">Stephan Schulz</a> (4) and <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveWolfer_b631.html" title="User:SteveWolfer">SteveWolfer</a> (1). Total of 23 edits taking place with over 90% of those within a 5-hour span. Reading those edits one can hardly find any consensus being attempted or even reached on the issue of Pseudoscience.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That leaves some doubt regarding the motivation for rv #4 &amp; #5 based only on the fact that there was very little, if any, support in the talk pages that would make the summaries of his edits honest.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>III. THE WIKIPEDIA POLICY ON REVERTS</dd>
<dd>Why are reverts being done simply because the text is "wrong" or "stupid"? Those reverts are clear violations of <a href="../../../r/e/v/WP%7ERevert_be8e.html" title="WP:Revert">Wikipedia's Revert policies</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>When to revert according to policy is clearly laid out. Reverting is "primarily for fighting vandalism", not if one feels "the edit is unsatisfactory". The policy also clearly states to "not simply revert changes that are made as part of a dispute." Remember the summaries explaining the reverts because the prior edits were "wrong" and "stupid"? How does that rest with the following from the revert policy: "Be respectful to other editors, their contributions and their points of view." Additionally, the policy state "Do not revert changes simply because someone makes an edit you consider problematic, biased, or inaccurate." Finally the policy states, "Do not revert good faith edits...a revert of those contributions is inappropriate unless, and only unless, you as an editor possess <b>firm, substantive, and objective proof</b> to the contrary." (emphasis added). The "firm, substantive, and objective proof" provided on the talk page 3 minutes after revert #5 is "This section appears to be in for attack reasons and is totally unbalanced. I've removed it. It needs a proper re-write before it goes back, not just a POV tag."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The reverts, each one of them on their own, are violations and should not have occurred in the first place. That a discussion about if all 5 should be counted or if 2 of them should be ignored is laughable when stood up to the "Do's and Dont's" explicitly laid out at <a href="../../../r/e/v/WP%7ERevert_be8e.html" title="WP:Revert">WP:Revert</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Keep in mine a few other important quotes from <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>. "The rule does not convey an entitlement to revert three times each day...Editors may still be blocked even if they have not made more than three edits in any given 24 hour period, if their behavior is clearly disruptive.", "The rule does not...endorse reverting as an editing technique" and "This particularly applies to editors who persistently make three reverts each day, or three reverts on each of a group of pages, in an apparent effort to game the system." It is easily demonstrable how William engages in such reverting persistence (and typically another person will continue the reverts after William makes his 3rd, but that is an issue to be brought forward at a later date).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So even if it is erroneously decided that 2 reverts should not be counted it does not mean William cannot face sanctions. In fact another important quote from <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> is, "administrators give less leniency to users who have been blocked before, and may block such users for any edit warring, even if they do not exceed three reverts on a page in 24 hours." William HAS been sanctioned before, yet for some reason in the past he is given leniency. The pattern of leniency is encouraging destructive behavior and the leniency should be ended and reversed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>IV. CONCLUSION</dd>
<dd>Normally an objective person would conclude that reverts #3 &amp; #4 should be excluded from being counted against the <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>. But there are just too many aggrevating factors surrounding these 5 reverts, the corresponding Talk Page and the summaries given in the reverts. On top of that are more aggrevating factors outside of the 12 hour timeframe in question that are tied to the reverter, administrator <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">William M. Connolley</a> that have been given excuse with each subsequent issue.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>1. William's experience and position in Wikipedia remove credibility to any claim that leaving 5 1/2 hours for "talking out differences" was reasonable or in good-faith.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2. A review (quick or thorough) leaves no doubt there was no consensus formed or hinted at on the Talk page within the 5 1/2 hour timeframe William provides for "talking out differences".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>3. An honest review of even a portion of William's history will reveal a pattern of engaging in revert wars. Recently the trend is to find any rationalizations to give William a loophole to escape any repercussions. An honest review of these patterns will leave no rational conclusions of the reverts being beyond any shadow of doubt in Good Faith.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>4. Each Revert was a violation of Wikipedia's policies.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>5. William is an administrator that had to be nominated twice because of concerns around his demonstrated participation in edit wars, revert wars, POV issues and other harmful activities which rule out any automatic assumption of good faith in any edit.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Each revert is improper and the behavior must be halted. It is not being halted on William's own initiative and so other actions are necessary for the well-being and credibility of Wikipedia. There is no reasonable justification for excluding reverts #3 and #4 and therefore William has violated <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>. William's history of engaging in edit/revert wars should be absolutely unacceptable for any editor and less tolerated by an administrator; William's history of attempting to dance at the threshhold of violation of <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> is even more reason for severe sanction on this instance, consideration of long-term sanction as a user, permanent revocation of adminstrator roles and permanent disqualification from any role in the future other than editor.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If the supporting documentation presented here is not enough more is readily available.
<dl>
<dd>Right. William is one of our more experienced admins. Tony is a <a href="../../../m/n/y/User%7EMnyakko_2c09.html" title="User:Mnyakko">talk radio host</a> who maintains an off-wiki <a href="http://wiki.racetotheright.com/GW_Stephan_Schulz" class="external text" title="http://wiki.racetotheright.com/GW_Stephan_Schulz" rel="nofollow">attack site</a>.

<dd>The purpose of the 3RR is to prevent edit-warring. Its enforcement is not meant, as Tony is using it, to be an end in itself, nor are editors encouraged to spend as much time rebutting a 3RR no-violation ruling as it would have taken them to edit several articles. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 21:56, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Stephan, I take it by your effort to turn the focus onto me and away from the actual issues at hand (Connolley's edits/reverts) that it is conceded Connolley's actions have been indefensible. Otherwise you would have focused on staying on the topic. Step up and be an adult..."very nearly" is a cowards way of making an accusation without having to own up to it, something I would have expected to be beneath you. Either make a charge that my account is as you "very nearly" claim or don't say anything. Providing facts about your friend's history with revert warring is not "Wiki-lawyering". I notice people throw that around when they really have no real defense because someone actually took the effort to make a coherent and solid narrative explaining something that needs rectification. Truly, I expect better from you. -- <a href="../../../m/n/y/User%7EMnyakko_2c09.html" title="User:Mnyakko">Tony of Race to the Right</a> 03:14, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, my point is that William's actions need no defense, least of all on <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>. <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> is intentionally a simple, mechanical criterion with little wiggle room either way. What you want is an RFC, but instead of doing the work and arguing in an open, hopefully neutral forum, you misuse the 3RR noticboard for your tirades. I wrote "very nearly" as I like precision. For the first 100 edits or so you have edited other fields. Since about mid-February, you have done little but disrupt the <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_warming.html" title="Global warming">global warming</a> related articles and stalking the editors, in particularly William. Is that accusation enough for you? Given your <a href="http://wiki.racetotheright.com/GW_Stephan_Schulz" class="external text" title="http://wiki.racetotheright.com/GW_Stephan_Schulz" rel="nofollow">collection of out-of-context edits</a> that apparently somehow try to give the impression of a big conspiray, I find the request for a charge particularly ironic. Your "narrative" is neither coherent nor solid. It is full of misinterpretations, wrong assumptions (for a similar example, see "Stephan, I take it by your effort to turn the focus onto me and away from the actual issues at hand (Connolley's edits/reverts) that it is conceded Connolley's actions have been indefensible."), and tortured logic. It is not worth refuting in detail. Coming up with this crap is fast and easy, doing a solid rebuttal is a lot of work. I have better things to do. I trust the Wikipedia community to recognize your methods and to act accordingly. --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephan_Schulz_3024.html" title="User:Stephan Schulz">Stephan Schulz</a> 09:08, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The logic is not twisted (except that it points out something very valid--and how dare it not be in lock-step with what you want). Look at the order of events: Complaint made about Subject &amp; 3RR, I post a supporting narrative with some of Subject's history (and, btw, it was not a rebuttal but was meant to be a reply to Zeeboid, but the decision was done so quickly that my submission came afterwards), you charge me with "attack page" and "very nearly SPA", never once addressing the Subject, 3RR or why (I presume) you believe the Subject's history of abuse is not relevant or accurate. Ask ANY scholar of rhetoric, anyone that knows about discourse or communication if the effort to shift the focus from the subject is because of the desire to prevent focus on what is damaging--the primary subject. You will find that nearly all of those people will have the same, as you call, tortured logic. -- <a href="../../../m/n/y/User%7EMnyakko_2c09.html" title="User:Mnyakko">Tony of Race to the Right</a> 15:00, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Zeeboid, you just reminded me of something I know I read on Wikipedia and do not feel like looking for it again. Somewhere I read that it is preferred that people do not edit in fields they are professionally involved in as the tendencies to engage in POV edits is too strong. So, I understand how Connolley's profession (the person this discussion should be about) MIGHT be relevant. I do not understand how my profession has any relevance...unless the implication is that someone on the radio should be disregarded. Stephan, what exactly is your point? -- <a href="../../../m/n/y/User%7EMnyakko_2c09.html" title="User:Mnyakko">Tony of Race to the Right</a> 03:14, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

However, I am also not an Environmental <a href="../../../a/c/t/Activist.html" title="Activist">Activist</a> who has many complaints on Wikipedia about a lack of an ability to maintain a NPOV. As you can plainly see by William's edit history, his self proclaimed <a href="../../../a/c/t/Activism.html" title="Activism">Activism</a> keeps him from editing with a NPOV, which results in a Wikipedia Administrator doing things like taking part in Revert Wars, like the one we are discussing here. No Activist should be aloud to edit in the topics he/she is an <a href="../../../a/c/t/Activist.html" title="Activist">Activist</a> in. This leads to issues with the POV, and deters people from taking part in Wiki, as well as giving a slanted view on what is taken for granted as being a NPOV Encyclopedic article. What would you rather have, editing Wikipedia? An Activist scientist, or a non-activist regular person editor? If it was not for WMC's Environmental <a href="../../../a/c/t/Activism.html" title="Activism">Activism</a>, issues like his Revert War that we are discussing, and many complaints about him in the past would not come up.--<a href="../../../z/e/e/User%7EZeeboid_0e8f.html" title="User:Zeeboid">Zeeboid</a> 21:41, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>This is so bizarre, I suspect there is a hidden camera running somewhere. So a Green Party candidate (and the Greens are more or less mainstream in Europe) cannot edit any "environmental" article (not to mention that <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_warming.html" title="Global warming">global warming</a> is a scientific article), but a proudly right-wing radio moderator or blogger is allowed to? What is more, in Europe - certainly in Germany - <i>all</i> major and most minor parties are using global warming as a campagining topic (btw, even the conservaties campaign <i>for</i> CO2 reductions). So I guess no-one associated with any party is allowed to edit <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_warming.html" title="Global warming">global warming</a>? --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephan_Schulz_3024.html" title="User:Stephan Schulz">Stephan Schulz</a> 01:41, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is nothing bizar about it. You would expect someone who works for EXXON from not being aloud to edit global warming articles. You would expect someone from Microsoft not being able to edit many articles for technology. As you pointed out, William's profession relates to the topic in question, which lead us to look at his activism. He is a Self Proclaimed Environmental <a href="../../../a/c/t/Activist.html" title="Activist">Activist</a>. An Environmental <a href="../../../a/c/t/Activist.html" title="Activist">Activist</a> (which a Right-Wing Radio moderator or blogger is not, a Right-Wing radio moderator, I would argue is more open minded on topics of Environmentalism then someone who is an Environmental <a href="../../../a/c/t/Activist.html" title="Activist">Activist</a>) should not be alloud to edit pages that deal with the Environment because of the same BIAS that would be in place if someone who worked for Exxon wanted to edit energy pages. The <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> is very clear in this. After all, William has even defended links to offsite refrences/sites that he himself has written at.--<a href="../../../z/e/e/User%7EZeeboid_0e8f.html" title="User:Zeeboid">Zeeboid</a> 12:07, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Hello... sorry to disturb. I have a question about 3RR... I (well, primarily me, with the assistance of several other editors) have been dealing with an anon who is continuing to linkspam several <i>Heroes</i>-related pages with links to a blog site. I <i>think</i> that I'm not breaking 3RR by reverting the anon, along with repeated talk page warnings. However, since I've never even had to be warned before, I'd like to double-check before continuing. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. (The pages are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mr._Bennet_%28Heroes%29&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mr._Bennet_%28Heroes%29&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">Mr. Bennet (Heroes)</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mohinder_Suresh&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mohinder_Suresh&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">Mohinder Suresh</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sylar&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sylar&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">Sylar</a>) Thank you in advance. --<b><a href="../../../c/k/a/User%7ECkatz_0c62.html" title="User:Ckatz">Ckatz</a></b><i><small><sup><a href="../../../c/k/a/User_talk%7ECkatz_91bf.html" title="User talk:Ckatz"><font color="green">chat</font></a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ckatz_cb51.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ckatz"><font color="red">spy</font></a></sub></small></i> 23:29, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
