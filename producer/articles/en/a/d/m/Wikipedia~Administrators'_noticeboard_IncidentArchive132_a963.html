<p>I wish to file a complaint against InShaneee for abusing his administrative authority. Under the guise of removing "personal attacks," InShanee has deleted comments he disagrees with which are not at all personal attacks. For example, one of the edits he deleted was my argument in support of another administrator, Bishonen: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Natasha_Demkina&amp;diff=72422225&amp;oldid=72334586" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Natasha_Demkina&amp;diff=72422225&amp;oldid=72334586" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> He also removed another section further down that is critical of one of the goals of the Wikiproject Paranormal - the Wikiproject that he appears to run. My comments are directed against the sources that some Wikiproject Paranormal members insist on using for the Natasha Demkina article. Apparently, he's taking this criticism personally and is calling it a "personal attack" so that he can remove it under his authority as an administrator (and threaten me with a block if I revert it - see additional comment below).</p>
<p>Another editor and an administrator has joined in my objection to InShanee's actions: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Natasha_Demkina&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Natasha_Demkina&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:InShaneee&amp;action=edit&amp;section=37" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:InShaneee&amp;action=edit&amp;section=37" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> I hope other editors and administrators will also tell him that he should not abuse his administrative authority and that censorship is not a practice welcomed in Wikipedia. If his abuse of authority continues, that authority should be rescinded. <a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskolnick_cd84.html" title="User:Askolnick">Askolnick</a> 20:42, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is about an admin who removes legitimate arguments/comments and labels the comments as a "personal attack" in order to censor this user. If this user reverts this admin's edits, I'm quite certain he will be blocked by this admin. This is unacceptable behavior for an admin, and I have seen so many complaints against Inshaneee that a desysop should be considered.</dd>

<dd>Is <i>naything</i> from the RFAR ever labeled as strict, by the rules, policy? (besides user punishments and probation). You just have to infer. Obviously the rampant misuse of the rollback, especially in a revert war, was strong enough that the ArbCom had to say something about it. And in this case, they said <b>only vandalism</b>. I think that applies to all admins, but if you disagree, Ic ould ask the ArbCom for clarification. <a href="../../../h/b/d/User%7EHbdragon88_4994.html" title="User:Hbdragon88">Hbdragon88</a> 23:37, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dionyseus, the edit summary of the second and third reverts <i>clearly</i> mention disruption.

Disruptive flaming/vandalism can clearly be reverted. That is why the admin reverted.

<dd><b>Comment</b> of an outsider: InShaneee left a warning for "No Personal Attacks" and threatening a block, pretty much immediately before this note was left of AN/I. Askolnick is not helping the situation by pretty much continuuing a verbal assualt on InShaneee on Askolnick's own talk page. While InShaneee is focusing also on other things (Unblock declining, I noticed), Askolnick is still focusing on the conflict (Hence this discussion). I have the odd feeling that this inter-editor conflict is just going to escalate if both editors remain "Unrestrained".</dd>
<dd>The first dif I see is sort of unwarranted, since removing even completely idiotic things (Like bots reverting past your revert of vandalism giving YOU a warning) from talk pages is met with (6.5 times out of 10) with a warning on not removing comments or blanking.</dd>
<dd><b>This has obviously escalated too fast and too far</b>. Both editors likely fall under Wikipedia's blocking policy for disruption of this Wiki. <strike>It needs to be made clear that catfights shouldn't be tolerated.</strike> <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELogical2u_96f0.html" title="User:Logical2u">Logical2u</a> 22:18, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While Inshaneee was justified in removing some of the many Pravda.ru links (really, you could have made your point with much more brevity, or created a subpage in userspace to link to), the majority of Inshaneee's rollback was inappropriate, and the blocking threats seem questionable. While rollback can occasionally be used for edits that are not vandalism (occasionally <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> does apply)), in this case it was clearly an inappropriate use of rollback. Furthermore, it seems disingenuous to describe the edits in question as personal attacks, unless Natasha or her representative has edited Wikipedia. While Askolnick needs to be cautioned to calm down and focus criticism on actions, not people, I think a formal review of the actions here is warranted. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 22:24, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've at times both admired and found reason to criticize in InShaneee's firmness in enforcing his view of the NPA rule. In this instance, my impression is he's overstepped a line, both in the initial revert and in the way his subsequent warnings and counterwarnings have escalated the situation. I'd say an RfC might be in order. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 22:28, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I do not believe InShaneee's reverts are entirely without justification, as Mr. Skolnick is implying <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Natasha_Demkina&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=72453143" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Natasha_Demkina&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=72453143" rel="nofollow">here</a> that Dreadlocke and InShaneee are aligning themselves with "pseudoscientists, psychics, quacks, and other New Age charlatans," and is also implying that they are acting in bad faith. If I recall correctly, reversion of personal attacks is an option for dealing with them, though a controversial one. I don't think this edit rises to the level where reversion is necessary, but I can see why InShaneee would see this as a personal attack and would revert it. I do agree that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANatasha_Demkina&amp;diff=72422225&amp;oldid=72334586" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANatasha_Demkina&amp;diff=72422225&amp;oldid=72334586" rel="nofollow">this reversion</a> was not justified. Skolnick is attacking Demkina's mother's credibility, but not another editor. I have no opinion on the specific method InShaneee used to revert ("rollback," the existence of which I am only newly aware).</p>
<p>Though I do not necessarily agree with InShaneee's recent reversions, I do believe that s/he has acted in good faith, and that, given Skolnick's long history of personal attacks and incivility, a warning from an administrator is long overdue, and will perhaps be heeded where mere editors' warnings have not. At worst, I think InShaneee's warnings were the right action at the wrong time. <a href="../../../r/o/h/User%7ERohirok_454f.html" title="User:Rohirok">Rohirok</a> 04:24, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Rohirok, you are ignoring the fact that InShaneee repeatedly threatened to block me if I reverted his improper deletion of my comments.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Askolnick&amp;action=edit&amp;section=32" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Askolnick&amp;action=edit&amp;section=32" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> That is an abuse of his administrative authority. Administrators are not allowed to use their blocking power to threaten and intimidate editors who they disagree with. Not a single editor or administrator has supported InShaneee's claim that he removed a "personal attack." The speech he removed was speech he objects to. He then threatened to block me if I put it back. That clearly an abuse of the authority granted to him by the Wiki community. In light of the comments from other editors and administrators who say the speech he removed was not a personal attack, he has modified his reason for removing it (and threatening to block me if I restored it). He now says he removed "disrepectful" speech.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Askolnick&amp;action=edit&amp;section=32" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Askolnick&amp;action=edit&amp;section=32" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> I believe InShaneee is further abusing his administrative powers when he stretches those powers to include blocking editors for speech he finds "disrespectful."</dd>
<dd>Nearly a century ago, Justice <a href="../../../o/l/i/Oliver_Wendell_Holmes_9971.html" title="Oliver Wendell Holmes">Oliver Wendell Holmes</a> wisely observed that the best remedy for improper speech is more speech, not censorship. Wiki administrators should uphold that philosophy. Those who don't should not be a Wiki administrator. <a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskolnick_cd84.html" title="User:Askolnick">Askolnick</a> 16:54, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><s>:I just noticed that Rohirok has misrepresented my complaint by using a link to only part of the material InShaneee deleted, under the guise that it was a personal attack.</s> Here is the one of my statements InShanee deleted and threatened to block me if I restored it:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Natasha_Demkina&amp;diff=72422225&amp;oldid=72334586" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Natasha_Demkina&amp;diff=72422225&amp;oldid=72334586" rel="nofollow">[13]</a></p>

<dd>Bishonen is on solid ground in her objection to including Natasha's mother's claims that contradict the widely held views of child psychologists and pediatricians. She is also correct about Wikipedia guidelines that warn against including such dubious information without compelling support: "Exceptional claims require exceptional evidence" and among those are "claims not supported or claims that are contradicted by the prevailing view in the relevant academic community."[71]</dd>
<dd>In opposition to the prevailing view of the relevant academic community of child psychologists and pediatricians, we have the claims of Natasha's mother - who has already received great profit through the promotion of her daughter as a miracle worker - and who made the clearly false statement her daughter has never ever made a false diagnosis, even though the record shows many of Demkina's diagnoses are false.</dd>
<dd>Clearly, Demkina's mother has publicly spoken falsely about her daughter's abilities. And her motive for doing so is not just a mother's pride. She and her daughter have already enjoyed great income from Demkina's readings (earning up to 40 times the average government worker's income in Saransk, with her part-time, after-school "job." [72] And she and Demkina stand to reap even greater wealth by convincing people that her daughter's diagnoses are 100 percent correct. Such exceptional, self-serving, and profiteering claims do not constitute exceptional evidence. They are far more consistant with the trumpeting of a quack. Wikipedia is not a medium to be used by quacks to promote themselves. That is why Wikipedia has guidelines concerning reputable sources - such as the one that directs editors to ignore exceptional claims that contradict prevailing views of the relevant academic community in the absence of exceptional evidence. Bishonen is absolutely right. Such self-serving and highly dubious claims do not belong in Wikipedia without compelling support from reputable sources.</dd>

<dd>I added this comment in support of administrator Bishonen's statement. Disagreeing with it, InShanee falsely called it a personal attack and deleted it.

<dd>Another thing I think is unacceptable for a Wiki administrator is to use his authority in a biased manner. Under the pretense that he was removing a personal attack, InShaneee deleted my criticism of the Wikiproject Paranormal, which he appears to be running.

<dd>At the risk of sounding like a "pseudo-Christian," InShaneee should remove the log from his own eye before poking his finger in the eyes of others.

<dd>Rather than explaining to us why he thinks InShaneee's deletions were proper and not censorship, or why InShaneee's threats to block me if I restored what was wrongly deleted is NOT an abuse of InShaneee's administrative authority, Dreadlocke has launched a long string of personal attacks, none of which is relevant to the complaint against InShaneee. If all of Dreadlocke's accusations and insults were true and I were the spawn of Satan, it still would not justify InShaneee's act of censorship and abuse of his administrative authorities.

<dd>Having spent a lot of time today reviewing the history of all this, I totally understand why <a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskolnick_cd84.html" title="User:Askolnick">Askolnick</a> may feel frustrated at the tactics of some editors who have attempted to "take every point", as lawyers put it, however lacking in merit - i.e., require him to prove every little thing that should not even be controversial. On the other hand, he does seem to find it difficult to avoid attacking the good faith of opponents. There is obviously some off-wiki baggage here, but we do expect editors to leave such baggage behind, at least in what they say (we can't try to control what they merely think).</dd>
<dd>As for the specific material deleted by <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">User:InShaneee</a>, I think most of the material was acceptable, but a small amount of it consisted of unnecessary speculation about the dishonest motives of other editors. I think InShaneee was right to insist that <i>that</i> component of the material remain deleted, but not to insist that <i>all</i> the material remain deleted. To that extent, InShanee overstepped the bounds, IMHO, but not in a way that shows bad faith or requires some sort of investigation.</dd>
<dd>If my view prevailed, I would allow Askolnick to restore the material in a form that does not cast aspersions on the motives of anyone here. In particular, it should not contain claims to the effect that editors have dishonest ulterior motives in wanting to use particular low-repute publications as sources. It is sufficient to attack the repute of the publications themselves without speculating about the motives of other editors. If the material is restored in that modified form, which probably requires the deletion of only a small number of sentences and phrases, I would, with all respect to InShanee, be opposed to any block and be minded to undo it (but not without due discussion etc.; I'm not into wheel-warring).</dd>
<dd>I also respectfully suggest to Askolnick that he should, in future, continue to argue his position in a robust way, but without straying into incivility or personal attacks by speculating about other editors' seemingly (to him) dishonest motives. I'm sure that most of his arguments could be put forcefully and persuasively without that current running through them, however much he may feel tempted to include it. In fact, that current really seems to detract from the force of the arguments, by tending to put the focus on personalities. It also makes it difficult for administrators who might have some sympathy for the position that Askolnick finds himself in, but who are also under an obligation to keep order and stop debates from getting personal.</dd>

<p>I became involved in the matter on August 24 when I noticed a 3RR violation, and I subsequently tried to address the user's concerns in the article and on its talk page. (I think I had edited the page once or twice before in a fairly insignificant way.) I ended up contributing a fairly major rewrite/expansion of the article yesterday, because although I believe Cretanpride's position was academically unsupported, the article provided insufficient context and might be misread by someone with an insufficient understanding of the subject.</p>

I'd appreciate it if an uninvolved admin could take a look at this situation and see whether a longer block is warranted.

<dd>As a matter of fact, allowing the friend to use your computer is absolutely a no-no. First, it's the story usually told by people with abusive sockpuppets. Second, that makes the donor as guilty of block evasion as the recipient. Third, no single account is supposed to be multi-user. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:44, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>True enough. To Geogre: I think he said he let the other guy use his <i>computer</i> (hence positive IP identification per checkuser), not his <i>account</i>.

<dd>The question I suppose we should ask ourselves is whether the Ellinas account should be treated differently if it is a meatpuppet or a sockpuppet. If Ellinas is a different individual (and therefore a meatpuppet), he is guilty only of helping his friend evade the block. Right now, Cretanpride is under a 48-hour block and Ellinas is blocked indefinitely. <i>If</i> Ellinas is a meatpuppet rather than a sockpuppet, I'd say that was backwards. Allowing Cretanpride to use his computer to evade his block is a no-no, but Ellinas probably didn't know that, and doesn't deserve to be indefinitely blocked for it. Cretanpride, on the other hand, had had the sockpuppet policy explained to him on several occasions, and should have known better. Would anyone object if I unblocked Ellinas and indefinitely blocked Cretanpride? Even if Ellinas <i>is</i> a sockpuppet rather than a meatpuppet, that account has been much better behaved than the Cretanpride account, and the individual behind it might take this as an opportunity to reform. Or am I being too generous? —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 16:12, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a> says: "Neither a sock puppet nor a single-purpose account holder is regarded as a member of the Wikipedia community. The Arbitration Committee has ruled that, for the purpose of dispute resolution, when there is uncertainty whether a party is one user with sock puppets, or several users acting as meatpuppets, they may be treated as one individual." Checkuser found that Ellinas is a sockpuppet; even if this is mistaken (and I doubt that it's a mistake), Ellinas is a single-purpose account.

If Ellinas were unblocked, I would act as a mentor for that account. And I do think that a longer, if not indefinite, block of Cretanpride would be helpful and appropriate, given the extensive history of sockpuppetry. Put it this way: would you rather deal with Ellinas or Cretanpride on the article?

<dd>Sorry, but all this assumes that Ellinas is really not a sock of Cretanpride. Personally I find no good reason to believe him, principally because, as, Gerge said, it's the story usually told by people with abusive sockpuppets. Also remember Cretanpride's previous record, confirmed also by checkuser; Cretanpride is habitual to sockpuppetry, and Ellinas is only the last of them. He is only quite habitual to not telling the truth: consider <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Homosexuality_in_ancient_Greece_3f9c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Homosexuality in ancient Greece">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Homosexuality in ancient Greece</a>, where Sac222, checkuser confirmed sock, says: "As for me being the same user, I'm sure the others are, but I am not. I made the account today and I started my first edits. I came across this page and voiced my opinion." Also consider the strange start of Ellinas: "I am a new user. I am not a sockpuppet of Cretanpride"; new users generally don't start with such declarations. Also he "forgot" to say that he was using the same computer of Cretanpride. In conclusion, I strongly oppose unblocking Ellinas; <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> has value only when it is used to better articles, and unblocking an obvious sock will not do this. And as for <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, it is of no value for socks, and it shouldn't be extended in such an unreasonable way. As for Cretanpride, if no one objects, I will extend his block for a new block evasion, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=4.245.120.147" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=4.245.120.147" rel="nofollow">[40]</a>, the edits mentioned by <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">User:Future Perfect at Sunrise</a>.--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 18:29, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I support Josiah Rowe on mentoring Ellinas, in the spirit of assuming good faith. One of three things will happen.</p>
<ol>
<li>Ellinas is a separate person, continues to be a good contributor, and doesn't make this mistake again.</li>
<li>Ellinas is a sock, but Cretan takes the opportunity to moderate his tone and editing style.</li>
<li>Ellinas is a sock, picks up where Cretan left off, and gets swiftly blocked by Josiah Rowe.</li>
</ol>
<p>The third case is essentially the same result as no action at this point, and the first two cases help the encyclopedia.

<dd>I'm really sorry of having to disagree in this occasion Josiah, because I greatly appreciate and admire your work, but I have learned in editing on balcan-topics that good faith should not always be assumed at all costs, when good sense tells, at least to me, exactly the opposite. When a brand new editor emerges exactly on the same day his spiritual brother has been blocked, and interrupts his edits exactly when the block expires, my knowledge of sockpuppetry tells me that the probabilities of the new account being a sock are very, very high. Dozens of socks, even when ascertained by checkuser, have continued to cry me "no, no, I'm not a sock, you're wrong". I've simply heard these stories too many times. Cretanpride has another chance, if he wants to use it; but lets not hide ourselves behind a phantomatic "good user" Ellinas.--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 00:03, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ah, well. I'm still agnostic over whether Cretanpride and Ellinas were one person or two, but given the tone of Ellinas' last posting I suppose the question is moot. The manner of Cretanpride's behavior upon his return should indicate something: as <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurt_Vonnegut_46cd.html" title="Kurt Vonnegut">Kurt Vonnegut</a> said, "We are who we pretend to be," so if Ellinas <i>was</i> a sockpuppet, then for a few days Cretanpride was a fairly respectful and civil user who showed the potential for becoming a useful Wikipedian, because that's who he was pretending to be as Ellinas. If he could do it then, he can do it upon his return. If, on the other hand, Ellinas was a <i>different</i> individual, then we can expect Cretanpride to be as abusive and abrasive as he was before he was blocked, possibly more so because he will have the "unjust block of his friend" to stoke his fires. (We will also, incidentally, have turned a potentially positive contributor into someone bitter and angry about Wikipedia's lack of openness, but I suppose that's a risk we take in making the "meat=sock" equation.)</dd>

<dd>It's true that I haven't had extensive experience of sockpuppetry, but I'm a little bit concerned that this time the boy crying "wolf" <i>may</i> be doing so because there really is one. But I won't go against the apparent consensus of my fellow Wikipedians. I suppose we'll just have to see what comes next. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 00:59, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Barefact" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Barefact" rel="nofollow">[41]</a>] The most egregious action on Barefact's part --- that I have seen, were his false accusations of sock-puppetry against me, and two users[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Arash_the_Bowman&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=70124508" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Arash_the_Bowman&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=70124508" rel="nofollow">[42]</a>] and [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Khosrow_II" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Khosrow_II" rel="nofollow">[43]</a>] , for which he had no evidence. I would consider that an attempt to <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wp%7Edisrupt.html#Gaming_the_system" title="Wp:disrupt">game the system</a>.</p>
<p>He even tried to use his false accusation of sock-puppetry(unproven and untrue) to reinstate a POV article of his [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2006_August_18&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=70486344" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2006_August_18&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=70486344" rel="nofollow">[44]</a>] by saying that it was deleted by sock-puppetry. This is a clear example of lying and deception.</p>
<p>One of his former articles was deleted because of OR [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Scytho-Iranian_theory" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Scytho-Iranian_theory" rel="nofollow">[45]</a>].</p>
<p>Even after an RFIC in <a href="../../../s/c/y/Scythians.html" title="Scythians">Scythians</a> he removed all reference to Scythians being Iranian recently.</p>
<p>The user Template:Barefact puts OR research from his website www.turkicworld.org. For example he disfigures quotes: [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ossetic_language&amp;diff=72499532&amp;oldid=72499209" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ossetic_language&amp;diff=72499532&amp;oldid=72499209" rel="nofollow">[46]</a>]. For example the following quote: <b>However, it retained its grammatical structure and basic lexical stock; its relationship with the Iranian family, despite considerable individual traits, does not arouse any doubt.</b> has been taken from this book directly: [<a href="http://www.azargoshnasp.net/languages/ossetian/ossetian.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.azargoshnasp.net/languages/ossetian/ossetian.htm" rel="nofollow">[47]</a>] (the first link pg 6), yet he disfigures the quote that has been taken directly from the scholar to a totally opposite quote! He is putting a one man show on the <a href="../../../o/s/s/Ossetic.html" title="Ossetic">ossetic</a> language, since all the sources Britannica, Encarta, Columbia and all available English sources agree with me, yet he is taking material from his ultranationalist webpage www.turkicworld.org and cut &amp; pasting it. Please ban this user for his disruptive behavior on multiple accounts specially OR, vandalism and false accusation of sock-puppetry and using the false allegation of sock-puppetry in order to change the mind of other administrators about the deletion of one of his false articles [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2006_August_18&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=70486344" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2006_August_18&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=70486344" rel="nofollow">[48]</a>].</p>
<p>Finally there is the admittance of the vandalizing user himself from his own webpage: <i>The following discourse addresses the reasons for the current universal acceptance by the scientific community of the preposition that the Scythians were unambiguously Indo-European, and specifically Iranian speaking, and the methods to reach this conclusion.</i> [<a href="http://s155239215.onlinehome.us/turkic/27_Scythians/Ethnic%20Affiliation%20Scythians%20En.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://s155239215.onlinehome.us/turkic/27_Scythians/Ethnic%20Affiliation%20Scythians%20En.htm" rel="nofollow">[49]</a>] (note the link above is connected www.turkicworld.org and is written by this user per his own admission). Note the user believes that he can go against universal acceptance of scholarly facts in Wikipedia. I have warned him numerous times about [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research" rel="nofollow">[50]</a>] but with no success. He clearly admits he is going against universal accepted position of scientific community and wants to put his cooked up theories instead of accepting the universal judgment of relavent scholars of the field. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">Ali doostzadeh</a> 00:54, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks but with did an RFC on Scythians and the user still persits in ruining the entery. Also in <a href="../../../s/c/y/Scythia.html" title="Scythia">scythia</a> he broke the 3rr rule (actually 6 revisions within the past 24 hours). He is also making another false accusation of false suck-puppetery <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrator_intervention_against_vandalism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=72716993" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrator_intervention_against_vandalism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=72716993" rel="nofollow">[51]</a> (which is the 4th or 5th false accusation). I have reported him for the 3RR violation here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR#User:Barefact_reported_by_User:Ali_doostzadeh_.28Result:.29" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR#User:Barefact_reported_by_User:Ali_doostzadeh_.28Result:.29" rel="nofollow">[52]</a>.

<p>Looks like <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadioKirk_a5db.html" title="User:RadioKirk">RadioKirk</a> is out and about abusing his admin powers again. If you look on his talk page history and block log, you will see that after Raptor30V1 left him a labor day greeting, he deleted the greeting and blocked Raptor30V1. It seems unimagionable that an Admin would block a user (newbe mind you) just because he does not celebrate labor day, but that seems to be the cas with Kirk.

<p>I would like to point out that I am making available, valid information, on the UHSA page; but a certain poster continues to use "finger-thocracy" to decide what is and what is not "wiki-worthy". The links I have contributed are for the most part from State websites that hold legitimate information that is in the public domain, none of the links are "rabbit-outta-the-hat" types.</p>
<p>Thank you. Robo doc 03:32, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Robo doc has nothing meaningful to contribute. He is copying and pasting links and copyrighted material into my article from other websites only to publicize 3rd party websites filled with ads. I’m surprised to see he is asking for your help. Notice, he recently registered his ID for the sole purpose of posting his nasty remarks and links in the UHSA article.</p>

<dd>He uses British Telecom, so indef blocking is out. You're probably stuck with 24 hours, and should probably only block anons and account creation. I'm also looking into the report at <a href="../../../a/e/_/WP%7EAE_df73.html" title="WP:AE">WP:AE</a> but in an advisory capacity since I'm not an admin. Just because the report was posted by Leyasu doesn't mean Deathrocker is totally innocent--it does need checking and I'll do that later tonight. I <i>have</i> asked Deathrocker why he is using so many IPs lately. It's not a crime to edit while logged out but it looks odd for sure. Also, while 3RR does not apply to reverting edits of a banned user, I'm not sure that escape clause applies to 1RR parole when the reverter and revertee have a long history of conflict.

It did vandalism, was blocked, then the account was transferred to RadioKirk. —<a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMessedrocker_53b5.html" title="User:Messedrocker"><font color="blue"><code>this is messedrocker</code></font></a> <a href="../../../m/e/s/User_talk%7EMessedrocker_915e.html" title="User talk:Messedrocker"><font color="blue"><code>(talk)</code></font></a> 20:15, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Radio Kirk, what side are you on? You can say what you want, but only Checkuser can prove it. Mr. Professor 20:22, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Accounts all created within minutes of each other (notice my impostor on Wikiversity was created two minutes [!] before Mr. Professor and 31 minutes before The Great Teacher were created here) on perhaps the only remaining Wiki I hadn't joined yet. Also check my talk page history; with no question whatsoever, this is Raptor30/Rappy30/Nanook/Nookdog/etc./etc./etc. (read up to "No block reason" on this page). I can think of nothing more sad than a determined vandal who gets pissed because I (and others) stopped him, and who is now wasting his life in an effort to "get revenge" (again, read my talk page history). Sad indeed... <tt style="color:#161;">RadioKirk <small>(<a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadioKirk_a5db.html" title="User:RadioKirk">u</a>|<a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadioKirk_dc7c.html" title="User talk:RadioKirk">t</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RadioKirk_8f39.html" title="Special:Contributions/RadioKirk">c</a>)</small></tt> 20:36, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Yeah right. The user page stated that syphonbyte used this as an alternative account, and it suddenly gets back active after syphonbyte is indef blocked. What a coincidence... By the way, this means that syphonbyte either lied when he said that Gotem was an alternative account of his, or that he did not lie then but is nlying now and evading his block. Either way, it does no good for his case... <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 14:31, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>I have a slight hunch that a local politician may have attempted to use Wikipedia for his own political gain. I know this isn't exactly vandalism, but I am unfamiliar with the protocol in place for this situation. The user in question is Stampedem. The contributions in question have to do with the <a href="../../../e/l/i/Eliot_Shapleigh_7f7e.html" title="Eliot Shapleigh">Eliot Shapleigh</a>, and Dee Margo articles. These two men are both candidates for a seat in the <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas_Senate_0cc2.html" title="Texas Senate">Texas Senate</a>, and as you can imagine, this sort of conduct has arrisen. I reverted some of the changes this user made too the Shapleigh article, and am currently researching the portions of his/her contributions I did not revert. I will document my findings on any other revert on the article's talk page. I also left a message on their talk page on the topic. Getting to the Margo article, what raises concern is that not all the contents of the article are exactly true. I have already tagged the article with {{<a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnreferenced_31dd.html" title="Template:Unreferenced">Unreferenced</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENot_verified_a8cc.html" title="Template:Not verified">Not verified</a>}}, and will be going through it over the next couple of days to check the facts. Also, although the author attacked the Shapleigh article with a sort of smear-campaign-style contribution, only a sentence of the Margo article deals with the upcoming election. In all honesty, Margo is somewhat of an unnotable person--although accomplished, his most notable quality is that he is running for a position as Texas senator. Hence, I also marked the article with {{<a href="../../../i/m/p/Template%7EImportance_b9e2.html" title="Template:Importance">Importance</a>}}. I need to know how to attain the IP of a user, that way, I may run a trace to see if this user is indeed who I think they are. Please, if you have a moment, look into this situation. Your input would be greatly appreciated. <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomnabot_5163.html" title="User:Somnabot">Somnabot</a> 15:06, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If these folks are merely candidates, then both articles should be on AfD, IMO, where candidate pages are pretty routinely sent to the bit bucket.

<dd>Doesn't look like a complete no-brainer (assuming it's Maggie, she's gotten a lot smarter), but a Checkuser may be in order. There's a suspiciously advanced knowledge of Wikipedia markup, combined with a similarly tendentious (though toned-down compared to previously) editing style. Watching Maggie's initial meltdown (I didn't participate (much?), but watching was more than enough) was deeply unsettling; it wouldn't be pleasant to watch it happen again. However, we need to be absolutely sure before we do anything drastic. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 20:38, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>To help with this, perhaps you should take a look at <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELingeron_802e.html" title="User:Lingeron">User:Lingeron</a>'s edit history. She was also a sock puppet of Maggie, and was also a bit more careful. The fact that she has toned down a bit is the reason why I waited so long to report anything to WP:AN/I. But I've been dealing with her for weeks, and it's pretty obvious to me, now, that she's a sock puppet (and my initial hunches tend to be correct regarding sock puppets, anyway). She's doing the same old thing, accusing people of being part of a communist conspiracy, calling them anti-American, claiming that there's an anti-American bias imposed by America-haters, and so forth. She's also highly sensitive, and lashes out quite a bit, per usual. Now she's accusing us of editing while drunk. --AaronS 20:48, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, AaronS, it was <a href="../../../d/t/c/User%7EDTC_5378.html" title="User:DTC">DTC</a> who first made the observation that you and Blockader were editing Wikipedia while drunk. This is evident by your conversations on <a href="../../../a/n/a/Talk%7EAnarchism_e72f.html" title="Talk:Anarchism">talk:Anarchism</a>. You both <i>sound</i> drunk and have all but admitted that you edit while drinking. I'm sorry that you think I am this (these) users. I'm just not and it's frustrating that you've driven good users away with your constant accusations like Two-bitSprite. As far as knowing markup, I've already explained to <a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> that I've been using computers for 11 years, (since I was 9 years old), and can do quite a few things concerning their use. Another thing that you mentioned, the anti-American thing, This <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force">user</a> says she is anti-American on her page, and this <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlockader_5d3e.html" title="User:Blockader">user</a> also claims to be 'un-American'. That is what started me wondering and saying such a thing! I never said there was a communist conspiracy. What a thing to say!

<dd>Interesting. As far as the facts are concerned, Two-Bit Sprite and I got along together quite well, actually, so I'm not sure what you're talking about. When you work a lot on an article and get to know all of the editors there, the bad with the good, it becomes easy to recognize who's whom. It's like reading the same few authors over and over again. After a while, you can be presented with a short paragraph from an unnamed book, and, without much effort, name the author and title. Regardless, I don't consider myself to be one of the partisan editors; it's just that I consider the actions of the partisans on one side to be a bit more offensive than the partisans on the other. Needless to say, I get along quite well with everybody from both sides of the spectrum, save a couple of editors who have been notoriously nasty to all who disagree with them. --AaronS 00:36, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Also see <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">User talk:Bishonen</a> for another conversation (also in archives). Anyway, they have definitely toned their edits down as mentioned above, although it has gotten worse the last few days. I however am convinced this is thewolfstar. I also think DTC and That'sHot should be checked into as well (DTC is accused of being an RJII sock, and I also mentioned this on both Bishonen and Bunchofgrapes' talk pages), but am not as confident as with Whiskey Rebellion. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force"><b><font color="black">Ungovernable Force</font></b></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_Wikipedian_kitchen_68b8.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force/Wikipedian kitchen"><font color="green"><sup>The Wiki Kitchen!</sup></font></a> 23:24, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It could very likely be her.

<dd>It's pretty clear to me. The account name is straight out of Maggie's farm. (Read about the Whiskey Rebellion: it's her kind of topic.) The evidence is certainly clear enough for a check user. Since enough folks are questioning the identification here, we'll need to RFCU before blocking, I suppose. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 19:59, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Me, too, but it's a good thing, generally, that we do the RFCU if there is any doubt, and that the question came up here, first.

<p>This user is busy in with a elaborate campaign of POV violation, which lies beyond the scope of this noticeboard. His methods of complex vandalism do not: the user is extremely fond of Wikilawyering, using it mainly to strike sources opposing his views from articles, especially the old problem article of <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">Anarchism</a>. He has made <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_3RRArchive26_a01b.html#User:DTC_reported_by_User:Marinus_.28Result:.29" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/3RRArchive26">a complex 3RR violation</a> striking an excellent source (a violation so complex no admin made a judgement). He insists on removing a slew of sources, some impeccable, despite my repeated pleadings for him not to and explanations as to why not <a href="../../../a/n/a/Talk%7EAnarchism_e72f.html#Marinus.27s_sources" title="Talk:Anarchism">on the talk page</a>. Later other editors gave fuller defenses of some of these sources <a href="../../../a/n/a/Talk%7EAnarchism_e72f.html#Sources" title="Talk:Anarchism">here</a> which the user has ignored in striking them from the article, unilaterally, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anarchism&amp;diff=72632593&amp;oldid=72604126" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anarchism&amp;diff=72632593&amp;oldid=72604126" rel="nofollow">first one excellent source</a>, then <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anarchism&amp;diff=72657169&amp;oldid=72656511" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anarchism&amp;diff=72657169&amp;oldid=72656511" rel="nofollow">a bucket of sources</a> (as he had <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anarchism&amp;diff=71747153&amp;oldid=71744807" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anarchism&amp;diff=71747153&amp;oldid=71744807" rel="nofollow">before</a>). Having thus removed sources opposing his POV he frames his POV as the scholarly consensus. Due to his dishonesty (he claims, twice, to have read all the sources and not have found the claims in question) his aggressive misrepresentation of sources (as discussed in the talk page) and of Wikipedia policy (concerning what is an acceptable source) I believe it impossible to consider his acts as those done in good faith. <b>I ask for administrator intervention</b> explaining to the user the unsuitability of manipulating Wikipedia in this way, since he has been edit-warring for weeks and has brushed off all attempts at mediation (note how his list of "verified" sources is unchanged since a week ago, despite some of these sources being justified on the talk page in the mean time).

<dd>Now for the real story. You're the one that put in those sources and I gave you ample time to come up with page numbers so they could be verified but you couldn't do it. Why couldn't you do it? Because you never accessed the sources. You took them out of another Wikipedia article, which you admitted. Apparently you don't know that information on Wikipedia needs to be verifiable. If you cite a whole book and claim that somewhere in there is the specific claim that anarcho-capitalism is not a form of anarchism, how is anyone to verify that? I looked through some of those books and I didn't see the claim in them. And you didn't either. The burden is on you to show that you allege to be sources actually are. You need to give us a page number, and a quote as well would be better. When and if you do, I'm going to look it up in the book to verify it. If you assume bad faith, that's your problem. I haven't given you any reason to assume bad faith. I have even deleted sources that were claimed to say anarcho-capitalism is a form of individualist anarchism, because I went to verify it and it didn't say what it was alleged to say. But if you want to assume bad faith, go right ahead. Your assumption of bad faith is not going to stop me verifying the sources and deleting any that can't be verified. And yes, please send us some intervention, preferably from someone who cares about Wikipedia having reliable information. <a href="../../../d/t/c/User%7EDTC_5378.html" title="User:DTC">DTC</a> 06:57, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Oh dear, it's an either or situation. Certainly, his block log is a complete train wreck of 3RR violations, and he shows absolutely no sign of being able to modify this disruptive behaviour. Something needs to be done however, and if it's not a community ban then his behaviour must be examined by arbcom. His recent behaviour before and after my recent block of him is completely unacceptable, including sockpuppet abuse and frivolous RFCU requests in spiteful retaliation. As a recently involved admin I offer no opinion on a community ban, leaving that to others.

<li>Nixer can really be a pain to deal with due to his stubbornness, but he has a number of good contributions and in my opinion he in general was an asset rather than a liability. I am against indefinite community block on this stage but I would support some limiting of his edit warring (e.g. 1RR or 2RR instead of 3RR) as well as some sort of a formal mentoring ( I volunteer to be a mentor, but I would need an assistance from somebody in a Moscow timezone).

Especially unnaceptable is its statement that "Wikipedia defines anti-semitism as X." That's original research, boys and girls, and the worst possible kind: it's for the purpose of labelling people with a highly-loaded term. It could be replaced, I suppose, by Category:People who are called Anti-Semitic or Category:Allegedly anti-semitic people—which would have the criterion that some notable source had called them Anti-Semitic. This criterion, unlike the current one, is at least self-consistent under NPOV. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 00:48, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nonsense. Whatever shred of "good faith" one can attest to his reversion of the anti-Semitic people cat, despite all the evidence on that, does not apply to his reversion of the "Holocaust denial" category. In that regard he was engaged in a one-man reversion war. He had zero support for that reversion on the talk page. For that alone his block should have been far more than the six hours imposed. That was no way a good-faith invocation of BLP, by any way shape or form. I think Heath errs is treating reversions for the anti-Semitic cat and the (relatively uncontroversial) Holocaust denial cat as being equivalent.--<a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMantanmoreland_c701.html" title="User:Mantanmoreland">Mantanmoreland</a> 01:15, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm honestly at some loss at to understand this. He reverted two cats, one definitely not a good faith reversion under BLP. If he had reverted that alone would it have warranted a longer block?

<dd>If you let Liftarn or any editor revert infinitely the "anti-Semitic category" tag, then you might as well do away with the category. That may be all ducky for an editor such as yourself who opposes both the category and MA's inclusion therein, but seems a rather backwards way of approaching the situation. There is such a category, and if the evidence is mountainous that a person belongs in it, as in this instance, citing BLP and revert-warring using that language is bad faith and should be subject to 3RR. Otherwise you have endless edit warring.--<a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMantanmoreland_c701.html" title="User:Mantanmoreland">Mantanmoreland</a> 02:25, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

He/she did this because I reverted his blanking of warnings off his/her talk page. Since, Snowbound has archived his/her warnings off the page, which I have no objections to. However, he/she added a link to the archive box which was incorrect, so I fixed it for him/her, per <a href="../../../a/r/c/WP%7EARCHIVE_af20.html" title="WP:ARCHIVE">WP:ARCHIVE</a>. I also left a helpful edit summary, as well as a message, detailing the fixes I made to conform with the Wikipedia policy linked previously.</p>
<p>This user has since posted a message on GIen's talk accusing me of Wikistalking, as well as stating "I have previously requested that the user Daniel Bryant do not edit my talk page". <a href="../../../t/a/l/WP%7ETALK_766c.html#User_talk_pages" title="WP:TALK">He/she refuses to acknowledge the fact that anyone can post anything, within Wikipedia policy, on any user's talk page</a>.

<dd>The stated purpose of the sock is to protect the article on himself, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Boothroyd_079b.html" title="David Boothroyd">David Boothroyd</a>. Although creating the sock is a techincal violation of his week-long block, it would be unfortunate if someone took advantage of Dbiv's situation to inappropriately edit the David Boothroyd article. As long as the sock sticks to that purpose, I find it hard to get worked up over it. It should be tagged as a friendly sock, should not edit any other articles while Dbiv is blocked, and should never edit <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Tatchell_6e4b.html" title="Peter Tatchell">Peter Tatchell</a>. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131 (talk)</a> 14:14, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Indeed. It is unfortunate that that was necessary. I feel blocking his sockpuppet was slightly more the letter of policy than the spirit. Equally, he is being deliberately disruptive (though in a minor way) and he should know better. It all fits with the pattern of behaviour that led to his desysopping.</dd>
<dd>If User:DavidBoothroyd were not be used as a tool to evade blocks, I would be quite happy to unblock it (at least at times when Dbiv is not blocked). <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Land_1a6c.html" title="User:The Land">The Land</a> 14:15, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It would be really nice if we could de-escalate this situation. CanadianCeasar's question is highly relevant. I've seen several former admins turn on wikipedia and we should do as little as possible to contribute to that. In the spirit of being nice and assuming good faith I would like to ask that <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidBoothroyd_7ceb.html" title="User:DavidBoothroyd">User:DavidBoothroyd</a> be unblocked and for everyone to leave him alone. Yes, its a technical violation and Dbiv is evading his block, but if Calton had left him alone then quite possibly the only edits would have been the redirects he set up. I also don't have a problem with redirecting the IP talk page to Dbiv's as long as it really is a stable IP; I have seen this arrangement before with noncontroversial editors and no one objected. The bottom line is, if Dbiv uses the David Boothroyd account for other than its stated purpose, that will become immediately clear and action can be taken then. With his stated refusal to accept the article ban Dbiv is on the wrong path but the last thing we should do is push (or even nudge) him farther down it. I know my opinion is not technically correct either, but its how I feel at this time. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131 (talk)</a> 15:05, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I may be speaking about stuff that ain't my business, Thatcher, but here it goes: rather than an appeal by Dbiv (that was rejected by ArbCom), why not make a motion in prior case and replace the article ban with a probation or a revert parole? If Dbiv will really want to improve the article and not go edit-warrying again, that's just fine for WP.

<dd>Without reviewing the arbitration case, I'm sure that such remedies were considered. (You can look yourself; it would be on <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Irishpunktom_Workshop_e63f.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Irishpunktom/Workshop">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Irishpunktom/Workshop</a> if I typed that correctly.) And I suspect it's much too early for the arbitrators to agree to entertain such a motion. Actually, I agree with the article ban, not because the content of his edits was bad, but because the manner in which he made the edits was bad, and his recent behavior does not fill me with confidence that he would have adhered to the 11th-hour compromise he worked out with Irishpunktom. Since he does not agree with the article ban, an escalating series of conflicts is not entirely unforseeable. In the meantime, since Dbiv could just as easily create User:QwertyJoe to defend the article on himself, we're probably better off allowing him to do it openly.<a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131 (talk)</a> 15:31, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If one were to tell a friend to please not borrow the car for awhile because they smoked in it, and they borrowed it again, it makes sense to take away the keys for awhile. We all have a certain amount of respect for Dbiv, but when people step beyond bounds of what's acceptable, even if they're nice about it (e.g. using an ashtray in a smoking-verboten place), we should not permit that. Allowing them to do so if they paint the cigarettes like straws is not kosher -- neither is changing the rules so they can smoke. Dbiv should show better sense than this, and we shouldn't be bending over backwards to permit or reward broken behaviour. Please reblock the sock and let him wait. --<a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImprov_b282.html" title="User:Improv">Improv</a> 15:35, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think Improv is right (I never meant my clarification of the block reason to imply that the sock should not also be blocked). Members of the Arbitration Committee specifically expressed severe reservations about Dbiv's conduct <i>during the arbitration case</i>, specifically his insertion of his own point of view into one of the proposed findings of fact (on a page that is reserved for arbitrators and clerks). His conduct since the case ended includes two separate repeated instances of edit warring on the <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Tatchell_6e4b.html" title="Peter Tatchell">Peter Tatchell</a> article from which he is banned, in what he openly describes as a direct challenge to the Arbitration Committee's authority.</dd>

<dd>I'm not arguing for special treatment. As I understand it, socks used to evade blocks should themselves be blocked. This is normally considered egregious misconduct by the blocked user. However, the fact that a sock has been used to evade a block does not necessarily mean that it will be in future. If Dbiv can avoid the temptation to wind people up with his sockpuppet, then that is a valuable step to his addressing the problems that led to him being blocked in the first place. If he continues to evade his block, then we can just issue more blocks on one or both accounts with relatively little effort.

<li>I'd block indefinitely, if it is compromised then the real owner can still contact us, if not then the block stands. Just a couple of observations though, the first edits were only at the beginning of the month. The first edits was to install popups in their monobook.js, so I would suggest this wasn't a brand new user per se. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User%7EPgk_d0c7.html" title="User:Pgk">pgk</a><sup>(<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk"><font color="mediumseagreen">talk</font></a>)</sup> 18:30, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>Yesterday I successfully put the article "Benoît Chamoux" into production but when I search on "Chamoux" the article is not listed.

<li>Make a redirect. Create a page called "Chamoux" with the content only reading "#REDIRECT [[Benoît Chamoux]]". <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_Lilithborne_247d.html" title="User:Danny Lilithborne">Danny Lilithborne</a> 08:24, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Unfortunately, that may not be the best advice for two reasons:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Chamoux isn't the rarest name - there's a <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Chamoux_ab90.html" title="Jean Chamoux">Jean Chamoux</a>, photographer, Matthieu Chamoux, some kind of producer, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cantons_of_the_Savoie_d%C3%A9partement_32e6.html" title="Cantons of the Savoie département">Chamoux-sur-Gelon</a> canton... we'd need a complex <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_78fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation">disambiguation</a> page rather than a simple redirect, which may be more work than Cclauss is signing up for.</li>
<li>And even that won't solve the "<a href="../../../s/e/a/WP%7ESEARCH_dcbe.html" title="WP:SEARCH">Search</a>" issue Cclauss is asking about. The issue with that is that the Wikipedia Search database can take several days to be fully updated with new articles. The only real cure for that is patience. It will come, grasshopper, it will come. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 21:14, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I've created a disambiguation page for the two main Chamoux articles (Benoît and Jean). I normally don't include pages that don't have the disambigued word in their title in the disambiguation pages I create (so no links to the producer etcetera), but everyone's free to add those if they feel it is necessary of course. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 08:38, 1 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Oh, it's not so simple at all, I'm afraid. In the French WP, <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamoux|" class="external text" title="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamoux|" rel="nofollow">Chamoux</a> is <i>primarily</i> the canton, not a disambiguation at all, and I guess they should know. Here's "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Chamoux" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Chamoux" rel="nofollow">what links here</a>" for the English page - both for the canton (or are they different cantons?), neither for either Benoit or Jean. It looks like using it for a name disambiguation is inappropriate. <small>And using the administrator's noticeboard/incidents to discuss the fate of a minor dab page is even less appropriate, now that I think about it...</small><a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 13:44, 1 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>For the moment, seeing what other articles exist, the current disambig page is the correct solution. What would you do? Create a Chamoux page that redirects to Chamoux (disambiguation)? That's overkill. What you can do, if you think it is necessary, is add a link on the Chamoux page to <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cantons_of_the_Savoie_d%C3%A9partement_32e6.html" title="Cantons of the Savoie département">Cantons of the Savoie département</a>. The page is not intended for name disambiguation only, it is intended for all disambiguation, but as there are no other articles for some specific Chamoux for the moment, no other items were needed there. I think I have followed <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_78fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation">Wikipedia:Disambiguation</a> completely, but nothing there prohibits the adding of more articles to the page. Also remember that while a French canton may be the logical first page for a search term on the French Wikipedia, it is not necessarily so on an international one. By the way, the village Chamoux (the main article on the French Wikipedia has a massive <i>83</i> inhabitants. I do agree with one thing though; if this discussion is necessary, it should be done at either the article Chamoux (for the specifics) or at the WP:disambig page (for a more general discussion). <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 19:21, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I've been trying to get an idea what this is all about. It's really quite difficult with all that history - lots of material archived, etc. Mystar does, indeed, often fail to assume good faith, and he has said a lot of things in the past that probably cross the line into personal attacks. Obviously, he shouldn't do that. It's also slightly concerning the extent to which he seems to be taking instructions from Terry Goodkind himself. All the same, I'm not sure that this is the right time for admins to intervene, unless something especially outrageous happens. We may just inflame the situation, right now, when there is some hope for it to cool down.</dd>
<dd>It's basically a content dispute, and it looks as if a number of you are prepared to try mediation. I think the mediation should go ahead if at all possible. Also, I'm getting a sense (perhaps I'm wrong about this; I haven't gone to enormous lengths to check the merits of the dispute) that Mystar isn't just being mad or bad here - that he has been provoked in part by some unencyclopedic attacks on Goodkind's literary reputation using inappropriate sources. I suggest that admins keep out of it for the moment, while we see if the mediation works. <i>All</i> the history will come out if it ever ends up with Arb.Com. For now, I'll watch developments. I just urge that everyone try to be civil and assume that other current editors are acting in good faith, and that everyone do their best to be understanding of other viewpoints in the mediation. Of course, you (or Mystar if it comes to that) can come back here if there are any urgent problems that I'm not seeing, or haven't yet come up, which might require warnings or page protection.

<dd>You're requesting a 48 hours "or more" block for that? It's not a nice remark, but many people wouldn't call it a PA at all. Please note that in any case only <i>extreme</i> personal attacks are grounds for a block. Why not correct the edits to your text yourself? And remember to comment on content, not on the contributor. Calling an <i>edit</i> "contentious" is acceptable, calling the <i>editor</i> contentious is quite unnecessary. Avoid ascribing motives to other editors, especially bad motives, such as saying "in an effort to inflame already-high tensions even more".

<dd>Well, a huge chunk of it is blatant plagiarism from PA's website. The company logo and infobox are fine and standard for a large corporation. However, the intro, 'Activities', and 'PA Ventures' sections contain verbatim lifts of their website content, while 'History' and 'Awards' seem to mostly contain original phrases. I've got to go right now, but in the meantime I changed your tags from {{POV}} and {{weasel}} to {{advert}}, which is what I think you intended to do in the first place. I'll check here when I get back and see what others suggest. I say leave the history and rewrite or cut the rest, but I'm kind of cranky right now.&#160;;-) <font color="darkblue"><b>Baseball,Baby!</b></font> <font color="red"><sup><i>balls</i></sup></font><font color="darkblue"><sup>•</sup></font><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BaseballBaby_1aec.html" title="Special:Contributions/BaseballBaby"><font color="red"><sup><i>strikes</i></sup></font></a> 11:51, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>(cross-posted to his talk) Yeah, sorry about that. I should have left a note after blocking you. I couldn't find any evidence changes to this template had been discussed, so I was worried about the speed with which you were editing the over 200 articles involved. If you had used edit summaries as Golbez suggested above, I might've found out you suggested the field to begin with. Please consider the above suggestion of raising suggestions to change major templates on the related talk pages and I'm sure blocks like mine won't happen again. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 20:06, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The issue here is fairly complicated, so bear with me. I have been "involved" in the Bint Jbeil article as sort of a referee. I was asked, about a month ago, for my opinion on a possible 3RR violation on this article. After sorting that out, I decided that since the article was so controversial, rather than let it hit the admin noticeboards for 3RR, RFPP, etc. every three days or so, I would watchlist it and keep a lid on disputes which occurred. I have reverted a few times in the past month, mainly for vandalism or for edits which ran afoul of talk page consensus. I am not interested in this article as an author in any way. I am just doing my best to keep a contentious article from perpetually clogging admin noticeboards. That said, a revert war over sources has broken out in the past few days, and although no one broke 3RR, I decided that the revert war was severe enough to warrant protection. Unfortunately, it had to be full protection, as several users involved in the reverting would not be covered by semi-protection. The reason I reverted Isarig's edits before I protected is because Isarig is the only person advocating his particular side of the revert war. I have even read the news article cited in this dispute, and have decided that they do not corroborate Isarig's point of view. Therefore, I reverted before protection because I would rather have a page protected on the (seemingly) more correct version than the less correct version. In addition to all of this, I would add that protection not be removed from this page, as I have seen no evidence that the revert war will not continue should protection be removed. Sorry if I have flouted policy, I thought my actions have been for the best from the start, but if the community feels otherwise I will undo them and even recuse myself from further editing of this article if need be. <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanGerbil10_1003.html" title="User:RyanGerbil10">RyanG</a><font color="green">e</font><a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanGerbil10_1003.html" title="User:RyanGerbil10">rbil10</a><small><a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanGerbil10_836d.html" title="User talk:RyanGerbil10">(Kick 'em in the dishpan!)</a></small> 19:18, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ryan, the situation with this article may be as you describe it, but the Talk page &amp; the edit summaries tell little more than this is a hotly contested subject, &amp; people disagree with Isarig. (For everybody else, the Battle of Bint Jbeil was one of the incidents of the recent Israel military action in south Lebanon. Yes, another Israel/Palestine-related conflict.) The rest of us could use a bit more conversation on the Talk page in order to understand what is being disputed &amp; why. Transparency is a good thing. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 20:26, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ryan, you are making things worse for yourself by engaging in a dishonest description of the situation. I am not the "only person advocating his particular side of the revert war" - the most recent revert to my version was by <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThreeafterthree_41a1.html" title="User:Threeafterthree">user:Threeafterthree</a>, who in addition to me, is also the only editor who has discussed his change on the Talk page - something you have yet to do. Furthermore, you cannot claim on the one hand to be "not interested in this article as an author in any way", and in the next minute tell us that you "have even read the news article cited in this dispute, and have decided that they do not corroborate Isarig's point of view" - describing a clear content dispute. In any case, disinterested editor or content-disputing editor, WP policy is clear and unambigous on this: "Admins <b>must not protect</b> pages they are actively engaged in editing" - there are no exceptions for self-appointed "refrees", disinterested editors or any other editor. You have admitted above to flounting policy. you have been instructed on your Talk page by another admin not to block pages you are editing - undo this block <b>now</b>. <a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsarig_bbf7.html" title="User:Isarig">Isarig</a> 22:08, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The locus of the dispute is over whether or not a link should be included to an MSNBC on-line news article which states that there are still Hezbollah fighters in the area of Bint Jbeil, and whether or not Bint Jbeil remains a Hezbollah stronghold. Isarig continues to remove the link to the article, and the mention that Bint Jbeil remains a Hezbollah stronghold. Various editors have reverted him on this. After having read the article in question, I have reverted Isarig, considering his edits to be both disruptive and false. I hope this clears things up, but I will be happy to provide more information if required. <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanGerbil10_1003.html" title="User:RyanGerbil10">RyanG</a><font color="green">e</font><a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanGerbil10_1003.html" title="User:RyanGerbil10">rbil10</a><small><a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanGerbil10_836d.html" title="User talk:RyanGerbil10">(Kick 'em in the dishpan!)</a></small> 22:04, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As an editor and especially as an admin it is easy to find yourself engaged in disputes that you came to only to assist with the resolution of a constant dispute, to remove content spam, and etc. It can be somewhat confusing as to what should be done at this point, and have found myself in similar situations. If ryangerbil did just come to that article a month ago to help diffuse a constant conflict, i can't say that i'm opposed to what he did, and that this is the reason <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> exists.

<dd>Being in a "confusing" situation (of your own doing) is not reason enough to break well established policy. In this case, we have a simple content dispute. As an admin , <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanGerbil10_1003.html" title="User:RyanGerbil10">RyanG</a> could have chosen not to become involved, protect the page to stop the edit war, and move on. Or he could have chosen to become an active editor, partcipate in the content dispute, voice his opinion on Talk, and edit the page accordingly. But he can't have it both ways. The proper thing to do is for him (or another admin) to unprotect the page, and participate in the discussion on Talk, like every other editor. If the revert war does not die down, there are numerous admins who have by now seen what is going on, and unlike <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanGerbil10_1003.html" title="User:RyanGerbil10">RyanG</a> are truly uninvolved, and they may choose to protect the page. Total protection is a very extreme measure, to be taken in very limited cases, and this one does not even come close to it. <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> is not a loophole by which every admin abuse can be excused. <a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsarig_bbf7.html" title="User:Isarig">Isarig</a> 22:30, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Having been involved in the page edit war to a limited extent, it would be prudent for me to disclose all the related information I know and have observed on this case, first and foremost Administrator <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanGerbil10_1003.html" title="User:RyanGerbil10">User:RyanGerbil10</a> did <i>not</i> revert before protecting the disputed page. He only protected the page after a barrage of reverts came in over the past two days and did what was necessary to prevent the sustained edit war from spilling over into related articles. As stated on the label protection does not amount to an endorsement of the extant version and was correctly done out of prudence. Further more User Isarig has been extremely active in the reversion of that article and has proven unwilling to compromise with other editors, and consistently reverts the article to his specific version; against the consensus of other editors and uses only a single ambiguous source (the source appears to say the opposite of his claims) to backup his position. Additionally <a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsarig_bbf7.html" title="User:Isarig">Isarig</a> often has taken a belligerent attitude towards other editors, and has engaged in numerous revert wars. Often employing what may border on character assassination against other users along with intimidation, due to these reasons he has been blocked in the past for what has been called “utterly uncivil behavior” <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Isarig" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Isarig" rel="nofollow">[107]</a> a thorough check by an administrator of his User contributions and Talk archive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Isarig/Archive_1" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Isarig/Archive_1" rel="nofollow">[108]</a> will show that this is little more than the same type of bullying he normally employs against Junior editors.

<p>I don't know how to report vandalism and abuse but at the Tahirih Justice Center article, the son of a volunteer/benefactor of Tahirih has been building blatant advertising for weeks. He will not back away even when caught. His name is UberCryxic on this board and Egand Kolosi in real life. His mother is Roza Kolosi, a benefactor of the Tahirih Justice Center. His job is to advertise for their coming fundraiser ball on September 27th in Washington DC.</p>
<p>Worse, he has reverted twice and will show no sign of being reasonable. He is acting like he owns the entire article.</p>
<p>I can almost see no action possible except to ask you to investigate or report this blatant manipulation by an organization to the media in a press release.</p>
<p>I am referring to UberCryxic.</p>
<p>This 19 year old man thinks that a Wikipedia article belongs to its namesake and, since the Tahirih Justice Center asked him to be their Wikipedia Webmaster, this young man who recently moved here from Albania just assumes he can revert, revert, revert when another tries to make a reasonable change.EnglishGarden 18:07, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Erald's mother is a fundraiser volunteer for the Tahirih Justice Center. He has written a blatant fundraiser advertisement. Please check the changes I made. Here is the proof that she is a fundraiser/volunteer <a href="http://72.14.221.104/search?q=cache:TUl_1Q0NcPQJ:tahirih.org/legal_tahirih_app/docs/TahirihNewsletterWinter06.pdf+kolasi+tahirih&amp;hl=de&amp;gl=de&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1" class="external text" title="http://72.14.221.104/search?q=cache:TUl_1Q0NcPQJ:tahirih.org/legal_tahirih_app/docs/TahirihNewsletterWinter06.pdf+kolasi+tahirih&amp;hl=de&amp;gl=de&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1" rel="nofollow">Mrs. Kolasi</a></p>
<p>Wikipedia should not allow this 19 year old to dominate an article that his mother is a fundraiser for. The press could be alerted to this. It is immoral. This young man needs to be banned or we need to start working together reasonably. EnglishGarden 18:06, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Again, I am trying to keep this as much away from the personal side of things as possible. I don't specifically know what my mother's involvement at the Benefit on the 27th will be (although I'll call her up and give you a multi-page report on it tomorrow), but I do know that your claim that she works at the organization is <i>false</i>.

<p>You are still not disclosing whether there is financial remuneration in this for yourself. A 19 year old male isn't going to work hard as the webmaster of a Wikipedia article on a women's political organization in the Washington area whom his mother is a fundraiser/volunteer for...without some kind of interest. You were never harmed by an American male dating a foreign woman. Your interest is military history, etc. There is no reasonable explanation for your interest in the subject matter of this women's organization, except that you are getting financial remuneration from your mother who is a fundraiser for the organization. You are guarding the article like a lion. This shows that you fear that your webmaster job is at risk. You do not want to fail. You want to be congratulated. I'll bet you are planning to go to the fundraiser. - This is not funny Erald. This law is serious business and there is a lot of media attention about to come its way. The article must reflect that Tahirih is deeply involved in two lawsuits and that at least one newspaper article per week comes out critical of what Tahirih is doing. You must cease and desist acting like the article belongs to you as the webmaster. EnglishGarden 18:21, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well ultimately, I want personal information about me <b>removed</b> from that website. Otherwise, I don't see how this user, or whoever posted those things, should have any credibility.<a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUberCryxic_9903.html" title="User:UberCryxic">UberCryxic</a> 18:40, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If there is additional criticism that is relevant, then it should be mentioned in the article. The problem that I have seen from looking at the article's history is the tone of the criticism, its placement and citations. Those things need to be fixed before they go into the article. It should be worked out on the talk page rather than reverting one another. Excluding the ill-placed criticisms, the article overall seems to be slightly biased in favor of the organization, but not irrepairably. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 23:47, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Court documents are reputable citations and that is most of what I cited. Please send an editor over with Online Dating article experience.</p>
<p>This matter should have been solved by neutral editors getting actively involved and actually making the changes. Don't assume that I, as the critic, want to spend more than 5 minutes online and continue the discussion anywhere. The young people who hang out at Wikipedia are asked to look at the facts and make real edits to that article.</p>
<p>You can still do so by reading the reputable information I provided and overriding the webmaster, for instance, in noting that a restraining order for one dating website is, according to the 5th Amendment fairness clause, a restraining order on all similar dating websites. The IMBRA law is dead in the water and not saying so is major POV. Why does an editor love this law so much that he is willing to fight so hard to make it appear like the Tahirih Justice Center achieved a wonderful accomplishment in getting a law passed that was quickly restrained?</p>
<p>Sure, the current article is a good skeleton with which POV can be taken out in a few minutes. If that is what one means by "slightly biased", then the article is now only "slightly biased."</p>
<p>With all due respect, people with lives cannot be expected to consider themselves "Wikipedians" in terms of hanging out here more than 5 minutes per week. You cannot assume that outsiders are "extremists" unless you mean that, to a high school or college student who lives on Wikipedia, a lawyer who actually knows the subject under discussion would be an "extremist." I just noticed that a lawyer made a few changes to the article in question and Ubercryxic, who is 30 years younger than the lawyer, made a revert with a condescending remark. The lawyer had to go back to his practice and his family. <b>There is no time for a busy professional with a family to deal with obdurate reverting behavior.</b></p>
<p>I have provided tons of reputable information. Please deal with this yourselves. The Tahirih Justice Center fundraiser is in two weeks and people will be deciding whether or not to donate a lot of money to an organization that openly states that it wants to destroy the online dating industry (according to the reputable source called the IMBRA law, the term "marriage broker" describes all dating sites where non-Americans are &gt;50%).</p>
<p>Would Wikipedians let the KKK put up a brochure two weeks before their fundraiser? Let's be fair and make sure that Wikipedians themselves edit that article to remove pro-Tahirih POV.</p>
<p>Also: Why is it so hard for people to personal message with this Wikipedia software? There needs to be an upgrade to this software. There should be a central point where all Wikipedians interested in "Online Dating" can be asked to check something out. Older people don't have the patience to learn the "Dungeons &amp; Dragons ideosyncracies of the current software.EnglishGarden 11:02, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The Willy on Wheels' non-wiki appearances subpage was the result of a MfD, as the Outoftuneviolin subpage, and unless I'm missing some sort of major event, at the moment those seem to be the <i>only</i> deletions that had <i>any</i> sort of legitimate justifications under the official <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">deletion policy</a>. As Cyde has not made any sort of declaration or announcement of his actions (a quick contribs glance proves that easily), I highly suspect he will defend himself with claims that he has "full community backing" in the matter, and definitely "there is no controversy over WP:DENY" will come up many times (getting any deja-vu yet?).</p>

I agree with others that vandals shouldn't be "rewarded" by having more Wikipedia infrastructure than is necessary utilized to properly manage their disruptions.

<p>OK look. I don't really care <b>one bit</b> about whether these deletions are in or out of process. Honest, I don't. And arguments that they are out of process truly <i>miss the point</i>, which is that we are getting some things tossed that we need kept, things that admins working hard to counteract sock vandals need to get their work done. I'm prepared to restore items that got deleted by mistake, without regard to DrV, and take the heat for it, if the case is made to me (in whatever manner you choose) that they're needful.

<p>Actually I agree with Friday. I've been open about what I'm doing all along - hense my post up above yesterday solicitating comments. I've been listening for any rational objections. I've sent the categories to CfD for a full debate. But changing things round here is always a matter of being bold and talking at the same time. Boldness only and you get backs up, talk only and you go in circles. I sense a consensus is emerging. Sure, it will need to be tweeked - a case for keeping some of the vandal-forensics may exist (I've yet to hear it tough).

<p>For my part I completely support the spirit of what Cyde and Doc are doing. There is absolutely no sense in keeping monuments to vandals around just because we can't muster a supermajority on MFD to delete them. Any pages that are of actual ongoing utility to people dealing with vandalism are another matter, but it is unclear to me that these monuments are in fact useful in this fashion. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">The Uninvited</a> Co., <a href="../../../u/n/i/User_talk%7EUninvitedCompany_4866.html" title="User talk:UninvitedCompany">Inc.</a> 16:06, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The case discussed at AN right now is an LTA page that was recently useful in convincing some admins that a new editor was in fact an old vandal. That's an excellent use of the LTA concept. No one needs an LTA page for Willy any more, page move vandalism is obvious and doesn't require investigation. We also don't need to categorize vandals except in the cases of subtle vandals that require investigation, and we don't need vandal templates as long as a reasonable summary is included in the block log ("page move vandal", "attack user name", etc.) Too much of the anti-vandal tagging and categorizing is about scorekeeping, and obvious vandals don't need to be tracked or counted. Just block and move on. I support 90% of these deletions and I would recommend that if any LTA pages that are needed for the more subtle vandals are deleted, to undelete them and make a note on the page/talk page. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131 (talk)</a> 16:03, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Speaking as one who deals with sockpuppets, keeping these kinds of pages really isn't very helpful, and I wholly support removing them. The things that vandals do--page blanking, page moves, insertion of inappropriate material--are readily recognizable as things which are bad for the encyclopedia and should be reverted. We don't need these monuments and shrines. I wholly support getting rid of them. Badlydrawnjeff is laboring under the mistaken idea that vandal pages have something to do with encyclopedia and fall under the rules which govern content. They don't. They're cruft. The community exists to serve the encyclopedia. You're here to serve the encyclopedia. If it's good for the encyclopedia it stays. If it isn't then it goes. If you don't agree with these propositions then you'd better go too, because you're here for the wrong reasons. Now, there is space for a debate as to whether these are useful and should be kept. The recent CfD debates suggest a general consensus to delete most of them, to the horror of vandals. Cyde, as always, has perhaps been exuberant in his interpretation of events. He does that. He also might be right. Instead of quibbling over process, let's ask whether he's right that we should nuke these pages. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 16:07, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I for one support deletion of all vandal trophy-cabinets. They glorify wrongdoing, and very likely do more harm than good. Vandals are vermin and should be reverted, blocked, and otherwise ignored. I also agree with Mackensen that there may be a few cases where forensic information is useful, but it is in a small minority of vandal pages: we need to discuss which may be in this category. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_af9e.html" title="User talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a> 16:15, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Mackensen, the thing is, where is a new user going to find information about a "prominent" (for lack of a better word) vandal if he runs into one? For example, how was I going to find out, back when I was a newbie, to look for the tell-tale signs of WoW? Or better yet, if I hadn't had found the page where it was documented, wouldn't I have been a bit unprepared to be an admin? Where would we have written the IP information when it came to the Squidward vandal a while back? IIRC, someone used it to make some phone calls to the ISP. I do agree that sometimes these pages are created unnecesarily, but it feels like you're throwing the baby along with the bathwater, and that many of these pages should not have been deleted. At the same time, explosive and spectacular antics like those seen here just distracts those who are actually trying to edit articles for a while and run into the latest meta-turf war. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">xd</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a>)</sup> 16:22, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I'll work to change that, but the other two, no, I do not agree with your interpretation one bit.

<dd>I am indeed starting to wonder what you <i>did</i> learn from that affair. I sure didn't learn that process takes precedence over all else. Rather, it demonstrated that both blind adherence to process and blind being-stupid are harmful, and can form the two sides of a wheel war. Common sense is what is called for, and it is never always process or always ignoring it. The proper way to carry on a discussion in our hopefully common sense-based community is to argue the merits, not the process, of the situation. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 17:48, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Jeff, you saw in the userbox wars that a rational discussion before action can come to the desired conclusion harmoniously? Did I miss the part where that happened?</dd>
<dd>My non-facetious point, which I don't wish to lose in the tone there, is that the idea that policy can be hammered out in discussion without testing through bold application and vigorous participation in the resulting discussions, is an untested hypothesis, and one that I don't find at all compelling.

<dd>I don't think rational discussion was ever seriously attempted, not that massive deletions would have helped the case. I do see many controversial policies work via discussion and consensus, however - for instance, CSD A7 is a great example. Even WP:BLP, which I'm not a huge fan of, didn't occur overnight. The policy was created as the issues were discussed and slowly implemente. There's absolutely no reason this couldn't have been handled the same way, especially given the amount of work people put in regarding combating vandalism. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 20:16, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree that the userbox situation wasn't handled all that well. I like to think that a few of us were attempting rational discussion, but there was enough noise to drown most of that out. I don't know much about the background of A7 or <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. I know Jimbo asked us, as a community, to discuss the reasons that userboxes are a bad idea, but most people couldn't be bothered to have those discussions, and many who tried found themselves sidetracked and running after red herring after red herring about censorship and disclosure of bias and everything else.

<dd>No one is forcing anything. I posted to this board and spelled out what I was doing and asked for any reasoned objections. I sent the categories to CSD, where an overwhelming consensus (almost unanimous) is agreeing with my analysis. I'm sorry if I didn't jump through whatever procedural hoop you think I ought to - but consensus is clearly with me. Otherwise, I'd have stopped, or been reverted. THat's how things work round here.

<p>For an admin to ignore all rules, they need to provide a clear motivation and document why they are ignoring particular guidelines and following others.</p>
<p>In this case, that motivation and documentation was provided at <a href="../../../d/e/n/WP%7EDENY_da3a.html" title="WP:DENY">Deny recognition</a>. So it's not true that Cyde is trying to avoid explaining hir actions.</p>
<p><a href="../../../d/e/n/WP%7EDENY_da3a.html" title="WP:DENY">Deny recognition</a> is not yet supported by everyone. That's ok, you are permitted to <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">be bold</a> and apply new guidelines anytime you like. You do have to expect to negotiate with people on the best way to apply them, and you do have to expect things won't go perfectly.</p>
<p>As per <a href="../../../b/r/d/WP%7EBRD_8e65.html" title="WP:BRD">Bold revert discuss</a>, "Out of process" is not a valid excuse to oppose any such action. You will have to provide solid logical arguments why your idea is superior to the solution chosen. Since we're talking about a process you're intimately familiar with, this should not be a problem. If you fail to logically argue your position (even with such a large advantage), then that process deserves to be overruled.</p>
<p>When you do have logical arguments for and/or against, please document them at <a href="../../../d/e/n/WP%7EDENY_da3a.html" title="WP:DENY">WP:DENY</a> and its talk page. What things did Cyde do right, what did he do wrong? Problems are inevitable when applying some new guideline. Try to help Cyde sort them out.</p>
<p>Of course, if the guideline is not viable at all, we'll find that out quickly enough too, and we document that, and people won't take this kind of action in future.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that if you think that following process is important, it still matters *which* process to be following right now, and how correct is that process? We have a process for things happening out of process. Follow it!</p>

<dd>Bold has often been applied to guidelines (Radiant used it there often). Bold Revert Discuss certainly applies to guidelines. I've already pointed out that Cyde was not reckless, because the reasons for his actions are well documented. Your concerns wrt Ignore All Rules <i>itself</i> may or may not be valid, but they're not relevant here and now. I'm certainly willing to discuss them with you elsewhere and/or later, of course!

Its conceivably the worst pillar or policy or guideline or whatever that has ever been created because honestly its a defense for any kind of behaviour you want to exhibit. If I want to be uncivil and flame and attack everyone up and down, hey IAR right? 3RR? I don't agree with those edits, IAR you can't block me. No. It doesn't work that way. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 20:25, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Howdy! I see that you blocked User:Sexyafterdelivery@yahoo.com. I don't see a policy violation, and your block summary says that it's because you feel that it's a "possible bad faith account".

If an account name sets off your alert (but does not violate WP:USERNAME), I urge you to wait until you see an actual bad faith edit before blocking.

<dd>Hm, I don't want to assume bad faith, but I've seen a lot of this. New users creating userpages for nil-edit blocked accounts, and often attributing them as sock puppets of some notorious vandal. In at least one case the user doing the tagging was revealed (by checkuser) to be a serial vandal himself. Personally, I think we need to stop people creating userpages for nil/low-edit accounts. It doesn't seem to serve any purpose, creates unneccessary pages, and draws attention to the vandal. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> 21:42, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As part of WP:DENY that I agree with (I don't agree with seeing random LTA subpages deleted without forethought, especially certain ones), but they've been doing this for awhile, and seem to be quite decisive at knowing that certain accounts are certain vandals identities. For this, I think there's a small group of them organized from somewhere trying to see who can create the most offensive/annoying accounts to be blocked as possible. Their tagging should be considered part of the vandalism. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Breitenstein_8775.html" title="User:Kevin Breitenstein">Kevin_b_er</a> 01:43, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello this users page <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShortJason_653f.html" title="User:ShortJason">User:ShortJason</a> is calling for Drini to be desysoped.

<dd>I'm not convinced the page constituted a personal attack. If the user had made the comment at ANI for instence or filed an RfC we would have little objection to the wording. It isn't clear to me why it should therefore be considered a personal attack when it is on his user page. Saying an admin made a mistake is not a personal attack, nor is saying that the admin should be desysoped for the mistake a personal attack by itself. I think the user is wrong and not focusing on the encyclopedia, but that doesn't mean his page needs to be removed. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 21:24, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, but creating a userbox saying "This user supports the removal of Drini" is certainly a personal attack.

<dd>Don't need any. If a user's first edit is vandalism of a userpage, and is also an edit through an open proxy, there's two reasons for immediate indefinite block.

<dl>
<dd>Antandrus is right- either a vandalism-only account <i>or</i> editing thru an open proxy is bad enough, but both at once is just too much. No problem at all with a block-on-sight for that. However it's also worth noting as above that calling for the removal of admin is not a personal attack, it's criticism, and we'd all do well to remember the difference. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 00:04, 2 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, I understand that User:Preserve Policy should have certainly been blocked, but the use of pronouns above ("He's also editing from an open proxy," right after "I asked him to remove the content,") seemed to imply Preserve Policy and ShortJason were one and the same. If that wasn't the implication, I withdraw my concern. And, Friday, couldn't have said it better. Criticism of an admin is not a personal attack, and labeling it so confuses and inflames the discussion. --<a href="../../../n/s/c/User%7ENscheffey_0fe4.html" title="User:Nscheffey"><font color="#000080" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>N</strong></font><font color="#FF0000" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>scheffey</strong></font></a><sup>(<a href="../../../n/s/c/User_talk%7ENscheffey_d4cb.html" title="User talk:Nscheffey">T</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nscheffey_b4d7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nscheffey">C</a>)</sup> 00:20, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'll agree with those who have noted that calling for an admin's desysopping is not – in and of itself – a personal attack, nor is the simple request or desire blockworthy. However, the <i>manner</i> in which it is done is <i>very</i> important. The <i>right</i> way is to employ some or all of the steps at <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">WP:DR</a>, remaining calm civil at all times. Approaching the admin first is important, as is discussing the matter in an appropriate forum (RfC or WP:AN/I) if polite one-to-one conversation fails. If those steps fail to resolve the issue, Arbitration is typically the last step.</dd>
<dd>Note that <i>none</i> of those steps involve the creation of a let's-rassle-up-a-posse-and-string-'em-up userbox. Recruiting a lynch mob is <i>never</i> an acceptable method of dispute resolution, and is blockworthy as eminently disruptive behaviour that runs counter to our goals here. That the editor has started creating sockpuppets and editing from open proxies to continue his crusade adds weight and merit to the initial decision to block. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 01:48, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Agree.

<dd>With some reluctance, I've protected the page. I'm not going to leave it like that forever, but you guys really need to sort it out on the talk page rather than moving the page back and forth ... so you're stuck with it as I found it until the dispute calms down a bit. If someone wants to re-open the debate, do it there on the talk page. Although I simply protected the version I found, rather than deciding what I think is the "right" version, this one does seem to have most support at the moment. Those wanting something different really should try to persuade others rather than reverting and conveying their reasons in edit summaries, as has been happening. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 07:00, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It appears to me that the discussion (started on August 12) was closed on August 18 by a non-sysop, who then proceded to do a cut-and-paste move to Kitty Pryde. This was reverted, and the page was not properly moved until August 27, where it was reverted; and then for the recent move page war on September 1 and September 2. <a href="../../../h/b/d/User%7EHbdragon88_4994.html" title="User:Hbdragon88">Hbdragon88</a> 07:42, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This user left some defamatory comments on my talk page a few days ago in Spanish, basically calling me a liar. At the time I decided against issueing a {{npa2}} warning and just replied to him in the same language, trying to make him realise that I do not tolerate personal attacks, though assuming good faith and using a conciliatory tone. Today he proceeded to revert my comments, using the edit summary <i>"Wanker thinks he's clever"</i>. I dropped an npa2 this time. He then proceeded to revert this, with another even more offensive edit summary: <i>Cabron</i> (meaning <i><a href="../../../c/u/c/Cuckold.html" title="Cuckold">cuckold</a></i> in Spanish), for which I left an {{npa3}} this time. He again reverted calling me a <i>"mariquita sensible"</i> (<i>sensitive homosexual</i>, which funnily enough I'm neither of them). I am currently involved giving statement of evidence on an <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_1b83.html#Kosovo" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration">Arbitration process</a> on the behaviour of this and other users. Given the current situation (with the arbitration process ongoing), I am not sure of the steps that should be taken (though this is the fourth insult in a row, each one more offensive than the previous one). I am certainly not prepared to give him a blank cheque just because the RFA. I guess he thinks he can shield himself behind the use of a foreign language.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive132_a963.html" title="Edit section: User:Ultramarine and use of images to disrupt talk pages">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltramarine_4c33.html" title="User:Ultramarine">User:Ultramarine</a> and use of images to disrupt talk pages</span></h2>
<p>On many talk pages, both article, user and administrative, Ultramarine frequently violates <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> by inserting so many large images as to disrupt discussion. In many case, she will insert the same image many times in the same discussion, essentially accompanying each new post by another copy of the same image. The images she inserts are ones of nominal connection to the talk page topic, although in most cases the connection is <i>extremely tenuous</i>. But it's not the sort of thing of inserting obscene or offensive pictures: usually it's charts and graphs which she perceives to somehow be relevant to some point she wishes to make.</p>
<p>For example, on <a href="../../../c/a/p/Talk%7ECapitalism_cb90.html" title="Talk:Capitalism">Talk:Capitalism</a>, Ultramarine has advocated inclusion of a certain chart she personally created on "GDP growth over 2000 years" which she (but no other editor) wishes to include in the corresponding article. The chart itself is both original research and non-relevant to the article; but it is <i>just barely</i> related enough that proposing inclusion is a sensible topic of discussion. But when she fails to win any support for inclusion of her chart from adding many copies of the same chart, she starts adding other <i>completely irrelevant</i> ones, purportedly in some effort to show something about "the nature of charts" or something. But it makes the talk page look like a grafitti wall. It's not actually the worst example, but look at this version of the talk page: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Capitalism&amp;oldid=72639306" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Capitalism&amp;oldid=72639306" rel="nofollow">[116]</a></p>
<p>Besides <i>three copies</i> of the GDP chart, it also has one on "carbon emmissions", one on "population growth" and one on "glacier retreat", each less relevant than the last. I have tried to address this by converting the excessive and distracting use of images by converting them to {{linkimage}} templates or escaped [[:Image:Foobar.png]] links (never deleting caption content, even where also repetivite). I have also patiently explained many times why this creates less disruption of talk pages; e.g. at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ACapitalism&amp;diff=72648177&amp;oldid=72647900" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ACapitalism&amp;diff=72648177&amp;oldid=72647900" rel="nofollow">[117]</a>. Ultramarine always reverts these condensations and/or just inserts even more charts.</p>
<p>Moreover, after she fails to win support for inclusion of her repeated charts in the article, she spills over inserting it to completely unrelated pages. For example, on the talk page of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> she also inserted multiple copies of the same GDP chart, I suppose under the thought that if editors saw it enough times they would start believing it was not original research. Lessee, it's a little hard to sort out that high-volume page and the various partial archiving, but look at <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia_talk%7ENo_original_research_Primary_v._secondary_sources_discussion_f34f.html" title="Wikipedia talk:No original research/Primary v. secondary sources discussion">Wikipedia talk:No original research/Primary v. secondary sources discussion</a>. That's an archive of the discussion thread where a couple copies of Ultramarine's GDP chart is randomly inserted.</p>
<p>It is not just this one article topic, or this one run of charts that is the problem. Just about everwhere I've seen Ultramarine edit she does exactly the same thing of littering talk pages with images in an effort to "shout louder" than other editors. This is one of her editing habits that makes it almost impossible to productively edit any page she goes near. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkgreen">LotLE</font></a>×<a href="../../../l/u/l/User_talk%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_7fd3.html" title="User talk:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkred" size="-2">talk</font></a> 17:24, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It looks like that article is Ultramarine's recent pet project, and a bit POV-ish in tone. But I don't have any special concern about that article existing.

<p>Editing the talk page comments of others is not allowed. The above seems to be a deliberately misleading description of the current situation by giving diffs that are several days old.

<dd>Editing is allowed in limited instances. Removing personal attacks, identifying information about another user, etc are all acceptable reasons to edit anothers messages. If someone is posting unusually large images in a discussion, this would be a reason to thumb them if they're relevant, but not outright remove them. If you were discussing the ancient egyptians and slapped a ford truck on the talk page I'd also see it as relevant to remove it. In this case the images do appear to be thumbnail size, unless I'm looking at the wrong version of the page. However, talk pages are usually not collections of images, and when an image is done being discussed (there is no real reason to have it on the talk page anywhere, you can use a&#160;: link to refer people to it for consideration) they should be removed.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 20:45, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can't say that her edits have been wise... but is an indefinite block really appropriate? Based on the user's contribution history, she seems interested in a) decreasing the Myspace-ness of the Wiki (using a few measures that have been proposed by others, a few not) and b) increasing Wikipedia's coverage of sexuality, particularly borderline practices. For that matter, the behavior you've mentioned hardly seems to come close to <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBLOCK_89b0.html" title="WP:BLOCK">WP:BLOCK</a>'s description of disruption, and an indefinite block of a user with a couple hundred edits (many of which have been productive) without a community ban is highly irregular. As an admin of long standing, you've earned community trust... but is there something that I'm not seeing here?

<dd>I'd like to clarify something - I think the editor was in the wrong with her proposal, and I think she was a little haughty and arrogant. But I don't feel that haughtiness and arrogance merit a complete and unilateral ban from the community. I think it might be helpful to talk to the user in question, warn her to spend more time in the community before making policy proposals - a very brief block to cool things off, if there was considerable disruption, I think might have been appropriate. She clearly has a lot to learn about Wikipedia policies. But, barring information that El_C has that I don't, I have to question the proportionality of the response. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 08:49, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>While I have tried to mentor the above user, I feel that El C's block is pretty much in order. There were things that El C explained to me, via email, that gave me enough reason to believe the block was just. Sure, I tried to help Courtney out and gave her pointers and all of that stuff. But even with my advice, she is doing this, so I am not sure if in the long run if she will be a good contributor or I will be burned at the stake at some random RFAr. However, if this user is unblocked, I would still like to mentor her, but I need something with teeth, because I can admit that Courtney is a wild gal, I just need something to tame her. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">User:Zscout370</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Return Fire)</a></sup></small> 08:52, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Okay... I think there's something to be said for trust and respecting the long history of established admins in this matter. Perhaps ArbCom would be willing to place a temporary injunction on her, enjoining her not to make policy proposals until they can review her case? That way she can continue to edit while they consider her case. Alternatively, if she's willing to accept mediation, perhaps she could be talked into accepting that sort of remedy voluntarily. Maybe these ideas are farfetched... I just think that there might be ways to handle this situation that don't end in a block. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 08:59, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>Oh, and by the way, real pictures are highly controversial. Even <i>drawings</i> of anal sex and other sexual poses have been somewhat contentious; real photos would be even more controversial.

<p>I am so glad someone's had the initiative to indef block this blatant troll. A few hours ago I went through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Courtney_Akins" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Courtney_Akins" rel="nofollow">all of this user's edits</a>, and it was unmistakable. This is not a novice. This person knows their way round all the nooks and crannies of wikipedia. Within the first two days they had not only created their first article on "Throat gaggers" oral sex porn film, but had <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/Throat_Gaggers" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/Throat_Gaggers" rel="nofollow">proposed it as a featured article</a>, describing it as a work of "pure genius". That is just such a wind-up. Then as a new user in their first two days they put up a bit of Florida for AfD.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Fairlawn%2C_Florida" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Fairlawn%2C_Florida" rel="nofollow">[126]</a>. Also in this meteoric career, also in the first two days, they found their way to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2006_August_10&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=69335982" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2006_August_10&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=69335982" rel="nofollow">Categories for deletion on the Rouge Admins template</a>.

<dd>I looked at some of the poster's track record, and I can see why someone might conclude that she is mainly here to <strike>take the piss</strike> engage in satire and merry japes. That said, she still has a way to go before it's a question of community patience being exhausted.

<dd>How exactly do you explain that this so-called newbie finds "her" way around with a competence that takes most people weeks or months to develop, and yet, despite this obvious sophistication, manages to come out with actions that use all the right words to purport to help wikipedia and yet are all perfectly inappropriate. I've looked at every one of the edits. I suggest you do the same. It's actually highly amusing, but I don't think wikipedia's purpose is to cater for that kind of amusement. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 09:40, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And if her edits continue to be mainly attempts (some moderately amusing, some not) at satirising Wikipedia, with attendant disruption, I'll probably support an indefinite block "next time".

<dd>I don't take offence at Courtney bringing me into this conversation, although she slightly misrepresented me, but personally I have felt that she was on a road to inevitable blocking from the first posts I saw of her. I think she is a troll, I think she is probably a sock (I have some opinions of who but won't smear anyone), and while I don't have an opinion on a permanent block I think she'll eventually get one, one way or another. A third of her edits are great, a third are blatant - at the very least useless to the project and at worst inappropriate - attention-seeking, and a third are subtle trolling. In my interactions with her I AGF, but my <i>opinion</i> is that s/he's like a kid who shoots spit balls at the teacher when her back is turned, then sits there with an innocent smile the rest of the time. <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnchoress_3b7f.html" title="User:Anchoress">Anchoress</a> 09:50, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't have time to read every single diff, but I looked at a few more, and it just confirms what a few of us have been saying: this user's career here is an elaborate piss-take. There may be some genuinely helpful edits somewhere, but if so they are hard to find.</dd>
<dd>I dunno. She's wasting a lot of our time, even if some of it is funny once you understand what she's up to. I suppose it's a question of whether there is any admin who is prepared to tell her that we got the joke and we'd now like to give her a chance to edit seriously. I'm not going to be that admin. Maybe someone else is more soft-hearted. If anyone does give her a second chance, I for one will watch her. If no one does, I guess that's the definition of a community ban.

<dd>I'm not sure I support an indef ban as the very first ban, for a user with a record, if that record includes productive edits. I'm inclined to agree with MM3K about the career so far but I do think someone ought to tell this user "we get the joke and here's your chance to edit seriously". So I'd give this user a second chance and watch carefully. I'm not seeing consensus either way yet though, and I'd like to hear from El C before I overturned his block, as I REALLY don't like to overturn other people's blocks. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 12:54, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Can't say I support the block. Based on looking at a few diffs, the user seems naive (e.g. lack of appreciation of copyright), but not dangerous. I also hope we're not blocking people just because they offer to upload pictures of anal sex. If we prefer to stick with illustrations of sexual techniques as opposed to photographs (I've no opinion on this), we can tell the user this rather than blocking them outright. - <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamsara_87dc.html" title="User:Samsara">Samsara</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamsara_83cc.html" title="User talk:Samsara">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Samsara_6f94.html" title="Special:Contributions/Samsara">contribs</a>) 16:37, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Courtney doesn't seem to be an overly disruptive user to begin with. Considering this is her <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Courtney_Akins" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Courtney_Akins" rel="nofollow">first block ever</a> and she was blocked for disrupton, seems a little suspicious. I think she would need to be <b>mentored</b> for Wikipedia civility, if anything. Her message above was inappropriate, yes, but blockworthy, maybe not so much. I would have tried to talk to the user about her actions, and block (for maybe 48 hours) if she continued to be disruptive, but indefblocked.. never.. for the above message. I don't know if her block was very justified in the sense of disruption, because no warnings were ever used and there doesn't seem to be many comments on her talk page about her conduct prior to her block. — <span style="font-family:Edwardian Script ITC"><font color="#00FF00">The Future</font></span> 16:56, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've done the look-at-every diff thing. Somebody said a third of her edits are great; they aren't. Of her edits, I counted six which seemed OK, and only one, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Human_experimentation&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=69331469" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Human_experimentation&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=69331469" rel="nofollow">this human experimentation business</a> she agitated about on AN/I, which truly helped the encyclopedia. My <i>opinion</i> is that Courtney couldn't troll us any harder if she had came back in time from the future with a cybernetic trolling machine with which to troll us. She's completely disruptive, but in a slow, methodical way that has been shy of producing any blocks. Should she be indefed? Sigh, I guess not. I suggest reducing the block to a week and letting this episode stand as a warning. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 17:54, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have no doubt that the sole purpose of this account is disruption, and I commend <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> for acting on that basis. However, it was a <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">BOLD</a> move and he has properly posted it here for discussion. Some other users have raised various doubts and opinion is divided. I think it is right to make sure that people are happy with admin actions. One objection is that a warning was not given for what could be seen as naivete, rather than deliberateness. I propose that this block to date should serve as that warning, and now be lifted. It is not going to do a great deal of harm now that Courtney Atkins is going to be closely watched. It won't take long to confirm things one way or the other, and it should at the very least provide some amusement. Has there ever previously been an article simultaneously a <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_article_candidates_Throat_Gaggers_0a87.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Throat Gaggers">Featured Article Candidate</a> and an <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Throat_Gaggers_219a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Throat Gaggers">Article for Deletion</a>, I wonder? I propose also that any user should feel free to revert any action by Courtney Atkins, if they feel it is not appropriate, provided they leave an explanation on Courtney Atkins' talk page as to why they have done so, for educational purposes. Also, bearing in mind the pranks, we should not allow the uploading of any photos, unless it can be proved that these are the copyright of Courtney Atkins. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 20:03, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Maybe I'm an outlier here, but when I contrast this user with other "exhausted our patience" users, I'm just not seeing that we're anywhere near that point yet. I think you guys know I think of myself as firm and intolerant of trolling (some of which I do definitely see here) but I'm not seeing the exhausted part yet. I expect typically to see a larger history here, or somewhere else, before I get to "exhausted my patience" state. You can count on me to mentor this user and if it's not working out, block, and block hard. But if the community doesn't agree, that's fine too. I'd like to get to a conclusion though, if possible.

<p>After hearing from El C that he has no objections, I have unblocked this user. See: <a href="../../../c/o/u/User_talk%7ECourtney_Akins_01ec.html#Unblocked" title="User talk:Courtney Akins">User_talk:Courtney_Akins#Unblocked</a>. What I would ask from the rest of you is twofold, give me the space to mentor this user and see if they can reform and fly right... don't expect me to jump on every little thing. But on the other hand, DO please bring things to my attention, issues, advice, anything you feel I need to know. My email and talk are always open to my fellow admins.

<p>Catching the tail end of this on returning from a break, I just want to protest the notion that an account needs to "exhaust the community's patience" before they can be blocked indefinitely. El C clearly didn't place an "exhausted patience" block but an "all edits trolling" block. Such blocks can with perfect appropriateness be set on an account's first day. Why ever not? We <i>frequently</i> invoke "All edits vandalism" as a reason for pretty much immediate indefinite blocks; is there a significant difference between that and this? No. Not even if the editor was savvy enough to technically make one or two non-trolling edits just to spike our guns. Lar's wasting his time, but it's his choice. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 12:09, 28 August 2006 (UTC).</p>

It's just that it was asserted (or felt to me like it was asserted) that this one had, and I'm not sure that's the case, as it hasn't yet exhausted mine and I think I'm part of the community (right? er, maybe don't answer that?&#160;:) ). Note also that I didn't unilaterally lift, I got El C's concurrance first... I could well be wasting my time, who knows, we shall see. (something you've suspected me of doing in the past in other contexts, mind you) Or maybe I have other motives, as I did those other times you thought I was wasting my time. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 12:40, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The fact that the debate you are referring to was posted in German and carried over onto the English Wikipedia was not by my choosing. If you wish to criticise the translation I provided, I invited everyone to do so when the discussion was still happening. I note that you chose not to do so.

<dd>Differential treatment for "I am an 18 year old hottie who wants you to see her body" accounts is a laughable constant on the Internet. You would think that Wikipedia would have enough folks with sufficient experience, or at least a sufficient number of "disinterested" people, to not fall for it. Courtny was one such. Publicgirluk may not have been. I did some research, and there is an <i>account name</i> by that handle very active in sex sites in the UK, but that doesn't confirm anything. Tojo was a troll who announced as much with his account name and then demonstrated it amply with his edits.

<dd>Guys, let's think about this one for a few seconds. Not to sound evil or anything, but what are the chances that this user is 6? I have members of my kin older than that and members that are adults but are afraid of editing Wikipedia and are unsure about it.

<dd>This seems like as good as time as any to trot out my perennial complaint that <a href="../../../c/h/i/WP%7ECHILD_ae87.html" title="WP:CHILD">WP:CHILD</a>'s directives are far too tame: I don't think underage persons should be allowed to edit Wikipedia at all. That's largely unenforceable, of course, but at least Wikipedia can point to that policy and say, at least in principle, kids aren't allowed here. We don't really need the editorial input of children anyway, do we? Not only is it a sane public-image policy (in these times more than ever), but it's good for the quality of the encyclopedia. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 00:41, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'd like to contribute to this discussion if I may. This individual would not be the only young editor on WP. My daughter is also an editor, and she is 7. This was her own idea after reading a book that she liked and asking me to look it up to see if it was on WP (she sees me editing WP frequently). She is well-versed in not revealing personal information, due to an online game at some kid's site (Disney or something like it) that she has been playing for years. She started using a computer when she was 2 - logging herself in on my Linux system and using Netscape/Mozilla to visit a selection of kids sites I put on the menu bar. When I switched her to a Mac before she could read, she complained that it was harder to use as several things like logging out had to be done on menus which assume the user could read&#160;:-) In any case, she has agreed only to edit WP with supervision, and I've helped her with a bit of wording and use of a template, but basicly the article <a href="../../../a/_/m/A_Moose_for_Jessica_25fa.html" title="A Moose for Jessica">A Moose for Jessica</a> is her work. —<a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHanuman_Das_3020.html" title="User:Hanuman Das">Hanuman Das</a> 01:31, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>COPPA does address this. If the user provides personal information even if we don't ask for it, we need parental permission. I.e. if a user identifies as 6 years old and the email user function works, then we've collected personal informaiton and we know it. Last I read COPPA e-mail addresses are considered personal information. The moment the user provides any possible remotely identifying information they should be blocked for 7 years (until they'd turn 13).--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 20:30, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Technically COPPA is irrelevant since its terms explicitly apply only to websites operated for commercial purposes. However, I would agree that in many ways COPPA generally defines a good set of practices. I would support deleting any personal information provided by someone who self-identifies as under 13. I don't generally support blocking though, unless the user is being otherwise disruptive. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 21:08, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Giano opposes Carnildo's RfA (which I have no interest in) and harasses Lar for his support of Carnildo, then starts personal attacks against said user. I warn him for civility problems, he takes it personally, and continues, implying that I had no authority or reason to block him (even though I pointed out the civility concerns). I've blocked him for 48 hours in the sincere hope that he'll cool down and start reacting civilly in the future.

<dd>Fun, no. I did unblock, since the situation was, in my opinion, cooling down (I have been following it all too closely and if I had a stress meter it would be way up there) and this block was (and in all honestly still is) likely to reverse that. It is not policy to block as punishment for incivilty or not assuming good faith; blocks should be for preventing (further) disruption and I neither believe Giano's invective has risen to disruptive levels in the first place nor that this block was going to prevent more of the same. However, I am generally friendly with Giano, and thus admit I may be vulnerable to some bias here and will bite my lip and be quiet if anybody says I was wrong to unblock and overturns me. I am going to sleep now. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 05:02, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You've done the unblock, so I'm done with the situation. I don't block as punishment, since last I checked that wasn't policy (except possibly in the case of 3RR, where to me it seems that's part of the reason they made policy as such, not that I agree with it) and I am loathe to "punish" someone when admins are just "users with more buttons" anyway. Anyway, with the large number of attacks ongoing between my warning to Giano and when I logged back in, I felt the situation was escalating out of control. Again, I don't know Giano, Carnildo, you (nice to meet you, though!) and Lar only vaguely. As you've said you're friendly with Giano, I'd greatly appreciate it if you'd keep an eye on the situation and do as needed: My hope was mostly to give Giano some cool-down time so he wouldn't spend it attacking others instead of being productive.

<dd>I believe that Carnildo seriously wronged Giano and has never shown any contrition about it. Partly for that reason, I have opposed Carnildo's RFA. I strongly support the idea that something should be done to remove the damaging note placed by Carnildo in Giano's block log. That, however, does not give Giano a licence to address Lar, in particular, in the way he did (see the exchange on Lar's talk page). It went way beyond ordinary incivility into quite ugly attacks of a personal nature. A 48-hour block for that was entirely justified in my opinion. I fully support Kylu's action, and believe that this block by Kylu should <b>not</b> have been lifted, especially by someone who admits to being "friendly" with the person blocked. Lifting blocks in these circumstances sends the wrong message about what kind of behaviour is acceptable here. We should <b>support</b>, not undermine, fellow admins who are prepared to impose blocks for such behaviour. If the blocking policy is thought not to cover it, the blocking policy needs to be updated to reflect the reality that such conduct is unacceptable. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 09:37, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If we can quell this user's breaches of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">the civility policy</a>, I think that personal attacks like this would stop. Anyone who disagrees with my judgement of <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_dc9f.html" title="User:Giano">Giano</a>'s comment on Kylu's talk page, please discuss it here.

<dd>I am not sure that Giano's comments warranted a block.

<dd>With respect, the wheel warring problem was <i>undoing other admins (including undoing Jimbo, if I recall correctly) without discussion</i>. That's wheel warring.

<dd>The basic problem was trigger-happy use of admin powers, and this was borne out by the ArbCom judgement on the case. As I say, I am with Bunchofgrapes and think Kylu's block was borderline in policy and probably a bad idea in the circumstances. Handing out blocks to other users-in-good-faith because they are misbehaving somewhat is not what admins are here to do. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Land_1a6c.html" title="User:The Land">The Land</a> 11:30, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This limited-term block for egregiously insulting behaviour toward Lar and other respected users is not in any way analogous to the ... let's all agree ... outrageous indefinite blocks that were imposed by Carnildo and led to his desysopping. Being a good-faith user is not a licence to attack others. Repeated misbehaviour should have consequences, not as punishment but as a deterrent to further such misbehaviour.</dd>
<dd>Really, Kylu's decisive but relatively conservative action should have been supported, or even commended, by the rest of us. I've never encountered Kylu before, but from what I've seen here I have confidence in her. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 11:39, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd><a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBLOCK_89b0.html" title="WP:BLOCK">WP:BLOCK</a> does not state that users who misbehave should be blocked, nor users who are incivil. The proper procedure for drawing attention to these problems is raising discussion on ANI or alternatively opening an RFC. That is why blocking Giano in the circumstances was a borderline decision (though I can see the logic to it). I am also very unimpressed with people using formalistic language (e.g. 'User blocked' in comments directed at the blocked person) and by people saying they have 'given out' standard warning templates to established users. None of that is in the spirit of the community. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Land_1a6c.html" title="User:The Land">The Land</a> 11:54, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The written policy is too soft on incivility, IMHO, and I am not at all sure that it reflects actual good practice. Written policy follows good practice (such as we saw here from Kylu), not the other way around. There should be consequences to gross misbehaviour. Be that as it may, as has been said before, this went far beyond a one-off insult or sarcastic remark in the heat of the moment to ugly, gratuitous, premeditated, and repeated personal attacks. Giano arrived at Lar's talk page unannounced to insult him. That is clearly disruptive. I am very surprised and disappointed to see admins effectively condoning Giano's quite outrageous behaviour - there is now no incentive for him to stop it or desist in future - and undermining sound admin action by Kylu. It is quite obvious from the above discussion that there would have been no consensus to overturn the block if it had been discussed here first. Again, I believe Kylu should be commended for firm but relatively conservative action. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 12:42, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Finding this thread here is no surprise to me. In my conversations with Giano yesterday I got the impression that he wanted to keep a controversy going and wanted to push the envelope to see how far he could go. His <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Kylu&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=72897673" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Kylu&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=72897673" rel="nofollow">edit</a> to as user who had last conversed with him a full 20 hours earlier, is the clearest indication of this to me (why wait so long unless you need a new sparring partner?). I think much can be learned by how someone reacts when they are blocked. Do they ask for an unblock and apologize, or do they go on a personal attack spree? Even if one believes that 48 hours is too long, I think it would have been better to let Giano to have the first opportunity to request the unblock (he was offline the whole time), and proceed based on how he behaves when he does. <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_Signature12_b3bf.html" title="User:NoSeptember/Signature12"><font color="green"><b>NoSeptember</b></font></a> 12:48, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think I've tried my best to be unfaliling civil in this whole affair (feedback welcome), even soliciting further input after others warned Giano, but I do think he crossed the line. I did not ask anyone to block, I was just going to let him go on. That said, I am not sure I agree that unblocking him without discussion here first and also without an unblock request by him was the best approach. Needless to say, despite the fact that this might well earn me undying emnity from Giano (which point I think bears noting as something that's inappropriate) I support this block. But of course, I'm biased (and naiive, stupid, a fool, incompetent and devious as well, apparently, according to Giano). ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 13:04, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I should remind all involved that Lar and Giano have interacted amicably for a long time. Further, WP:NPA is only a policy that says, "Be nice." There are no sanctions adherent. The point is that one of the things that Giano has been irritated about, if I may be so bold, is the way that people have been tossing out blocks and such for "not nice" and "I don't like that." The block is, to some degree, gasoline on a fire. Speaking for myself, I think a lot more talking folks down is necessary and a lot less blocking of well-established folks for getting angry. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:05, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I love Geogre like clotted cream loves scones, but I'm disturbed by this growing trend to treat Wikipedia as a tea party where we are supposed to pretend to have not heard when someone has acted like a complete prat, as Giano has in this case. A <i>brief</i> block for a cooling-off period is not only good for the encyclopedia, but good for the user, as it's letting them know where the boundaries are. My only criticism of the block in this case is that 2 days was, in my opinion, too long. But a few hours would have sent the message and given Giano a chance to reconsider his prattish behavior. I know we all want to be nice guys, mes amis, but it's truly OK to send someone outside of the room if they're throwing a temper tantrum.

I just thought 48 hr was long for cooling. 3 hr might do, but...look, what I wanted to wag my finger over wasn't any of that, and certainly not the fine point of what's cooling and what simmering. I just wanted to warn folks about incivility blocks with well established users. It's a tough and thick soup we ... drink or something... when we get into that.

<dd>The corollary being <i>well-established editors should know when to step back from posting when they are angry</i>. I understand Giano's anger, but if he cannot discuss matters without calling someone (who themselves is a well-established editor) the laundry list of slights he threw at Lar then he is being disruptive. I wouldn't have blocked for it personally, <s>and I certainly wouldn't have unblocked without discussing it with Kylu (another well-established editor)</s>. <a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 13:18, 31 August 2006 (UTC) <small>note this was intended as a reply to geogre, but the vagaries of edit conflicts made it appear far below <a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a></small></dd>

<p>To Geogre: (3x edit conflict!) We <i>used</i> to interact amicably. I would not characterise his interaction with me in this affair as "amicable" but the shoe is entirely on his foot I feel, as I have, in my view, remained civil and open to input (feedback welcome). I'm happy to forgive and forget though, if he returns to being amicable and stops behaving in a manner that I feel is incivil and uncalled for. Forgiveness is something that we could use more of around here. Giano's anger is based on his being wronged, the wrongee not apologising or showing any acknowledgement of wrongness and Giano's subsequent inability (justified or not) to forgive. Forgiveness even when you don't get an apology might be a good thing sometimes instead of holding grudges. My expectation here, unfortunately, is that Giano will add me to the list of those he holds grudges against, which is really too bad. Also I think there was a lot of trying to talk Giano down from several admins (and myself) before he got this block. I note his friends were notably absent in trying to talk him down though.

<dd>Hi, Captain Obvious here again with some perspective. We are involved in a rather radioactive Rfa now featuring a highly controversial candidate. A certain level of sparks should be expected and allowed for. Moreover, Giano was one of the main principles WRONGED by said candidate. He is entitled to express some anger, even if he wasnt one of the most prolific and best editors on this 'pedia (which to my mind means he is even more entitled to have his mild eccentricities indulged). What I truly find disturbing about this mess is, most of those harassing and threatening Giano, are from the opposite camp in Carnildo's Rfa. It is as if they are trying to bully and intimidate him into withdrawing his opposition and it looks as if they may have finally succeeded:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Carnildo_3&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=73085436" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Carnildo_3&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=73085436" rel="nofollow">[136]</a>. Here's another obvious fact, Kylu, who wasn't even a member of Wikipedia during Carni's last, failed, Rfa, decides to play the politeness police and charge into a situation she knows next to nothing about, pass judgement on my old nemesis and ban him for an excessive time period. In doing so she made an already bad situation, which was already starting to cool off, <b>even worse</b>. She should at the very least get a harsh scolding from the more experienced and (presumably) more fair minded admins. But this is not the case. I'm increasingly appalled by the way admins here mistreat not only new but veteran contributors. Without editors like Giano, Panairjdde, Sam Spade and even Ghirlandajo, this place would be a much bigger joke than it already is. I just spent the last several hours trying to improve one my my friend's articles...opppsie I meant one of the PROJECT's articles. I did so out of friendship, to keep a promise I made and because I believe that the Wiki (sub) project of which we are both members is one of the few things left here which still works and is worthwhile. I did not do it because I believe that I'm contributing to some bold new experiment in human knowledge nor to help make "Jimbo's dream" a reality. And I certainly did not do it because I still believe this is an enjoyable and encouraging environment in which to work or even to visit anymore. Especially when those who have little to do with actually BUILDING this place take such an active role in harassing, threatening and discouraging those few who still do. So much for making "the internet not suck". The "revolution" is dead...and this glorious, bold new experiment has become just another shitty website. I would be surprised if after the way he has been mistreated, Giano ever again contributes here in any meaningful way. Niz job gang. Admins need to see beyond the heat of the moment and take a user's contribution history and edit count into account, before they start handing down threats and disproportionate punishments, like circus clowns doling out cotton candy and balloons.--<a href="../../../r/2E/d/User%7ER.D.H._%28Ghost_In_The_Machine%29_1bea.html" title="User:R.D.H.

<dd>Hiya! Just to clarify a couple points: I actually invited Bunchofgrapes to unblock if he felt it appropriate, so no wheel warring, and I certainly don't have any problems with the action. While I appreciate RDH's concern in the matter, I'm not sure I agree that just because one has a high edit count and numerous contributions, that they're immune from following policy like other users. That's a slope ripe for abuse, in my opinion. If it much matters, I <i>did</i> consult other admins on IRC before issuing the block, though as I'm the one responsible for the action, I'll not mention them by name.

It seems to me that everyone has staked out a position, and we've all established that Giano is very upset, that Lar is affronted, that several people feel that the comments are too hot, one way or the other.

<dd>To Geogre: Do you suggest we ignore comments he posts here too? Should we create a special class of user who is permitted to say whatever they want while we pretend not to see it? How do I sign up for this special right to abuse anyone I want without consequences? And if some people leave WP because nothing is done about the abuse they must endure, should we just say "Tough luck, sorry it happened"?

<dd>Kylu, you <i>didn't</i> screw up earlier, and you still have my full confidence. Although I don't know you, I am deeply disappointed that <i>you</i> are having to take heat from colleagues who should be supporting you, when you've simply done your job. I still don't know why there is this feeling around among some admins that Giano has to be treated with kid gloves. His behaviour is unacceptable. He has responded badly to advice, warnings, and your totally justified block. Community patience with him should be running out by now - mine certainly is. However, I feel at the moment that my hands are tied by some of the comments above. Giano apparently has a licence to run riot and cause disruption, and there's nothing anyone can do about it. As NoSeptember says, he has become a member of a new class of untouchable users. I'm distressed that this is happening. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 00:24, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>One quiet Sunday evening six months ago, I stumbled on a conversation on this very page - I made two comments here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=38332411" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=38332411" rel="nofollow">[138]</a> and here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=38335373" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=38335373" rel="nofollow">[139]</a> for which I was indefinitely banned by Carnildo. Carnildo still regards this as "Hate Speech". Since the moment he blocked me he has never contacted me publicly or privately. Lar has described Carnildo as "brave" and having "the sort of attitude we need among admins". I have described Lar as a "fool" and variations thereof. For which Kylu attempted to block me for 48 hours. I stand by every word I have said. Now get on a and block me if you want to. I will be happy to be blocked for such an offence. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_dc9f.html" title="User:Giano">Giano</a> | <a href="../../../g/i/a/User_talk%7EGiano_a5ff.html" title="User talk:Giano">talk</a> 00:32, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>in response to these accusation i say that the link that was introduced was relevent to the subject , but due to the hypocracy of some editors and admins the links were removed .... it's plain simple hypocracy (it's like saying&#160;: we are willing to eat bread but we won't eat the cake because on this cake was given as a form of adds)... <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewww_4239.html" title="User:Newww">Newww</a> 18:57, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>sorry i forgot to sign , actually i am not the same person that added the link , but i am a member of the concerned site developping team , and i simply found it pure hypocrisy that my collegue be called spammer for adding a very imformative link, by someone (5ko) that is using anyway possible on wikipedia wikibooks and all the other projects to link to his site , this user under the name of 5ko(he has many other) has hundreds and hundreds of user profiles linking to his personal homepage .</dd>

<pre>
while my collegue (who often removed spam and irrelivant links from wikipedia)
was banned  and was unable to access wikiedia by  his established personal profile 
</pre>
<p>(because his IP was blocked too) just because he insisted on his right on adding this informative link that is more relevant to the subject than many other. further more another collegue (overall admin) tried to contact 5ko and know why is he so focussing on removing the link , so the concerned user (5ko) publicly revealed the message in wikipedia (without any translation ) and the email address of my collegue , i then personally informed my collegue that sent him an email asking him to remove the email , so 5ko simply gave a link and said that the complete information can be found on this link , giving a link to the complete registration information that contain the email of the current admin (and the address of the original domain owner) <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewww_4239.html" title="User:Newww">Newww</a> 16:40, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>1- 5ko has hundreds of user profiles in different languages in wikipedia plus he has also used the same strategy (douzens of profiles in different douzens of languages) in wikibooks ,wikiquotes and every other wikimedia project. this is defenatly a SEO spammer</p>
<p>2- 5ko claims that the documment is SEO driven ,in other words it was made for the whole purpose of being put on wikipedia - my answer : what is the problem with that ? if it is informative and bringing something new there is no harm , if it can helps the average non computer skilled wikipedian then there is no harm in having it. from these 2 points we can sense the hypocrisy of 5ko <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewww_4239.html" title="User:Newww">Newww</a> 17:03, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>3- 5ko is giving a link to the whois information and that is agaisnt the law , the information are public but to be exploited privately.</p>

<p>1) Userpages and pages not in the article space are set to have links no follow so your argument completely fails. 2)As I said before we will not tolerate you spamming us. Especially as your copyright claim on the page is downright bloody offensive to people who actually write wikipedia. 3)What law would that be. Why do you even care if people are encoraged to whois you? What are you trying to hide? I suppose he could delink it though.

<dd>Obvious from your attitude that you consider my friend the spammer and not 5ko</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>1) the first argument was to show you who is the real spammer , wether the no follow tag is used or not ,it is not the subject , the subject is that this 5ko guy is a professional spammer that have been spamming wikiprojects since years , in other words it is a major vandal not like those who add a link or 2 , this guy had added hundreds . it does not concern me , but when he pretends to be honnest and full of virtue he should think twice before commenting as he did ,it is plain hypocisy.</p>
<p>2)again i tell you , i had nothing to do with the link ,it was my collegue , having said so i think the link he provided is more informative than the majority of bull**it links that were on the page , but then it is up to you guys if you prefer that unless links are added by completly neutral editors (and i doubt it).</p>
<p>3)nothing to hide personally , but the email of my collegue is in public plus he already asked the guy to remove it,</p>

</dl>
<p>the 1st letter: sent by my collegue : sir we are noticed that you are focusing on the link we provided on wikipedia and that you are insisting on removing the link , your claim that it may have a relation with seo is true ,but you are forgetting the essence of wikipedia (that is to present usefull , understandable information) and the link that we provided has high informative value, higher than many links.</p>
<p>so when you pretend removing this link because it is a SEO it is dishonest and fishy. sir we have done our job to investigate your link to wikipedia and we were surprised to notice that you are a spammer of the biggest importance ,you have profiles in dozens of languages and in different wikimedia projects with links to your webpage hidden everywhere on wikipedia. (5ko answer here was that his page does not contain ads)</p>
<p>sir we are a team of 12 administrator , eventhough i often insist that they should never spam, many do not listen , but in this particular case the guys have done nothing wrong</p>
<p>i'm not telling you that my admins can behave like you are doing now and report every single spam link you have to administrators but i am telling you that SEO fighting is stupid and not constructive,</p>
<p>i noticed that you are from bulgaria and we do not have any developper for bulgare language , so if you are interesrted send me an email with your competence and CV...</p>
<p>This letter contain no threat , it is friendly and even offering a job .... again 5ko giving misleading infomations.</p>

the 2nd letter: sent by my collegue after i informed him that 5ko is putting his email publicly : Sir i have many other things to do than try to resolve this problem between you and my admins , solve it on your owns between you and them. i was informed sir that you are displaying my email , i inform you sir that such actions are against the law and the rule of wikipedia (such issues have been known to lead to lawsuits)</p>
<p>5ko answer here was to present the whole whois info , adding to the previous infaction, the address of the domain seller and his info.</p>
<p>the problem is that my collegue 0T0 has his user/ip blocked so he can not have access to his main profile either and all this because of a spammer [<a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=&amp;num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=5ko&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_nlo=&amp;as_nhi=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=wikipedia.org&amp;as_rights=&amp;safe=images" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=&amp;num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=5ko&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_nlo=&amp;as_nhi=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=wikipedia.org&amp;as_rights=&amp;safe=images" rel="nofollow">multiface vandal</a> that is being disonest in his arguments <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewww_4239.html" title="User:Newww">Newww</a> 20:13, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not an admin, but I think your action was appropriate. While I think a userbox expressing concern over the German Userbox Solution is appropriate (and I think I would want one for myself), this particular userbox was in poor taste and could be easily construed as an attack on our German friends. EDIT: Thinking about it, I think it might be a good idea to let John Reid know about the deletion and ask him to explain the userbox. It's somewhat troubling and deserves discussion. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 14:15, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>I must point out that it wasn't the swastika, it was the eagle and I've been told it's actually the current German symbol. I unreservedly apologise for that mistake. Nonetheless I have declined to restore the userbox because I consider the phrases "sleepless nights" and "German solutions", plus the aforementioned eagle flag, to be too close in connotation to the "final solution". This doesn't detract from my apology regarding my mistake over German iconography. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 09:18, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It shouldn't have been in template space anyway per <strike>T2 and</strike> GUS, but perhaps the user concerned would be unimpressed by that line of reasoning! If it had just been coded on his own userpage, it might have been a trickier issue. The question in my mind would be whether it was a disreputable box stereotyping Germans as Nazis.

<dd>Diff? If the source cites it in hectares, it would probably be better as: 989 hectares (9.89 square kilometres). Depends on the context. The MoS seems to like SI units, but it also says that the source's units should go first, with conversions after. So yeah, you have a very good point.

<dd>Hectares are a metric unit, albeit from older forms of the metric system and not from the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_System_of_Units_e6f4.html" title="International System of Units">International System of Units</a>. Square kilometres are an <a href="../../../s/i/_/SI_derived_unit_d826.html" title="SI derived unit">SI derived unit</a>, and so are probably preferable in most cases. However where a hectares value has been drawn from a cited source, it ought not to be replaced with the equivalent square metres value, rather both values should be shown. Fact-checkers should not have to do unit conversions in order to verify statements in articles. I would advise Bobblewik to check every change of units to make sure that where a value is cited it is not replaced.</dd>

<dd>Posting incivil, biased vote alerts to multiple user talk pages is not on. There is dissonance between "Some users with a chronic lack of understanding of English moved the page to the ludicrous <i>Prime minister</i>..." and "Be careful however not to <i>tell</i> people how to vote. That is against WP rules." When you tell people that "illiterates" are supporting a "ridiculous" title I'd say that's a pretty strong hint that you'd like them to vote the other way. <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 08:36, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Underage in what sense? the only <a href="../../../a/g/e/WP%7EAGE_3ed9.html" title="WP:AGE">WP:AGE</a> I'm aware of, isn't exactly a serious policy page. The fact that the reference desk is frequently inundated by questions from people who are clearly in either high school or younger, should reinforce this fact. In fact, the very idea that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_censored" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not censored for the protection of minors</a>, relies on the idea that there are in fact minors. Besides. When you say "underage" do you mean a US centric age of consent? UK? EU? How about Canada?--<a href="../../../v/e/c/User%7EVectorPotential_f384.html" title="User:VectorPotential"><b><small>VectorPotential</small></b></a><sup><b>71.247.243.173</b></sup> 11:36, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>That's extremely bizarre! I blocked the account User:Kingbot only recently as it was an old account with hardly any edits, and being used by a human not a bot. I thought the similarity to my own bot account <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingbotk_68c3.html" title="User:Kingbotk">Kingbotk</a> (<a href="../../../k/i/n/User_talk%7EKingbotk_d00a.html" title="User talk:Kingbotk">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kingbotk_e154.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kingbotk">contribs</a>) could present difficulties for that user if they ever come back. I'll see if I can grab the <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingBot_c529.html" title="User:KingBot">User:KingBot</a> account as it seems the young editor in question has their eyes on using that name too. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 11:49, 3 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well, I would assume that even the UK and Canada have a cut off age at ten, especially when this user wants to use a bot and his account is less than a month or so old. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryūlóng</a> 11:52, 3 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>think that it is not mandatory that this info be removed, necessarily, if there is good reason to believe the user isn't actually 7, or if the information looks like it was given voluntarily with parental consent. But, policy or not, if another admin whose judgement I respect removed it, that's good enough for me and I'd prefer not to war about it. In general there just seems to be way too much "but it isn't policy" going around these days. Even for policy wonks like me. I repeat...

<dd>It's a very bad idea to have 7 year olds identifying themselves — for more than one reason.

<dd>There's two immediately obvious reasons. 1) to protect young people from being contacted inappropriately 2) to prevent any very unsavoury media stories. The legal aspect is hardly our remit, unless there are any specialist lawyers here. There's no point in an amateur approach to that.

<dd>Or if we just involved Danny and Brad and let them make a call. But in the meantime, I think prudence is better than asserting "it's not policy".

<dd>It is sometimes better with the Foundation's status as the "Carrier", if they're not involved. I'm sure they will be, if they want to be. A simple exercise of due diligence for us is to not allow age identification of under-16s (which was the cause of a recent debacle). This should be stated on the new user/log in page. If necessary young users may be required to change to a new user name, something which should be explained kindly to them. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 17:33, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is this person's User name their full name?

<dd>It isn't their full name, but it does include their last name. Though he isn't claiming underage-ness now since the age was removed, certainly its easy to find due to this thread. A username change is probably in order, however I'm not sure how to go about it in this case. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 18:47, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A note should be placed on the user's talk page, explaining the community's concern. Presumably this might be seen by the user's parent or whoever is assisting with the editing (I respect our younger Wikipedians but I assume a 7 y/o is having some assistance). I would draft the note myself but I'm not familiar with the protocol for name changes, etc. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 19:19, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
