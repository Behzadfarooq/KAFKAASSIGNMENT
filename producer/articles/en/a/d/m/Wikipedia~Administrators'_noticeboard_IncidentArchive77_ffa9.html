<dd>I'd like to inquire how, precisely, adding to a talk page is vandalism of any sort? Disruption, perhaps, but certainly not intentional.</dd>
<dd>As for "false accusations of anti-semitic allegations", I'm curious what, precisely, "Here he accuses all jewish people who hold to religious customs of child abuse" is supposed to be other than an allegation of anti-semitism. (The location of said text is in that "summarization of the purpose of RfC", so I won't bother relinking it).</dd>
<dd>As for the claim that it's "not about Midgley's behaviour", I'm curious what [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAnti-vaccinationists&amp;diff=40498877&amp;oldid=40462634|this" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAnti-vaccinationists&amp;diff=40498877&amp;oldid=40462634|this" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>] is supposed to have to do with the topic, then. <a href="../../../t/h/s/User%7EThsgrn_05b9.html" title="User:Thsgrn">Michael Ralston</a> 07:01, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I do believe I have the right to defend myself against your accusations, 86.10.231.219.

<dd>No, I am arguing that you repeatedly link to the diff in which you declare Midgley to be anti-semitic, and declare that diff is what the RfC is about; therefore, <b>you</b> are claiming that Midgley's behaviour is part of the RfC. If you were not claiming this, as I have pointed out, you would present a diff or a new post that does not mention Midgley, or at <b>least</b> does not mention Midgley in reference to religious beliefs.

<dd><s>Looking into it now.</s> Ok. First of all, to an outsider this looks like a total mess. Here are a few recommendations based on a first (and possibly wrong) impression:
<ul>
<li>86.10.231.219 (<a href="../../../8/6/2E/User_talk%7E86.10.231.219.html" title="User talk:86.10.231.219">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.10.231.219_17ac.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.10.231.219">contribs</a>) a.k.a. "The Invisible Anon" is strongly encouraged to register a username. Anons don't "own" their user pages and talk pages the way registered users do. The notice on top of 86.10.231.219's talk page ("Attention: The Invisible Anon's Talk Page") is inappropriate. If you want your own talk page, register an account. I believe you can still claim your anonymous edits later.</li>
<li>Nominating 86.10.231.219's talk page for deletion was not a good idea. If the talk page is used in violation of Wikipedia policy (this is a hypothetical; I haven't looked into this), please bring it to the attention of an admin. Since anons don't "own" their talk pages, stricter standards apply than for registered users. However, registered users are also bound by <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUser_page_1e96.html" title="Wikipedia:User page">Wikipedia:user page</a> and other policies and guidelines.</li>
<li>It's not a good idea to paraphrase somebody's utterance in controversial terms. Saying something like "parents who have their children circumcised are child abusers" may or may not qualify as antisemitism (for purposes of this discussion I will make no assumption on whether it does or doesn't qualify). But antisemitism is a rather serious charge, and since it rests on shaky foundations it is best avoided. That said, I have not seen any evidence that Michael Ralston was acting in bad faith when he made that accusation.</li>
<li>Not only is there confusion about what the anti-vaccinationism article is about, there is also confusion about what the talk page RFC (which would resolve the first kind of confusion) is about. Michael seems to think (and again I see no evidence of bad faith) that the behavior of editors is partly at stake. That may or may not be the case, but in this case I agree with the anon that such disputes should be resolved in other venues, not on an article talk page.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Admins won't be able to help you with the content disputes. The only actionable item I see is whether 86.10.231.219's talk page was used inappropriately. If you think it was, please present concise evidence. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a>&#160;<small><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkSweep_9d72.html" title="User talk:MarkSweep">(call me collect)</a></small> 07:07, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, I haven't stalked you. I've strongly contemplated <b>wiki</b>stalking you in self-defense, but I haven't yet done so - and given that I know now there's at least one administrator who's looked at this case, I don't think I'll have to. I do have <b>this page</b> on my watchlist - after all, there's an accusation against me! I'd darn well better be keeping an eye on this. As for me asking for the AfD to be closed <b>in your favor</b>... do I have to point out I also stated before then, on your talk page, that an AfD was improper, as it was not an article? Someone wondering about the timing might be advised to take a look at my contributions - I've been doing a moderate amount of editing the past few days, and most of my posts that in some way, shape, or form have something to do with this IP have been at the same general time as other edits. As for "untrue personal attacks", I can't even think of any personal attacks I've made, at least not lately. Claiming that <b>you</b> said Midgley is anti-semitic is not a personal attack - it may not be entirely accurate, but it's not a personal attack, especially when it is and has been perfectly clear what I'm referring to at that point. Claiming that Midgley is <b>not</b> anti-semitic is also not a personal attack, to my knowledge. <a href="../../../t/h/s/User%7EThsgrn_05b9.html" title="User:Thsgrn">Michael Ralston</a></dd>
<dd>All that said... Anon, can we try to work this out somewhere it belongs? Because it definitely doesn't belong here. Given your apparent opinion of me (and, I'll admit, my opinion of you), I doubt mediation would be effective. If you'd like to open an RfC on my conduct, I will willingly waive the two-person requirement as long as you'd be willing to agree not to report me for any further alleged misconduct elsewhere without first notifying me on my talk page.

<dd>Wow. I see a few things I very strongly disagree with: 1) the idea that the block was warranted, and 2) the idea that discussing it in a chat room somehow makes it better, and 3) the willingness to block without an accompanying willingness to discuss the block on the wiki. Blocking is quite controversial, as we should all know, so if you're not presently willing/able to be involved in the wiki much, you shouldn't be using the block function. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 16:52, 23 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So, the story from my perspective. After making the above remark, I decided to go into IRC to discuss the recent RfA voting patterns and I saw people discussing just that, and also the blocking of some guy. Before I decide to ask whom they're talking about, I was informed, that it's me who is blocked. I was like WTF and indeed, I was blocked (this is the first time I saw what happens when you try to edit a page while blocked). Thankfully I was unblocked rather quickly. I won't call for Kelly's head, but I think that making sudden 24hr blocks is not the practice that should be encouraged. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrue_d9a8.html" title="User:Grue"><font style="background: black" face="Courier" color="#FFFFFF"><b>&#160;Grue&#160;</b></font></a> 19:09, 23 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It <i>is</i> disconcerting, isn't it? My first time was last year during the affair which eventually led to Stevertigo's desysopping. It really threw me for a loop.

<p>Can I make an attempt at perspective? Grue said something he shouldn't have. Kelly said something she shouldn't have. Both mistakes were reversed. No long-term harm was done except whatever bitterness people choose to make themselves. Everyone makes mistakes and infallibility is not a prerequisite for adminship. I found the sudden rush of votes to oppose Djr's nomination distressing, but <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFA_4c83.html" title="WP:RFA">RFA</a> is probably the single area where Wikipedia drama does the least harm.</p>
<p>Since people are quoting Jimbo's opinions on userboxes until they're blue in the face whenever the subject comes up, here's one of his views I remember:</p>

<dd>Agree with <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">User:Geni</a> 100%. As admins become increasinly enamored with IAR, and as we become increasingly contemptuous of consensus and process, adminship becomes a bigger and bigger deal.

<dd>The basic problem is that in many instances we have outgrown our policies, they haven't scaled, no big deal almost certainly fits with that to. Yet our basic set up is very resistant to change since most proposals are effectively scuppered by a few who disagree, and many not caring, making consensus difficult to reach. We also face the problem of many users believing process to be the end itself rather than the means to an end, and the rather bizarre belief that consensus is some how a trump card which overides common sense and the basic project goals. But this is nothing new, the "no big deal" line has been trotted out frequently, ususally on failing RFAs, which to me indicates that the person themself does believe it to be a big deal, in much the same way that <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">WP:BOLD</a> is often trotted out when someone knows they have over stepped the mark. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User%7EPgk_d0c7.html" title="User:Pgk">pgk</a><sup>(<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk"><font color="mediumseagreen">talk</font></a>)</sup> 08:28, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with much of what you say, except that I don't think we really have a problem of users who believe that process is an end to itself. I think that's a bit of a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strawman.html" title="Strawman">strawman</a>. I think users who make a good faith effort to participate in the various processes that have developed in Wikipedia would like admins to generally respect those processes unless they have a good reason not to. Admins who go trampling on process for no good reason whoatsoever win a lot of respect among other admins, but infuriate non-admins and make Wikipedia a less pleasurable, less interesting experience for them.

Stop living on them and go write the encyclopedia. Also, please don't blow this out of proportion.

<p>Kelly's block for incivility strikes me as somewhat inconsistent considering that just a couple of days ago she was calling people "idiots". <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Criteria_for_speedy_deletion&amp;diff=40569189&amp;oldid=40567566" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Criteria_for_speedy_deletion&amp;diff=40569189&amp;oldid=40567566" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> When the personal attack was removed Kelly disapproved saying that "<a href="../../../r/p/a/WP%7ERPA_efd5.html" title="WP:RPA">WP:RPA</a> is controversial".

<dd>Seconded. Grue's comment hardly even qualifies as a personal attack, though it was a bit incivil. Blocking him for it without so much as a warning or a prior request that he chill out was rather a bigger faux pas than his comment, especially considering Kelly was on the opposite side of the debate and absolutely shouldn't have been carrying out a block even <i>had</i> it been warranted.

<p>I'm also adding to my complaint against Gamaliel that he has broken the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Wikipedia%7EHarassment_9843.html" title="Wikipedia:Harassment">Wikipedia:Harassment</a> rule. This rule says</p>
<p>"Harassment is defined as a pattern of disruptive behavior that appears to a reasonable and objective observer to have the purpose of causing negative emotions in a targeted person or persons, usually (but not always) for the purpose of intimidating the primary target. The purpose could be to make editing Wikipedia unpleasant for the target, to undermine them, to frighten them, or to encourage them to stop editing entirely."</p>
<p>Here are the things that Gamaliel has done to foster all of the things described by this rule:</p>
<ol>
<li>He threatened to ban me over the most minor infraction imaginable - a single case of "incivility" when I complained a sourced quote was being censored from an article.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AColonelS&amp;diff=40924523&amp;oldid=40923186" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AColonelS&amp;diff=40924523&amp;oldid=40923186" rel="nofollow">[24]</a></li>
<li>He followed me to my message page and to another article (<a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Lawyers_Guild_08be.html" title="National Lawyers Guild">National Lawyers Guild</a>) to continue an argument on <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chip_Berlet_64c2.html" title="Chip Berlet">Chip Berlet</a></li>
<li>He made a secretive request for investigating me and accused me of being banned editors, which I am not.</li>
<li>He tried to intimidate my attempts to undo the blanking of a vandal who has blanked the majority of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Lawyers_Guild_08be.html" title="National Lawyers Guild">National Lawyers Guild</a> article a dozen times in the last week by misportraying the anti-vandalism rule and claiming it didn't apply when it does.</li>
<li>He blocked me under "3RR" for undoing that same vandal's blanking, when the 3RR rule says undoing vandalism does not count as a bannable revert. This was also on an article Gamaliel followed me to.</li>
<li>He added me to an "enemies list" he maintains against Republican and Conservative editors on his homepage.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Gamaliel%2Ftodo&amp;diff=41289204&amp;oldid=41273887" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Gamaliel%2Ftodo&amp;diff=41289204&amp;oldid=41273887" rel="nofollow">[25]</a></li>
</ol>
<p>All of this behaviour is aimed at harassment, and as proof that he is targetting me you can look at any of those pages and see that Gamaliel let several liberal editors get by with breaking rules while he was singling me out. He seems intent on driving me off of Wikipedia for political reasons and he is abusing his sys-op powers -- such as blocking -- to accomplish this. -- <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColonelS_a8ad.html" title="User:ColonelS">ColonelS</a> 04:02, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Warning you not to be incivil is not harassment. <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> is one of the primary rules here, and admins share the job of enforcing it. (Whether it really was incivility is another question entirely.)</li>
<li>Your "message page" is where he's supposed to talk to you; how could he follow you there? At any rate, it's hardly surprising that when an admin detects what he perceives as incivil behaviour, that he checks to see if it was part of a general pattern of incivility, or just a momentary lapse of manners.</li>
<li>What is this "secretive request"? Everything's pretty public here.</li>
<li>What you describe as "blanking" is not blanking as referred to in <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia:Vandalism</a>; it is a content dispute between representing an organization as a "human rights" association or a "radical far-left" association. 3RR applies strictly.</li>

<p>Bishonen and jpgordon, I'm sorry that you're so immediately dismissive of this new user's feelings. Wikipedia has a don't bite the new user policy, and ColonelS obviously feels bitten. Gamaliel is an administrator, and is subject to a higher standard here. After stepping back, I think the problem arises from Gamaliel not drawing a bright line between his substantive editing activities and his use of admin powers. One solution which I hope that all will consider is to ask Gamaliel to avoiding even the perception of crossing this line, because crossing or bumping up against the neutrality policy makes users feel very comfortable. Whether or not Gamaliel has violated policy is an issue in dispute, but what is not in dispute is that many users (see Gamaliel's enemies list) feel like Gamaliel abuses his admin powers. I have been on the receiving end of his attack runs, and know what it feels like. It's not good, and makes me not trust the Wiki admin review process. The simple solution would be for Gamaliel to voluntarily draw a brighter line between his admin and editing activities. If he agrees to that, then no sanctions would be necessary.

<ul>
<li>I hope you've read this user's contributions, as well as Gamaliel's interactions with him, to come to this position. I certainly wasn't immediately dismissive; I studied what had happened and came to my position in an informed fashion. As far as his "enemies list" is concerned, Gamaliel is one of our best NPOV enforcers, and his page is a useful record and tool in that fight. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 20:25, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>We've already had this conversation, Morton, and as I explained to you then and as is the case now, that "bright line" is already there. I am not editing the Berlet articles and thus this conflict you allege does not exist. My "substantive editing activities", which all administrators engage in, have nothing to do with the Berlet articles. I'm not sure how a brand new user like ColonelS would be made uncomfortable by or even be aware of my substantial edits to other articles when I ask him not to be combative and uncivil.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As far as you being "on the receiving end of my attack runs", I have only had two interactions with you. The second was our conversation about <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigplankton_dc98.html" title="User:Bigplankton">User:Bigplankton</a>, when you accused me of oppressing him for asking him not to personally attack me and not to accuse me of all manner of nonsense. The first was when I submitted for AfD <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Fry_Mumia_df54.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Fry Mumia">your article about an insignificant T-shirt slogan</a>. Your response was to label me a "pedantic asshole" and "weasel" on your <a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorton_devonshire_4a12.html" title="User talk:Morton devonshire">user talk page</a>, accuse me of being a sockpuppet of Will Beback, Guettarda, and Golbez, and place me in the "cult of mumia" despite my not editing that article nor expressing any opinion on the matter. At no point have I had any administrative interactions with you. Let's be clear about who is on the receiving end of what here.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>This incident is not about 86.10.231.219's behavior; it's about Midgley's. No matter what 86.10.231.219 did - and maybe especially if his/her behavior is so bad - there is no justification for malicious sockpuppetry, impersonating another editor, and deliberately confusing the discussion. If we are going to allow that accusations against one editor justifies bad behavior by another, we're setting a very dangerous precedent. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 03:34, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm seconding Leifern here. I've had my own difficulties with 86.10 - just look up the page to see! - but when one deliberately violates <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>, this is a problem, no matter why. It can, at most, be partially excused as being provoked, but that remains <b>partial</b>, and would be something for an RfC or maybe even an RfA to resolve the degree of. (As a side-note, my POV places me far closer to Midgley than Leifern or 86.10 on such issues as <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-vaccinationists.html" title="Anti-vaccinationists">Anti-vaccinationists</a>, as is surely obvious to anyone who cares to investigate. This conflict obviously started as the result of POV conflicts - but it has escalated beyond that, and must be stopped.) <a href="../../../t/h/s/User%7EThsgrn_05b9.html" title="User:Thsgrn">Michael Ralston</a> 03:40, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I may well regret this - hell, I'm sure I'm going to regret this - but I'll see what I can do to mediate and ensure that articles agree with Wikipedia policy.

<dd>Andrew, I appreciate the offer and will certainly cooperate with you. As a telling indicator, I am also involved in articles on the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab-Israeli_conflict_ff03.html" title="Arab-Israeli conflict">Arab-Israeli conflict</a>, and things are going much better there. This is an area that requires a great deal of intellectual integrity. As far as next steps for Midgley is concerned, let me ask this question: if 86.10 had, say, registered as "Midgely" and done exactly what Midgley had done, would he/she have gotten off with a warning? --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 11:38, 28 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There are no "next steps for Midgley", other than the next steps which will apply to everyone - an end to personal attacks (including the loose ad-hominem stuff about conspiracies), and a rigorous course of treatment consisting of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> and other relevant policies and guidelines. This "he did it so I'm doing it" tit-for-tat behaviour has got to stop. I am going to think about this further over the next couple of days, and sort out some firm proposals. In the meantime, any more nonsense <b>from either side</b> <i>will</i> result in people being blocked. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 12:52, 28 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ehm, please try to read what I wrote - I wasn't suggesting that anyone do what Midgley did - quite the contrary. Other than that, I'm sure Midgley will be gratified to know that rules about sockpuppetry, etc., don't <i>really</i> apply to him as long as he does these kinds of things to people others already are annoyed at. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 15:46, 28 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I didn't think you were suggesting anyone should do what he did - what you are suggesting (also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:TenOfAllTrades&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=41548548" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:TenOfAllTrades&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=41548548" rel="nofollow">here</a>) is that he hasn't been "dealt with" to your satisfaction. I think several people who have looked into the background have come to the conclusion that there has been some severe provocation going on, some of it by people with very little history of constructive contributions to Wikipedia. There are two ways to go with this. One is to draw a line under everything now, and try to move forward assuming good faith, and sticking to verifiability, neutrality, and so on. The other is to go for a <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAR_b522.html" title="WP:RFAR">request for arbitration</a>, which I suspect would see <i>several</i> of the people caught up in this being severely censured. I'm quite prepared to go down that route, if people don't stop needling each other. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 16:57, 28 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I guess what confuses (and concerns) me is this: we routinely block people for impetuously violating the 3RR rule and generally ignore protestations about being "provoked." The principle we are trying to engender is this: <b>no matter how provoked you think you are - or have reason to be - certain behavior is unacceptable</b>. Maybe I have a warped sense of justice, but it seems to me that malicious sockpuppetry, impersonating another user, confusing a discussion, and trying to preempt an MFD through all this bad behavior has to be one of the worst things I have personally seen here, with the exception of admins blocking editors in a content dispute. Yeah, I think Midgley got off way easy - and I also think there are plenty of editors who simply would have been banned indefinitely for the same offense. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 17:35, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Did he break 3RR? I would say so, on <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle-earth.html" title="Middle-earth">Middle-earth</a>. Did CBDunkerson, whom he was editwarring with, block 3RR? No. Was CBDunkerson blocked? No. However, both are coming very close, occasionally overflowing, the common sense bounds that are the 3RR. Both parties should be reminded that the 3RR is not an allowance, it is a guideline. IMO, the articles should probably be protected if this moronic fight continues. Also, I very much dislike it when people call anything but vandalism "vandalism", and that's an extra strike on Martinez. Please don't do that, it really distracts us from fighting the real vandals.</dd>

<p>This user continues to insist that his version of the article is the only correct one and that all others are vandalism. Despite several uninvolved administrators reviewing his request, he insists he be unblocked despite his violation of WP:3RR, and has assumed bad faith of everyone involved, including myself, when I addressed his request to be unblocked on his talk page.

<dd>When I saw where this mess was going I walked away to sleep on it. Apparently a bit too late to avoid 'being on thin ice'. For the record, there <i>has</i> been discussion on the talk pages and I <i>have</i> attempted to compromise with neutral wording. I have a problem allowing Michael's edits to stand because even if we were to assume that he's right, his assertions could <i>never</i> be verified. He is arguing for the inclusion of things that he believes an author <i>meant</i>... but never actually <b>wrote</b>. Personally, I think that ample evidence has been provided that Michael is simply wrong, but even if we assume that the author changed his mind or meant something different there will never be any way to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verify</a> it because the man is dead and he <i>never</i> wrote the things Michael wishes to include. That said, I tend to think that 3RR blocks cause more problems than they solve so I'll continue to leave the articles in the 'wrong' version and wait until Michael's block expires before resuming efforts to settle this. If someone wants to remove his block early I think that could only help. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBDunkerson</a> 11:59, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While trying to create the page 'Attila the Hun to Charlemagne', which did not exist, I received a 'hand-in-stop-sign' icon. The page had not been being worked on, until I started to create it. This was placed by Ghirlandajo. I completed the page. It took quite some time, because there was much information to format. I had come to this page by way of 'Descents from antiquity' [sic], where I had also tried to add some information and a bibliography. The bibliography was removed overnight, with the note on the changes/history page that 'charlatans' had been removed. The entire bibliography! Since I was one of those half-dozen charlatans, I was (justifiably) offended by the slander. Especially when one considers that I was the author of one of THE three seminal works creating the field. The other charlatans are also all very well respected in the field. Since Ghirlandajo claims to have written the page, he should be aware of this fact. The work which I did creating 'Attila the Hun to Charlemagne', was entirely removed, and replaced with other material, (which was not nearly so helpful); and Ghirlandjo takes credit, on his page, for having created 'Attila the Hun to Charlemagne'. He also uncorrected spelling, grammatical and punctuational errors, returning them to their original incorrect state.</p>
<p>Ghirlandajo takes credit for a great many things on his page. I wonder how much of it is deserved. He also, as one can tell by reading his discussions, is very heavy-handed, and smuggly self-righteous - as is mete for one as knowledgeable as he claims to be. He also proudly states that he is not an administrator, and does not wish to be. Then let him behave accordingly!</p>
<p>Frankly, I shall just quit contributing ANYTHING to wiki, from this point forward. That includes related projects, (such as MeroWiki), or any of the other topics, to which I might have contributed, as in the past. I simply will no longer be slandered, and have hours of work undone, by one who is not the expert that he wishes the world to believe.</p>

<p>It might help get things reviewed if you gave us some links to the articles and user page in question (by bracketing). This appears to be partly a content dispute, and many of the admins here will not consider it worth attention. However, any removal or replacement of info should be explained on the article Talk page. Did G leave an explanation? Removal by a editor without explanation of a sizable contribution of a new editor would certainly warrant our attention. The best place to ask for community review is at <a href="../../../r/f/c/Wp%7Erfc.html" title="Wp:rfc">wp:rfc</a>, where you can list the article and ask for review. Your work is not lost. It is in the article history, and can be resurrected.

<dd>Probably, the most diplomatic thing to do is to find replacement images. Thepcnerd's request, though petty and groundless, is reasonable. Perhaps it would be best to write a message on their talk page saying that the images will be taken down as soon as replacements have been uploaded, and that, in the meantime, Wikipedia has no obligation to take down images that have been licensed under GFDL. — <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 15:51, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Looking at the images' files more closely, it could be argued that they were not explicitly placed under GFDL. When they were first uploaded, <a href="../../../c/o/p/Template%7ECopyrightedNotForProfitUseProvidedThat_6a69.html" title="Template:CopyrightedNotForProfitUseProvidedThat">CopyrightedNotForProfitUseProvidedThat</a> was used. When Thepcnerd discovered that this unfree licence would lead to a quick deletion, they removed it with the edit summary <i>GFDL or whatever the official wikipedia copyright terms thing is</i>. I beleive that anything uploaded and not otherwise tagged is under GFDL, and the edit summay implies that such a licencing, although not understood, is sought. — <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 16:03, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>IANAL, but "the official wikipedia copyright terms thing" is surely either GFDL, or there isn't one. In the first case, the pictures are GFDL. In the second case, we go back to what's on the other side of the 'or' conjunction and they're still GFDL. (It sounds like we agree on this point, hope I don't sound argumentative as I frequently do.)</dd>
<dd>As for the question of replacing the images, it's entirely up to whoever wants to use them now. On the one hand I sympathise with the user, and replacing the photos if it's easily done would be a nice gesture. On the other hand I think he's learnt two sorely-needed lessons: 1) read the small print 2) don't threaten people with the almighty Western legal system like it's everyone's universal bigger brother because it annoys people, especially those who have chosen to make themselves accountable by using their real name. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Malthusian</a> <small><a href="../../../l/a/s/User_talk%7ELast_Malthusian_5d5c.html" title="User talk:Last Malthusian">(talk)</a></small> 16:17, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I know it is incredibly hard to assume good faith, but we have to allow for the fact that some of these might be genuine editors albeit likely brought in by Gastrich's external efforts. It's probably best to give them enough rope to hang themselves, especially since the Gastroturfing is now at a much lower (i.e. containable) level. I've blocked a couple of the more obviously abusive ones lately, but one of those was for gratuitous personal attacks. If you feel that a suspected sock is a problem (e.g. edit-warring over tendentious edits to controversial and previously Gastroturfed articles), leave a note here using the {{vandal|user_name}} syntax (replace spaces with underscores) and someone will have a look.

<p>I may be accused of pessimism, but I sincerely doubt that KDRGibby is about to reform in any way (he made no promises to reform; in fact he boycotted the arbitration case because it was "a total circus" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:KDRGibby&amp;diff=40179652&amp;oldid=40179327" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:KDRGibby&amp;diff=40179652&amp;oldid=40179327" rel="nofollow">[44]</a>). As such, whenever I run into misbehavior by him (which has happened saddeningly often in the past, perhaps because our watchlists share many common articles), I will record it here.</p>
<p>I would like to note that I was not a party in the arbitration case, and I do not go out of my way to find incriminating evidence - it's just very hard not to bump into it at every turn. -- <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikodemos_e75d.html" title="User:Nikodemos">Nikodemos</a> 06:43, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I understand the point about the attempts by anons and user:Cooldc19 to add material without sources. Nevertheless, the tone in the talk page and the comments made by Davis21Wylie in the edit summmaries are not the way to proceed in these cases. If you want to remove the block, please go ahead. Just make sure that you explain to that user that regardless of vandalism, there is no need to escalate things by feeding the trolls, and that there is always semi-protection to deal with IP vandalism. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">t</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossi_2ed2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossi">@</a></small> 04:11, 26 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The page was already semi-protected while these reverts were going on. The anon had created an account and waited several days so as to get past semi-protection.

<dd>No problems. Just make sure to cool off the air and remind Davis21Wylie that even if he considers an edit to be vandalism, and there is a need to revert, to not feed the trolls by writing things like <i>Straight-up rv'in, baby</i>, <i>Yeeah, this is how we do... rv.</i>, <i>Illin' like a villain... rv</i>, <i>Word to your mother... rv</i>, and other.

<dd>This behaviour is perfectly consistent with other cases of spyware-added links I've seen before (the edits genuinely change something else other than adding the links, and it uses the HTML link syntax).

<p>Hi -- I'd like to report major harassment and abuse by Wikipedia sys-op Gamaliel against me for political reasons. Gamaliel is a vocal Democrat and has been harassing me since I am a Republican ever since I joined because I edited one of his "sacred cows" in an article about a liberal pundit he likes. We had a dispute there at Chip Berlet over what the article should say when I clarified it to show that Berlet is not a lawyer because the old version left an assumption that he was. Gamaliel quickly turned this into a personal campaign against me. I was immediately attacked there with all sorts of rude personal comments accusing me of "fabrication" and deceit -- which Gamaliel ignored -- but when I responded with a single sentence that the Republican view was being censered Gamaliel rudely threatened to ban me! That's when his campaign against me intensified and it hasn't stopped.</p>
<p>Gamaliel then followed me over to another article -- the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Lawyers_Guild_08be.html" title="National Lawyers Guild">National Lawyers Guild</a> -- which has been vandalized for several days by an anonymous editor who sometimes logs in as user:Carlosvillareal and sometimes edits anonymously as 169.237.161.209, but only does one thing -- he blanks 3/4ths of the National Lawyer's Guild article without discussion and explanation. Carlosvillareal and his isp number have been doing this on February 23rd - 26th. I count 9 different times that this article has been blanked by this same vandal in those days, plus 7 or 8 times somebody else has done it.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=National_Lawyers_Guild&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=National_Lawyers_Guild&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[62]</a> All in all this article has required the watching by several of us simply to keep its text from being wiped clean. Over this period 4 editors have been fighting this vandalism - me, <a href="../../../m/s/t/User%7EMSTCrow_5721.html" title="User:MSTCrow">user:MSTCrow</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/t/User%7ELatinus_7925.html" title="User:Latinus">user:Latinus</a>, and <a href="../../../t/a/w/User%7ETawker_141a.html" title="User:Tawker">user:Tawker</a>. We've all posted warnings that Villareal and his anonymous accounts were doing vandalism and he's ignored them all.</p>
<p>On February 24th after a long day of undoing all the damage by this vandalism Gamaliel followed me to the National Lawyers Guild article. It had been blanked 9 times that day alone including 6 by Villareal and his ISP account, but each time one of us restored it. Gamaliel singled me out for this and accused me of violating the "3RR" rule of Wikipedia by undoing this clear vandalism more than 3 times. He posted another block threat on my userpage for supposedly violating this rule and then claimed that the anti-blanking rule on vandalism only applied when the entire article was deleted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AColonelS&amp;diff=40977075&amp;oldid=40977018" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AColonelS&amp;diff=40977075&amp;oldid=40977018" rel="nofollow">[63]</a>. I quickly showed him that this is not true and <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia:Vandalism</a> says it is also blanking when "significant parts" of the article are deleted without reason <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AColonelS&amp;diff=40977988&amp;oldid=40977075" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AColonelS&amp;diff=40977988&amp;oldid=40977075" rel="nofollow">[64]</a>, which is what Villareal and the vandal accounts were doing with 3/4ths the text. I also showed him that <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> says it is not a "3RR" violation when you are reverting to undo vandalism. Three other long established editors agreed with me that this is the case with Villareal at the National Lawyers Guild and were active reverting these same vandals too, but Gamaliel singled me out for harassment.</p>
<p>He ignored all the rules showing that this was indeed vandalism that Villareal was doing, that 3RR did not apply to it, and that 3 others were involved in fighting this same vandal. Then Gamaliel singled me out and blocked me for an accused "3RR" violation -- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AColonelS&amp;diff=40981677&amp;oldid=40979359" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AColonelS&amp;diff=40981677&amp;oldid=40979359" rel="nofollow">[65]</a>. I believe that this was a major abuse of his administrator powers and it was only done to harass and cause harm to me. Nothing I did at the National Lawyers Guild article was inconsistent with wikipedia policies -- it was all done to fight a vandal who has been a major disruption to that article for most of the last week. Gamaliel blocked me only because of our fight on the other article and he singled me out because of my politics clashing with his.</p>
<p>I believe he is also harassing me elsewhere on WikiPedia -- Gamaliel also tried to start secretive investigations of me and now he's got me listed on an "enemies list" that he created here -- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AGamaliel%2Ftodo&amp;diff=41289204&amp;oldid=41273887" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AGamaliel%2Ftodo&amp;diff=41289204&amp;oldid=41273887" rel="nofollow">[66]</a>. His main issue with the people on it seems to be his disagreement with their politics because he is such a partisan Democrat.</p>
<p>Somebody with power to do so -- please reprimand this guy as he is out of control. I personally think he is abusing Republican editors and making Wikipedia a hostile environment for them to edit in. He should also be de-sys-opped for abusing his powers to block me and to protect a vandal who has been a major problem at <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Lawyers_Guild_08be.html" title="National Lawyers Guild">National Lawyers Guild</a>.</p>

<dd>Gamaliel is clearly being deceptive here. While he did advocate "civility" and accuse me of breaching it for a simple complaint that liberals were censoring that article, Gamaliel completely ignored it when liberal editors were uncivil to me -- including accusations of "fabrication" and namecalling. He is also not being fully truthful when he says he "explained" I was using the term blanking incorrectly. He did no such thing and only declared on his own definition that deleting 75% of the article without explanation is not "blanking." I showed him the rule from <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVandalism_79f5.html" title="WP:Vandalism">WP:Vandalism</a> that defines blanking: "Blanking - Removing all <u>or significant parts of articles</u> (sometimes replacing the removed content with profanities) is a common vandal edit." He ignored this rule and continues to insist on his own definition. Also on <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Lawyers_Guild_08be.html" title="National Lawyers Guild">National Lawyers Guild</a> Calton reverted to the blanked version 3 times versus 6 by Villareal and anonymous ISP (up to 10 now!). It's also worth noting that even though 3 other established editors also undid Villareal's blanking as vandalism (MSTCrow, Latinus, and Talker), Gamaliel ONLY TARGETTED ME FOR HARASSMENT. You can see this documented on my talk page, along with all of Gamaliel's rude and harassing block threats for "violations" that are minor or fabricated. This guy is clearly out of control and seems to be out to drive me and other Republicans off wikipedia. Just look at his "enemies list" page, which is all the people he has political disagreements with. He needs to be de-sys-opped because he is abusing his power to persecute people for their politics. -- <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColonelS_a8ad.html" title="User:ColonelS">ColonelS</a> 20:26, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>One more thing -- Gamaliel says I was given a "3RR warning" by Slim Virgin. Yet I did not violate "3RR" there either. She posted it saying I was "about to violate" 3RR because I had reached the 3 revert limit, which <b>she had also reached on the same article</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Political_Research_Associates&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Political_Research_Associates&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[69]</a>.

<dd>Colonel S, when people warn you about 3RR, they're doing you a favor because you're a new editor. If either Viriditas or I violated 3RR, we'd be blocked without warning, because we know not to do it. Insofar as you're attracting the attention of other editors and admins, it's because you've arrived with a chip on your shoulder about certain pages, apparently convinced that only you can save them from their horrific left-wing bias, and you've leapt into making controversial edits on disputed pages with no editing experience and no knowledge of our editing policies. I've already advised you to spend a few weeks editing less exciting pages so that you gain a bit of experience, then return to the ones you're more interested in. I can assure you that no one cares whether you're a Republican or a Democrat. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 05:45, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree, but that is not an accurate description of what happened. I was not "in the middle of a revert war" with ColonelS, nor have I been editing any of the Berlet articles. My sole edit to these articles was to revert ColonelS's fourth revert, as I customarily do with 3RR violations because I feel to leave a 4R in place is to reward a 3RR violator. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 22:34, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thatcher131 -- Actually Gamaliel was in the middle of a different revert war on the other article where I first met him - about liberal pundit <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chip_Berlet_64c2.html" title="Chip Berlet">Chip Berlet</a>. He was arguing with me there on the talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Chip_Berlet&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Chip_Berlet&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[70]</a> and a few moments later followed me over to my own message page to post rudely worded threats of banning for a very minor offense <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AColonelS&amp;diff=40924523&amp;oldid=40923186" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AColonelS&amp;diff=40924523&amp;oldid=40923186" rel="nofollow">[71]</a>. After a lengthy argument there he followed me over to <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Lawyers_Guild_08be.html" title="National Lawyers Guild">National Lawyers Guild</a> and blocked me for 3RR violations when I was doing nothing more than undoing a blanking made by a vandal who has done the same vandalism over a dozen times. As <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> clearly indicates, undoing cases of simple vandalism do NOT count as 3RR violations. I've shown that rule to Gamaliel several times, as well as the one that shows that blanking is the removal of a significant part of any article (and deleting over 3/4ths of it is certainly "significant") but he keeps dishonestly claiming something else is the rule when it very plainly is not. Also notice that Gamaliel is not enforcing any of these "rules" against anybody but me on these articles. On <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chip_Berlet_64c2.html" title="Chip Berlet">Chip Berlet</a>: When <a href="../../../c/b/e/User%7ECberlet_c009.html" title="User:Cberlet">User:Cberlet</a> insulted me repeatedly in the Edit Summary box and in his talk page posts, Gamaliel didn't lecture him on civility or threaten to ban him for it. When <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlim_Virgin_d8fd.html" title="User:Slim Virgin">User:Slim Virgin</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">User:Viriditas</a> both reverted up to their 3 revert limit on a deletion that ignores the talk page objections of several others, Gamaliel didn't post any 3RR warnings to them or threaten to ban them if they make a 4th. When 3 different editors on the National Lawyers Guild made the exact same revert of the blanking done by the vandal operating there Gamaliel did not send them warnings that falsely claimed his blanking wasn't really vandalism. No. Gamaliel only does that sort of thing to me, which is for the sole purpose of harassing me. -- <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColonelS_a8ad.html" title="User:ColonelS">ColonelS</a> 03:48, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Aaron - Actually the only part of that I added was the last paragraph, which is a quote about the NLG. It is linked to give it a source too. The rest was the existing text of this article before I edited it. I'm sure it could be improved, but that is not the problem here. The problem is that an anonymous vandal who sometimes logs in as Carlosvillareal keeps blanking 75% of the entire article -- part of which is the quote I added. Also Gamaliel is not the one doing the reverts except for that one, which he did after imposing an abusive 3RR block on me for fighting Villareal's vandalism that had been going on all day. -- <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColonelS_a8ad.html" title="User:ColonelS">ColonelS</a> 20:32, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The substance of this seems pretty clear. There are two <i>separable</i> reasons that the block should not have been made by the administrator who made it:</p>
<ol>
<li>A 3RR block for reverting vandalism is <i>invalid</i>, since <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> expressly permits making multiple reverts of vandalism.</li>
<li>Administrators are <i>expressly forbidden</i> under <a href="../../../b/p/_/WP%7EBP_c8aa.html" title="WP:BP">WP:BP</a> from blocking someone they are in a content dispute with.
<ul>
<li>Note, the rule isn't "admins may not block someone <i>as part of</i> a conflict" -- it is, rather, that they "must not block editors with whom they are currently engaged in an editing conflict." It doesn't matter if the blocking is over a different issue.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In other words, it seems that the block in this case was (1) invalid, that is, not called for; and separately, (2) specifically prohibited in policy. Even if there is <i>reason</i> to block a person with whom an administrator is in dispute, that administrator is specifically forbidden from doing so. He or she should instead raise the issue to other administrators for review and action. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 05:19, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I wish people would investigate the issue or at least fully read the comments here before commenting. It is irresponsible not to do so and only encourages frivolous complaints. You are correct when it comes to policies, but these policies do not apply here.</p>
<ol>
<li>ColonelS was not reverting vandalism. It was a content dispute, as I explained to him before the block. Even if you do not accept my judgement that it was not vandalism, it certainly doesn't fall under any definition of <i>simple</i> vandalism.</li>
<li>I was <b>not in a content dispute</b> with ColonelS. I have not been editing the Berlet articles.</li>
<li>I was not in a content dispute with ColonelS on any other article.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you don't believe me, investigate for yourself, but please do so <i>before</i> commenting. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 05:55, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Please do investigate. Gamaliel is being less than forthright in his characterization of this dispute, as he has been all along.</p>
<ol>
<li>The <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Lawyers_Guild_08be.html" title="National Lawyers Guild">National Lawyers Guild</a> stuff is a clear case of vandalism by every measure. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=National_Lawyers_Guild&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=40928724" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=National_Lawyers_Guild&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=40928724" rel="nofollow">This</a> is what the vandal was doing - blanking the majority of the entire article without given reasons and without participating in a discussion. A content dispute takes a discussion and the vandal was not doing so. Furthermore, the vandal was using a combination of anonymous ISP's and a username created ONLY to edit that article. You can look and the ONLY thing they did at wikipedia is blank that article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=169.237.161.209" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=169.237.161.209" rel="nofollow">[72]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Carlosvillarreal" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Carlosvillarreal" rel="nofollow">[73]</a>. This same guy seems to be using those ISP's and an account <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlosvillarreal_495a.html" title="User:Carlosvillarreal">user:Carlosvillarreal</a> to do only one thing on WikiPedia - blanking the National Lawyer's Guild article. He also alternates between logging in and making an ISP vandalism so as to avoid 3RR, even though he's accumulated about a dozen different blankings of the article since last Thursday. Carlosvillareal has also been warned about vandalism and urged to discuss his desired changes by three other long established editors plus me but he's ignored it.</li>
<li>Gamaliel was involved in the content dispute with me on the Chip Berlet article when this whole mess started. He made posts several times on <a href="../../../c/h/i/Talk%7EChip_Berlet_efa5.html" title="Talk:Chip Berlet">Talk:Chip Berlet</a> to me and in general. -- <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColonelS_a8ad.html" title="User:ColonelS">ColonelS</a> 06:16, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>An anonymous editor operating through an open proxy made a number of edits in various articles relating to <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shi%27a.html" title="Shi'a">Shi'a</a> Islam, replacing all instances of the word "Rafidi" or "Rafida" with "Shi'a".

I reverted or revised his edits, using the term "Shi'at Ali, party of Ali, and by their opponents, Rafida". We can't use the term Shi'a for Muslims before 750 or so, as they were only proto-Shi'a; sectarian lines hadn't hardened yet. Rafidi/Rafida is a well-attested description used in the 7th and 8th centuries; it means Refuser and has no inherent derogatory meaning. The anon will not accept this reasoning and continues a revert war, which he has broadened to include defacement of my user page and reversion of all my edits, in ANY article, even the ones with no relation to Islam, no reason given.

<dd>there is no relation between the term shia and rafida in islamic history please stop adding POV anti-shia Salafi only terms. the term nasibi is islamic term used by the prophet himself for the sects like salafi also u edits ALL salafi related articles that have nasibi term . the shia term has been used by the prophet himself in the history this was proofed for u and u reject the facts. Sunni have refused the shia imams so they are refusers (rafida) why u use arabic words and what is that if i did not accept sunni "caliphs" (who killed the shia ) i am refuser so if i do not accept president Bush i am refuser&#160;!!! and i must called refuser forever only loooool ( if u wish add the term rafide to all salafi sunni articles because they refuse shia imams and they killed the shia and there imams ). as wiki we can edit without login that is my right and this is not open proxy dear... please help us and stop her from ADDING blocking non salafi's edits --82.194.62.22 02:55, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Zora, the IP has been blocked for 3 hours for some clean up and pending some discussion on a better way to fix this problem. Some of the edits I'm not so sure what to do about them. Anonymous user, you lose a lot of credibility calling Zora a salafist because if you knew anything of her history here you would know she is not.

<p>SPUI is on probation since the pedophilia wheel-war case, and may be blocked for 7 days at an admin's discression. He has now twice inserted this personal attack into a debate.

The last time he violated his probation ( a few days ago), I blocked him for 24 hours. I recommend he is blocked for a deal longer.

<p>At the article <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operating_Thetan_ca0f.html" title="Operating Thetan">Operating Thetan</a> <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimmyT_3543.html" title="User:JimmyT">JimmyT</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJimmyT_26ac.html" title="User talk:JimmyT">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JimmyT_2c45.html" title="Special:Contributions/JimmyT">contribs</a>) appears to be trying to game the system. In his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Operating_Thetan&amp;diff=41677163&amp;oldid=41665022" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Operating_Thetan&amp;diff=41677163&amp;oldid=41665022" rel="nofollow">first edit</a> there today he used the edit summary "writing only of body thetans and NOTs is innacurate POV as there are many things addressed on the OT levels", and in this edit he removed all descriptions of all that happens after reaching the state of "Clear". He did not dispute that those were <i>accurate</i> descriptions; he simply stated that because "there are many things", that it was "innacurate <sup class="noprint">[<i><a href="../../../s/i/c/Sic.html" title="Sic">sic</a></i>]</sup> POV" to describe the ones that were being described, even though these were described as being "amongst other things" -- not even implying that the description already there was complete. In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Operating_Thetan&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=41677163" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Operating_Thetan&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=41677163" rel="nofollow">his next edit</a> he removed even more information with the cryptic summary "Description - Took out incorrect POV mention. OT5 is not the only OT level about OT3" which does not appear to match his actual change.</p>
<p>I attempted to revert this to a previous version, and immediately got an edit conflict with JimmyT's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Operating_Thetan&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=41677467" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Operating_Thetan&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=41677467" rel="nofollow">next edit</a>, stamped in the very same minute as his last. Because of the unexpected edit conflict, I did not see that the effect of his edit, for which he used only "/* Description */" as his edit summary, was to insert his <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> that certain documents were "fake (or forged)".</p>
<p>Jimmy's next two edits (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Operating_Thetan&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=41677654" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Operating_Thetan&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=41677654" rel="nofollow">[76]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Operating_Thetan&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=41677678" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Operating_Thetan&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=41677678" rel="nofollow">[77]</a>) expanded on the same theme, prefacing the premise (generally accepted) that the documents over which the Church of Scientology claimed copyright are authentic (otherwise the Church would have been acting illegally to claim copyright over them) with "Critics argue that ..." My <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Operating_Thetan&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=41677678" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Operating_Thetan&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=41677678" rel="nofollow">next edit</a> was reverting this attempt to paint this generally-accepted argument as a critic-only argument, and his insertion of original research which I had discovered in the meantime, with the summary "Show us non-critics who believe that the Church successfully and illegally claimed copyright over non-authentic documents, we'll talk. In the meantime, do not insert your own OR that they are "fake"."</p>
<p>His next two edits (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Antaeus_Feldspar&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=41678944" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Antaeus_Feldspar&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=41678944" rel="nofollow">[78]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Antaeus_Feldspar&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=41678944" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Antaeus_Feldspar&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=41678944" rel="nofollow">[79]</a>) were made with the edit summaries "Antaeus' plays games with his edit summary" and "Regarding you RV which does not match your edit summary", and started with "Antaeus, FLUNK!!" That "attempt to communicate" included the incivil "Care to explain your dishonest and sneaky revert or did you make a mistake? I'm not buying any more confusing dialogue from you, lets stick with the facts and get to the point without the extra blah blah."

<dd>Concur with Antaeus. The editor in question has engaged in a pattern of removing cited material from articles without seeking consensus or even providing credible criticism of its accuracy.

<dd>I have looked at this, and I am inclined to agree that Jimmy has probably broken 3RR. Of more concern is the fact that the group he may represent is powerful, organised, fairly good at PR and has in the past been unscrupulous. I think maintaining the NPOV of these articles will be hard, not in the gross sense but in keeping finer detail in, and changes that can be wikilawyered, but are not apropriate out. At the same time, we don't want to keep those with a pro or anti-POV from editing. It's one of WP's dilemmas writ large. <i><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERich_Farmbrough_93a5.html" title="User talk:Rich Farmbrough">Farmbrough</a></i> 22:57 <a href="../../../1/_/m/1_March_4087.html" title="1 March">1 March</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> (UTC).</dd>

<dd>It's true that the Church of Scientology has in the past perpetrated organized attacks on Internet sites. However, I don't see that happening here. Instead we seem to have a small group of individual Scientologists who push Scientology positions in articles. My speculation is that JimmyT's "hatting" was not from Church hierarchy but from another one of our Scientologist contributors, such as Terryeo or (less likely) AI. We are not dealing with the likes of <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helena_Kobrin_4c6b.html" title="Helena Kobrin">Helena Kobrin</a> here -- fortunately for our article quality! In order to cover Scientology better, we <i>need</i> Scientologist contributors who are willing to discuss and provide information rather than to whitewash and delete criticism. The current set are a <i>hell</i> of a lot better on that metric than (say) <a href="../../../a/i/_/User%7EAI_72bc.html" title="User:AI">User:AI</a> was ... although they've still got quite a bit to learn about civility and policy here. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 02:14, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>We are less than a couple of hours from reaching 1 000 000 article here on en. New page patrol will definitely need a few more eyes, in part to quickly excise the flood of non-articles that will likely occur within a couple minutes of the event. Also, is there a place where eyes will be gathering to try to reach a quick consensus for which article reached a million? --Jeffrey O.

<p>I don't understand why my first artice on "Hamid Yazdani" is being deleted? Isn't is a discriminatory action against a genuine poet from a third world country? Is it just because some of your so -called editors don't know him or what? I met Hamid for the first time in Germany where he was working as a produer/editor with the radio Deusche Welle: the Voice of Germany's Urdu Service.I was on working with the Bangla Service those days.During our stay in Cologne,Germany,he translated poetry from German and Bangla languages,too.His books have been published in Pakistan and he IS well-known in urdu literary circles of pakistan and Canada.I can supply you with the copies of his published works/books,if it's about the credibility of the information. Would you mind reviewing your decision? Although it does not make any difference to the literary stature of my poet friend,anyway. Thanks, Jahid</p>

<p>The template was used on at least 25 pages before he sneakily removed it, then used "orphaned" as an excuse for deleting it. I put the template back and then he uses "CSD G4 recreation of deleted content" to try justify it.</p>
<p>As has been said http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=116 here by Blu Aardvark: "<i><b>Orphaned templates are not a CSD criterion</b> - because any admin can do what MarkSweep just did, and orphan the template to get away with deleting it. But hell, now it's gonna sit on DRV for a week, where most members of the elitist cabal will vote to keep it deleted. Not that that's what DRV is for, or anything. DRV is for determining whether the deletion was made in accordance with policy, or for determining whether events have changed significantly to warrant a review of the page's inclusion in the project. It is NOT for "Well, I don't like it, so keep deleted", as so many have used it for."</i></p>

<dd>If you want to view it as T1, you can, but you can also say it's common sense, IAR, NOT, etc. The point is, people were edit warring over the wording of the template. The template itself is not widely used, so substing and deleting was a rather elegant solution (if I do say so myself) to several problems. Whoever wanted it can still have the template text and edit it to suit their needs without getting drawn into the edit war that was going on prior to its deletion. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a>&#160;<small><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkSweep_9d72.html" title="User talk:MarkSweep">(call me collect)</a></small> 08:41, 2 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Mark, looking at the amount of flamage this has produced, I hope you understand that I disagree with you calling this solution "elegant". I don't care about this little box. I care about having a bit of peace and quiet for a change. Even if I did agree that this little template had to go, consider that there's a policy in the works that could possibly back you up in the near future. Blasting away at them now amounts to trolling or feeding the trolls, depending on personal politics. And if you think that having them disappear in a bang and then the situation will settle down after a bit of complaining, well, if I could agree with that I'd kill the damn things myself. But it's been tried, and didn't work. I've said it before and I'll say it again: Yes, things like this don't help building an encyclopedia. But the mess we're in now is actively disrupting building an encyclopedia. --<span style="font-family:monospace">&#160;<a href="../../../g/r/m/User%7EGrm_wnr_b9ae.html" title="User:Grm wnr">grm_wnr</a></span> <a href="../../../g/r/m/User_talk%7EGrm_wnr_e8bc.html" title="User talk:Grm wnr"><span style="border:1px solid;color:black;font-size:9px;padding:2px 1px 0px 1px">Esc</span></a> 11:08, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I restored this template after <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_Userbox_debates_Archive_0cad.html#Political_Parties_UserBoxes" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review/Userbox debates/Archive">this DRV debate</a>. MarkSweep has now speedied it justifying it with, among other things "common sense". I have already restored it twice, and don't want to wheel war over it. I think this is a speedy undeletion candidate as it has survived a TFD and been restored on a DRV just minutes ago. Both debates had an overwhelming majority for inclusion, and while I may not like the template, I think blatantly running against consensus like this is more damaging than the userbox ever was. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 08:55, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>For goodness' sake, it's an orphaned advocacy template. The text is still available, so if anyone really wants to use it (no takers yet), they can.

<p>That is not the point. The point is that the DRV produced overwhelming consensus to undelete. It determined that the template should not have been speedied.

<dd>I would suggest simply undeleting these, as well as the associated categories. It isn't wheel warring as the reasoning given for deletion ("orphaned") is NOT acceptable grounds for speedy deletion.

<p>This is getting bloody ridiculous. Either we should have a policy to delete these userboxes or we shouldn't delete them.

<p>Instantnood is under probation for aggressive revert warring, not using edit summaries, and renaming places. The result of the case is that any admin can page ban him for "inappropriate editing". For really aggressive edits, he's been banned entirely for a week, a week again, and two weeks. Each time he comes back and continues to play revert games. There is now a third case which will potentially ban him from the site entirely.</p>
<p>I'd like an admin to review these edits for "inappropriate editing" concering his renaming political entitites (countries, provinces etc) in line with his POV, his revert warring with multiple editors (even spread out over multiple days, he doesn't have the luxury of 3RR) and not using edit summaries.</p>

As for the <a href="../../../r/a/i/Rail_transport_in_Hong_Kong_fa8c.html" title="Rail transport in Hong Kong">rail transport in Hong Kong</a> article, I made similar improvements to both versions (mine and user:Huaiwei's, and there's actually a RfC regarding the two versions).

<dd>Tip of the iceberg because you have hundreds of similar edits that simply go unreviewed.&#160;:)</dd>
<dd>As to "only one user, user talk:Alanmak, who had kept objecting using round brackets," that exact same edit keeps getting reverted on other articles by enochlau and others as well - it's simply wrong to put parentheses around China. As well, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO OR WHY. It's your revert game that is the problem. An interesting point of that series of reverts is that you say AlanMak made the find and replace problems, but in the revert game, you're the one that restored them. That tells me you're not actually paying attention to what you're reverting. You're just doing it - a revert junkie.</dd>
<dd>If there is an RfC on an article, Rail transport in Hong Kong, then YOU, who are under probation, shouldn't be making controversial edits to it. Those who came to the article from the RfC also saw a blank talk page. Apparently playing revert was more important than trying to state your case here as well.</dd>
<dd>The templates as well, I don't know or care who is right or wrong between you and AlanMak or you and Curps. YOU, under probation, need to quit edit warring.</dd>
<dd>Macao: again, it doesn't matter why you did it or if you are right. You've shown repeatedly that you will edit war over your preferred spelling. It's not vandalism for another user to change the spelling, it's a matter of controversy - which means Instantnood should butt out and discuss, not revert.</dd>

<dd>There are often mistakes. Changes won't be perfect in one go, and very often it takes several edits to keep everything alright. Please don't count on anybody as long as the find and replace problem has been fixed. I'm not making controversial edits to <a href="../../../r/a/i/Rail_transport_in_Hong_Kong_fa8c.html" title="Rail transport in Hong Kong">rail transport in Hong Kong</a>, on the contrary I'm making the same improvements to both versions, with the version I don't preferred displayed. Please don't pretend you don't know what I've edited. As for the spelling of <i>Macao</i>, don't think I was doing anything wrong for linking to the real title, instead of a redirect, at the time of my edit. Being on probation doesn't mean every edit by you or I could be deemed controversial in such a casual manner, without looking into the details. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 22:39, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It's problematic that he should be editing it at all, and he seems unwilling to engage in Talk. He has reverted multiple times as anon, then logged in.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive77_ffa9.html" title="Edit section: HeyNow10029">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../h/e/y/User%7EHeyNow10029_96cc.html" title="User:HeyNow10029">HeyNow10029</a></span></h2>
<p>I've left several messages on the talk page of <a href="../../../h/e/y/User%7EHeyNow10029_96cc.html" title="User:HeyNow10029">HeyNow10029</a> (<a href="../../../h/e/y/User_talk%7EHeyNow10029_821a.html" title="User talk:HeyNow10029">talk</a>) concerning images that he/she uploaded. Each one lacks a fair use rationale, and despite being informed of the policies at <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use</a> and <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImages_4162.html" title="Wikipedia:Images">Wikipedia:Images</a>, the user continuously reinserts the removed images. On one occasion in the edit history of the <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kelly_Clarkson_b0db.html" title="Kelly Clarkson">Kelly Clarkson</a> article, the user wrote: "Image is fair use screenshot and should not be removed for copyright reasons, if you think there's a copyright problem get an admin to sort it out". This is rather peculiar — are they stating that removing the image from the article would qualify as copyright infringement? Unfortunately, I am not aware of all of the guidelines regarding images and screenshots, however, another user, <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a>, explained to him/her that the images did not justify as fair use. HeyNow10029 has been repeatedly insisting that because numerous other articles include images lacking fair use rationale, the Kelly Clarkson article should as well. I cannot locate the logic in this mess that has been created, but could someone help me with the situation? The current discussion between myself and this user is taking place <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:HeyNow10029#Kelly_Clarkson_image_Image:Kelly_Award.jpg" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:HeyNow10029#Kelly_Clarkson_image_Image:Kelly_Award.jpg" rel="nofollow">here</a>. —Eternal Equinox | <a href="../../../e/t/e/User_talk%7EEternal_Equinox_6bf0.html" title="User talk:Eternal Equinox">talk</a> 21:18, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>These two users have been embarking on the same types of edits that <a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELightbringer_ee74.html" title="User:Lightbringer">User:Lightbringer</a> and later <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBasil_Rathbone_9abb.html" title="User:Basil Rathbone">User:Basil Rathbone</a> had. As such, they are likely socks, and therefore at the very least are banned from editing Freemasonry-related pages, if not being banned indefinitely for being socks of a banned user. My instinct tells me they are operating on open proxies, but I have no proof of this.</p>
<p>Anderson and WMMrgn have also each betrayed information that they should not have as new users, such as Anderson12 reporting a 3RR after 7 edits, and posting a sock notice on my page as me being a user he never dealt with and should therefore not know about). Anderson12 has also deleted sections of <a href="../../../f/r/e/Talk%7EFreemasonry_dcd6.html" title="Talk:Freemasonry">Talk:Freemasonry</a>, and has c/ped another user's page verbatim (his edit history shows no interest in the Philosophy project materials he has on his userpage, which is the same MO Basil used).</p>
<p>WMMrgn has engaged in POV editing on List of Anti-Masons, and uses the same sites Lightbringer/Basil used for "support". The blatant factual errors and unsupported edits were detailed on the Talk page. There was no response from him, and the article has been protected.</p>
<p>A look at these users' edit histories (if not simply their antagonistic usernames) will quickly verify tactics. Could someone please intervene on this before it gets even more out of hand? <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 22:16, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
