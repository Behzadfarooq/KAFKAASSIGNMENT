Now you see the problem is I don't have one any more, I have intentionally locked myself out of it, and I do not want a new account for reasons I have mentioned before. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia that anyone can edit, with an account or without, and I want to edit as an IP. The ArbCom has made absolutely no restrictions on any of my editing, except saying I need to run for RfA again, so why won't Yanksox let me edit? I have never voted for anything as an IP, I have brought some info to an AfD discussion without even giving my oppinion on it, I'm not violating anything. Could someone please help me out.

<dd>Thatcher131, could you please remove the voided section from the "final result" then?

<dd>Having been one of the people active in workshopping that case (although I was not officially a party), this issue was specifically raised by me as well. It was specifically agreed by the arbitrator who had originally proposed the ban that because the one-month ban was not enacted, the proposed enforcement was vitiated and did not take effect. It is clear that this user is free to resume editing at any time. Beyond that, he was a fine editor and administrator until the events that led to the case (which should not be rehashed) and I would strongly <i>encourage</i> him to resume editing. However, I also urge him to assume the good faith of anyone who was misled by the wording on the arbitration case page. Frankly, I was afraid that precisely this would happen and I should have stuck to my guns that the page needed to be fixed at the time (I was the only one commenting by the end of the case and I didn't feel I should push another point, but I wish now that I had.) <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 02:41, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you Thatcher&amp; Newyorkbrad. Before I kill someone I will go stop editing again. Nobody wants to hear my explanations, and even Thatcher's explanation (where he provided the exact same diff as me...) was ignored when I was just blocked. Wikipedia is just too hard. If I don't create a new account this happens, if I create a new account I will piss off other people, it's a deadlock.--<a href="../../../2/0/3/User%7E203.109.209.49.html" title="User:203.109.209.49">203.109.209.49</a> 02:46, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I assume you would rather not have a connection to your old name? Otherwise you could create User:Konstable III and just link to this explanation.

<dd>Yes Ten its a bit silly, but as Ive explaned to Ned, this is a reaction to his recent block. 12 hrs and it will be over! I have had some words with THB to assure him that he is not under attack. So please dont make me look like a liar! I have asked all admins to cool down and give some space. This is working at present so i would ask once more for Admins to show good judgement and AGF in THBs case. Also reporting here what he is doing on his own user page is likely to increase his paranoia so I would ask that unless THB violates any rules, that we all stop talking about him here.

<p>Could someone please take a look at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Human_rights_of_Kurdish_people_in_Turkey_5de9.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Human rights of Kurdish people in Turkey">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Human rights of Kurdish people in Turkey</a>? This AfD ran out of control when one deletion proponent got rather upset about what he suspected to be a WP:POINT article creation and a votestacking campaign on the keep side (an unproven but not quite baseless suspicion). Debate ran extremely hot bordering on personal attacks; then the article was moved and merged with other material while the Afd was still running; wherupon some votes were changed and the whole picture is rather muddled now. Right now, spirits are hopefully quieting down again. I've suggested an early provisional close, for later reexamination. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 16:00, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I do not mind it when people disagree with me, I just find the entire afd procedure broken for quite some time. Star Trek afds are a mere example.<br />
Think it this way: if vote stacking did happen in the afd, history will simply repeat itself on deletion review.<br />

<p>There should be a deletion process with an extended probationary period to allow for discovery of reliable sources, and then an objective decision based only on the multitude, reliability, triviality, etc. of the sources. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 10:18, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>If you mean that topics for which there exist reliable sources should not have articles, this would be a deletion mechanism alongside AfD, to cover the many AfDs where sourcing and notability based on sourcing is the problem and reason for deletion. Articles that belong deleted even with sources could still be deleted on AfD. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 02:16, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Problematic user, please review. I erred by assuming good faith and inexperience yesterday and only blocking him for 3 hours for POV-pushing and edit-warring on <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>. He has since moved on to <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argentina.html" title="Argentina">Argentina</a> where he recently made (I think) his fourth revert in trying to change the map from a png to a gif he has made. He made a complaint about me here yesterday for what I think he sees as my interference with his aim of changing several fairly controversial articles (<a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> and <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falkland_Islands_2644.html" title="Falkland Islands">Falkland Islands</a> have also received his attention) to conform with his own POV, without any regard for consensus or discussion towards such. I said at the time it would be better if his next block came from someone else; I think the time has now come for other admins to review his edits and take whatever action they deem necessary. Thanks in advance. --<a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinnog_5d26.html" title="User:Guinnog">Guinnog</a> 23:55, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree that the combination of his behaviour and apparent political motives are worrying.

<dd>Thanks a lot Sam. Yes, some (though still a minority I think) of his ideas are actually quite reasonable ones, and some of his edits before he got into these controversial areas were of good quality. It is the people skills that seem to let him down and I think he may need mentoring of some kind if he is to survive here, assuming he wishes to continue after his block. --<a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinnog_5d26.html" title="User:Guinnog">Guinnog</a> 04:17, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I also reverted the page to Xandar's version, since I felt it was best to have the version which didn't make controversial accusations be the one visible while the issue is discussed. <a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBharatveer_2e1b.html" title="User:Bharatveer">User:Bharatveer</a> then reverted my revert, giving a very similar edit summary to mine (how his version can be considered the safer version, he didn't explain). I reverted him and left a message on his talk page asking him not to revert again and saying I'd protect the page if he did. He did revert again, leaving a message on my talk page about placing disputed tags rather than removing the text. I reverted again (my 3rd revert, for those counting), and protected the page. Opinions, please. --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> 15:46, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Generally, I would agree that admins should protect whatever version is showing when they get there but, in cases of controversial accusations, I think it's best to play safe. There was debate on the talk page as the whether or not the accusations were verifiable, so playing safe meant I assumed they weren't and removed them. I didn't investigate to see if they were valid or not (I since have, and I don't think the source given is very reliable, it's an opinion piece.) - that's a content issue and is "not my job" for want of a better phrase. --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> 20:28, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I object to the behaviour of Nick. He initially asked me for an explanation on my talk page and when I asked him to be more specific he responded sarcasticly (bordering on uncivil) and reported me here without actually discussing the matter with me first, what was the point in going to my talk page if you weren't going to actually talk to me? He then created a new section which has the only effect of giving his comments more weight that those that have gone before. He has misrepresented my actions in his description - he says I called my version the safest version, which is nonsense, when I used that edit summary it was my first edit to the page, how could it be my version? I was never in a content war, I was simply determining what version should be there while the discussion takes place, I have no opinion on what version is the better one, only which is the safer until consensus is reached. Also, he quotes me as saying I used "admin discretion", I never used that phrase or anything similar, I have no idea what he's refering to. He says that I didn't apologise for my actions when I explained them here - that's because I was the one that brought the matter here. Why would I apologise when I hadn't been told I'd done anything wrong (other than by someone already involved on the page)? I was asking for a 2nd opinion (and the one I got was that I'd done the right thing), if I felt I had anything to apologise for, I simply wouldn't have protected the page in the first place. Nick is trying to make out that I've refused to listen to criticism, which is complete nonsense, I was the one that came here to ask for criticism in the first place! --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> 18:32, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In my opinion a better way <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">User:Tango</a> may have approached this by requesting protection at <a href="../../../r/f/p/WP%7ERFPP_fba0.html" title="WP:RFPP">WP:RFPP</a> or ask other admins to protect the page since he reverted the article <b>OR</b> revert then immediately protect, <a href="../../../p/p/o/WP%7EPPol_0bed.html" title="WP:PPol">WP:PPol</a> did say that admins are allowed to "<i>Reverting to an old version of the page from a week or so before the controversy started if there is a clear point before the controversy.</i>". Though I would say the outcome of the page is likely to be exactly the same as it is currently, so I would say this is more of a procedural issue than an abuse of admin power. --<a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWinhunter_d2c4.html" title="User:Winhunter">WinHunter</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../w/i/n/User_talk%7EWinhunter_2903.html" title="User talk:Winhunter">talk</a>)</sup> 07:28, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ach, this isn't good at all. It's always better to get a second opinion when tools are needed in a content dispute, and I think Tango got involved wrt content here.

<dd>Rollback is only to be used for removing vandalism. If you're mechanically reverting someone thrice over, you might want to take a step back and realize, that while technically not violating 3RR, you are violating the spirit of it. Ideally you want to cool-off revert wars; one good way to do that is to put further rationale in your edit summaries. If you don't provide any new information and use a standard admin rollback edit summary, they're just going to keep pushing back. Please stop using admin rollback except when dealing with the specific situations it is authorized for. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 17:48, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There's a problem at that page. It desperately needs some serious intervention by uninvolved parties to try to clean up/mediate the dispute. It's also obvious that Tango should never have protected the page after getting involved in a content dispute, and definitely should not have reverted it after protecting it. The important question is "what next"? Tango has reverted to what he called a "safe version". That would be ok if this were a BLP issue, or some other libel issue. However, the version he reverted to lacks sources, while the one he reverted is sourced. A quick look over the talk page suggests that the issues have been discussed and the sources are fairly reliable.</p>
<ol>
<li>Page protection seems reasonable. Tango shouldn't have been the person to do it, but that's just bureaucracy. He did the right thing even if he broke some rules.
<dl>
<dd>I think the page should be protected until the issues can be sorted out finally and more outside editors involved.</dd>
<dd>I trust that Tango will bear in mind these issues in the future.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Reverting after protection was uncalled for - there were no burning legal issues, as far as I can tell (I may have missed something, there's an awful lot of back and forth here). The other version is better sourced, but per "wrong version" that shouldn't be the issue here.
<dl>
<dd>Assuming that there are no legal issue, Tango's revert should be undone. The page should spend its "protection" in the version that was actually protected.</dd>

<dd>All right I'll speak frankly: Tango stepped into a very rough situation and did (his?) best. As Sir Nicholas states, I agree it would have been better to have either protected whatever version was current or to have asked other administrators for input. Any page protection during a content dispute is likely to draw accusations of administrative bias or misconduct (no matter how spotless the administrator's conduct and reputation actually are). So by rolling back or reverting for anything other than the most narrow paramaters such as <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> compliance, an administrator runs the risk of inflaming the dispute rather than quelling it. I think I see the point Tango was trying to make in the caution, and I also see how that went over: sysop tools seem much less important to people who have them than to people who don't. Administrators are expected to have the wisdom of Solomon in the messiest situations, so even when I might choose differently I usually respect others' decisions. Yet I've been uneasy about this particular action because it's right at the outer limit of what's acceptable, maybe a few inches beyond it. I wonder what's the fairest way to take a few steps back and defuse the dispute. <font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charg</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><span style="color:#0c0">e!</span></a></i></sup></font> 17:18, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I don't think the page should be changed at this point. The edit war is stopped and users are discussing sources on the talk page.

<p>I apply the principle of <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">WP:BOLD</a> to administration, just as I do to editing. I do what I think is best (within my interpretation of policy, and using <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> where necessary), and then if I think what I've done might be controversial, I come here and ask for people's opinions. In this case, I recieved two responses in the first couple of days, one was an admin endorsing my decision, and the other was a non-admin involved in the page who questioned it and then didn't reply to my response. If what I did was so terrible, why didn't anyone say so when I first brought this matter up for review? This page is watched by a large number of admins, I'm sure plenty of them saw my message and they obviously decided it did not require comment, which is an implicit endorsement of my actions. Had an admin suggested I undo the action when I first made it, I would probably have done so (depending on their reasoning), but no-one did. There is now a discussion going on on the talk page, and hopefully those involved will soon reach a consensus, if not the matter can be refered to the dispute resolution procedures. Undoing an action like mine 2 days after it happened would do more harm than good. I strongly support admins reviewing eachother's actions and speaking up if they disagree, but reviewing days old actions is of limited use. Try monitoring this page more closely in future, and perhaps your opinions can be taken into account before a decision becomes difficult to reverse. --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> 18:07, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Tango, it is fine to be bold to stop a revert war. It is not fine to become involved in a revert war, use your admin rollback button in that revert war, and then protect the version you prefer. I can understand the accidental use of the rollback button to revert something that is not obvious vandalism, but twice? And protecting an article where you have just been engaging in an edit war is unacceptable. We hold the admin tools in trust. You have betrayed that trust. I normalloy would not be commenting on this, but you do not seem to understand the seriousness of what you have done. Your actions, and your refusal to acknowledge how wrong they were, cast a cloud over all admins. -- <b><a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalbury_e849.html" title="User talk:Dalbury"><font color="navy">Donald Albury</font></a></b> 18:22, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Then why did you keep reverting? It was an edit war. You used your admin rollback button. Are you claiming you were reverting vandalism? That's the only excuse for doing what you did. But, protecting an article that you have just reverted three times is the biggest problem. Once you reverted the article the first time, you were obligated to not use your admin tools. If you wanted to stop an edit war, you should have protected the article without making any edits to it. Appearances are, in a sense, just as important as intentions. You have created the appearance that you have used your admin tools to gain an advantage in a content dispute. You may say that it was not a content dispute, but I don't understand then why you were edit warring. -- <b><a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalbury_e849.html" title="User talk:Dalbury"><font color="navy">Donald Albury</font></a></b> 18:52, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'll accept that every version is wrong and a discussion of sources would do this article much more good. If keeping the current wrong version helps that discussion move forward then so be it. Tango, the reason I didn't speak up sooner was that when I saw this I scratched my head a bit, wondered whether the uneasy feeling was just me, and moved on. I noticed this was ongoing today and realized I wasn't the only person who had some misgivings. Maybe I should have spoken sooner, in which case I apologize.

<p>Ok, let me try and work out exactly what the problem is here. Consider this alternative: Rather than reverting 3 times, as I did, what if I'd protected after the first revert (the manual one, so rollback doesn't come into it)? Is the problem that I chose a version to protect, or is it that I reverted to that version a few times before protecting? --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> 21:27, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>At the risk of repeating others here, since you still don't seem to grasp it, this is the problem. First, you shouldn't have been edit warring at all. No matter what the problem was, that is not how we solve disputes; we use calm and amicable <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">dispute resolution</a>. There should be no admin who doesn't hold that opinion. You shouldn't have been using rollback on good faith content edits. It's rude and furthers ill-will. You absolutely shouldn't have protected when you were involved in the edit war, and even more so should not have protected to your preferred version. That isn't really negotiable at all. Administrators are expected to protect the version they encounter, not the one they prefer. Finally, after all this, clear involvement in the dispute, you shouldn't be making threats to block other editors on that article's talk page. You seem not to be understanding the distinction between your involvement as an editor and your invovlement as an administrator; don't mix these. To answer the specific question: no, neither of those are good options. Why is "talk," rather than hitting your admin buttons at all, not one of your solutions? <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 10:03, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I won't repeat what Dmcdevit and others have said above. I would only like to say that I do not endorse the use of roll-back. I would have protected the article as it was if there were no concerns about BLP. The use of roll-back combined with protection looks bad and makes it look like Tango wanted to protect his "own version" after revert-warring. I appreciate what Tango tried to do but it is now obvious that one side of the edit-war will never see Tango as a neutral admin. So I advise Tango to allow any other admin to mediate the dispute. I am willing to look into the matter if no other admin is currently mediating the dispute. - <a href="../../../a/k/s/User%7EAksi_great_bb76.html" title="User:Aksi great">Aksi_great</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/s/User_talk%7EAksi_great_f9ab.html" title="User talk:Aksi great">talk</a>) 10:43, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was never involved as an editor, as I've repeatedly said and no-one seems to understand - I've never even read the article, I've just looked at the diffs and the talk page. I was reverting to what I felt was the safer version to have showing during discussion - I know there is no BLP concern, but a quick look at the talk page will tell you there are some very strongly held opinions on the subject nevertheless. Even if I was wrong to select a safe version in this situation, that doesn't change the fact that I was acting as an administrator, not an editor and was not involved in any content decisions. And how you can call Bharatveer's reverts "good faith", I don't know. He was using misleading edit summaries and reverting when as administrator had specificly asked him not do. I don't think it quite counts as vandalism, but it wasn't done in good faith. --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> 15:31, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Tango, I understand why you don't think you were involved in the editing dispute, and honestly, I don't think you chose a side or have a preferred version of the page--to me it looks like you were trying to get editors to discuss whether a controversial source should be included or not. And personally, given the tone of some of the comments on the talk page, I also think a warning about incivility and personal attacks was warranted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Still, if a page is undergoing an edit war it's best to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest. Once you revert an edit, no matter what your intentions, it looks like you've made a decision about what the content of the article should be--in other words it looks like you're no longer neutral. Like Aksi_great said, some of the editors in that dispute will never see you as impartial now, so it would be best if Aksi_great or some other admin could step in. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 18:06, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>When I reverted with an edit summary saying not to revert again, I considered that a kind of "soft protection". It allows people to continue to edit the article, but makes it perfectly clear that they should not continuing reverting. It seems such a soft approach doesn't work and I should have just protected it from the start. I've already said that reverting to a "safe version" was, with hindsight, a mistake. As for using rollback, if people feel that strongly about it, then fine, but to me it's just a convinience - the automatic edit summary doesn't say it's vandalism, it just says it's reverting edits, I could type that edit summary myself after a manual revert and it would be perfectly acceptable and there would be no way for you to tell the difference. If you can't tell the difference between two things and one is acceptable, then they both are acceptable - that's simple logic. And I will not apologise for threatening to block people for incivility - that's simply enforcement of policy. --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> 12:26, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>Tango, the point is "you just don't seem to get it". You do not revert when you are a neutral party, or simply acting like it. Why are you continuing with your lame arguments? At one point you are saying that the administrators saw that and did not comment means that it was an implicit acceptance of what you did. When they commented, you have been asking them to "<i>stop repeating yourselves</i>". — <a href="../../../s/i/r/User_talk%7ESir_Nicholas_de_Mimsy-Porpington_ae26.html" title="User talk:Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington"><font color="black"><b>Nearly Headless Nick</b></font></a> 12:36, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Update: thus far at least eight editors have posted on his talk page with links, information, and requests - even pleas - to stop this disruptive behavior. He has yet to acknowledge that he may be in error; and in fact continues to assert he is correct, calling American English "a regional variation of English" which he seems to concede might be acceptable for specifically American subjects, maintaining that in <b>all other cases</b> he is changing to "International English, not North American English" - with the clear implication that UK spelling is International and Preferred. This is now spread over at least three user talk pages and I don't know how many article talk pages. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a><sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a></sup> 15:56, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hello, I have never posted here, so bear with me. On this page, a disagreement towards the subject matter has caused a war with important information being added, then removed.

<dd>I just put my two cents in on that article's talk page, with a compromise proposal. Since you're both in violation of 3RR, but at the same time are the only two disputants, I think that blocking you both will hinder us finding some sort of resolution, so I'm inclined to let it go - but am posting here in case any other admins think I'm getting soft around the holidays ... | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">Mr. Darcy</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a></small> 20:10, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not sure if that bug is the best way to fix the problem. Just protecting templates that are on the main page, and those being used on that day's featured article then <i>unprotecting them when they leave the main page</i>, is probably best. Incidentially, a status report on unprotected main page templates could be used by vandals, so it might be best to restrict access to admins somehow. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 16:38, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey, I've written a bot that checks the protection status of pages transcluded onto the Main Page. Anyone think I should ask for bot approval? <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadow1_a579.html" title="User:Shadow1"><font color="olive">Shadow1</font></a> <a href="../../../s/h/a/User_talk%7EShadow1_f31d.html" title="User talk:Shadow1">(talk)</a> 17:10, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I would ask for approval, since it only reads and I suppose writes a single report it should be apporved quickly. Thanks for building it, question, does it go into the templates on the main page and look for templates transcluded in that one and so on up the chain? Or does it only check the first level? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 17:11, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

A petition was put on his Talk page requesting his resignation, as per his own statement. <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">User:Hipocrite</a>, who is deeply involved in all of the RD drama, has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AFriday&amp;diff=96327321&amp;oldid=96325393" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AFriday&amp;diff=96327321&amp;oldid=96325393" rel="nofollow">deleted the petition</a>. I am not about to get into an edit war over this, but I think that Hipocrite's action is unacceptable, especially as there were several supporters of the petition in good standing, and Friday certainly had the opportunity to remove it from his Talk page if he so wanted. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe">(talk)</a> 22:25, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't give a fuck about those redirects personally. I think they're a bit borderline myself, but they were referred to RfD and the RfD was closed as a "keep".

<dd>I believe Centrx explained (in his unblock request, not now currently visible as far as I know) that he had not been aware of the results of the RfD discussions. I agree that it is better for admins to include a deletion summary when deleting. What I don't understand is why the question of why these deletions was not addressed to Centrx <i>before</i> blocking for one week. That sort of block without an opportunity to explain, in a non-emergency situation, shouldn't be applied to <i>any</i> good-faith user, much less an experienced administrator. And I am concerned that your comment above plus <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Philwelch&amp;diff=96184321&amp;oldid=96182794" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Philwelch&amp;diff=96184321&amp;oldid=96182794" rel="nofollow">[50]</a> auger an upcoming <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> violation.

<p>Right now, after scouring through the RfD logs now (as there is no indication in page histories on which day in the preceding 3 weeks the RfD occurred), I found the discussion at <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirects_for_discussion_Log_2006_December_4_d3d0.html#Price_is_Right_redirects" title="Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion/Log/2006 December 4">Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion/Log/2006 December 4#Price is Right redirects</a>, in which <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">User:Philwelch</a> states at the end "Despite high support for keeping, many of these were improperly speedied as G6's. This is an abuse of CSD and I would like to advise Gh87, as well as the deleting admins, never to do this again." I'm not sure whether his "advice" means he was going to block anyone who had been involved in the previous discussion or deletion, but I received no advice from him and was not involved in the discussion or previous deletions. I come back today merely to find "This is a reckless abuse of your administrative privileges and you have accordingly been blocked for a week. If you promise to be more careful in the future I can unblock you, but you made a pretty significant mistake without explanation or justification"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ACentrx&amp;diff=96070840&amp;oldid=96032940" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ACentrx&amp;diff=96070840&amp;oldid=96032940" rel="nofollow">[52]</a>. "Reckless abuse" is an absurd claim, and this is a <i>punitive</i> block; if one simply made a mistake and need only go hat in hand to Philwelch to promise not to do it again, there is nothing that would warrant blocking.

<dd>Maybe we should be more ruthless against recurrent vandalism—or maybe we should have higher standards for administrators. If there's an RfD specifically closed by an administrator <i>other than myself</i> as a "keep", you don't delete. If there's an RfD ongoing for redirects that don't fit the Criteria for Speedy Deletion, you don't speedy delete. And if you do delete something, whether or not you're bending the rules or applying the "snowball rule", you should at least put some explanation in the deletion summary. All that I've been doing here is cleaning up after admins too careless or lazy to check the page history for edit summaries clearly labeled with things like "2006-12-15— RFD closed as "keep". <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Philwelch</a> 00:14, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The explanation for anything deleted with the auto "Content was..." rather than a specific summary is the relevant speedy deletion criteria. Any cleanup or questions related to it can be directed to the deleting administrator. A "higher standard" for administrators would entail knowledge of blocking policy.

<dd>There's a speedy deletion criteria that applied to these? Which one? "Centrx disagrees with the result of this RfD"?

It's easy enough to "get someone's attention" by leaving them a talk message and triggering that nice big orange banner. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmasterka_6922.html" title="User:Grandmasterka"><font color="red">Grand</font></a><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrandmasterka_5f38.html" title="User talk:Grandmasterka"><font color="green">master</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Grandmasterka_b497.html" title="Special:Contributions/Grandmasterka"><font color="red">ka</font></a> 01:20, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I've come to a bit of three-pronged conclusion: (1) admins should, as has been encouraged for my entire tenure here, check page history and "whatlinkshere" before deleting, as doing so can reveal vandalism, disruption, or prior XfDs, and Centrx probably should have done so in this case; (2) one should not block a fellow administrator without first attempting to resolve the situation through less draconian means, blocks are preventive, and we have talk pages for a reason; (3) with best possible respect, this may be a good time to consider an RfC regarding Philwelch's apparent abuse of the block tool. As both users have certified, there was no contact between the two of them, prior to the block, which indicates to me that no attempt was made to resolve this before blocking -- see <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELuna_Santin_1cab.html" title="User:Luna Santin">Luna Santin</a> 01:33, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I removed them because they're unnecessary harassment over two cases that have already been discussed and resolved. *This* case has already been discussed and resolved. I suggested in no uncertain terms that you leave me alone when you harassed me privately, on my talk page. That does not give you license to harass me publicly here. I came here, briefly discussed the reasoning behind my decision, and let it go. I advise you to do the same. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Philwelch</a> 01:39, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm more concerned that Philwelch blocked Centrx <i>while</i> he was in a wheel war with him as under no circumstances are administrators to block someone they are in a dispute with. This is grounds for a RFAR case if there is indeed a history of questioned administrator actions, so I would suggest that you take that avenue to settle things quickly. <a href="../../../c/o/w/User%7ECowman109_5ea9.html" title="User:Cowman109"><font color="DarkGreen">Cowman109</font></a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/w/User_talk%7ECowman109_260b.html" title="User talk:Cowman109">Talk</a></sup> 01:42, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I wasn't in a wheel war with him, and as far as I am aware, things are settled. He was unblocked. I'm letting it go. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Philwelch</a> 01:44, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>If those previous cases were discussed and resolved you could have and can still direct me and others to those discussions. This case here is clearly not resolved, and I hope your "advice" here is not the same warning you have given others before, i.e. you threatening to block those who disagree with you. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 01:48, 24 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This case clearly is resolved—you have been unblocked and I have chosen not to contest the issue. I even concede that the initial block was in error. What else do you want of me? As for the rest of your message, I am not going to dignify your harassment and personal attacks with any further response. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Philwelch</a> 01:53, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The ArbCom has just set a record for the most cases accepted in one week, and is going to have a horrible backlog when the new arbitrators are appointed soon, so I hesitate to recommend sending any more disputes in that direction if there are any alternatives. I do have thoughts on the blocking history here, but don't know whether sharing them would help solve an issue or just fan the flames. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 01:50, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I noticed all this, at some point, since I've got Sir Nick's user talk watchlisted. I hadn't looked at everything involved, and wasn't aware of a prior block until now, but I agree the user was being pretty confrontational. If they're planning on starting an RfC or RfAr, the proper course of action is to just do so; no need for rummaging around so harshly on various user talks.

<p>I stumbled in here because a user informed me a couple of days ago that Cindery was on vacation. However, that doesn't appear to be the case, given her recent activities. I did some digging and found a few diffs that might warrant consideration.</p>

<dd><i>ceyockey comment</i>: In response to badlydrawnjeff's comment ... is it not wise for Wikipedia to follow rather than lead in an area like this? In other words, should Wikipedia not persist in utilizing the old standard until the new is in use across the majority of the heavily used resources (such as LOC)? That might seem stuffy from a technology standpoint, but it is consistent with maximum resource accessibility, which is important for Wikipedia as a whole. --User:Ceyockey (<small><i><a href="../../../c/e/y/User_talk%7ECeyockey_b802.html" title="User talk:Ceyockey">talk to me</a></i></small>) 23:17, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The word "standard", as in "International Standard Book Number", seems to me to imply something that is widely used. If 13-digit ISBNs aren't currently recognised by some of the significant relevant organisations, then they're not really "standard" and we shouldn't be using them until they are. To use Ceyockey's wording, we should definitely be following in this case rather than leading; others may have a responsibility to lead, but our responsibility is to our readers. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 00:16, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As I understand it (and books are my profession), this *is* the lead. We would, in fact, be following. We, of course, are in a position of ease, being able to handle both easily and without any troublesome operations overlap. Given that the standard doesn't go into effect until 1 Jan 2007, perhaps that's why places like the LOC aren't allowing searches by it yet, but no one's expecting Wikipedia to be first on the block as much as up to date. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 05:06, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>I seem to recall reading on the official ISBN web page that it is prudent to use <i>both</i> forms during and immediately after the transition period. Why don't we do this? We could provide both the 10- and 13-digit ISBNs in the articles themselves. (We might even be able to do this automatically, if wiki markup can do simple arithmetic and conditionals; we would have a template which took an ISBN in either form and produced output in both forms.) Alternatively (or in addition), we could change the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Wikipedia%7EBook_sources_341d.html" title="Wikipedia:Book sources">Wikipedia:Book sources</a> syntax so that instead of MAGICNUMBER, each entry uses either MAGICNUMBER10 (for book sources that require a 10-digit ISBN), MAGICNUMBER13 (for book sources which require a 13-digit ISBN), or MAGICNUMBER (for book sources which can use either format). Whatever engine converts <a href="../../../b/o/o/Wikipedia%7EBook_sources_341d.html" title="Wikipedia:Book sources">Wikipedia:Book sources</a> to <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBook_sources_f27d.html" title="Special:Book sources">Special:Book sources</a> would obviously need to do the ISBN conversions as well. —<a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychonaut_e6a0.html" title="User:Psychonaut">Psychonaut</a> 11:34, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi guys, as you can imagine I have goven this matter some thought over the past year. The "problem" is not without solutions, and the "solutions" are not without their problems.</dd>
<dd>The first thing to say (s that the transition period is 2005-2006, effectively everyone should support 13 digit by the end of the year, and from the beginning of 2007 no one need support 10. Clearly support for 10 digits will continue for a considerable time: Why would anyone remove it? However the next crunch point is when 979 ISBNs come into play- they have no 10 digit equivalent.</dd>

<dd>I'd like to toss in a lone voice here <i>against</i> conversion, at all. Sure, give ISBN-13 in preference for books printed in 2006 and after (though even many 2006 editions are missing ISBN-13, says my cataloguing experience) but leave earlier books as ISBN-10. The systems will still support querying for ISBN-10 - they have to, as no-one is going to recatalogue and recalculate every ISBN in their records - and we avoid the conceptually messy issue of giving a reference number to a book retroactively, which is what originally worried me. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimgray_a1bc.html" title="User:Shimgray">Shimgray</a> | <a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShimgray_87de.html" title="User talk:Shimgray">talk</a> | 13:08, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First, let me say that I am no computer guru and I really don't understand much of the above discussion. However, I agree with <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimgray_a1bc.html" title="User:Shimgray">Shimgray</a>'s comments. My engineering text (which was self published and has been on the market for over 10 years) is now in its 4th edition. In one of the first few pages, all editions of my book display the 10-digit ISBN. It does not have a 13-digit ISBN to my knowledge. If Bowker (the company that assigns ISBN numbers) converts my ISBN to 13 digits, my inventory of books will still include only the 10 digit ISBN. I am sure that the large publishers also have thousands of books in inventory that display only the 10-digit ISBN. So no matter what deadline has been set for the conversion to be complete, thousands of books printed pre-2006 will still display only the 10-digit form. That is the reason why Wikipedia must find a way to let us use 10-digit and/or 13-digit ISBNs and some way of making sure that sources such as the Library of Congress can find the book no matter which form of ISBN is used in the Wikipedia {{cite book}} template. - <a href="../../../m/b/e/User%7EMbeychok_616b.html" title="User:Mbeychok">mbeychok</a> 18:58, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, the problem is I often enter ISBNs from printed sources. Perhaps the solution is to have an ISBN template that can differentiate between 10 and 13? If it's 10, link to the 13. If it's 13, link LoC to the 10 (I assume back conversion is possible?) That'd be my suggestion but I don't know how technically feasible it is. <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 06:38, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Justin322 (<a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJustin322_4fab.html" title="User talk:Justin322">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Justin322_8579.html" title="Special:Contributions/Justin322">contribs</a>)'s entire contribution history is a bit...odd, all 20 edits of it. His first edit is to slap a {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-bio_ac6d.html" title="Template:Db-bio">db-bio</a>}} tag on <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panaca%2C_Nevada_38e9.html" title="Panaca, Nevada">Panaca, Nevada</a> (yes, it's a town). After that's removed as bogus, he nominates <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panaca%2C_Nevada_38e9.html" title="Panaca, Nevada">Panaca, Nevada</a> for <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Panaca%2C_Nevada_f52f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Panaca, Nevada">deletion</a>. The nomination is speedily closed -- though not before he's had time to delete <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Panaca%2C_Nevada&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=96107322" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Panaca%2C_Nevada&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=96107322" rel="nofollow">someone else's "Keep" comment</a>. Stymied, he's resorted to blanking the article in favor of a redirect to <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lincoln_County%2C_Nevada_2a05.html" title="Lincoln County, Nevada">Lincoln County, Nevada</a>, which I've reverted, with him labelling his subsequent reversions as "rvv". Next stop is <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_3RR_4b52.html" title="WP:AN/3RR">WP:AN/3RR</a>, where I'm reported as a violator, with the claim that his <i>bete noir</i> article should be merged into <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lincoln_County%2C_Nevada_2a05.html" title="Lincoln County, Nevada">Lincoln County, Nevada</a> -- not that he was doing that, either (the 3RR violation report has been rejected by <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp">User:Alphachimp</a>). The rest of Justin322's contributions are deleting various warnings and messages from his talk page, calling them vandalism from a "troll". In short, an {{<a href="../../../s/p/a/Template%7ESpa_94ad.html" title="Template:Spa">spa</a>}}, albeit a peculiar purpose. I assume this will peter out now, but just in case... --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 22:03, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I created the damned thing two years ago, which is an awful long way to reach back for a grudge.
