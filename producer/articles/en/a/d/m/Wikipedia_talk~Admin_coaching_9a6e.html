<dd>Just my two cents- I really like the subpage system that Fang Aili set up. It looked much simpler on the main page, and kept things very organized.

<dd>I'm truly sorry to have had to do this, but I've reverted your addition of <b>67369</b> characters of text (the whole requests section) to the requests listing. The best way to list unassigned ones is to make a very concise listing for each prospective coachee on the requests page, using the details at <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_Admin_coaching_Requests_Archive_908b.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza/Admin coaching/Requests/Archive">the archives</a>.

<p>When I get a little time here in the next few days/weeks, I'd like to revamp the project page.</p>
<ol>
<li>The <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_Admin_coaching_Coaching_box_0225.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza/Admin coaching/Coaching box">coaching box</a> is redundant with the <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_Admin_coaching_Status_7f4e.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza/Admin coaching/Status">status page</a>.</li>
<li>The volunteers should be listed on their own page.</li>
<li>The coaching requests should be listed on their own page.</li>
</ol>
<p>Basically I would like to simplify the project page so it's easier to navigate. If you have any objections/ideas please let me know. I will probably scrap the coaching box, because the status page lists that information and more. And separate pages for volunteers and requests will make the main page easier to read, and requests can be easily removed once they are fulfilled. --<a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFang_Aili_a8ed.html" title="User:Fang Aili">Fang Aili</a> <sup><a href="../../../f/a/n/User_talk%7EFang_Aili_6d94.html" title="User talk:Fang Aili"><font color="green">talk</font></a></sup> 18:42, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ugh, I just lost all my messages to this page in an edit conflict. Oops. Basically, the forum page method works well, but was only partially implemented - the part that wasn't implemented yet was to simply place "(assigned)" next to each student as they get a coach. It then becomes a simple matter of working down the list. This retains the message threads, which makes the program much more organic. &#160;<i><b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Transhumanist_1191.html" title="User:The Transhumanist"><font color="purple">Th<font color="blue">e Tr<font color="#9ACD32">ans<font color="#FFCC00">hu<font color="orange">man<font color="red">ist</font> &#160;&#160;</font></font></font></font></font></a></b></i>00:33, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Not really, as the page (as it was, and is) will scare off any potential admin helper (it scared me!). If you take a look at the <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_Admin_coaching_Requests_e95a.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza/Admin coaching/Requests">new reqeusts page</a>, you'll see that Fang Alai is planning to get those unassigned fromt he old list and add them, in a simple way, to the new. As the page (now and proposed) is a requests listing, it shouldn't really be treated as a forum, lest it becomes too unweildy (as it is now!!). Can I please encourage you, Transhumanist, to revert back to the subpage version and help by adding to the list of unassigned coachees?

<p>I'm wondering, I used to be an admin coach but removed myself when I left the wiki for a few months. I'd like to help out with this program again, so my question is, since I am no longer a member of Esperanza would it be a fallible assumption that I can just re-add myself to the active coaches page? <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledgeOfSelf_7104.html" title="User:KnowledgeOfSelf"><font color="#151B8D">K</font><font color="#7D1B7E">O</font><font color="#6D7B8D">S</font></a> | <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledgeOfSelf_36c0.html" title="User talk:KnowledgeOfSelf"><font color="#461B7E">talk</font></a> 00:04, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia_talk%7EAdmin_coaching_9a6e.html" title="Edit section: Proposed new instructions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Proposed new instructions</span></h2>
<p>Here's an idea for you to think about: we could write some simple instructions for coaches, so that they can process the request list as they become avaiable to coach. There's lots of coaches compared to coordinators, so shifting the burden to them spreads the work out so it doesn't overload one or two people. (That has contributed to the bottleneck). For example, the instructions to coaches could read something like this:</p>
<p>To select a coachee and begin his or her training, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>During a shortage of coaches please take on as many students as you believe you can comfortably handle. Also keep in mind that coaches can team up to share one or more students.</li>
<li>Starting at the top of the <b><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_Admin_coaching_Requests_e95a.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza/Admin coaching/Requests">request page</a></b>, find the first entry that says "(unassigned)".</li>
<li>Change the status to "(assigned)".</li>
<li>Add a note just below the heading that says "<i>paired with ___________.</i>" (Fill in the blank with your username.</li>
<li>Contact the coachee to inform him or her that you are his or her coach.</li>
<li>If it turns out they already have a coach, then make a "<i>paired with</i>" note of the assignment on the request page, and move on to the next available entry.</li>
<li>Once you've received confirmation from the coachee, set up a subpage of his or her userpage called "Admin coaching". If you have or expect to have more than one coachee, set the subpage up under your own userpage and instruct your students on that page. Make sure they know where their training shall be taking place.</li>
<li>Add a link leading to the admin coaching subpage you've created on the central list at <b><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_Admin_coaching_Coaching_advice_pages_7188.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza/Admin coaching/Coaching advice pages">Wikipedia:Esperanza/Admin coaching/Coaching advice pages</a></b>.</li>
</ol>
<p>So instead of contacting the coachees, we should contact the current coaches on the list with an email pointing to the new instructions. New coaches will automatically see the instructions wherever they sign up. This will free up coordinators so they more easily oversee that everything is running smoothly.</p>
<p>Any thoughts? &#160;<i><b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Transhumanist_1191.html" title="User:The Transhumanist"><font color="purple">Th<font color="blue">e Tr<font color="#9ACD32">ans<font color="#FFCC00">hu<font color="orange">man<font color="red">ist</font> &#160;&#160;</font></font></font></font></font></a></b></i>05:36, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have several concerns.
<ol>
<li>I disagree with the (unassigned) and (assigned) stuff because I do not think the request list should be handled that way. It should be a simple numbered and dated list. Please see the <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia_talk%7EEsperanza_Admin_coaching_Requests_2718.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Esperanza/Admin coaching/Requests">requests talk page</a> for more about this. The current Requests page is a complete disaster area, and no potential coach will want to wade through it.</li>
<li>I think most coaches use a "admin coaching" subpage, but it shouldn't be required.</li>

<dd>As an admin coach, I agree that few admin coaches are going to wade through that mess. I would expect that the coordinators keep an organized list, and that list is definitely not organized. I also don't think there should be instructions to take on as many trainees as possible; we aren't churning out admin trainees; I'd prefer quality over quantity. Is it better to train 5 great potential admins or 30 half-trained ones? I much prefer the 1-on-one (or even two-on-one) approach. This also has a hint of instruction creep to it. Admin coaching was always supposed to be informal, as far as I know. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirsfron_bff1.html" title="User:Firsfron"><font color="#0000FF">Firsfron of Ronchester</font></a> 07:05, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Personally, when I handled the program, I kept the list of users and coaches in an Excel spreadsheet, and assigned coaches that way. The coaching box was a summary of the assignments I made.

<dd>(Sorry about the edit conflict). These are all excellent points, Titoxd. Regarding mandatory assignments... some of the coaches on the list specifically signed up with the proviso they could turn down potential trainees. Requiring coaches to take the next case will likely only cause a bottleneck, or cause coaches to leave the program. Although I had only one admin coach (and she was very good), I recognize not everyone will be so lucky. Furthermore, as we are all volunteers, and admin coaches are just as likely to go on wikibreak as anyone else, it would be good to have more than one coach assigned to each trainee. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirsfron_bff1.html" title="User:Firsfron"><font color="#0000FF">Firsfron of Ronchester</font></a> 07:21, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

We currently have around 53 unassigned requests, and 15 coaches waiting for an assignment. We need to come up with at least 38 more coaches, or take up the slack in some other way.

<p>Titoxd, since you ran the program for awhile, would you mind sharing the procedures you followed when doing so? How did you decide who got assigned to who, how long did coaching assignments last (until the coachee became an admin, or until the coach thought they were trained?), and what did you do when an admin or student dropped out and left the other without a partner, etc.? How long of a wikibreak breaks the asignment. Anything you can tell us could be helpful in bringing important considerations to light. Can anyone coach, or did you turn some volunteers away? (Did you use a screening process, criteria, or just go by a general impression of whether they were experienced enough to be a coach)? And anything else you can think of. &#160;<i><b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Transhumanist_1191.html" title="User:The Transhumanist"><font color="purple">Th<font color="blue">e Tr<font color="#9ACD32">ans<font color="#FFCC00">hu<font color="orange">man<font color="red">ist</font> &#160;&#160;</font></font></font></font></font></a></b></i>10:37, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A recap of that (perhaps slanted)... some folk think thats a good idea. Others, including myself, think it's a bad idea because this program is NOT about coaching people to be better editors. There are other programs for that. This program is about helping folks do the soul searching to know if they have what it takes to be a good admin, and helping them understand what the tasks they face are like. Admining in my view (again, biased, some do not agree) has nothing whatever with being a good editor or writer, except that some writing skills are required. If this program's name is changed, I'm out, as I have no interest in editor coaching. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 13:47, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

In fact, an argument could be made that it is more important to, say, revert vandalism since uncontrolled page blanking would reduce the content of the encyclopedia. Fixing copyvio is also an important aspect, as this threat jeopardizes the whole project.

<p>The recap above missed out my point that "Admin coaching" is ambiguous. It can mean coaching in the skills needed for <i>administration</i>, it can mean coaching <i>by</i> administrators, and it can mean coaching <i>of</i> administrators. I suspect the 'coaching' bit of the name is not quite right either, as this soul-searching that Lar talks about is not really coaching. It is more mentorship. I suggest renaming it to something like <b>Mentoring of aspiring admins</b> or <b>Aspiring admins mentorship</b>, with this proviso added to make the system stronger and less prone to accusations of trying to churn out admins: <i>nominations at RfA for people who are mentored under this program must be made by the mentor</i>. This means that a succession of failed RfAs will reflect badly on the mentor, who is of course, free to not nominate if they feel the candidate will not succeed. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 00:34, 18 December 2006 (UTC)<br />
At the moment, I don't feel that the training programs are skills oriented enough, they appear to be role-playing Q and A sessions (from my reading of coaches asking questions and such) and this rightly or wrongly gives the impression that the student is being taughted to say the politically correct things and such. I would much rather, for example that practical exercises, such as image-tagging were put in place, as even the vast majority of admins do not know the image deletion criteria and there is often a 7 day backlog on the image deletions with usually about 20 people doing all of them. I don't know about anybody, else but when I look at candidates, I don't consider whether they've done the coaching Q&amp;A session, I want to see the debate appropriately on AfD, tag images properly, etc, rather than saying what hypotheticals they would do. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> (<a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">bananabucket</a>) 05:39, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>To repeat what I have said in the past, I don't think there's anything wrong with this program (other than perhaps some functionality issues that are currently being dealt with). There seem to be two main threads of discussion; <b>One</b>, the program's name. Yes, perhaps the name "admin coaching" is ambiguous in a way, but such names as "Mentoring of aspiring admins" or "Aspiring admins mentorship" is unnecessarily wordy. All information that needs be known is on the main project page. Also I agree that admin coaching is not "editor coaching". It's about moving towards adminship. <b>Two</b>, the proposed addition of various instructions or guidelines. I am against any sort of instruction creep. This program is very individual: when a coach and student are matched, it's up to them how to proceed. Not all coaches make use of theoretical scenarios or whatnot. The project (i.e. its coordinator or another 3rd party) does not tell the coach/coachee what to do. If, in the future, we have problems with a certain admin coach somehow doing a bad job, we can discuss that. But thus far I have not heard any complaints.

<p>I would like to see it renamed. I have no background with esperanza though, so you may consider me an outsider. I don't see why people should be coached into becoming admins. There is no significant difference between people who are admins and those that aren't other than enough members of the community trust you with some extra tools. Editor coaching is nice, people may need help with specific tasks, as they have been here they will obviously learn what admin tools are available, and if they think they need them can become admins, as the consensus allows. This whole thing makes it seem like some sort of game, which is also one of my main gripes with esperanze in general. I'll leave you all with this quote. - <b><a href="../../../c/o/h/User%7ECohesion_07b5.html" title="User:Cohesion">cohesion</a></b> 02:51, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The point was that we don't want editors to have to learn <i>how to use</i> the tools after promoted. While the current RFA climate may prevent that, we don't want any editor to think, "I'm an admin. <i>Now what?</i>" The point of the program when it was created was to teach someone about the unwritten rules of Wikipedia, when to do something, when not to, to round and polish a user's knowledge of policy. Part of admin coaching <i>is</i> to teach that having the word "sysop" in the <tt>user_rights</tt> field of one's entry on the <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/User_table" class="extiw" title="mw:User_table">user table</a> means only that there's more responsibility placed upon one's shoulder, not that suddenly you got a sheriff's badge put upon your shoulders. Admin coaching is (or at least should be) a way to dispel that idea of "admin = power". Editor coaching and admin coaching are complementary in that aspect. Admin coaching is much more in line with that quote from Jimbo than you may expect... <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito<span style="color:#008000;">xd</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a>)</sup> 03:02, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree entirely. As long as the coaches always make that clear, it shouldn't be that much of a problem. Worse than newly-minted admins who go "now what?" are those who when they become an admin suddenly change their behaviour, gain confidence, and start throwing their weight around. Sometimes with disastrous consequences (they get burned and scale down their activity). I have no problem with confident admins, but I would like to see them be confident and throwing their weight around as editors before they run for adminship. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 01:04, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Those are fine sentiments, but I think the problem is the perception that a small group of people are <i>coaching</i> new users into thinking like they do, with the carrot of adminship hanging over the whole affair. This was an even bigger concern when this was a part of esperanza, since it was actually a club actively coaching its members into more responsibility. It can <i>easily</i> be perceived as a power play. I'm actually pretty relieved with Titoxd's response, and would be happy to disabuse myself of the idea, but I don't think I'm alone in that perception, and <i>any</i> hint of exclusion with this is very troubling. The fact that the first two people to respond are sporting their esperanza <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armband.html" title="Armband">armbands</a> doesn't ease my fears at all.

Ultimately, this is your responsibility, not the responsibility of your coach.

<dd>Yes, but instead of correcting a misleading title, why not change the title?

<dd>Maybe I'm misunderstanding your statement Carcharoth, but I don't see what's misleading about the title "Admin coaching". Coaching anyone on anything does not guarantee success.

<dd>We've had this discussion before.&#160;:-) The phrase coaching doesn't imply success, that is not what I pick up on when I read the title. An Editor Coaching program would be interpreted as coaching people to be good editors. An Admin Coaching program would then be interpreted as coaching people to be good admins. The first questions would be "how do I become an editor?" (easy) and "how do I become an admin so I can join the admin coaching program?" (well, that's the wrong question actually). In fact, aside from those points, my main point is that the distinction between administration (the job) and administrator (the noun) is lost with the abbreviation "admin". People talk about admin tools, and admin tasks. Anyway, I think I've come up with a workable idea.

<p>I'm sure it's been addressed before, but I want to bring it up again because <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_ddf5.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review">Wikipedia:Editor review</a> is getting some scrutiny over it's "RFA-prep" aspects. So: <i>Why is the name of this program "<b>Admin</b> coaching" rather than "<b>Editor</b> coaching"?</i> And why should the following line even <i>be</i> in the second paragraph: <i>Admin Coaching does not guarantee that you will pass the RfA.</i>?</p>
<p>I suspect the answer to the second question is that it wouldn't make sense to title the page "Admin coaching" and not talk about improving one's chances to pass an RfA. But that begs the real question: if the title were changed, then why would that sentence even be there?</p>
<p>In short, now that this isn't an Esperanza program, I think it's time to fix this problematical aspect. <i>Editor</i> coaching is what you do; just one possible motivation for someone coming to the program shouldn't be embedded in tht program's title. <i><a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a></i> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Broughton_26e4.html" title="User talk:John Broughton">♫♫</a> 18:29, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>is a program for people who would like the special attention that only one-on-one coaching can provide. People are matched with experienced users (often, but not always, admins) who are willing to offer coaching. This program is designed for people who have figured out the basics of editing articles; they're not newcomers any more, but they might want some help in learning new roles. Some might like suggestions about how to learn vandal patrol, or mentoring on taking an article to featured status, or guidance with a proposal they plan to make at the Village Pump, for example.</i></dd>

<dd>I think that defintly makes things clearer, and hopefully makes things clearer for all participating too. It's important for coaches to know that they should be thinking "what can I help this editor learn about administrator activities", rather than "how can I help this editor become an administrator". They will become an administrator when/if it is right for them; we are just here to prepare them for the job that they will be doing.

<dd>Just a notice. Being one of the twenty earliest coachees of Admin Coaching (my first lesson started in early 2006 when Esperanza was still in place), I could tell that in the earliest day of admin coaching coaches really took pushing coachees to RfA as their primary aim. --<a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDeryck_Chan_2dc3.html" title="User:Deryck Chan">Der</a><a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDeryck_Chan_4045.html" title="User talk:Deryck Chan">yck C.</a> 11:48, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Then it seems like we have to make sure that isn't happening anymore. It's not really productive; people will pass RfA when they are ready, and what we should be doing is getting them ready for what they will do as an administrator. Do we think this is clear enough with the program, or should coaches be given an "introduction" or something when they start coaching? I doubt people would do that on purpose, but they may just not have seen the purpose. -- <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalya_459d.html" title="User:Natalya">Nataly<font color="green">a</font></a> 12:56, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Having read the discussion above and participated in threads at <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia_talk%7EEditor_review_90f0.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Editor review">Wikipedia_Talk:Editor review</a>, I plan on nominating both this page and <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_ddf5.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review">Wikipedia:Editor review</a> for deletion on <a href="../../../m/f/d/WP%7EMFD_9ce3.html" title="WP:MFD">WP:MFD</a>.

As I have described on the talk page of Editor review, this page and that both advocate deplorable principles completely contrary to Wikipedian philosophy: by working these pages, we are institutionalizing the creation of cookie-cutter users and fostering editcountitis and related illnesses. I believe these issues to be fundamental to the nature of this very unnecessary and deleterious page, and that deletion is the best possible end for it. I also think this matter warrants a more centralized and open discussion that MFD would provide, for action must made by the community.

<dl>
<dd>Unless I misunderstand this page completely, in which case, of course, I shall not nominate it for deletion, Admin coaching is a system <i>to become an admin</i>. It is designed, "for administrator hopefuls". It acts as though its sole purpose is to help users pass RfA: "Admin Coaching does not guarantee that you will pass the RfA. Ultimately, this is your responsibility". This goes against our Wiki policy and philosophy, which encourage every trusted user to become an admin. Instead it promotes the idea that such coaching is helpful and even necessary.

Admin coaching superficially preps inexperienced users in specific areas of Wikipedia that happen to be used as poor gauges of admin-readiness, such as number of edits in each namespace. I see such values as opposed to Wikipedian philosophy and policy; but where I can't change the minds of RfA voters (I've tried), I can attempt to halt the official endorsement of these values.

<dd>From my observation about the discussions, if editor review is "devolving" to RfA preparation, then admin coaching is "evolving" from RfA preparation to mentorship scheme. In the past AC was fundamentally quite a RfA coaching class, but as time goes on many found this direction incorrect. It turned from how to "become" an admin to how to "be" an admin. The "evolution", using your terminology, further speeded up after Esperanza was dissolved and AC became independent. As one of the earliest-starting coaching programs, my coaching page <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDeryck_Chan_Admin_coaching_3da1.html" title="User:Deryck Chan/Admin coaching">User:Deryck Chan/Admin coaching</a> is quite a good example to explain this shift. A few weeks ago, when I asked my coaches to "review" my RfA statement draft, they refused - this shows that AC has completely moved out of the shadow of "RfA coaching". --<a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDeryck_Chan_2dc3.html" title="User:Deryck Chan">Der</a><a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDeryck_Chan_4045.html" title="User talk:Deryck Chan">yck C.</a> 12:25, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree; I am sorry that there is the impression that Admin coaching is about helping someone to pass a Request for Adminship, because that is highly what it is not about, and it has been made clear time and time again. The <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdmin_coaching_a473.html" title="Wikipedia:Admin coaching">front page</a> makes this very clear outright: "Admin Coaching does not guarantee that you will pass the RfA. Ultimately, this is your responsibility, not the responsibility of your coach. So if you come here looking for a personal coach in order to pass RFA, you're at the wrong place." pretty much puts it out there that Admin Coaching is not about passing an RfA. It is about editors who may one day become administrators learning about the skills they will need once they are an administrator. It's nothing about making these editors good candidates for an RfA; it is up to them to be of administrator quality and become administrators on their own. By going through Admin Coaching, however, they can learn about what to expect as an administrator, so that if/when they acquire the tools, they will feel more comfortable taking up the tasks of an administrator, and will be better able to benefit the encyclopedia with their knowledge of the tasks expected of them. -- <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalya_459d.html" title="User:Natalya">Nataly<font color="green">a</font></a> 17:15, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Something has gone horribly wrong on Wikipedia, when this page exists to promote the idea that adminship is a goal in and of itself. Too many users have forgotten why we are here, namely <i>to write an encyclopedia</i>, and enjoy doing it. This page has nothing to do with this encyclopedic goal, in fact, it encourages superficial editing (high edit counts) and arbitrary standards for the RfA process. I view this page as a serious detriment to this encyclopedia, albeit indirectly. Users who request Admin Coaching <i>seek to design themselves</i> according to these arbitrary standards; to be coached to fit an arbitrary model.

<p>Adminship today is too far removed from this ideal. As I stated, it has become an end itself, and not merely a set of tools given to anyone proven to not abuse them. To pass RfA today, users <i>must</i> be well-rounded (as if those were the users that make this encyclopedia great) and do many hours of chores. We should not, with our ever-increasing population, be so afraid of abuse of admin powers that we construct these arbitrary standards. This page represents the general acceptance of this attitude, and moreover, institutionalizes it; and this page is not a separate issue from this. I think I must nominate this page for deletion in good conscience; though I'd rather spend my time <i>writing articles</i>, I really must. -- <a href="../../../r/m/r/User%7ERmrfstar_ff0f.html" title="User:Rmrfstar">Rmrfstar</a> 01:59, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please, I am having trouble understanding how our explanations of the functions of Admin Coaching still give such an impression. Where has there been one impression that Admin Coaching "encourages superficial editing (high edit counts) and arbitrary standards for the RfA process"? Admin Coaching has absolutely nothing to do with that. Until there are concrete reasons for this reasoning, it is very hard to understand where this view is coming from. It is very evident that many of us are happy to discuss your concerns with you, but at least to me, it does not seem like our explanations are being considered.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There is no disagreement that editors attempting to pass an RfA must be well rounded. There is no disagreement that they will be doing many hours of chores. The whole point of Admin Coaching is to prepare users for these chores. To prepare the users to help the encyclopedia through administrative tasks. This is stressed over and over again. -- <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalya_459d.html" title="User:Natalya">Nataly<font color="green">a</font></a> 02:31, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>And yet, there are disagreements over such matters you consider closed. I and a significant number of others do not agree that admins must be well-rounded or must do many hours of chores. These beliefs, in my opinion, oppose the philosophy of this project: admins are developing into a special subgroup of Wikipedians who meet these two criteria; and, this page reinforces it. -- <a href="../../../r/m/r/User%7ERmrfstar_ff0f.html" title="User:Rmrfstar">Rmrfstar</a> 00:21, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Brief response: I want to respond to these comments on a point-by-point basis, so I'm going to break up the sentences. I hope you don't think it's rude.
<dl>
<dd><i>Something has gone horribly wrong on Wikipedia, when this page exists to promote the idea that adminship is a goal in and of itself.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I see nothing wrong with the goal of becoming an administrator. In fact, we'd have very few (if any) administrators if people didn't actively <i>decide</i> to run for adminship, rather than stumbling onto RFA and deciding to submit their names on a lark.
<dl>
<dd><i>Too many users have forgotten why we are here, namely</i> to write an encyclopedia<i>, and enjoy doing it.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Which of the users here doesn't spend most of his/her time here writing the encyclopedia? Seems to be an unfounded claim.
<dl>
<dd><i>This page has nothing to do with this encyclopedic goal, in fact, it encourages superficial editing (high edit counts) and arbitrary standards for the RfA process.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>As I have pointed out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ARmrfstar&amp;diff=104753388&amp;oldid=104543794" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ARmrfstar&amp;diff=104753388&amp;oldid=104543794" rel="nofollow">elsewhere</a>, there is no mention of "edit count" on this page on in the talk archives (aside from your own allegation that this page encourages editcountitis). An automated search for "edit count" turns up more than two dozen on <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFA_4c83.html" title="WP:RFA">WP:RFA</a>. It appears to me, then, that your comments <i>here</i> are misplaced, and your reservations about people placing too much of an emphasis on edit count belongs on the RFA talk page.
<dl>
<dd><i>I view this page as a serious detriment to this encyclopedia, albeit indirectly. Users who request Admin Coaching</i> seek to design themselves <i>according to these arbitrary standards; to be coached to fit an arbitrary model.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Which arbitary model would that be? Have you looked in at coaching sessions? From your comments above, it doesn't look like you have. I feel like I'm discussing colors with someone who has never seen them, or describing music to someone who can't hear.
<dl>
<dd><i>To pass RfA today, users</i> must <i>be well-rounded (as if those were the users that make this encyclopedia great) and do many hours of chores.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Again, something that should be brought up at RFA. I've been saying this for at least six months.
<dl>
<dd><i>We should not, with our ever-increasing population, be so afraid of abuse of admin powers that we construct these arbitrary standards.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The standards were not decided at Admin Coaching; they came from RFA. If you want to help loosen the restrictive adminning process, the proper channel is through the RFA talk page, not an MFD here.
<dl>
<dd><i>This page represents the general acceptance of this attitude, and moreover, institutionalizes it; and this page is not a separate issue from this.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Where exactly on this page do you see calls for stricter standards, fewer people being granted adminship, etc? It is not here. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirsfron_bff1.html" title="User:Firsfron"><font color="#0000FF">Firsfron of Ronchester</font></a> 02:35, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It sounds like you have more of a problem with the RfA process than admin coaching, Rmrfstar. If you think RfA is about "arbitrary standards" with which you disagree, then go to the RfA talk page and try to change these standards. The fact is that there <i>are</i> certain typical standards for an RfA; however, the admin coaching program has little or nothing to do with those standards. People sign up for a coach because they <i>want to be better Wikipedians</i>. They want to help with the administrative, janitorial tasks, <i>as well as</i> write the encyclopedia. If you don't think administrative tasks have encyclopedic value, you haven't been here long enough. In sum, I don't understand why you're railing against us when you should be arguing elsewhere. --<a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFang_Aili_a8ed.html" title="User:Fang Aili">Fang Aili</a> <sup><a href="../../../f/a/n/User_talk%7EFang_Aili_6d94.html" title="User talk:Fang Aili"><font color="green">talk</font></a></sup> 15:04, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>As I have stated above, this page and others like it are products of these beliefs which I abhor. They are, however, more than mere symptoms, for they do exacerbate the problem. This page <i>encourages the view that adminship is a goal in and of itself</i>. It does not aid in producing our encyclopedia but encourages merely meeting the requirements of adminship; thus does it encourage editcountitis etc. -- <a href="../../../r/m/r/User%7ERmrfstar_ff0f.html" title="User:Rmrfstar">Rmrfstar</a> 00:21, 5 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Again, how does this page encourage the view that adminship is a goal in and of itself? Furthermore, why <i>can't</i> adminship be a goal all on its own? Seriously. Why can't I say "I want to make X a Featured Article, I want to add three new images to Y, I want to fix the vandalism on 47 articles tonight, and I want to become an administrator"? Each of these are goals is, in my opinion, admirable, and I'm not sure what you see that you "abhor" so much.</dd>
<dd>You stated it doesn't aid in producing the encyclopedia. In actuality, before Admin Coaching began, we actually <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreestylefrappe_d689.html" title="User:Freestylefrappe">had admins</a> who did not even know what a diff was. I cannot claim every current admin is fully trained. But it is nice to know that editors have a place to come to if they do want a little coaching or advice. And as Fang Aili hints above, if we did not have administrators, this site would quickly fall apart. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirsfron_bff1.html" title="User:Firsfron"><font color="#0000FF">Firsfron of Ronchester</font></a> 01:19, 5 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think we need <i>more</i> administrators, not less: I think regular users should be admins, not specially trained, well-rounded ones. And, as I have stated above at least once, there are already <b>plenty</b> of places for Wikipedians to go if they need "a little coaching or advice", <i>See <a href="../../../c/o/a/Wikipedia%7ECoaching_83df.html" title="Wikipedia:Coaching">Wikipedia:Coaching</a>. -- <a href="../../../r/m/r/User%7ERmrfstar_ff0f.html" title="User:Rmrfstar">Rmrfstar</a> 01:58, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</i>
<dl>
<dd>As someone benefiting from the programme right now, I can't really understand the problem. I am learning from an administrator how to carry out administrator tasks in the hope that I can benefit Wikipedia by being better equipped to be an administrator when, hopefully, the time comes. Without the training, I would undoubtedly have made mistakes when I first became an admin. Before I started on admin coaching I hadn't a clue about vandal fighting and I still don't have a clue with copyright issues. This is what I will be learning. Just as a side issue, I notice that you haven't participated in any RfA's recently which, if you don't mind me saying, is a little strange if you want to see more admins. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallanox_1ced.html" title="User:Mallanox"><span style="background:white;color:black">Malla</span></a><a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMallanox_41c6.html" title="User talk:Mallanox"><span style="background:white;color:black">nox</span></a> 02:21, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Rmrfstar said, "<i>As I have stated above, this page and others like it are products of these beliefs which I abhor.</i>" Which beliefs do you abhor, exactly? The idea that admins should be familiar with admin tools before they become admins? That admins should have a range of Wikipedia experience? That janitorial tasks (admin cleanup activities) are encyclopedic and necessary? --<a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFang_Aili_a8ed.html" title="User:Fang Aili">Fang Aili</a> <sup><a href="../../../f/a/n/User_talk%7EFang_Aili_6d94.html" title="User talk:Fang Aili"><font color="green">talk</font></a></sup> 21:56, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Quite frankly, it seems you're putting Editor review and Admin coaching on the same vessel, when they're two entirely different beasts. At least, that is the impression I'm getting. Many of the issues you bring up about admin coaching are not actually about admin coaching, but are rather systemic issues with RFA itself, so here isn't really the place to argue about them. There is no indication here that users working here actually encourage the application of those standards.</dd>
<dd>If a user wants to become an administrator, there's two possible reasons for that: either they find the tools useful to help in the encyclopedia, in which case, AC's purpose is to help the user familiarize him or herself with administrative areas and processes. You appear to have the common misconception that Admin coaching ends after a user has his or her RFA; it doesn't. The new admin then gets help getting acquainted with both the technical and political aspects of being an administrator.</dd>
<dd>On the other hand, there's also users who want to become admins for the sake of becoming admins, and who see adminship as a badge. AC's role there is to try to bring them to the "bright side", if you want to call it that. Now, I don't see why the intentions of the users working here are diametrically opposed to the purpose we're all here, which is to work on an encyclopedia. We're not robots, after all. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito<span style="color:#008000;">xd</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a>)</sup> 03:37, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Tellyaddict, sorry for the delay in response. Admin coaching is very free-form, meaning there really aren't any rules for what you <i>must</i> do. Basically, you are matched with an experienced user, and you and s/he can talk together about Wikipedia. I think of it as an opportunity for you to pick someone's brains about the inner workings of Wikipedia. You can communicate on-wiki, over e-mail, on IRC, whatever. Your coach may offer to give you quizzes, like the <a href="../../../e/w/s/User%7EEWS23_CSD_3920.html" title="User:EWS23/CSD">speedy delete exercise</a>.
