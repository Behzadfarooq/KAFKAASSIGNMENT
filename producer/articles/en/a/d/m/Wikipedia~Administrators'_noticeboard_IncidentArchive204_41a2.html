Nothing has been revealed in that post that a 12 year old couldn't figure out on their own from spending about 5 minutes at WP:AN/I on any given day since we seem to be discussing a certain set of editors almost daily. That said, I concur with Newyorkbrad below, "BryanFromPalatine" should be used here on wiki just so it is clear which editor we are talking about.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 14:44, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>To be nice, I've redacted the part that I suspect most offends him. I didn't restore anyone elses comments just because with edits here it would be difficult, but if anyone wants to add back what they said, feel free. The biggest issue I saw (and the reason I blocked him) was because he was selectively editing comments and leaving parts that completely changed the meaning and tone of the posts.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 16:20, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I only just noticed this. DeanHinnen acknowledges that his family name is Hinnen, talks openly about being the brother of BryanFromPalatine, calls him Bryan in the RFAR, but to use the name Bryan Hinnen is a privacy violation? Riiiiiight. So we ban Dean for privacy violations, yes? Because it was only by violating Bryan's privacy through "outing" that he got unblocked in the first place, wasn't it? <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 20:54, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>For the last 24 hours Wikipedia pages have been slow in loading and rendering when using Internet Explorer for Macintosh.</p>
<p>Pages would load maybe 5k of data and "park" for a few minutes before finally rendering.</p>

<p>Well, Jimbo is off-wiki at the moment so he can't reply. But I'll cut and paste; what follows was my reply to Jimbo and it's an open question to everybody:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>then what is <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAN_eb66.html" title="WP:BAN">WP:BAN</a> supposed to mean?: "<i>Users are generally expected to refrain from reinstating any edits made by banned users. Users that nonetheless reinstate such edits take responsibility for their content by so doing.</i>" Rbj is fighting to ensure that legal threats remain on Wikipedia.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If legal threats are not supposed to be on Wikipedia, and Rbj is going to assert that they cannot be deleted from his user page, then how can they be removed? <span style="white-space: nowrap">— <a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant: small-caps">l</span>acan</a></span> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant: small-caps">lk</span></a> — 00:03, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>no, this is an example of you not being an honest person. i said that although you don't think your shit stinks, it actually does stink. where were you cursed?</dd>
<dd>but now i will repeat, you Coelacan, are not an honest player. you game the system for your advantage, you want your biased POV to be accepted as NPOV, and when you are called on it, you revert to nasty and underhanded behavior to try to get your way. you're not honest.</dd>

<dd>My take -- Jimbo was right to lift the block. Rbj has violated policy by acting as a proxy for a banned user, and may deserve a block, but an indefinite one is not necessary from that. The block reason indicated that Rbj was blocked for legal threats, but he didn't himself make any legal threats, so that's not right. Yes, those edits should be removed as they are banned user edits. But an indef block is only justified if we agree that Rbj is making legal threats and I don't see that he is. However, I will make sure that the threat is removed as a banned user edit, and if Rbj pushes the issue we can block him (temporarily) for proxying. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 02:26, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>and just to add another point, there was other content that Nkras put down that stood, in its own right. the content has value to be considered whether it came from <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Manson_8fd5.html" title="Charles Manson">Charles Manson</a> or <a href="../../../n/e/l/Nelson_Mandela_1695.html" title="Nelson Mandela">Nelson Mandela</a> and it was being conveniently censored along with the legal threat that i did not make and was wrongfully ascribed to me. it's this content that i was taking ownership of myself. and it is content that i repeated so often myself that it's just bothersome to do it again. <a href="../../../r/b/j/User%7ERbj_42ae.html" title="User:Rbj">r b-j</a> 02:55, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, anything Nkras put before his ban would be evaluated in its own right, as it should be, and would only be removed if it would under normal circumstances be removed from any user. But edits made <i>after</i> his ban may be reverted by any editor, and <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAN_eb66.html" title="WP:BAN">WP:BAN</a> is pretty clear on this-if you chose to reinstate his edits, they were then <i>your</i> edits. Since you chose to reinstate his legal threats and personal attacks, they were, from that time forward, <i>your</i> legal threats and personal attacks. You realized this, at one point you specifically stated that you "take ownership" of his meatpuppetry threat. I don't even see any indication that you've decided <i>not</i> to do this anymore. Finally, quit cursing at Coelacan. I started the AN/I thread regarding your reinstatement of Nkras' edits, so if you really feel the need to curse at someone, do it at me.

<dd>i haven't cursed Coelacan. there is no example of it. repeating a false premise multiple times doesn't make it true.</dd>
<dd>you can also repeat it all you want, but i made no personal threats, legal or otherwise, to anyone at anytime. repeating a false premise multiple times does not make it true and is reflective of something less than forthrightness.</dd>
<dd>as <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetesmiles_8c9b.html" title="User:Petesmiles">User:Petesmiles</a> said, i'm not very patient with stupid people. well, it's not quite accurate since i haven't identified anyone as stupid at all. but i have identified some statements as blatently false or blatently POV skewed. since WP is uncensored, the simple descriptive term for this is "bullshit". and when someone, stupid or smart, presents such bullshit to me to accept as true or of value, i'm not very patient with it. i read it for what it is and ascribe motive to it. and if the motive is one of arrogance or dishonesty ("we give you this shit and say it's caviar! ha, ha, ha, ha!"), i will say as much. it's not diplomatic, but it's not a curse. it is not cursing anyone.</dd>
<dd>these repeated false premises are bullshit. they are not persuasive. they're crap. i don't recognize them as having value and i say so clearly and forthrightly. and i take ownership of that. but i <b>don't</b> take ownership of what <b>you</b> say that i say, just because you say it doesn't make it so (i think, but am not sure, that this was the simple truth that Jimbo could clearly see).</dd>
<dd>so it's full of crap. now what are you going to do? oh... you just cannot handle it when someone so openly rejects your crap and calls it what it is. so you act to have that person indefinitely blocked. the term for that is underhanded, and, frankly immature. <a href="../../../r/b/j/User%7ERbj_42ae.html" title="User:Rbj">r b-j</a> 03:49, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Your tendency to be pedantic and wordy is not helping your case at all. Consider yourself lucky that I am not obsessively pursuing the removal of the legal threat on your talk page, an act that many others would have done.

<dd>"pendantic" can be applied to multiple directions.</dd>
<dd>i never said i did not "directly insult anyone". in fact i think i conceeded that one could "call that an insult". what i said is that i never <i>threatened</i> anyone. <b>not once.</b> and i said i haven't <i>cursed</i> anyone. and there is no example of me doing so.</dd>
<dd>also, i explicitly took exception here with <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetesmiles_8c9b.html" title="User:Petesmiles">User:Petesmiles</a> observation that i'm not very patient with stupid people. it's stupid and dishonest statements presented to me as factual or valuable that i have little patience with and i reserve the right to evaluate them for what they are. actually, i think nearly everyone involved here is pretty smart. but there are some whom i would not ascribe much integrity, either in some of the words that they say or in the oft blatently hypocritical actions they have made. they are trying to censor dissent.</dd>
<dd>BTW, you might note that Coelacan has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Coelacan&amp;diff=109709847&amp;oldid=109709217" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Coelacan&amp;diff=109709847&amp;oldid=109709217" rel="nofollow">exerted control</a> over his/her <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan">usertalk page</a>, the very thing that was being denied to me and got me indefinitely blocked for a few hours for so exerting. what would happen if some user:X reversed every action or selected actions of Coelacan on his/her own user talk space. whom would you block? the hypocrisy here is thick enough to slice. <a href="../../../r/b/j/User%7ERbj_42ae.html" title="User:Rbj">r b-j</a> 04:09, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>Thanks to Mangojuice for that comment, I think that's the most accurate. Rbj was doing the wrong thing by restoring the comments, and was approaching proxying, but in the end, it was the wrong call to make to attribute the consequences of Nkras' comments to Rbj, and I apologise for making a bad block and causing this fuss.

Hale, however, made only minor changes to his additions and continues to push a POV and to cite a specific unreliable source that I suspect is Hale's own website. Hale's contribution history isn't large, so I haven't provided diffs. I would block Hale, but given that I have a clear POV regarding the subject matter that Hale is editing and because part of the problem is POV-pushing on Hale's part, I would like fellow administrative comment on Hale to determine whether a block (or something else) is the best course of action. · <b><a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko"><font color="#709070">j e r s y k o</font></a></b> <i><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJersyko_3ca3.html" title="User talk:Jersyko"><font color="#007BA7" size="1">talk</font></a></i> · 00:47, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The amount of man-hours of research and correction that this user is producing should be reason enough to permanently block all accounts and take quicker action the next time s/he surfaces.

<dd>MONGO is being harassed regarding the ED speculation regarding his employer is again.

<p>I checked the edits and agree entirely: NuclearUmpf's behaviour is both calculated and completely unacceptable. This is on top of ArbCom sanctions, an article ban for disruption, and numerous blocks for violating ArbCom sanctions. I have blocked NuclearUmpf while we discuss what should be done. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 16:28, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think Nuclear is playing passive aggressive games. (Who me? Was I not supposed to say that?) (Hence the reference to his comment about similar tactics by another user.) I find it hard to believe that Nuclear was unaware of trolling by Cplot et al. claiming that MONGO should not edit certain articles due to his place of employment. Therefore (and also because of the "Who me? attitude in followup to MONGO's removal request) I think the reference was deliberate and calculated. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 16:49, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

I'm not sure this can be handled at the community level, so perhaps it is time to take it back up to ArbComm with the hope of final action. His statement of deny it and I'll remove it is beyond acceptable behavior as regardless of where or for whom Mongo works, it shouldn't need to be publicly disclosed and even if disclosed in the past does not need to be repeated if he does not wish to advertise it now. --<a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuffOfInterest_823e.html" title="User:StuffOfInterest">StuffOfInterest</a> 16:45, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Administrators, <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtaxiad_296b.html" title="User:Artaxiad">User:Artaxiad</a> has posted a 3RR report today, accusing <a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">User:AdilBaguirov</a>. Although the report was false, because links under revert 2 and 3 were the same, administrator Dmcdevit blocked the user <a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">User:AdilBaguirov</a>. Quickly after that <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtaxiad_296b.html" title="User:Artaxiad">User:Artaxiad</a> (formerly also known as User:Nareklm caught for sockpuppetry and unpunished) has removed his false report. I have restored the report and added a comment indicating the concern, yet <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtaxiad_296b.html" title="User:Artaxiad">User:Artaxiad</a> now started an edit war at Wikipedia 3RR reporting site reverting my comment edit. Can you please, address the issue. Below are (1) the original false 3RR report by Artaxiad, (2) Artaxiad's removal of the report after blockage of AdilBaguirov, (3) my comment, and (4) the deliberate revert of 3RR comment page by Artaxiad:</p>

<dd>No, the user was blocked for alleged 3RR on Tigranes the Great page (it says so on <a href="../../../a/d/i/User_talk%7EAdilBaguirov_8fb9.html" title="User talk:AdilBaguirov">User's talk page</a>), as reported and removed by yourself after the fact of blockage. This seems to be a clear blackmail and an oversight case. I am just a concerned user reporting your reverts of 3RR page(!!!), the administrators are welcome to check my editing record to see who I am. I have no desire to engage in further discussion and will let the administrators decide.

<dd>Yes, but he was edit warring on the other pages, also restoring a certain version is considered a revert, and I think Dominic knows what he does, he violated it. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtaxiad_296b.html" title="User:Artaxiad">Artaxiad</a> 22:35, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You guys should stop reporting eachothers. There should be something done to stop Armenian/Azeri reportings. It has become a reporting war and is becoming very disruptive. May I suggest two administrators following those articles and hadling the edit wars insteed of such reportings? They aren't done in good faith anyway. One side reporting the other to get the other silenced (from both sides) has become out of proportion and isen't helping the issue. Reporting incidences should be done for the better, but here the situation has made it that this tool is abused. In any way, the users know already who the concerned admins are and can use their user pages insteed of "spamming" the incidents and dragging uninvolved administrators in this intestine conflict. <i>Fad</i> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 23:32, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree, however, the favor started from user Artaxiad who made a false 3RR report. I am just reporting it because the consequence of his misconduct is blockage of the user based on false report as one of the reasons. This counter-productive terrorizing of usernames and notices should be stopped, as the user in question Artaxiad (formerly Nareklm) should understand that false reporting, reverting and edit warring is not going to change the contributor's opinion neither their positions. What goes around comes around, so it's essential to use Talk pages and provide arguments there. <a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtabek_e9c3.html" title="User:Atabek">Atabek</a> 01:26, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't know about the false report, right now I have hard time digesting Nareklm uses of a sock, and in my eyes this suspicion that he would do this again for me will remain. The same with you, just to remind you. In any event, if your issue about the misreporting is true, bring it with the admin who blocked him. I don't know in which article Adil was engaged in this revert war, but it will sure not be as worst as what he's doing on the NK. After uneasy months of negotiations with both parties, the NK had finally peace, Adil came in, edit warred, ended up with its closing. The article was opened again, again edit waring, again it was closed, opened again, and again. If Adil wasn't blocked, for sure the article will again be closed. I requested Grandmaster to comment on that three time, he knew that there was an agreement on the specific issues Adil was engaged in, he decided to remain silent. His choice, but I just want to remind you that NK was one of the few articles in which we were able to work on some level of peace and Adil has sabotaged that. I expect at least one Azeri editor to ask him to stop. <i>Fad</i> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 02:31, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>That's not a false report admins know what they do, that was 4 reverts go look at it yourself, and you're not going to get me blocked for changing my username since admins did it, so stop saying things like that and when you revert stop saying vandalism thats one reason no one wants to cooperate with you adil and dacy. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtaxiad_296b.html" title="User:Artaxiad">Artaxiad</a> 01:28, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>NK article is a separate subject, which should not be a matter of discussion on ANI page. However, I should say that at any time when you have compromise on some page, there can be someone, who quite legitimately appears with additional references and opinion, which is often hard to deny. So this is an ongoing process, and it's not appropriate or helpful to concentrate on personality just because you don't agree with him or with his references, especially as aggressively as you do. Personally, I have nothing against Artaxiad/Nareklm, my problem is with the fact that he is only involved in reverting every single one of my edits, with or without a reason, with or without understanding, reading the content of it or references thereof. And that should be stopped. Wikipedia is not a witch hunt place, and what goes around comes around. <a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtabek_e9c3.html" title="User:Atabek">Atabek</a> 06:13, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Like i said if you respect me we can make progress but all you do is go around telling people they vandalize etc, that is very disrespectful and at this rate it will not stop unless both parties agree, the information you add is POV and I dislike everything about it I've never seen you make a good edit all you do is add stuff that nationalists would do or you go help Adil and dacy revert, especially March days. It's common sense stop adding stuff that are not appropriate for Wikipedia I can make way more articles saying Azeris did this and that but I don't because its useless. If you refrain from adding content that is offensive, POV and disrespectful this will stop. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtaxiad_296b.html" title="User:Artaxiad">Artaxiad</a> 06:21, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The Wikipedia is not for respecting personalities, but for contributing to the encyclopedia. Myself and few other users made major contribution to March Days article with nearly 25+ references, with which you agreed as it was well balanced, until one day <a href="../../../a/i/v/User%7EAivazovsky_a655.html" title="User:Aivazovsky">User:Aivazovsky</a> appeared and destroyed (clearly vandalized) the whole page. He can't even explain why he did it on Talk page now, neither did you ever complain about the vandalization and removal of well quoted references to Armenian victims provided on that page. In any case, my message was addressed to Fadix and not to you. To continue thread don't use ANI page, as the thread will be left unanswered. <a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtabek_e9c3.html" title="User:Atabek">Atabek</a> 06:53, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>He has pushed POV in many articles. For example he added "It seems without question that the government of Iran is clerical fascist…" on the <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clerical_fascism.html" title="Clerical fascism">Clerical fascism</a> article (see history for his reverts and edits <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Clerical_fascism&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Clerical_fascism&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>, and the discussion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Clerical_fascism" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Clerical_fascism" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>). And has only added blogs and editorials for sources of this.</p>
<p>Another example of his POV pushing is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ali_Khamenei#Khamenei_and_Patchouli" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ali_Khamenei#Khamenei_and_Patchouli" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>.</p>
<p>He added a section called Nicknames to the <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">Iran</a> article and wrote "One nickname of Iran is Land of Mullahs" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Iran&amp;oldid=106522333#Nicknames" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Iran&amp;oldid=106522333#Nicknames" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>. Like most of his POV edits he reverted editors attempts of removing his POV (you will see over three reverts on seperate occasions bases on the "Land of Mullahs" edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Iran&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Iran&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>).</p>
<p>When I complained about him making unilateral POV edits without discussion he merely replied "I am proud to have reverted your censorship" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Patchouli#Unilateral_revert" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Patchouli#Unilateral_revert" rel="nofollow">[33]</a>.</p>
<p>On the [Khatami] article he wrote of Khatami "He has received criticism inside and outside the Islamic Republic and it is not known how a mullah can bring freedom." (Please see the history for the extensive amount of unilateral edits <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mohammad_Khatami&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mohammad_Khatami&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[34]</a>).</p>

<li>I have had a lot of trouble with Patchouli's edits just recently, so I'll be adding my findings as I go along. For one, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yahya_Rahim_Safavi&amp;diff=106249719&amp;oldid=106249607" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yahya_Rahim_Safavi&amp;diff=106249719&amp;oldid=106249607" rel="nofollow">Using terrorist opposition group as a 'background information' link</a>.

<li>Also, note this series of revert warring. Someone removed an undue weight POV issue about some magazine's opinion of Ali Khamenei (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ali_Khamenei#World.E2.80.99s_10_Worst_Dictators" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ali_Khamenei#World.E2.80.99s_10_Worst_Dictators" rel="nofollow">[39]</a> for the relevant discussion).

Adding a link to a very biased website in the article body, as its own section, is very POV.

I can't help but consider the possibility that it is misleading to say "Official Website of Religion of Peace" in the article where Islam is being discussed as a "religion of peace."

<p>Patchouli is a very interesting person: His edits does hit one's raw nerves! I used to improve his edits on Iran related topics, but he has accused me of being a spy:</p>

<p>I am also one of the editors that has had to deal with Patchouli's sneaky POV pushing attempts. This is definitely a pattern of behaviour that he has on all articles related to the middle east. I am asking for your help to put a stop to <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatchouli_1f56.html" title="User:Patchouli">User:Patchouli</a>'s abuses and his sabotage of wikipedia middle-east related articles. Please take the time to read the following links for information about his history of misconduct.

I agree. I've already written about Patchouli many times before, and I don't want to repeat myself. He is not a good contributor and, in my opinion, should be banned. <small><a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELittleDan_7151.html" title="User:LittleDan">LittleDan</a></small><sup><a href="../../../l/i/t/User_talk%7ELittleDan_c646.html" title="User talk:LittleDan">talk</a></sup> 19:11, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I get frustrated whenever I see AN/I reports like this. One side, Patchouli, is vehemently ANTI-Iran, but then I see the other side, or a faction thereof, like Gerash77, who seems to have a long history of agitating against WIkipedia and actioning for it's censorship in Iran. I wind up feeling like if we deal with only the one issue brought to AN/I, but ignore the revealed OTHER problems, we're really not much better off, and possibly worse off. Can we address Gerash77's actions against what he calls a 'patchopedia', and brags of helping to censor it on his User Talk? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Gerash77#I_have_retired.21" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Gerash77#I_have_retired.21" rel="nofollow">[68]</a> <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 03:41, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Maybe at a different ANI. This particular ANI is about Patchouli's POV &amp; OR editing, as well as unwillingness to compromise with a number of different editors. I don't think these different editors comprise some sort of anti-WP "faction;" the whole reason that Agha Nader started this and others, including myself, contributed is because Patchouli's disruptive edits are hindering the project. So I think it is unfair to characterize all of us as an anti-WP group just because one member of this group claims he convinced the IRI to filter WP. Anyway, this ANI hasn't really gone anywhere significant, and we are thinking about moving to an RFC or ArbCom. Most of the people who have had these unpleasant experiences with Patchouli consider ArbCom the best choice, including editors who haven't posted here (saving for ArbCom), so I intend to apply for ArbCom once I finally figure out the confusing process. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 08:45, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

When you write an article that criticizes or advocates something or someone, this must be balanced by an opposing viewpoint in the same article. One user wrote on my talk page that you have created issues with the following articles:</i></dd>
<dd><i>*<a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohammad_Khatami%27s_reforms_a37a.html" title="Mohammad Khatami's reforms">Mohammad Khatami's reforms</a> (POV fork to bash a living person, just look at the introduction and how biased it's worded)</i></dd>
<dd><i>*<a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohammad_Khatami_e5e5.html" title="Mohammad Khatami">Mohammad Khatami</a> ( Please see the evidence of some of Patchouli's abuses at Talk:Mohammad_Khatami#Patchouli_edits, it includes links and refernces to his personal attacks on other users' talk pages calling them agents of foreign governments etc)</i></dd>
<dd><i>*<a href="../../../g/u/a/Guardianship_of_the_Islamic_Jurists_1e75.html" title="Guardianship of the Islamic Jurists">Guardianship of the Islamic Jurists</a> (adding Mullahcracy which is political epithet, jargon and neologism, as an alternative to the title of the article by citing political editorials! Also see Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Mullahcracy)</i></dd>
<dd><i>*Association for Defense of Azerbaijani Political Prisoners (POV fork)</i></dd>
<dd><i>*Khomeini's Islamic leadership (POV fork)</i></dd>
<dd><i>*<a href="../../../g/o/v/Government-organized_demonstration.html" title="Government-organized demonstration">Government-organized demonstration</a> (POV fork)</i></dd>
<dd>If you continue to do things like this, I'll be forced to block you. Wikipedia is meant to be an encyclopedia, not an editorial page, and when you do this, it just makes more work for other editors who have to delete your articles and revert your changes. If you keep doing this, I'll have to block you from Wikipedia or bring this case to the arbitration commit. Another important thing is, <i>Don't delete posts from your talk page.</i> You should let others see what people have previously written to you, even if it isn't always positive. <small><a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELittleDan_7151.html" title="User:LittleDan">LittleDan</a></small><sup><a href="../../../l/i/t/User_talk%7ELittleDan_c646.html" title="User talk:LittleDan">talk</a></sup> 17:26, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>Oh, good grief. "POV-pushing" is surely too weak a term here, and the user has been around long enough to get a clue about encyclopedic editing if he's ever going to.

<dd>Yes, we are aiming for a ban. If this can be done without having to go through ArbCom &amp; all of its formalities, that is better. I think this ANI lays it all out very well, and this isn't even all of it. The more I look, the more I find. It is completely disruptive, and I'm tired of finding bad edits, undo/correct them, and then fight his successive blind reverts and attitude. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 05:27, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"<i>There have been situations where a user has exhausted the community's patience to the point where he or she finds themselves blocked.

</dl>
<p>This sounds to me like a case for a ban like that. But if there doesn't turn out to be consensus that the user has exhausted the community's patience, I suggest you ask somebody previously uninvolved to make a good-faith effort to reach out to him and make him change his approach to editing. If that fails, go directly to <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAR_b522.html" title="WP:RFAR">arbitration</a>. From the links and quotes already posted, I don't see the sense in wearing out everybody with a <a href="../../../m/_/_/WP%7EM_4ddf.html" title="WP:M">formal mediation process</a> and/or an <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a> which would only turn into a flameout anyway. Requesting arbitration isn't in itself difficult or formalistic. It's the RFC's and the more or less "official" mediation venues that are the big time-sinks. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 13:22, 19 February 2007 (UTC).</p>

<dd>Sa.vakilian... no. Those aren't efforts to reach out&#160;:-( Vandalism warning templates, and fair-use image upload templates are not dispute resolution, they're the exact opposite. Please ask an experienced user to do the reaching out thing, because the examples you give are the wrong kind. Of course they didn't have a good effect on him, warning templates never do have a good effect. The only posts anything like good faith dispute resolution are LittleDan's, which are in human language and a more conciliatory tone. (Though since they double as block warnings, they're not exactly mediation attempts, either.) Also, did you read my response to you on my page, for instance about <i>not</i> listing policies&#160;? <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 22:01, 19 February 2007 (UTC).

<dd>I unreservedly recommend a community ban. I have had many interactions with this user before. Patchouli is not a new comer to wikipedia, he knows the rules but breaks them nevertheless. There is no hope to change this user's behaviour. Different editors have gone to great lengths to reason with him in several different occasions, and he has never changed his behaviour, and in some cases (including myself) he has responded with personal attacks <a href="../../../b/a/r/User_talk%7EBarnetj_4168.html#Khatami" title="User talk:Barnetj">User_talk:Barnetj#Khatami</a>. He continues adding comments such as "It is not known how a mullah can bring freedom!" referring to President Khatami <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mohammad_Khatami&amp;diff=81409747&amp;oldid=81409381" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mohammad_Khatami&amp;diff=81409747&amp;oldid=81409381" rel="nofollow">[87]</a>. He doesn't seem to get that wikipedia is not a political commentary, but an encyclopedia. Maybe if he was a journalist writing articles in some political newspaper I would even agree with many of his comments. But he just doesn't understand the purpose of an encyclopedia! So I vote for a ban. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarnetj_3c29.html" title="User:Barnetj">Barnetj</a> 11:31, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Strongly Agree</b> with the ban. He has continuously called many, including myself a spy and a government agent, and hasn't stopped. This has resulted in many contributors either leaving Wikipedia, or in my case, getting impatience and emailing Telecommunication Companies to block this site, to save myself from further defamation. His behavior has resulted in negative emotions and actions which has resulted in edit wars and mutual accusations. He continually assumes bad faith, and accuses others of sockpuppetry, in some cases like the one you see, simply because "they disappeared at the same time"!--<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerash77_a233.html" title="User:Gerash77">Gerash77</a> 12:36, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>Why do I need to self-censor myself on talk pages?</i> Ummmm! Bear in mind Patchouli that Wikipedia is not a soapbox. I think you may be confusing opinions with facts and that you fail to understand that. That's why i first suggested a probation period instead of a ban. However, i changed my mind after realizing that it is rather systematic and the proof is that you still defend <i>your</i> unproven theories.

<p>I basically agree with everyone here who wishes to ban Patchouli, so I shouldn't bother repeating them. Patchouli has continued to write articles with a biased point of view, despite repeated admonishments. However, I think it's OK to put whatever comments you'd like on your talk page. Additionaly, Patchouli <i>has</i> made a few useful edits, so perhaps we should ban him for only a limited amount of time (say, 3 months) to send a clear message that Patchouli should not be making biased edits, that he is in clear violation of Wikipedia policy, but that he is not being censored. If he continues, then he should be banned permanently. This is not an issue of the religion or national origin of people bringing up this case; it is an issue one Wikipedian introducing his own political views to Wikipedia, which is plainly against Wikipedia policy. <small><a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELittleDan_7151.html" title="User:LittleDan">LittleDan</a></small><sup><a href="../../../l/i/t/User_talk%7ELittleDan_c646.html" title="User talk:LittleDan">talk</a></sup> 17:58, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wow. This sort of flagrant assumption of bad faith, an unreasonable accusation that all your critics are sockpuppets (including one admin, and most of the rest are established users) with absolutely no research or evidence whatsoever, when your own poor behavior is at issue, in order to avoid addressing serious criticism, tends to speak towards your incorrigibility and the necessity of a ban, not the opposite. A community ban isn't something that happens when you hit a magic number of blocks, it's what happens when the community, through experience, comes to the conclusion that it can no longer tolerate your behavior. If you make that blatantly clear to us of your own accord, it will happen all the quicker. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 09:15, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Oppose. He has made similar comments several times in the past, and has allowed himself to be talked back from the brink. He needs to cool down and realize that even if some of the past reports against him were poorly founded, this incident was entirely self-inflicted. Before imposing a full ban, let's see if he can walk himself back again, or see if he wants to file a full new arbitration case to examine his charges of "scarlet lettering". <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 17:19, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>How does the project benefit by allowing him to edit? (These are serious questions, I'm not asking rhetorically) Are his contributions so valuable that the project would be better off continuing to endure his unacceptable behavior? How many chances should a user get before we say "Thanks, but we've had enough. Please leave now."? I just think that we often act as though every editor is so incredibly essential that we should attempt to "rehabiliate" even the most obvious disruptors. This isn't an isolated incident and dispute resolution has failed multiple times.

<dd>Replying to Thatcher, I'm cautiously in favour of allowing an unblock at some point, the only reason I blocked indef was because I didn't want to set a specific time.

<li>I think an indefinite block is about right, unfortunately.

<li>On the fence. As involved party, my opinion is worthless, but all I wanted him to do was adjust his comment so it wasn't so quasi-harassing.

<li>NuclearUmpf's behavior last Thursday, in regards to the <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_Silverstein_2269.html" title="Larry Silverstein">Larry Silverstein</a> article was entirely rude, lacked good faith, and seems typical of this users tendentious behavior. The day before, he left me a talk page message, requesting clarification as to why I reverted his edits. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:AudeVivere&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=108130127" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:AudeVivere&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=108130127" rel="nofollow">[88]</a> When I came on Wikipedia again, I replied, saying that I will answer on the article talk page. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:AudeVivere&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=108336018" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:AudeVivere&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=108336018" rel="nofollow">[89]</a> And, I answer on the article talk page. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Larry_Silverstein&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=108337944" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Larry_Silverstein&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=108337944" rel="nofollow">[90]</a> Nuclear then replies, "Please stop following my edits.

Anyway, I have been editing the article in question for over a year, and perhaps more than anyone else. Nuclear's first edit to the page was two days prior. So, who was following who? From this interaction and others with Nuclear, I find him counterproductive to our goals. This latest incident is the final straw. It's unlikely that Nuclear will change his ways. --<a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_5149.html" title="User:AudeVivere">Aude</a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/u/d/User_talk%7EAudeVivere_8a42.html" title="User talk:AudeVivere">talk</a>)</small> 17:34, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Support. Despite the good intentions of many users who tried to work with him in good faith, Zer0 has continued to engage in this abusive conduct for a long time with unrepentant and unflagging zeal. Observations about how he has done this in the past and 'allowed himself to be talked back from the brink' should show just how long the abuses by this user have been tolerated to the direct detriment of WP. The unwillingness to abide by his ArbCom probation, numerous personal attacks (homophobic and otherwise), disclosures of users' personal information, tendentious editing, sockpuppetry and cabal accusations Zer0 has leveled against other users are unacceptable and admins are the ones we trust to act in order to stop such conduct and protect the good faith of the community. As it is, we'll be having to stay on the lookout for anons or new socks that he creates to conduct the 'harassment' he promised.

<li>Oppose – …just to note that a lot of folks who shared their opinions could as easily be questioned about their edits (reverts), their manners and their civility. From my perspective this indefinite block will do no good. The fact is, Nuclear was under to much pressure, he was cornered (by the very people who advocate his forced retirement) and it's only natural that he decided to <i>bite back</i>. Constant threats about (poorly founded?) former charges? As far as I can recall three "coordinated attacks" in last month? Not sure what to say, but poor language is usually caused by poor language, raising one voice will raise another and so on… Double standards?

<p>My contributions to wikipedia aside, I feel that I have been deliberately targeted for wikiredress by the wikiuser Jeffpw. This user has raised a valid wikipoint, and that is that I have canvassed in a manner contrary to wikipedia rules. I have accepted that. However, the user's postings have digressed into wikibullying. What is more, the user accuses me of 'unwiki' behaviour when he himself is guilty of (I apologise for my lack of ability in iconising these links): insulting another user <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Coelacan&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109679416" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Coelacan&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109679416" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Coelacan&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109679416</a>; used inappropriate language whilst delighting in having another user banned, ergo, <b>banned his sorry ass</b>&lt;sp&gt; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jeffpw&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109437708" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jeffpw&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109437708" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jeffpw&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109437708</a>; and has used a word that I absolutely would not use here: 12:34, 10 February 2007 (hist) (diff) User:Jeffpw (→My Biography In Userboxspeak - bah humbug--I'm turning into a <b>fucking</b> Puritan). If complaints are to be made against me for my impassioned defence of the LGBT community, I'd rather that they weren't connected to one that is not only guilty of the same things that he levels against others, but delights in the banning of others. To a degree, wikipedia is something that we can switch off and go about our lives without any bother as this is a virtual community, but come on! Ganging-up to go with the flow when attacking another is just not cricket, and I don't deserve it.

I stand by my comment. The last edit Enzedbrit references was my edit summary when I switched from a "<b>smoker</b>" userbox to a "<b>non-smoker</b>" userbox. My last vice being gone, I am now a f*****g Puritan. Wikipedia is not censored for language. However, if my use of a common vulgarism offended Enzedbrit, I am more than willing to apologize to re-establish community harmony. Now I am off to the movies. Have a nice day (or not, if you don't feel like it. Who am I to tell you what to do?). <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffpw_23d5.html" title="User:Jeffpw">Jeffpw</a> 11:43, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarpet9_91e2.html" title="User:Carpet9">Carpet9</a> is a sockpuppet of <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EForestH2_888b.html" title="User:ForestH2">ForestH2</a>, a frequent sockpuppeteer. I blocked him, which may be construed as a conflict of interest (I don't consider myself in a conflict with him so much as that I'm the main admin involved in blocking him). While I've known that Carpet9 was a sockpuppet, I let him know that I would not worry about blocking him as long as he continued to edit in good faith. Recently, he's chosen to bother me, and I've therefore blocked him indefinitely. He does not dispute this block.</p>
<p>He does, however, dispute my December blocks of other accounts that I have tied to him (<a href="../../../s/p/o/User%7ESpongeBobBoy_8362.html" title="User:SpongeBobBoy">SpongeBobBoy</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/e/User%7EReeler_fc0a.html" title="User:Reeler">Reeler</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShipready_c19b.html" title="User:Shipready">Shipready</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacintoshApple_ba48.html" title="User:MacintoshApple">MacintoshApple</a>, <a href="../../../i/s/w/User%7EIswatch19_69d9.html" title="User:Iswatch19">Iswatch19</a>), accounts which he denies are his. My original blocks were not made because he admitted this to me (although I would not have noticed the accounts without him). In looking at the accounts' editing, there was a clear pattern between them all (a few were created and "retired" on the same day, a few had other indicators such as immediately creating bot accounts, another thing ForestH2 does occasionally). It's also worth noting that he claims to be <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESquirepants101_2dbc.html" title="User:Squirepants101">Squirepants101</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ACarpet9&amp;diff=109708942&amp;oldid=109708300" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ACarpet9&amp;diff=109708942&amp;oldid=109708300" rel="nofollow">diff</a>), something that has since been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_checkuser%2FCase%2FForestH2&amp;diff=109766077&amp;oldid=109764861" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_checkuser%2FCase%2FForestH2&amp;diff=109766077&amp;oldid=109764861" rel="nofollow">refuted</a> by CheckUser.

<li>He's already shown to control several sockpuppets and lying about controlling another account. I think you were actually a bit too reasonable when you said you wouldn't bother blocking a known sockpuppet. If he decides to bother you (I'd like to see some evidence of that to be sure) despite your huge assumption of good faith, he's outstayed his welcome. (Yeah, I know.

<p>This anon has been repeatedly adding a section (often with very incorrect information) to many digimon articles. He's being reverted by many editors who regularly edit the Digimon articles, and has been left <a href="../../../8/4/2E/User_talk%7E84.81.129.59.html" title="User talk:84.81.129.59">talk page notes</a> by myself and one other editor explaining why his edits have been reverted, and asking him to please stop.</p>
<p>One example of an article is the <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patamon.html" title="Patamon">Patamon</a> article (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Patamon&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Patamon&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">article history</a>). The same thing has been occuring on dozens of other digimon articles (check his contribution history).</p>
<p>It's been going on for about four days and i don't think i'm the only one who's getting sick of reverting these edits. It doesn't seem like he's planning to stop any time soon, so can someone block this address for a day or two. Hopefully, that'll suceed in getting the message through that he really should stop making those edits. --<a href="../../../y/a/k/User_talk%7EYaksha_d46a.html" title="User talk:Yaksha"><font color="#330066"><b>`/aksha</b></font></a> 12:07, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The particulars here are that this categorization is grossly offensive to everyone else in the generalized category of LGBT, and he's grossly offended. He needs to be civil about it, but ... this is ridiculous. The only people who lump them all together are anti-gay hate groups trying to make mainstream gays look bad. I'm removing the category. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 01:01, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I wouldn't do that, George, not while discussion is ongoing on the talk page. The fact is members at the LGBT Project are split on this issue, and we should probably be the ones who make the decision whether it is included or not. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffpw_23d5.html" title="User:Jeffpw">Jeffpw</a> 01:03, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, too late, but for the sake of argument (and to deter reverts) - psychologists researching pedophillia report it to be a third form of sexual attraction, distinct from hetero or homosexuality. Most pedophiles aren't gay, and only a tiny minority of gays are pedophiles, apparently proportionately less than in the general population. Most gays, all the ones I know, and everyone else across the LGBT spectrum, find connecting them with NAMBLA to be akin to hate speech. And I tend to agree. It's roughly equivalent to calling "Hitler", with the general populace.</dd>
<dd>The arguments on the talk page are not persuasive.</dd>
<dd>I certainly may end up being wrong on this, but your definition of the category is at odds with standard usage, and offensive to a lot of people, and I think there's a very good reason not to use it there. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 01:20, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Of the five members of <a href="../../../l/g/b/WP%7ELGBT_a8aa.html" title="WP:LGBT">WP:LGBT</a> who have expressed an opinion on the category so far, three have said it should stay and two otherwise. Thus "The only people who lump them all together are anti-gay hate groups" is not true, and that is in fact the (false) idea that Enzedbrit is pushing. I mean, I really, really understand his concerns, but the fact that the LGBT community have (rightly) utterly disowned NAMBLA doesn't make it any less LGBT. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDev920_f8f8.html" title="User:Dev920">Dev920</a> (Have a nice day!) 01:13, 21 February 2007 (UTC).</dd>

<li>It does actually. As has been pointed out by others on wikipedia, sex between men and boys does not mean that the man has to be a homosexual. This is something beyond heterosexuality and homosexuality. I am being attacked as having a strong POV, yet what people don't realise, because I am a faceless username on a planet of 6.5 billion, is that I have been actively involved in my community for many years and the activity of sex between adults and minors does not automatically fall into a determined sexuality. Rather than POV, that is accepted commonsense.<a href="../../../e/n/z/User%7EEnzedbrit_6d4b.html" title="User:Enzedbrit">Enzedbrit</a> 02:59, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I think one of the problem has been the fact that editors involved in this dispute may be too involved, either as members of the LGBT Wikiproject and/or as LGBT people, with issues surrounding the dispute. I suggested forms of dispute resolution to <a href="../../../e/n/z/User%7EEnzedbrit_6d4b.html" title="User:Enzedbrit">Enzedbrit</a> when I expressed a view that his cross-posting to talkpages could be seen as votestacking. I now think it would be helpful if an RfC be made about the categorisation of the article so that cooler heads may have a look at this issue, an intend to request such and RfC presently. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WjB</b></a><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe"><i>scribe</i></a></span> 01:25, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>A second, and probably bigger, problem I see, in reviewing the relevant talk section, is this edit: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANorth_American_Man%2FBoy_Love_Association&amp;diff=109385852&amp;oldid=109385020" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANorth_American_Man%2FBoy_Love_Association&amp;diff=109385852&amp;oldid=109385020" rel="nofollow">[101]</a> in which Enzedbrit uses 'Guilt By Association' to suggest that anyone who says it belongs in the category is either a pedophile or a pederast, or maybe just gay. No matter what he meant specifically, it's a clear challenge that anyone supporting category inclusion is horrific, thus dissuading others from supporting it's inclusion. I'd go voice support for inclusion, based on the 'historical perspectives' and 'criticisms of LGBT' arguments raised on the talk page, but I guess the WP's got it covered, for better or worse. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 01:32, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It might be useful if an uninvolved party spoke to Enzedbrit as so far comments about his conduct have all come from users involved in the dispute with him (myself included). My aim in the <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_SOC_f3eb.html" title="WP:RFC/SOC">WP:RFC/SOC</a> is to try and gain consensus to resolve the underlying dispute which has clearly become rather inflammatory. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WjB</b></a><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe"><i>scribe</i></a></span> 01:45, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I am responding my defence here. I have not been abusive at all and anyone that has followed my edits cannot claim in good faith that I have been. I have called upon 'decent LGBT folk' and have explained now several times, including on my talk page, what this meant. I have countered someone's assertion that my health is in question by edits to a group that openly advocates sex with children, with a comment that is fitting, and that is that I'm not the one sleeping with children. Again, this was not aimed at the contributor and this has been explained. Therefore, the grounds for me being listed here are baseless and I demand the removal of my good name from this page. <a href="../../../e/n/z/User%7EEnzedbrit_6d4b.html" title="User:Enzedbrit">Enzedbrit</a> 02:53, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I note that you are the LGBT coordinator. How strange. So, may I look at one point of your original posting? When confronted with two sides of an argument - that I have said someone has slept with children, or that I have said that I am not the one sleeping with children - you could take the view of the offended - that I said he sleeps with children - or the accused offender - that my mental state is in question and I retort with a comment directly applicable to the article that has caused all this mess - you still go with the view of the offended, overriding my explanation, and use it as a base comment for my being here. Why would the LGBT coordinator do this? <a href="../../../e/n/z/User%7EEnzedbrit_6d4b.html" title="User:Enzedbrit">Enzedbrit</a> 05:37, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Enzedbrit, responding with "I'm not the one sleeping with children" is, indeed, an attack against the person you replied to, and thus a violation of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>. No, you did not explicitly accuse the person you were responding to, but you have a good enough command of English to know what implication is. Your comment implies that the person you are responding to does, indeed, sleep with children--and I'm of the opinion that you are already quite aware of that. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustin_Eiler_f9c0.html" title="User:Justin Eiler">Justin Eiler</a> 05:45, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your indignant posture aside, you still don't seem to understand that your wording is a distinct 'challenge' at best, and Guilt by association in a worse light, and at the worst, an outright accusation, that anyone who can find any factual or contextual basis for the inclusion is by extensino also a pedophile. I'd wager that in fact you're fully aware of the meaning of yoru words, and hope to argue from a position of apparent moral superiority. Unfortunately, WP:NOT=High School Debate Club. Ad Hominem attacks and arguments from any sort of position of authority aren't relevant. The talk page makes some rather convincing points to me, and I'm an outsider to the entire issue. I'd rather be discussing Rush's latest album, upcoming movies about comic books, or 20th century art. However, I watch AN/I among many other pages, and more and more, I'm enjoying adding to the discussions here. Simply put, the arguments made that by association, critical and otherwise, that organization is tied to LGBT issues. Further, longstanding ideas about the sexuality of members, extant their agenda overlaps, warrants inclusion. I could keep going, but interested editors and admins can find it all on the talk page. To attack numerous Wikipedia editors, all acting in Good faith to help debate and find consensus on such an obviously difficult issue, is Pure Bad Faith. It's dishonest, disingenuous, and needs to stop. You do no one involved in this a service by your games. It's far better to read the issue through, and construct good points. If you're only going by gut emotion, at least more quietly support one side or another, as your feelings may be. But to vehemently defend your side while insulting all editors who come to help is poor manners, to say the least. It is that behavior we're discussing here on AN/I, not the categorization, which is being dealt with at the talk page and the project page. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/u/User_talk%7EThuranX_4d05.html" title="User talk:ThuranX">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ThuranX_4834.html" title="Special:Contributions/ThuranX">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<dd>Although I accept that so many people now think that I indeed have accused the user of sleeping with children, I hold to it that this is not my intention, and I stand by my redress of this. I also protest that I have attacked and/or insulted all those who have <i>acted in good faith</i> and do not see this as a justified assertion. I am well aware that this alleged behaviour is the topic of discussion, and the most aggrieving aspect of this is the seeming inability of those in contrast to me/my opinion to view those of the 'offended' in the same light by which I am being judged.

<dd>Enzed, the fundamental issue here is one of association, no matter how distasteful. Whether we approve or disapprove, the ideas behind NAMBLA came out of the post-Stonewall radical gay rights movement. I know that today almost no gay rights associations will have anything but repugnance for NAMBLA, but to have a complete, accurate, and <i>truly</i> NPOV assessment of LGBT issues, we cannot turn our backs on those issues that are no longer accepted. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustin_Eiler_f9c0.html" title="User:Justin Eiler">Justin Eiler</a> 12:32, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>*shrug* It really only seems to backfire when the LGBT community protests about this. I agree with <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustin_Eiler_f9c0.html" title="User:Justin Eiler">User:Justin Eiler</a> on this. The inclusion should be referenced as controversial, but as a notable wikiuser who happens to be LGBT, I should emphasize that LGBT expands into LGBTQQ, an umbrella that incorporates a broader strata of sexuality. Even reprehensible, distasteful sexuality.</dd>

<dd>(I confine myself to the procedural questions.) The more recent RfC has remained uncertified for well more than forty-eight hours and so can be deleted straightaway by any uninvolved party (the endorsement of the statement of the dispute by an uninvolved party ≠ a certification of that which underlies the dispute inasmuch, most notably, as the former does not reflect the endorsing user's having tried to resolve the dispute). On the latter issue, an RfC, to my understanding, is generally not formally closed, such that there is not after some period erected a bar to further participation (beyond, of course, the abiding <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>, etc.); one can safely divorce him/herself of an "old" RfC, though, I imagine, when its constructive potential appears exhausted (viz., when a consensus of editors has been borne out and contributions tend only to represent unsubstantial endorsements or restatements of expressed views). <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 05:38, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>OK, we have an issue here in that several individuals express frustration with InShaneee. Much of this is sour grapes.

I think it's important for the healthy functioning of this site that criticism of admin actions, even strong criticism, is allowed, nay, encouraged.

<dd>Sneaky personal attacks are still personal attacks. For instance, someone who says "If I were a vindictive person, I'd call you a &lt;censored&gt;, but I'm not vindictive so I'm not going to say that" is in essence gaming the system. Oh and by the way, I don't think we officially "close" RFCs, but adding new remarks to a page that is essentially abandoned is not a plausible form of dispute resolution. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 10:44, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have no opinion on the core dispute here, but I disagree with the assertion that "You are a terrible administrator" is a personal attack, especially when couched in hypothetical terms. While there are of course many good admins on Wikipedia, there have been and will be some bad apples among them. Are you suggesting that if anybody (rightly) criticises the actions of a bad admin, or (rightly) calls them out for being a bad admin, they are engaging in a personal attack? It just seems like a slippery slope toward forbidding all criticism of admins, because criticism of anyone's actions constitutes a personal attack. <a href="../../../v/e/n/User%7EVenicemenace_b4a4.html" title="User:Venicemenace">Venicemenace</a> 17:15, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Reverting your own user-page is generally held as an <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3rr_66ae.html#Exceptions" title="WP:3rr">exception</a> to 3RR, one that outside users do not similarly enjoy. Thereby, edit warring with a user on their talk page can indeed result in <i>you</i> getting blocked without any 3RR violation of the user in question. If you have a serious concern with a particular editor, a <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERfC_a13a.html" title="WP:RfC">request for comment</a> is a more appropriate avenue to pursue it. If your concern falls short of a RfC, you might consider disengagement instead of trying to force the issue on a user talk page. Really, that's pretty much a bad option because it's likely to prove unfruitful and harmful to yourself. <a href="../../../b/i/t/User%7EBitnine_cb95.html" title="User:Bitnine">Bitnine</a> 16:05, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks. It isn't a matter of edit warring - I just tried to continue the conversation and was not reverting. The fact that it was her/his user talk page is the reason why it isn't an <i>actionable</i> violation, but it still shows contempt for policy, and far more importantly, shows utter unwillingness to attempt to resolve the issue . The user's edits appear to be well-poisoning in a dispute in which the user appears to have been acting as a "mediator"; thus, I think the comment should be struck. If I'm wrong, convince me I am wrong, don't escalate to insults and threats. With regards to disengagement - it's part of a DR filing <i>against</i> me, so her/his characterising me as "unwilling" to proceed (when I was unaware of the filing) isn't something from which I can disengage. An RFC requires two people who have had the same problem with the user, so it isn't an option. Filing a request for informal mediation via the medcab is a waste of time, in my experience, since almost every "mediator" I have dealt with there seems clueless about policy..not to mention the user is active in the medcab (perhaps this is part of what is endemically wrong with the medcab - "mediators" who can't discuss differences in a civil manner). I didn't raise it here, but I am interested in resolving this issue. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 16:21, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I speedied it some time ago as what was apparently a nonsense attack, but quickly discovered that -- at the very least -- it's not <i>patent</i> nonsense. I personally figure the purpose of redirects is to get people to what they're looking for as quickly as possible.

<dd>Nothing to see here. Move along. The short answer is that content disputes belong on the talk page of the article.

It seems all problems would be solved if talk page discussions between these parties were limited to article space. Going forward, that seems to be the best policy. As for the "physicality" it appears <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">User:MONGO</a>'s position is if you are going to say "Fuck you" to him, you should say it to his face.

<dd>(Quadruple edit conflict) (Tyrenius, I hope you'll forgive my tampering with your post to put relevant dif's throughout.) I'm familiar with the page the two are debating about but am not involved in this conflict. For those who aren't familiar with the 9/11 article and corresponding talk page, it gets pretty heated. I don't think MONGO was intending a physical threat here. MONGO's comments boil down to "you pissed me off; I feel you were rude to me; people aren't rude to me in person; don't talk to me again." While I'd advise MONGO to avoid mentioning his apparently fearsome mortal coil in the future, I'm strongly of the mind this was not a threat. Uncivil, perhaps, but no threat. <b><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorjam</a></b> <small><a href="../../../j/d/o/User_talk%7EJDoorjam_230c.html" title="User talk:JDoorjam">JDiscourse</a></small> 02:42, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>He could have come to ANI or some uninvolved third party to ask for clarification or mediation. You were a bad choice. He's seeing a threat where there's only rudeness, and that is not something he needs to leave the project for, nor something that justified the block on MONGO.

<p>As I said on MONGO's talk page, I'm female, and I can't imagine feeling frightened as a result of MONGO's post. If people are so sensitive, then maybe they should just respect another user's wish that they discuss problems on the relevant article talk page rather than on his user talk page. I make a point of not continuing to post on people's talk pages once they make it clear that my posts are unwelcome, unless it's absolutely essential, and MONGO said he had the articles watchlisted. (By the way, was it just a coincidence, that Thomas went to ask help from someone who had been in serious dispute with MONGO?) I wish admins would give a little more consideration before they put permanent records in someone's block log — something that's far worse than the inconvenience of temporarily being unable to edit. I fully support the unblocking. This was a very trivial matter, completely overblown.

<dd>I object to the innuendo of "serious dispute with MONGO". I'm not aware of having much to do with MONGO, and whatever dispute there was was very short-lived.

<dd>Hi! I've mentioned this elsewhere, but I wanted to drop a line here, as well. I'm completely fine with the unblock performed by <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">User:SlimVirgin</a>, especially as other users and administrators voiced a desire for <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">Mongo</a> to be unblocked. I maintain that the comments were extremely inappropriate, and indeed threatening. Of course, the threat was empty and not frightening, but it was a threat nonetheless and something that we cannot allow or even ignore, lest things escalate, which was what my block intended to prevent. As a number of experienced and well-intentioned users seem to be watching the user talk page, I'm confident that they will act as a voice of reason should any further discussions disintegrate into silliness again. With regards to any "smearing", it wasn't my intention nor my will, however I do stand by my actions.

<p>LOL. The interwebnet is chockers with feebs who cry "you wouldn't say that to my face in real life" and no one ever feels threatened. Gaillimh can think himself lucky that deadminning is so difficult. If you could lose the bit for just not having a clue, he'd be back among the grunts already. Kudos to Slim for taking the right action; brickbat for MONGO for the silly comment. BTW, should you really get the bit when you change IDs? Isn't it the ID we have trust in, rather than the person behind it?

<dd>Exactly...maybe it makes for an uncomfortable editing experince for Basboll, but I have told him previously to not bring content disputes to my talkpage and yet he persists and even accuses me of somehow doing something wrong for reverting his edit that he had no consensus to add...and finishes up that heated exchange with a hardly honest "Have a nice day", which is akin to saying fuck you where I am from. How anyone except someone with an axe to grind could construe my response as a real physcial threat is beyond me. I have no idea who Gaillimh is...but now my block log indicates that I made <i>intimidation and thinly veiled threats of violence</i>...how outrageously preposterous is this.

<p>A point of clarification might be in order. If I left Wikipedia over this it would not be because I "felt threatened" by Mongo. As other people have noted, though it was clearly some sort of gesture at the fact that I probably wouldn't be able to handle myself in his "presence", such threats are too unrealistic in this medium to be taken seriously. But my "virtual" experience with Mongo has been that of repeatedly having to stand up to a bully. In the past, we have had some success in keeping things civil on the article talk pages, precisely because we could take things our own talk pages. Mongo's outburst suggested to me (actually confirmed for me) that he is likely to interpret little "pleasantries" like "have a nice day" as direct insults. He is, of course, free to do that, and I guess I can see his point in this case. My hope, in contacting Tyrenius, was simply to straighten the matter out: to assure him that I did not mean it as an insult (just a rather terse "good bye, let's not say more about this") and to give him the opportunity to assure me that he was just doing some rhetorical posturing--drawing the line, as it were. If disputes like this can't be resolved in a civil way (note that Mongo is basically suggesting that we mutually assume bad faith in each other's edits) then I simply have better things to do. The part of me that, I think, offers some hope for a thaw here is that I can understand Mongo's reluctance to appear to back down from a fight. I feel the same way, which is why I stress that I'm <b>not</b> asking for protection from Mongo. I'm just not interested in "fighting" my way out of every edit I make like this. In any case, I know when I'm outnumbered. So unless Mongo does the gentlemanly thing and retract his remarks and return to a state of open, civil disagreement, or more formal authorities intervene, well, I'll just be moving on.--<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas_Basboll_a8ed.html" title="User:Thomas Basboll">Thomas Basboll</a> 07:56, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Thomas, you and MONGO have a long-standing dispute, I recommend you to take it to mediation. I don't think this warrants any kind of sanctions against anyone, but the phrase "chill out" does spring unbidden to mind. I am unsure why people find it necessary to make hundreds of edits per day to the 9/11 articles anyway, since nothign much has changed about the events or their interpretation recently. Perhaps if everybody took a voluntary break from editing those articles? <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 11:06, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>My hope is still that Mongo and I just offer those mutual assurances, acknowledge the misundertanding, and get back to a civil tone, with each other's talk pages open to deal with these occasional needs to chill. Otherwise, yes, some further step in the dispute resolution process will be necessary before I, in any case, can get back to work. The content question about the 9/11-related articles is very tricky. When I arrived on the scene last year, the articles were in fact quite outdated, and needed a lot of work on the details. Mongo agrees with this at a general level, I think, and even in the case of the article that gave rise to this incident. What he objected to was my particular approach to beginning improvements (which he believes is an extreme form of POV pushing.) Incidents like this, and their underlying causes, are no doubt much to blame for hampering the continuous improvement of the articles. So we deal with problems in the order that they must be solved. Right now, it is this.--<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas_Basboll_a8ed.html" title="User:Thomas Basboll">Thomas Basboll</a> 11:22, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>This stuff is a good example of where people have been wanting to go. By continually treating <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> as if it said that "personal attacks" result in blocks, we have made over half the threads on AN/I about "I got insulted! I got attacked! I want him or her blocked!" If <i>that</i> weren't enough, we're sitting right in the middle of a pile of "could it conceivably be interpreted as hostile in any way, and, if so, can I possibly block?" So we get brush-offs as attacks, attacks as threats, and then blocks for content disputes and because someone <i>said</i> (past tense) a thing. Oh, happy! Troll heaven! We can bring all editing to a halt by going to AN/I, claiming to be intimidated, and then getting blocks thrown.</li>
<li>Is it the fault of the new admins that they blocked, when the older admins have been encouraging this misbegotten, illogical, and inevitably crippling understanding of "help, help, I'm being repressed?" We should have been making it clear that the more prone to minority point of view edits a topic is, the slower anyone needs to be in responding to a complaint. We should have never allowed anyone, much less rising admins, to misunderstand "attack" to be "could you, would you, if you wanted to consider this possibly sort of mean," and letting people believe that "personal attack" is a reason for a block is just crazy.</li>
<li>The fact is that some topics are victims of legion minority points of view edits. UFO's, Bigfeet, alien abductions, Arab/Israeli issues, 9/11, Guantanamo Bay and Camp X-ray, the moon landing, perpetual motion, the JFK assassination, all have not <i>one</i> minority point of view, but hundreds of minority points of view, and most are represented by some editor, sooner or later. The reason we don't allow the usual flow and ebb of an article like that to whatever the editors think is that each minority point of view alienates and irritates all the others, and these articles are non-stop war. When we have people who stand up to watch these articles, even if they're too conservative, we should be overjoyed. If they get aggravated by the editors wanting to change this way and that, you ought to think, at least temporarily, "better him than me." <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:48, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This is why PAIN was discontinued - my goodness, I've been called a bitch and other things which I'd prefer not to even repeat, and it harms me not at all. It harms the poster's reputation as someone who can keep their cool and/or make nice, yes - but that the heck is this? If I call someoe a name, it is <i>irrelevant</i>, and someone would do well to remind me to <i>comment on the content, not the contributor</i>. What is this, the civility police again? I repeat my previous advice: encourage people to be civil, yes. Act like it is a crime just short of infanticide to make a snippy comment or be less than completely polite and repectful? Bullshit. And as for the blocking admin, while I concur with Geogre that "the older admins have been encouraging this misbegotten, illogical, and inevitably crippling understanding of "help, help, I'm being repressed" hence the newer admins have been led down this absurd path, I am deeply concerned that Gaillimh states he "stands by" blocking MONGO, adding to his permanent block record that he was guilty of threats - which is patently untrue. Please clarify - are you sorry? in which case you erred, and should say so - or are you not? in which case... well, I've edited this about eight times and there is no polite way to say what I'm thinking. Let me just say, I'd prefer to see a "my very very bad, I have Learned" rather than "I stand by this block". <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a><sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a></sup> 14:44, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>As I mentioned, if what I said is construed as a personal attack or anything tantamount to a real physical threat, then I must have different perceptions than some. I've been called every name in the book, got a few death threats and whatnot since being on Wiki so maybe my jab seems to me to be a much to do about nothing. I have an I'm going to "whoop your ass" comment on my talkpage now by one editor who showed up obviously to antagonize the situation, but I merely played games with that in my exchange with ElC...obviously I can see much to do about nothing when it's obvious. I can't imagine why I would go running to a potentially sympathtic admin just because of a simple nothingness...just maybe as I stated, I've seen so much worse that this raises the bar of tolerance for me.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 20:56, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Seize that fire Mongo, you know I wouldn’t touch you, not even with the flower, I've distributed a lot's of smiles along with those massages, weren't you laughing? I was, since just a few spaces above Nuke has suffered indefinite block and I wrote about double standards and was about to provide a reference to illustrate such standards, and right from the blue there comes Mongo (with his little droogs). It was not only convenient, but lovely to say the least. So just to be clear on things, till yesterday you weren't on my watchlist at all, and you won't be after we see this through. You did insult me maliciously few days back, and I'm not about to turn the other cheek every time you and Regebro decide to have your little rampage. As I said before, here and there me &amp; Mongo share a few words of disagreement and life goes on. I'd kindly advise you not to push that whoop all around the Wiki, it was a joke, come to think of it, TBeattyes &amp; ElC's edits made me smile too… As for these latest developments, I do agree with the Thomas, it's not healthy if we are to have some sort of "poor language standard" here.

<dd>The thing here, however, is that before this AN/I was started you had an opportunity simply to say "It wasn't meant as a threat" when Tyrenius communicated my "It wasn't meant as a 'fuck you'". There wasn't a big to do about anything at that point. As to "raising the bar", yes, that's the issue. KillerChihuahua may accept being called a bitch and worse; and you may accept receiving death threats. The question is whether you want to have your own behaviour judged with that as your standard. The question is whether you think WP should be an environment where that's just how we do things. I know I don't want to work in an environment where the bar is set that "high". (Think about that metaphor for a second. It's normally about the difficulty of a challenge. What we're really talking about here is how <i>low</i> the rhetorical bar should be.)--<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas_Basboll_a8ed.html" title="User:Thomas Basboll">Thomas Basboll</a> 21:58, 21 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, the thing here, as you put it, is <i>was that a blockable offense</i>? I found being called a bitch highly unacceptable. I told the person who did it how unacceptable I found it. That's not the point. The point is <i>I didn't block</i> nor did I report it, etc. We're not discussing levels of acceptable behavior. We're discussing whether blocks are appropriate blocks. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a><sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a></sup> 22:06, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Ah, I see. I'll stay out of the question of the block, which I don't actually understand. (Those who have pointed out that Mongo wasn't harrassing me are perfectly right.) Keep in mind that telling Mongo that I found his behaviour unacceptable (something I've done a few times before) would mean disrespecting his request that I stay away from his talk page (for ever). My appeal to Tyrenius was not a report, but a first step in a dispute resolution. Isn't that the most natural interpretation?--<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas_Basboll_a8ed.html" title="User:Thomas Basboll">Thomas Basboll</a> 22:16, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Actually no incivilities should be tolerated. I generally maintain a civil tone if I am dealing with someone who is civil. If they are accusatory, snide or condescending and it is persistant, then my patience for such behavior generally lessens, as would be expected. You've decided to concentrate on critical articles, at least one of which is one of the most visited articles on Wikipedia, so expecting that everyone is going to agree with alterations for which there is little or no consensus for, is probably not a likely event to expect.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 22:20, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think my behaviour here was snide or condescending or accusatory. I was offended by your edit summary and I told you so. You have lost your patience with me. And I with you. And so perhaps we should consider mediation. Otherwise our conflicts over the article will be as unproductive as this one. During such a mediation I can try to explain to you where I'm coming from. You consistently misunderstand my motives, and express that understanding, as I put it this time around, in inflammatory ways. That's been your approach to me from the beginning, sadly. Maybe this is an opportunity to see what I do in a new light.--<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas_Basboll_a8ed.html" title="User:Thomas Basboll">Thomas Basboll</a> 22:26, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I originally posted what follows in italics on 19 February, but no admin bothered to respond, possibly because this user is such a aggravation:</p>
<p><i>Serafin has been evading his block, and has been continuing his disruptive editting. He was blocked on 19 January for 1 month, but since then has made ~100 edits <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_131.104.218.46_5828.html" title="Special:Contributions/131.104.218.46">see here</a>, most of which have been personal attacks and none of which have been useful contributions. if you will read <a href="../../../s/u/s/Wikipedia%7ESuspected_sock_puppets_Serafin_321d.html" title="Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Serafin">Wikipedia:Suspected_sock_puppets/Serafin</a> you will see how problematic he has been. He has been banned from both Polish and German wikipedias (sometimes known as Aserafin, Bserafin, Cserafin), further indication that his actions are not likely to contribute anything to the English wikipedia. if that wasn't enough of a smoking gun, I would like to direct you to a talk that took place between him and another polish-speaking editor, <a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilip_Gronowski_f606.html" title="User talk:Philip Gronowski">User_talk:Philip_Gronowski</a>. Much of the discussion is in Polish, but Philip was kind enough to translate it for me <a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilip_Gronowski_Translation_of_Polish_55bd.html" title="User talk:Philip Gronowski/Translation of Polish">here</a>. the most incriminating part is where he states <b>You can rest assured that I will be doing everything to close as many articles as I can.</b> This was commented soon after the all the articles he had been editting were protected, and he had been blocked for a month. Can someone please block all his sockpuppets to allow the normal editors with good intentions to continue on wikipedia. and if he uses another anon IP, perhaps semi-protect the pages he has been seen to frequent.</i></p>
<p>I would also like to add that he is now unblocked, and using multiple accounts to 3RR violate on <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> article as well as many others. he is primary using his one IP address and <a href="../../../s/n/i/User%7ESnieg_41b2.html" title="User:Snieg">User:Snieg</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerafin_4705.html" title="User:Serafin">User:Serafin</a> (the block on the latter ran out despite his evading his block ~100 times). I have also been told that <a href="../../../w/i/a/User%7EWiatr_551a.html" title="User:Wiatr">user:Wiatr</a> is another sockpuppet he just created, and is also the same name of another sockpuppet he created on German wikipedia. I would like to quote him, he said <i>You can rest assured that I will be doing everything to close as many articles as I can.</i> <a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilip_Gronowski_Translation_of_Polish_55bd.html" title="User talk:Philip Gronowski/Translation of Polish">here</a> and he is very well trying to do that, on <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recovered_Territories_96ac.html" title="Recovered Territories">Recovered Territories</a> <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> and other articles. This person has been banned from both Polish and German wikipedias, why must we put up with such an editor when it is plain to see he is not here to be constructive or contribute to wikipedia in any way. The only thing he adds is more stress and frustration.</p>

<dd>Well, at the very least, we have severe edit warring going on here. Furthermore, Snieg does seem to me to be an obvious sockpuppet being used abusively. Before I make any decisions, could another administator or two have a look at this? Am I right in thinking this is an obvious case of sockpuppetry and that we needn't go through Checkuser? (Still pretty new to the admin bit, don't want to make any dumb decisions. <a href="../../../h/e/i/User%7EHeimstern_8a02.html" title="User:Heimstern">Heimstern Läufer</a> 22:01, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

But no block has followed as of now. The CheckUser result does not only prove that the first edit Serafin made after the block was actually violating the 3RR, but it is also further conclusive proof of the fact that Serafin evaded his one-month block. The following is the most recent history of Serafin's block evasions. There were some before it and not to mention those in the German wikipedia, but the following are directly relevant to the case and there should finally be a decision.</dd>

<dd>On January 17, J.smith reset his block of Serafin because of block evasion(s). On January 18, Serafin's continued block evasion(s) led J.smith to warn Serafin that any further edit by him "to anywhere other then this talk page before the block expires" would prompt J.smith to "extend the block to a month and propose a permanent ban". Well, Serafin continued and he was blocked by him for one month (though as far as I'm aware J.smith didn't propose the perma-ban). (for evidence most of the paragraph can be looked up at <a href="../../../s/e/r/User_talk%7ESerafin_cb24.html#Blocked_from_editing_for_48_hours" title="User talk:Serafin">User_talk:Serafin#Blocked_from_editing_for_48_hours</a>)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But a block lasting a week, a month or eternity could be all the same to Serafin - because why abide by any of them? So some days later J.smith noticed that Serafin was still editing and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:131.104.218.46" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:131.104.218.46" rel="nofollow">blocked</a> his main IP for a week, which didn't even prevent Serafin from editing in this week (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Erudra" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Erudra" rel="nofollow">[117]</a>).</dd>

<dd>I do not know exactly why J.smith stopped involvement but I believe that no admin would like to be the only one dealing with a large case for a long period of time. So please, admins, also get involved. Because of this history and because Serafin evaded his one-month block and the moment he got unblocked his revert warring even got more terrible, another one-month block is the least that can be done. <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7ESciurin%C3%A6_d3c6.html" title="User:Sciurinæ">Sciurinæ</a> 22:55, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

If there are doubts, couldn't we just ask him to give some certification by sending us an e-mail from that photographer's domain or something of the kind? BTW, if he is not the photographer, how did he get access to all the photos in the first place? Those that are displayed on the website have some watermarks and stuff, and those he uploaded haven't. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 18:32, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Honestly, I don't see why someone would pretend to be a photographer if they weren't. He most likely <i>is</i> Daniel Gluskoter. I simply provided the links because they were referenced in the initial post. I have no opinion one way or the other about the editor other than I find him to be sorely lacking in <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">civility</a>. His last message to me was a simple "F/Y". <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy"><font color="green"><b>IrishGuy</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishguy_9a49.html" title="User talk:Irishguy"><font color="blue"><i>talk</i></font></a></sup> 20:06, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>He is Daniel Gluskoter. I sent an e-mail earlier to the contact address listed at dgpics.com, and I received a reply confirming it. —<a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChowbok_9a99.html" title="User:Chowbok"><span style="background:black; color:white; font-weight: bold;">Chowbok</span></a> <a href="../../../c/h/o/User_talk%7EChowbok_a1df.html" title="User talk:Chowbok"><span style="color:black;">☠</span></a> 21:58, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
