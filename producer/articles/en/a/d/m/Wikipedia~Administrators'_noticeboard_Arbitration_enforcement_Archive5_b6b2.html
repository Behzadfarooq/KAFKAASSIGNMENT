<ul>
<li>I run the Web site <a href="http://www.plasma-universe.com/index.php" class="external text" title="http://www.plasma-universe.com/index.php" rel="nofollow">plasma-universe.com</a>. *My server logs note various visits by IP address 71.57.90.96 and 216.125.49.252 (Wikipedia contributors) whose timing coincide with the actions from two users named "<a href="http://www.plasma-universe.com/index.php/Special:Contributions/Asshole" class="external text" title="http://www.plasma-universe.com/index.php/Special:Contributions/Asshole" rel="nofollow">Asshole</a>" (on 23 Feb | <a href="http://www.plasma-universe.com/access_log-07-02-23.log" class="external text" title="http://www.plasma-universe.com/access_log-07-02-23.log" rel="nofollow">Log</a> (359K) ) and "<a href="http://www.plasma-universe.com/index.php/Special:Contributions/Anon" class="external text" title="http://www.plasma-universe.com/index.php/Special:Contributions/Anon" rel="nofollow">Anon</a>" (on 25 Feb | <a href="http://www.plasma-universe.com/access_log-07-02-25.log" class="external text" title="http://www.plasma-universe.com/access_log-07-02-25.log" rel="nofollow">Log</a> (285K)). Yesterday (11 Mar) I also received over 400 emails (example available on request) sourced from IP address 71.57.90.96, and another contributor to the plasma-universe.com web site received numerous emails,<a href="http://www.plasma-universe.com/index.php/User_talk:Iantresman#Phishing.3F" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.plasma-universe.com/index.php/User_talk:Iantresman#Phishing.3F" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></li>
<li>Both IP addresses 71.57.90.96 and 216.125.49.252 resolve to ILLINOIS, and an email I received from someone at "<a href="http://hwashington.ccc.edu/" class="external text" title="http://hwashington.ccc.edu/" rel="nofollow">Harold Washington College</a>" in Illinois, also shows the IP address of 216.125.49.252.</li>
<li>WP:NPA on "<a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html#Off-wiki_personal_attacks" title="WP:NPA">Off-wiki personal attacks</a> notes that "Wikipedia acknowledges that it cannot regulate behavior in media not under the control of the Wikimedia Foundation, but personal attacks elsewhere may create doubt as to whether an editor's on-wiki actions are being conducted in good faith."</li>
<li>The evidence suggests that User <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> will be shown to also operate <a href="../../../7/1/2E/User%7E71.57.90.96.html" title="User:71.57.90.96">71.57.90.96</a> and 216.125.49.252, and he is responsible for the vandalism and spamming of users on <a href="http://www.plasma-universe.com/index.php" class="external text" title="http://www.plasma-universe.com/index.php" rel="nofollow">plasma-universe.com</a>.

<dd>I was informed about this notice from a third party who monitors this board. The first time I heard about Ian's website was when Ian made mention of it at <a href="../../../p/l/a/Talk%7EPlasma_cosmology_bb1b.html" title="Talk:Plasma cosmology">Talk:Plasma cosmology</a>, but I thought that he was simply spamming for his website. Now it seems he is accusing me of unbecoming behavior and trying to sully my reputation at Wikipedia. I have some ideas who might be orchestrating this (I believe it is a student of mine), but I'm pretty upset that Ian would accuse me of this behavior without ever having asked me for assistance. I do use the two IPs in question to log into Wikipedia, but the accusations he is leveling against the ScienceApologist account are not connected with the person who logs into Wikipedia as such. --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> 12:30, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>So what you're saying that you believe that <a href="../../../7/1/2E/User%7E71.57.90.96.html" title="User:71.57.90.96">71.57.90.96</a> has been compromised, though the comments to <a href="../../../p/l/a/Talk%7EPlasma_cosmology_bb1b.html" title="Talk:Plasma cosmology">Talk:Plasma_cosmology</a> under IP address 71.57.90.96 are yours? --<a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIantresman_3a2c.html" title="User:Iantresman">Iantresman</a> 17:58, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I can also corroborate, as I am the other party who received several messages for "password change request notification." Appx 25-30 on plasma-universe.com and one from wikipedia.com. The one originating from wikipedia.com has been forwarded to wikipedia. Though at that time I didn't have any information on who may have had access to anonymous IP 71.57.90.96 (noted as the originator of the illegitimate password change requests). I assume these were either designed to disrupt use of the system (despite measure in place that countered disruption by outside parties, so usability was not ACTUALLY compromised, thankfully), or as an [unsuccessful] attempt to hack my password on that forum or on wikipedia. I assume it was more of a "nuisance" than necessarily a hack attempt. I can't say with certainty who originated the illegitimate password change requests, nor will I speculate. If ScienceApologist states the IP address is his (I'll accept his statement), but has been in some manner compromised, I hope that further steps to limit such action in the future will be taken. If the machine is a shared machine, say at a university or other educational institution (or the IP is used by a proxy server shared between many users), etc. it may be difficult to track down an actual perpetrator. So, I won't jump to conclusions as to intent, etc. I'll just hope it doesn't happen again.&#160;;o] Anyway, nice chatting with all y'all again. Not quite sure how I got roped into the whole thing, aside from I'd left comments on Ian's talk page on plasma-universe.com and signed it, and perhaps someone followed that link and spammed it too, though not to the same extent as they spammed Ian. Like I said, I can corroborate THAT it happend, but not much more than the IP address noted in the e-mails from here and thereabouts, and the number received. Hope everyone has a good day, aside from this little quibble. I bear no ill will, so long as I don't get roped in any further. =o] <a href="../../../m/g/m/User%7EMgmirkin_558d.html" title="User:Mgmirkin">Mgmirkin</a> 03:12, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I may also note that the anonymous user ID 71.57.90.96 and Ian have been having discussions on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Plasma_cosmology" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Plasma_cosmology" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Plasma_cosmology</a> in recent days, and possibly contentions elsewhere. As I recall from prior WP experiece, SA &amp; Ian can occasionally be mutually antagonistic over contentious issues. I won't comment on rightness or wrongness of either party, or speculate on whether these contentious issues may have spilled over into vandalism of Ian's site by IP 71.57.90.96 (whether SA or someone else) and current spam issues today. Again, don't really want to get involved much beyond that. Just noting for contextual purposes that both, as I recall (I don't frequent WP much anymore, so I was surprised when I got roped into the spamming bit), have had prior conversations, some of which possibly leading up to today's issue (or not). I hope all this gets resolved amicably, of course. Best of luck all. <a href="../../../m/g/m/User%7EMgmirkin_558d.html" title="User:Mgmirkin">Mgmirkin</a> 03:25, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Admin comment</b>. <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html#Off-wiki_personal_attacks" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA#Off-wiki_personal_attacks</a> clearly states that wikipedia "cannot regulate behavior in [outside] media" and "an editor may not be directly penalized for off-wiki attacks". So we can hardly punish these offences, especially since <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">User:ScienceApologist</a> denies involvement. The policy <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html#Off-wiki_personal_attacks" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA#Off-wiki_personal_attacks</a> does allow off-wiki behaviour to be "taken as aggravating factors when any on-wiki policy violations are being considered", but that is something for <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAR_b522.html" title="WP:RFAR">WP:RFAR</a>, not <a href="../../../a/e/_/WP%7EAE_df73.html" title="WP:AE">WP:AE</a>.

Unfortunately the uploading of many megabytes of images, and the double redirects put into place, not only crashed the site, but knocked out a number of my client's Web sites too. As Admins may appreciate, this directly affects my business (I am a Web publisher), which I consider malicious.</li>

<ul>
<li>I can corroborate this too. I was sent an additional appx 40 messages this morning around 6:00 am. I would still prefer to be kept out of this. However, the perpetrator appears to have their own agenda, and may not even know about this discussion, since it may not be ScienceApologist, but another party who has co-opted IP addresses (or these may be proxy addresses used by a proxy server service, and may be used intermittently by different users). Other IP addresses used included: 75.126.48.148, 85.195.119.22, 85.195.123.22, 85.195.123.25, 85.195.123.26, 85.195.123.29 (I note that their talk pages generally indicate that they may be "shared"/proxy/zombie IP's). I don't know whether these were by the same user (sock puppets), or by copycats (I believe I'll remove a comment from Plasma Cosmology ^talk with details of the initial incident in order to curtail copycat issues). <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../m/g/m/User%7EMgmirkin_558d.html" title="User:Mgmirkin">Mgmirkin</a> (<a href="../../../m/g/m/User_talk%7EMgmirkin_8277.html" title="User talk:Mgmirkin">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mgmirkin_fe47.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mgmirkin">contribs</a>) 17:16, 13 March 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<dd><b>Admin response</b>. Your best recourse may be to contact the ISP of the individuals involved and/or your national law enforcement (since such attacks are illegal in most places). One way or the other, you should probably not bring such matters to this page (arbitration enforcement) since we only deal with enforcing existing arbitration rulings. Again, I'm interested in hearing comments from other arbitrators. <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBucketsofg_06fb.html" title="User:Bucketsofg"><font color="#DF0001"><b>Buck</b></font><b><font color="green">ets</font></b><font color="grey"><b>ofg</b></font></a> 13:47, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Indeed, I wouldn't involve ISPs and law enforcement here.

<p>Here is what I think is concluding evidence on the three cases of off-site vandalism and personal attacks of my Web site, <a href="http://www.plasma-universe.com" class="external text" title="http://www.plasma-universe.com" rel="nofollow">plasma-universe.com</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>216.125.49.252</b> is an IP address of "Harold Washington College". ScienceApologist is quite correct that as a shared IP address, one of his students could use it.</li>
<li><b>71.57.90.96</b> appears to be residential (home) IP address. Its times of use suggest out-of-college hours; My server log files (available on request) include the modified IP-address entry "c-71-57-90-96.hsd1.il.comcast.net". I contacted the customer service department of Comcast.net who told me that "it looks like it belongs to a subscriber .. probably a home"<a href="http://www.plasma-universe.com/docs/070313-comcast-report.gif" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.plasma-universe.com/docs/070313-comcast-report.gif" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. This would make it very difficult to "compromise" this IP address as recorded on Wikipedia.</li>
<li><b>A student</b> may plausibly have been responsible for the attacks using the shared IP address, 216.125.49.252, the likelihood that they would also have access to the home IP address 71.57.90.96 is slim. The student would require direct access to the home computer, or the installation of <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trojan_horse_%28computing%29.html" title="Trojan horse (computing)">trojan software</a>. We also have to assume that the student would have the motive, the will, the expertise and a streak of malicious ill-will again both myself and ScienceApologist. Or the student has authorised access to the home computer, but the owner does not notice.</li>
<li>ScienceApologist says he heard about plasma-universe.com after my mention of it on Talk:Plasma cosmology,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Plasma_cosmology&amp;diff=110406275&amp;oldid=110292404" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Plasma_cosmology&amp;diff=110406275&amp;oldid=110292404" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> on 23 Feb 2007 at 20:08 UTC (14:08 CDT). My server log files shows a visit from the home IP 71.57.90.96 at 8:05 UTC (2:05 CDT), 12 hours earlier. It results from a Google search for: "redshift wikipedia" an article which ScienceApologist has been heavily involved.</li>
<li>While some of the vandalism was carried out through anonymous proxies such as Anonymouse.org and hidemyass.com, the most recent attack on 13 Mar at 03:08 UTC (10:08pm CDT+1 12 Mar) was preceded one minute earlier by a server log entry from "c-71-57-90-96.hsd1.il.comcast.net", the home IP address.</li>
<li>Where the off-site Web site vandals left comments, it is interesting to compare some of them with previous comments by ScienceApologist</li>

<li><b>Conclusion</b>. Scienceapologist's IP address 71.57.90.96 appears to be a residential IP address associated with a home PC. The same IP address was also responsible for attacks on my server that has damaged my business.

<dd>As I mentioned earlier, I have a student who works on research projects with me and I encouraged him to look into these controversies at Wikipedia (and yes, he shares my home internet connection with me through a proxy network as he cannot afford his own ISP but needed acceses to the internet to conduct research). He has personally admitted to me that he did vandalize Ian's site and has made a few posts under both my IPs at Wikipedia. I have taken measures to prevent this sort of action in the future, but as far as I'm concerned this is a matter best left to private conversation. --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> 00:18, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Admin note</b> There's not much ScienceApologist can do about editing from the college, but certainly there shouldn't be any further incidents coming from his residential IP address. It would be best for Ian and SA to work this out in private; there is no precedent for taking on-wiki action here. Any negative behavior on wikipedia coming from SA's residential address after this has been brought to his attention would be another matter. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 00:25, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>These users are working together to avoid 1rr and game the system on the <a href="../../../m/a/m/Mammed_Amin_Rasulzade_f485.html" title="Mammed Amin Rasulzade">Mammed Amin Rasulzade</a> article.</p>
<p>Here is the history of the article: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mammed_Amin_Rasulzade&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mammed_Amin_Rasulzade&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[15]</a></p>
<p>Here is the history of the article's talk page: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Mammed_Amin_Rasulzade&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Mammed_Amin_Rasulzade&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[16]</a></p>
<p>Notice how Grandmaster has not been involved in the article since the 21st of February and did not participate in any of the recent discussions. Here is Adil Baguirov's revert, in which he is adding information which has nothing to do with Rasulzade, let alone his exile: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mammed_Amin_Rasulzade&amp;diff=115011212&amp;oldid=114873471" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mammed_Amin_Rasulzade&amp;diff=115011212&amp;oldid=114873471" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> Then, after I revert, with good reason, since the information is completely irrelevant and I have said this many times, Grandmaster comes out of nowhere and reverts back to Adil, saying that "you cant decide on your own whats relevant and whats not": <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mammed_Amin_Rasulzade&amp;diff=115138630&amp;oldid=115122110" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mammed_Amin_Rasulzade&amp;diff=115138630&amp;oldid=115122110" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> None of what Adil inserted into the article is relevant about Rasulzade or his exile. I keep telling Adil that he should put his information in the relevant article (such as the ADR article) but he wont listen. If you read the full quotes from the sources that Adil is using to put that information in the article, you will see that known of them are referring to Rasulzade. Adil also clearly distorts the Swietochowski quote, which would not be the first time he has distort quotes and information. My conclusion is that either Grandmaster was reverting blindly, without even looking at what he was reverting, or he reverted due to a request by Adil, or maybe because he is stalking me. None of the information Adil is trying to add is about Rasulzade, let alone his exile.</p>
<p>Also note that while Grandmaster is telling me not to revert and wait until there is a consensus, yet he again shows his double standard by continuously reverting to his own version: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Khachkar_destruction&amp;diff=115094456&amp;oldid=115065731" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Khachkar_destruction&amp;diff=115094456&amp;oldid=115065731" rel="nofollow">[19]</a><a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">Azerbaijani</a> 21:19, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>user Azerbaijani, all my edits you complain about are a response to your insertions of taken out of context quotes (such as Atabaki's poorly cited and ripped out of context quote). Meanwhile, when you attempt to attack Prof. Swietochowski (a preemenent authority on Azerbaijani history in the West), at least try better, and not some weird and baseless "Adil also clearly (?!) distorts (?! huh?) the Swietochowski quote" (really? how?). It's you who try to portray Mammed Amin Rasulzade as some Pan-Turkist maniac, deny his own voice to be heard (MP3 file), remove Academician Iqrar Aliyev's quote (another top authority on Azerbaijani history, and himself of Iranic extraction), try to make Rasulzade appear appologetic for the name "Azerbaijan" and make him appear pro-Iranian (nice -- you are going from Pan-Turkist to Pan-Iranian) and argue about a host of other things. Meanwhile, both myself and GM have been active on Azerbaijan-related pages before you, and specifically, have been active on Rasulzade page before ArbCom, so all your other accusations are just as groundless. All my edits are well explained on the Talk page, and quite frankly, I've presented far more versatile and full information on Rasulzade, as opposed to your carefully selected, take out of context snippets. --<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">AdilBaguirov</a> 07:06, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>He doesnt even know what hes talking about, just his usual OR. For example, not only is he attacking me, but all of his information is wrong.

<dd><b>Response</b> It was not a revert, it was an edit. Not all edits are reversions.

The example of Adil you cited is also a reversion, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ziya_Bunyadov&amp;diff=115743921&amp;oldid=114459522" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ziya_Bunyadov&amp;diff=115743921&amp;oldid=114459522" rel="nofollow">[25]</a> Adil reverted to his own version, erasing 11 intermediate edits that had stood for 5 days. However in the case of <a href="../../../v/a/r/Varoujan_Garabedian_dff4.html" title="Varoujan Garabedian">Varoujan_Garabedian</a> there was no previous version lacking this information and the removal of information is often part of the normal editing process. As an editor I don't agree with Artaxiad's logic in removing the statement; if John Smith is a member of Greenpeace, and Greenpeace is an environmental organization, then it strains logic to say that the sentence "John Smith, who is a member of Greenpeace, an environmental organization, participated in a Global Warming demonstration" is invalid because there is no source that says <i>both thingsin the same source.</i> However the arbitration case is about behavior, and this disagreement certainly could escalate to a reversion situation involving penalties if you don't have a meaningful discussion on the talk page. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 02:12, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Response</b> A <i>limited</i> amount of advocacy is probably acceptable, as long as he makes his point and then stops. The article ban is for disruptive and aggressive editing and if he is nice and polite and calm on the RFC page then that's probably ok. If he harangues editors who do not agree with him he can be banned from the page (enforceable by block if he continues after notification). However other editors (hello, Crum?) who do not agree with his suggestions would be advised to politely decline and then stop talking and not rise to the bait or continue to engage him. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 01:16, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Because the number of Armenian editors is at least twice larger than Azerbaijani editors, and some of the former (as opposed to only one of the latter) use a great number of sock- and meat-puppets, not to mention IP anons (Mikara, HyeProfile, Zurbagan, Pulu-Pughi, Ararat Arev, etc), what you allege against Azerbaijani editors (e.g., "besmirching", etc) is not even physically possible, no need to make baseless allegations. --<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">adil</a> 00:45, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Response</b> In order to be subject to the revert limitation he would have had thave been listed as a participant in the case and informed on his talk page of both the case and the probation.

<p>User MarshallBagramyan has been named as a party long before the above complaint, by user Atabek, for example.

<dd>Desperate measures. My first edit there removed vandalism and I have written in the edit summary to say that. My 2nd edit was the removal of a DEAD image, big deal? Eupator also had an edit summary about his RV. Keep trying! - <a href="../../../f/e/d/User%7EFedayee_044a.html" title="User:Fedayee">Fedayee</a> 01:19, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Edit summary is not sufficient, the injunction is clear, and was further clarified by Dmcdevit, that everyone must write in the Talk page, especially when reverting. And especially when reverting blindly, like what Eupator did with "Sahib" and that weird comment in the bottom of the article. --<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">adil</a> 01:29, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

(That he reverted to a vandalized version is an irrelvant goof, he was reverting the "suppression of a source" per his summary.)
