I realize the IP range I listed is huge, but it was easier than listing the 5 or 6 different IPs that he/she/it has been using... maybe I'll just let it go, if the ISPs aren't willing to do much... it's a RIPE user, so I would have to deal with an overseas (for me) ISP anyway... eh... maybe I'll just continue squashing it's vandalism... at least it's giving me a good laugh... - <a href="../../../a/d/o/User%7EAdolphus79_aa38.html" title="User:Adolphus79">Adolphus79</a> 11:19, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Biased Deletions</span></h2>
<p>Here's a situation that I haven't seen addressed (maybe it's gotten lost in the 50 or 60 pages of vandal reports). User:Circeus is repeatedly deleting any and all links to Crocdilian Online. The only comment made was a single one to linkspam, which I don't see as being even relevant. I've sent the first warning to him thinking it was just a page or two, but I've since discovered it's worse than I thought. Which is the appropriate template? <a href="../../../c/f/l/User%7ECFLeon_0a91.html" title="User:CFLeon">CFLeon</a> 01:38, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This user is now following me and reverting all of my recent edits, to the point of even reverting my spelling and clean-ups over ALL Crocodilian pages now. (Does Wiki recognize 'Web-Stalking'?) Previously, the user showed no interest in these pages and his user page has no indication of such interest. He has refused to address this issue on any Talk pages, instead sending me rude responses. This User will allow NO mention of this link, which is the major source on the web, WHATSOEVER. I have tried to get him to answer what he has against this link, but the only thing he ever said was something about "linkspam", which is irrelevant. This is the first time I've had repeated problems with another user and I'd like some help with this. I am not one who smiles when someone spits on me; if someone is rude to me, I respond in turn. I'd like to return this to being civilized, but he refuss to respond. Could someone help out? <a href="../../../c/f/l/User%7ECFLeon_0a91.html" title="User:CFLeon">CFLeon</a> 03:28, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't really view this as vandalism, so this is probably not the appropriate venue. But a response anyways: I've looked over Crocodilian Online and it does look like an appropriate link (it's on an .edu server in Florida, contains no ads, and is well referenced). However, it is important that the articles of individual Crocodile species are linked to the relevant subpages on Crocodilian online. I think this is the point that <a href="../../../c/i/r/User%7ECirceus_e372.html" title="User:Circeus">Circeus</a> was trying to make. If you link as suggested above, I don't think there will be a problem.

<dd>Thanks for going to the work of providing these diffs. In my own judgment, I'm going to give this anon the benefit of the doubt and assume that he or she is trying to improve the article; even if all of the above changes were incorrect, I don't see any clear-cut, obvious signs of malicious intent here — just poor judgment and a lack of understanding of the articles he or she is trying to contribute to. We'll see if this garners any other comments from other admins. <b><a href="../../../t/i/j/User%7ETijuana_Brass_50f8.html" title="User:Tijuana Brass"><span style="color: #FF4500; font-family: Times New Roman; font-variant: small-caps;">Tijuana Brass</span></a><sup><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><span style="color: #228B22;">E@</span></a></sup></b> 19:38, 11 June 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">IP 220.235.253.231, IP 220.235.254.170 - "Sneaky Vandalism"</span></h2>
<p>I am new to this, the notes I read here (in green ) said to post reports to the other page but it did not have a '+' so I will attempt to post here. This user appears to be be using a dynamic IP address. I was unable to post a warning to their user page as I could not find one. Using multiple IP searches located this user in nth qld cache of ISP westnet, interesting to note that other vandalism within the same article (but using different IP's) also point to the same area. It appears as if one or two IP's are used by this person over a period of time before the IP's change (hence dynamic tag). I am assuming it is the one person or persons. This user has an interest in vandalising specific articles thus far. Seeing that this user came back so quickly to vandalise the article after I had reverted 6 vandalism entries they had done, I did not revert this last vandalism entry (a false external link) and instead have attempted to bring it to the attention of Admins re: vandalism. The latest vandalism still requires reverting - 'Sneaky Vandalism' - <a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBacmac_043c.html" title="User:Bacmac">Bacmac</a> 22:23, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't understand&#160;?, the current IP being used is posted above: 220.235.254.170 Maybe where i said using multiple IP searches has caused confusion , I actually used various IP "Searching Programs" to confirm the location. Should there appear to be a repeat of the use of multiple IP's as seem to show in the article history I will add them. <a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBacmac_043c.html" title="User:Bacmac">Bacmac</a> 01:18, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>ADDED: 220.235.253.231&#160;:- this is the IP I am talking mostly about above (it looks as if i mistakenly added the seconded IP I suspected of this user) A second 'sneaky vandalism' entry has been carried out. I will revert these two rubbish entries and see how long it takes this guy to vandalise again. Can anyone out there post a warning to this guy?, I couldn't find a user page for him.</p>

<p>Hey its me you talking about. I am very interested in History&#160;:o). And I´m no vandalizer. I´m just cleaning up on Wiki. "Inge" is the one who write unsoursed and wrong articles. Come with just one thing i have made wrong.</p>
<p>The time i´ve got blocked was because i deleted the tread "Swedish Empire" because it´s pathetic to write a article with that name on a Encyclopedia. Then all countries could be a Empire. I did´t know of that blocking thing tho.</p>

<p>The above users are harrassing me.

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>While I'm not an admin or anything fancy like that, there's a few things everyone should keep in mind and use as the first steps in trying to work this out:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Policies like <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">no personal attacks</a> and <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>. While I'm not picking on anyone in particular, comments like "or do i have to cite you for harassment" and ""these people have serious problems with their egos and feel free to do whatever they want" are in violation of these policies. Keep a cool head. One example for <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMaryLouise%40gmail.com_0ae5.html" title="User:MaryLouise@gmail.com">User:Marylou</a>: when <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli-oops_e331.html" title="User:Ali-oops">User:Ali-oops</a> called you "Robert", you should have <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assumed good faith</a> and let her know <i>politely</i> that your name was in fact Marylou. Threatening people with things like "cite you for harassment" usually doesn't help the matter. For <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemiurge_afbf.html" title="User:Demiurge">User:Demiurge</a>: repeatedly adding the sockpuppet template to Marylou's talk page doesn't really help your case either. One diff (especially the one you provided) isn't that credible evidence-wise. If you have <i>solid</i> evidence, take it to <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFCU_026f.html" title="WP:RFCU">WP:RFCU</a> but don't just threaten people about it.</li>
<li><a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">3RR</a>. Don't revert someone more than 3 times in 24 hours. Full stop. Unless it's clear cut vandalism (blanking a pageor similar) - a factual dispute about whether the person in question was a Unionist or not is <b>not</b> vandalism. Work it out on the talk page. One of you just has to stop adding/removing these facts to the article, and start giving evidence on the talk page as to why you think the person is what you say they are. Evidence needs to be readable by everyone, so "i found it in a history book" isn't good enough.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>In general, the problem here simply seems to be a simple factual dispute that spilled over. If you want to work this out, all I can advise as a first step is to <b>stop</b>. Just stop removing/adding content that is disputed. Then, work it out <b>calmly</b> on the article's talk page, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">citing evidence</a> for <b>all</b> your claims, hwoever small they may be.

<p>Is there some mechanism for getting the school to exercise some control? Also, why not block them? Kids could still see the pages -- they couldn't edit them without a user account. It seems reasonable to block this account.</p>

<p>Since my punctuation offends you, then that makes it okay that wiki would employ someone's photograph in a racist manner.</p>
<p>Much of what wiki is famous for, I have read on thousands of pages.</p>
<p>However, conversely, much of what it is infamous for, has thus far been proven tonight.</p>
<p>You, obviously, deal w/ any criticism w/ snap, caustic, attacks, w/o spending even a micromillisecond on the problem causing any dispute.</p>
<p>I do not know what community you write in; however, many of these webpages do state that the webservers are in Florida. I can see that even the best ideas, through Florida, become infested. There, I can, as well, be caustic; but, we've had centuries of Florida. You've read my comments once.</p>

<dd>Oh yes, I see the issue. Your edit was to Wikipedia:Long term abuse/The Doppleganger. This is not a talk page. This is a page on a long-term vandal.

To you, the issue is invisible.</p>
<p>The discussion-page, like about half of the discussion-pages, has been malfunctioning, @ least on my machine. They often say something like:</p>
<p>We don't have an article called "Long term abuse/The Doppleganger" Search Wikipedia for Long term abuse/The Doppleganger - it might be called something else. ...but you can write it!</p>
<p>That's exactly what your servers keep giving me; pleas repair it, before accusing me of anything.</p>
<p>Or, @ least move that photograph.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, it says "but you can write it!" for a reason. You <i>can</i> write it, right in that nice text box that the Wikipedia gives you that's under all of that text. -- <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsumed_Crustacean_06d3.html" title="User:Consumed Crustacean">Consumed Crustacean</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConsumed_Crustacean_e411.html" title="User talk:Consumed Crustacean">Talk</a> | 05:30, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If I, the ignoramus, could have figured-out how to do it, I would've.</p>
<p>If I wanted to commit the vandalism that your oppressive regime has accused me of, I would have moved the photograph in the first place. But, I tried to be polite, &amp; I pointed-out that it was posted in a racist manner.</p>
<p>Which you all have refused to correct.</p>

<dd>So, you don't see the text box under all that? I've even tried it without logging in, and after I click "Discussion" I do indeed see a textbox.

I don't understand why you think the picture is racist?

<p>On the other page, it describes them as vandals.</p>

<dd>It said "you can create it", and it meant it. As you can see, <b>I created that talk page, without even logging in, and as easily as I am typing this comment right now</b>. If I could do it, you can too. As for describing them as vandals: it isn't. The article uses their picture because it is a play on the word "Doppleganger", which is also the name of the vandal that the article is centered around. That's it. It's a play on words, not racism. Your "different types of racism" are completely nonsensical. -- <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsumed_Crustacean_06d3.html" title="User:Consumed Crustacean">Consumed Crustacean</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConsumed_Crustacean_e411.html" title="User talk:Consumed Crustacean">Talk</a> | 06:02, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Jus one of many rasons why they've earned a biography-page is that wiki has targeted them for attack. That is now historical-fact. The fact the insult is no longer there does not alter that. Further, one of you had posted a partial bio. on the picture-description-page.</p>
<p>So, let me get this now, uuuummmm; they're worthy of a bio in order to insult them, as well as to insult me, to label them vandals, as well as myself;....</p>
<p>But, now that that's done, they do not deserve a searchable biography page?? They don't deserve an apology??</p>
<p>Wiki is absolutely conscience-free.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The "recent warnings" thing just isn't working</span></h2>
<p>Sorry to bring up this arguement again, as I see it's been discussed a few times, but this has really been bothering me. Over the past few days the anonymous user 68.199.204.46 had been sporadically vandalizing articles. He had already been warned by test4 on the 22nd. He was added to this page three separate times, twice by me and a third time by <a href="../../../o/s/c/User%7EOscarthecat_3c87.html" title="User:Oscarthecat">Oscarthecat</a>, all three of which were denied. The first time, done on the 23rd, the administrator didn't even bother to give a reason for not blocking him. The second time, done today, the administrator denied it due to lack of a recent warning. The third time, the administrator mistook the vandalism for a content dispute, but that's beside the point. Eventually, <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMushroom_bc66.html" title="User:Mushroom">Mushroom</a> saw his edits and blocked him himself. My point is that while his vandalism started back before June 22nd, it took until today for someone to finally block him. Why? Because he hadn't been "warned recently". I'm assuming that's the reason why he wasn't blocked the first time as well. Maybe someone could help elaborate the reasoning behind that to me, but personally, I don't think that makes any sense. If the user is warned with "This is your <b>final warning</b>. The next time you vandalize a page you <i>will</i> be blocked from editing Wikipedia." and then he or she vandalizes again and they don't get blocked, what kind of lesson is that teaching them? "This is your <i>last warning</i>. Seriously. At least until a few hours or so from now... then you can vandalize again."

<dd>The Ceiling Cat Vandal is a vandal that goes around with what seems to be a spambot, adding the same content to every article it hits (so named because the first content they inserted was a picture of the Ceiling Cat). While on its own it's not that big a problem, what really makes it dangerous is the fact that it comes from AOL, so its IP changes often. That means we can't effectively block it (and can't block it for more than a few hours anyway to avoid <b>massive</b> collateral damage to legit editors). <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBornhj_aa00.html" title="User:Bornhj"><font color="#336699">--<b>james</b></font></a> <sub><font color="green">// bornhj</font> <a href="../../../b/o/r/User_talk%7EBornhj_2497.html" title="User talk:Bornhj">(talk)</a></sub> 04:43, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is there a particular need for this separate subpage? As has been pointed out occasionally, it probably isn't on as many watchlists as the main page, meaning it gets less attention.</p>
<p>The main reason I can see for it is that dealing with bot reports requires special care. It may actually be that the bot is more reliable than humans, since it never falsely reports NPOV issues and other disagreements as 'vandalism' - obviously that doesn't allow us to be complacent. As it's a bot and doesn't worry about how long it spends typing, why not have it post to the main page, but expand on the explanation a bit? Currently it just says "Has vandalised x times in 24 hours" - if we added "This report comes from a bot - please check every contribution and inform (whoever) if the bot is in error", we would still have that caveat. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 13:26, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just to address some of these concerns, when the vandalbot conflicts on an edit, it doesn't overwrite. Instead it could be made to make several retries.

<dd>Templating/transcluding the bot page onto the bottom of the main page would be an interesting solution. The bot page would need to be streamlined to mesh cleanly into the main page visually. And anyone who wants to see the bot page's edits on their WL can still bookmark the bot page. The main page gets enough traffic that this should give good visibility to the bot alerts, even if the people with only the main page on their WL don't get specific alerts for it. And this solution would require no updates to the bots themselves. - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasAndroid_b0eb.html" title="User:TexasAndroid">TexasAndroid</a> 18:32, 5 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I would still prefer merging to the transcluding idea.

<p>Unless there are reasons against merging which I'm currently unaware of, I'm in favour of merging. I presume that bot would add the reports to a separate section from that used by humans. I always check that it really is vandalism before blocking, and I imagine most admins do, so I don't really see a problem with allowing the bot to post reports on the same page as humans. (I check <i>their</i> reports before I block as well!) By the way, I think since the bot is not infallible (though he's pretty close), his message when reporting should read "<i>Seems to</i> have vandalized four times" etc. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 21:17, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I'd go with merge. Primarily on the basis of it being more clear from just one page if someone has been reported already by the bot. Also I guess admins only having to check one page. The listings being signed by TB2 will still show that they're bot edits, so there shouldn't be any confusion about that. -<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldom_560d.html" title="User:Goldom">Goldom</a> <a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGoldom_553a.html" title="User talk:Goldom">‽‽‽</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Goldom_034e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Goldom">⁂</a> 04:14, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I support the proposed merger, not particularly transclusion.

<li>I am very much in support of just having the bot write to AIV (merging). I can see no real problems with it other than the possibility that it may cause a torrent of edits to the main page, which is just in tune to the amount of vandalism going on. The bot is much faster than the RC patrol, and if it writes to AIV, then VandalProof users (and possibly users of other software) would simply get an "already reported" message rather than risk redundancy when reporting a user that's already been listed by the bot on the other page. This is assuming I understand correctly how both the bot and VP work.<br />
I think making a separate section for the bot on the page would become a pain for editors somehow, though, and what's the trouble with just letting it mimic a real patroller? -- <a href="../../../o/m/i/User%7EOmicronpersei8_71da.html" title="User:Omicronpersei8">Omicronpersei8</a> (<a href="../../../o/m/i/User_talk%7EOmicronpersei8_2291.html" title="User talk:Omicronpersei8">talk</a>) 18:55, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It's been a while since this merge has been proposed, and it looks like the consensus was to merge or otherwise have the TB2 page show up on AIAV. I'd merge the two myself, but knowing me, I'd probably mess it up. <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIanManka_997b.html" title="User:IanManka">Ian Manka</a> <small><a href="../../../i/a/n/User_talk%7EIanManka_481c.html" title="User talk:IanManka">Talk to me!</a></small> 08:16, 11 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I normally do merges as soon as it looks like I won't be reverted, but in this case there's a technical issue as the bots have to be reconfigured, so it seems we need Tawker to actually do it. I'll leave a message on his talk page. I think I should repeat that I hope that the pages are merged and not transcluded for the reasons above; mainly because I proposed this for the watchlist issue, which transcluding wouldn't affect, and might even harm as people would be <i>less</i> likely to watchlist a transcluded subpage. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 08:23, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I've been following this but I'm not totally sure if consensus is to merge or transclude, hence no action from me. As of this moment transclude is the fastest way to move the results (as there are something like 4 copies of Tawkerbot2 out there, and we would need to send an updated version to each one (I think I'll transclude for the moment) -- <a href="../../../t/a/w/User%7ETawker_141a.html" title="User:Tawker">Tawker</a> 13:22, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't know anything about what the technical difficulties would be, but if it's reasonably do-able, I'd prefer that it would be merged. Otherwise, when I go to AIV, and block a user, I then have to go specially to the Tawkerbot page to remove that user, saying he's blocked. It would be easier if I could just go back to the page I came from. And, it would be easier if there were just one page for reports. I was also wondering if the heading "Alerts" in AIV should be changed to something like "Alerts from human editors" (if we're going to have a special bot section), or does that sound a bit silly? <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 13:30, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it'll be useful.

<dl>
<dd>It's more than showing serif; it also involves rendering <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unicode.html" title="Unicode">Unicode</a> characters (outside the Latin character set) as escape sequences. In the example above, various characters in the <a href="../../../c/y/r/Cyrillic.html" title="Cyrillic">Cyrillic</a> code set which are duplicates of Latin letters (but unique Unicode entites) are used to create a username which looks exactly like <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">User:Jimbo Wales</a>, but is considered different by the WikiMedia software. By use of the "urlencode" macro, it gets turned into the escape sequences, making it easy to spot the impersonation.</dd>
<dd>BTW, {{<a href="../../../v/a/n/Template%7EVandal_ff98.html" title="Template:Vandal">vandal</a>}} is a redirect to {{<a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUserlinks_5339.html" title="Template:Userlinks">userlinks</a>}}.
