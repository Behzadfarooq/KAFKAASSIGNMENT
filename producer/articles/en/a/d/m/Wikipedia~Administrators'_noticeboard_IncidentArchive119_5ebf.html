<p>Blu Aardvark started off, as many of us do, as a good earnest newbie Wikipedian. He did a few questionable things and got a taste of some of the Wikipedia community's officiousness. He did not handle it well and flamed out in a puerile fashion. He then co-founded a criticism site, quite likely with good intentions, but just stood by when it got out of hand and other members launched some vicious attacks. He had a change of heart and tried to come back to Wikipedia, but the community was unforgiving and reacted with anger. This time he left with class and maturity, trapping us in our own officiousness in a nice coup de grace. It sounds as if he has matured and learned from the debacle; let us hope that, in time, the Wikipedia community will as well. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp_7670.html" title="User:Martinp">Martinp</a> 04:10, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Of course, his final actions were nothing more than an attempt to sow confusion by playing the "Ohh look at me, I'm making good edits but you're blocking me anyway!" card.That is to say, he wasn't editing because he truly cared about making the encyclopedia better, only to try to make us look bad.--<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><span style="color:#ff66ff;cursor:w-resize;"><b>Cyde↔Weys</b></span></a> 04:17, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not sure exactly what he believes, but <a href="../../../v/a/q/User%7EVaquero100_66a7.html" title="User:Vaquero100">Vaquero100</a> (<a href="../../../v/a/q/User_talk%7EVaquero100_5fc3.html" title="User talk:Vaquero100">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Vaquero100_e2d2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Vaquero100">contribs</a>) is moving articles about Catholicism despite the fact most, if not all, other editors who edit the subject disagree with him.</p>
<p>Vaquero100 has changed references to the Roman Catholic Church to drop the Roman part and generalize things when the article in question didn't include any other <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic_devotions.html" title="Catholic devotions">Catholic devotions</a>. Apparently, they want to remove mention of "Roman" Catholicism from Wikipedia. While the Roman Catholic Church is commonly referred to as just "Catholic Church", we need the Roman prefix to distinguish ot from other varieties of Catholicism. If both names are valid, things shouldn't get moved (just as with variety English spellings)</p>
<p>And just today, he has been making moves like redirecting <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consecrated_life.html" title="Consecrated life">Consecrated life</a> to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consecrated_life_%28Catholic_Church%29_d122.html" title="Consecrated life (Catholic Church)">Consecrated life (Catholic Church)</a> or <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic_spirituality.html" title="Catholic spirituality">Catholic spirituality</a> to <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spirituality_%28Catholic_Church%29_2f3c.html" title="Spirituality (Catholic Church)">Spirituality (Catholic Church)</a>. The last one is particularly annoying for a naming conventions nut like me (so I undid the move). While it indeed discusses several different Catholic denominations, titles should generally not contain modifiers in brackets wherever possible.</p>
<p>This user is basically annoying others to further their own POV. Can someone please talk to him?</p>

<dd>Oh, heavens!If he thinks that the Anglicans are out to get him, he should talk to members of the Greek Orthodox Church, which might well have a thing or two to say about the RCC being "the Catholic Church."(The "Roman" distinguishes from Greek, Syrian, Russian, inter al.)And that's not even to get into the question of "the" Catholic Church, which is tantamount to saying, "the one true church."Very nasty, there.<a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:46, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's (Roman Catholic) POV-pushing. The <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Orthodox_Church_72f2.html" title="Eastern Orthodox Church">Eastern Orthodox Church</a> calls itself the Orthodox Catholic Church, and believes that the 'Church of Rome' (i.e. the Roman Catholic Church) is not the legitimate Catholic Church.

<dd>This is not to defend Vaquero's actions, but POV pushing can go both ways. Isn't it POV not to allow a self-naming, on the basis of disputing a religious claim implicit in that name? Note that RCs would argue that the Orthodox are not in fact orthodox. The claim is disputed, not the self-identifying name Orthodox. The reasonable approach would seem to me to allow both, with or without Roman. <a href="../../../g/i/m/User%7EGimmetrow_3628.html" title="User:Gimmetrow">Gimmetrow</a> 16:40, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is a very old argument.Every time it's been discussed, as far as I recall, there has been strong consensus for the status quo. The qualifier <i>Roman</i> Catholic is not, to my knowledge, offensive to Romans, and the assertion that only Romans are "The Catholic Church" is offensive to many outside the Roman tradition (I believe in one holy catholic and apostolic church to, y'know).But this is probably not the place for this argument.

<dd>Appearing to dismiss my statement as "very old" is not helpful. I actually want what appears to be the <i>status quo</i> to remain - there are articles titled both ways.

<dd>How can one recall a strong consensus where there has been none?A majority vote does not constitute a consensus!And be advised, there are Catholics who do take offense at being qualified as Romans.You apparently also don't understand that many Catholics take offence at being called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Geogre#Nasty" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Geogre#Nasty" rel="nofollow">"Papists."</a>Recognize also that there are Anglicans who are <b>not</b> offended by Vaquero's use of "Catholic Church" (as evidenced by several citations of such use on Anglican documents).<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Vaquero100/Catholic_Church_naming_arguments" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Vaquero100/Catholic_Church_naming_arguments" rel="nofollow">Plenty of evidence</a> has been given to show Vaquero's use of "Catholic Church" to be in compliance with published Wikipedia naming conventions.The opposition thus far has always been POV or unsupported.It is not ambiguous just because you said so.A less commonly-used alternative name should not be used just because you prefer it.If you make a claim in opposition to this, back it up with facts that are relevant to the naming conventions!If you do this, perhaps a true consensus can be achieved. <a href="../../../s/y/n/User%7ESynKobiety_1792.html" title="User:SynKobiety">SynKobiety</a> 23:43, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I invite you to look at the archives.Ths is a very old argument.The question is not about self-description, it's about whether one should allow one particular sect (albeit the largest) to arrogate ownership of a description used by multiple other sects, on the basis of membership numbers.Take it to mediation by all means, but warring over redirects is not going to fix the problem.<a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 11:19, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi there!I've noticed that you extended Tobias's block and labeled <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHauke_e201.html" title="User:Hauke">User:Hauke</a> as a sockpuppet.I've been in contact with Tobias, and according to him Hauke is a friend of his.Please file a checkuser request if you have doubts; the results will be negative.</p>
<p>I would also like to reconsider your approach towards Tobias.I will agree any day that he may be stubborn, difficult to deal with, and lose his tempers easily, but he is not here to compromise Wikipedia, nor is he sticking to some malicious plan of sorts (please check his contributions history).</p>
<p>I spoke to Tobias last Friday, and promised to investigate what happened myself.From what I found the whole thing looks like a relatively simple misunderstanding, that gradually elevated to the exaggregated mess it is now.Let me outline the things the way I see them.Tobias definitely deserved a portion of his block, but not all of it.</p>
<p>I am crossposting the following summary to the talk pages of all involved parties.</p>
<ol>
<li>The stub about Eisenkappl, which Tobias created, was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=delete&amp;user=&amp;page=Eisenkappl" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=delete&amp;user=&amp;page=Eisenkappl" rel="nofollow">deleted</a> by <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimfbleak_6698.html" title="User:Jimfbleak">User:Jimfbleak</a> on June 30.Jim <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tobias_Conradi&amp;diff=61500842&amp;oldid=61435098" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tobias_Conradi&amp;diff=61500842&amp;oldid=61435098" rel="nofollow">later</a> explained that the deletion was due to the stub not providing enough information for a reader to understand what the stub's subject was.This is a valid reason, however, it was not explained in the deletion summary.</li>
<li>Tobias re-created this article and moved it to <a href="../../../b/a/d/Bad_Eisenkappel_a073.html" title="Bad Eisenkappel">Bad Eisenkappel</a>, making an inflammatory edit summary ("fight against admin power abuse...") in the process.While making a summary like this is not constructive, it should be understood that it was made in response to Jim's deletion, for which no reason was given.</li>
<li>Tobias later <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Jimfbleak&amp;diff=61421158&amp;oldid=56358257" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Jimfbleak&amp;diff=61421158&amp;oldid=56358257" rel="nofollow">added</a> a "this user is a deletionist" note to Jim's user page.Again, this was not very constructive; Tobias should have requested a reason for the stub's deletion instead of losing temper.</li>
<li>The new stub on Bad Eisenkappel was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=delete&amp;user=&amp;page=Bad+Eisenkappel" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=delete&amp;user=&amp;page=Bad+Eisenkappel" rel="nofollow">deleted</a> by <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">User:InShaneee</a>.No reason for deletion was given in the edit summary.</li>
<li>InShaneee then <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=InShaneee&amp;page=User%3ATobias+Conradi" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=InShaneee&amp;page=User%3ATobias+Conradi" rel="nofollow">blocked</a> Tobias for 48&#160;hours for "vandalism, personal attacks".When I asked for details, InShanee <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ezhiki&amp;diff=61435032&amp;oldid=61432298" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ezhiki&amp;diff=61435032&amp;oldid=61432298" rel="nofollow">explained</a> that Tobias was blocked for "disruption" and "for placing "this user is a deletionist" on other people's userpages".While the latter is true, the former referred to moving Eisenkappel to <i>Bad</i> Eisenkappel.While I see how such a move can be interpreted as intentional vandalism, the "Bad" portion is actually a part of this village's name, as a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=43P&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22bad+eisenkappel%22&amp;btnG" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=43P&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22bad+eisenkappel%22&amp;btnG" rel="nofollow">google search</a> would attest.</li>
<li>At this point of time, the situation from Tobias's perspective looked very much like admin abuse—stubs he created were deleted by two different admins, both of whom gave no reasons for deletion.Tobias himself was blocked for "vandalism/disruption", the meaning of which was also not explained.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tobias_Conradi&amp;diff=61424038&amp;oldid=61423781" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tobias_Conradi&amp;diff=61424038&amp;oldid=61423781" rel="nofollow">This edit</a> of Tobias's is a good illustration of the way he felt.</li>
<li>A moment later, Tobias was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tobias_Conradi&amp;diff=61424178&amp;oldid=61424038" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tobias_Conradi&amp;diff=61424178&amp;oldid=61424038" rel="nofollow">further accused</a> of violating <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>—no details provided.</li>
<li>Understandably, Tobias's aggravation <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tobias_Conradi&amp;diff=61424517&amp;oldid=61424310" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tobias_Conradi&amp;diff=61424517&amp;oldid=61424310" rel="nofollow">grew</a>.</li>
<li>InShanee <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tobias_Conradi&amp;diff=61424847&amp;oldid=61424794" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tobias_Conradi&amp;diff=61424847&amp;oldid=61424794" rel="nofollow">protected</a> Tobias's talk page in order to prevent him from removing the warnings and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tobias_Conradi&amp;diff=61425271&amp;oldid=61424915" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tobias_Conradi&amp;diff=61425271&amp;oldid=61424915" rel="nofollow">extended</a> his block for incivility.</li>
<li>In response to his talk page being protected and his account being blocked, Tobias launched an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Tobias_Conradi&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Tobias_Conradi&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">anon IP campaign</a>.While this was a direct violation of sockpuppeting guidelines, the user could not contend his block from his account as his talk page was blocked from editing at that point.</li>
<li>In response, Tobias's user page was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Tobias_Conradi&amp;diff=61434324&amp;oldid=61433052" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Tobias_Conradi&amp;diff=61434324&amp;oldid=61433052" rel="nofollow">protected from editing</a> by <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">User:Pschemp</a> and his block was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tobias_Conradi&amp;diff=61435098&amp;oldid=61431474" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tobias_Conradi&amp;diff=61435098&amp;oldid=61431474" rel="nofollow">extended</a> for sockpuppetry.</li>
<li>On July 2, <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHauke_e201.html" title="User:Hauke">User:Hauke</a> account was created.Soon after it was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Hauke&amp;diff=61761362&amp;oldid=61728774" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Hauke&amp;diff=61761362&amp;oldid=61728774" rel="nofollow">labeled</a> by Pschemp as a sockpuppet of Tobias and blocked.According to Tobias's email communication to me, Hauke is a friend of his, <i>not</i> a sockpuppet account.I asked Tobias to stop sockpuppetry on June 30, no matter how unfair the situation seemed to him, to which he agreed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Summarizing the situation: while I in no way want to defend Tobias's less than stellar behavior in response to the accusations against him, I can see the situation from his perspective.Hopefully, this summary will allow you to do the same.I cannot, however, justify the behavior of the administrators involved in this case.Instead of trying to study the situation and finding out the cause of Tobias's aggravated response to the actions against his, the administrators pretty much reacted on emotion, thus complicating and elevating the situation, instead of trying to relieve it.Denying the user his right to contend his block by blocking both his talk and user pages is especially worrisome.</p>
<p>My opinion is that both sides largely ignored <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, refusing to listen each other.I thus urge the involved parties to shorten Tobias's block from unbelievable six weeks to a total of seven days (three of which he has already served) for not assuming good faith, for refusing to inquire about sanctions against him at the earlier stage of the conflict and resorting to inflammatory edit summaries, and for failure to challenge his block through legitimate means (such as placing an unblock template request at his user/talk page when it was still possible).I ask Tobias to apologize to the people to whom his was incivil.I also urge <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">User:InShaneee</a>, <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">User:Pschemp</a>, and <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimfbleak_6698.html" title="User:Jimfbleak">User:Jimfbleak</a> to apologize to Tobias for not providing the reason for their actions and to impose a self-block for refusing to assume good faith, for acting on emotions instead of reason, and for denying the user right to be heard through his talk page.</p>
<p>Being a proud Wikipedia administrator myself, I would not ask anyone to do something that I personally would not be ready to do in a similar situation.</p>

<dd>The reason for my extensions was sockpuppetry which he clearly repeatedly engaged in and he was clearly told that this was the reason<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Tobias_Conradi#Name_calling" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Tobias_Conradi#Name_calling" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Considering that he used multiple IP's for the the socks, it is quite easy for him to set up a new account with a different IP that would of course not show the same as his on checkuser. The new account also edited tango articles, (Tobias's listed interest) and used the same grammar as Tobias right before requesting that the protection on his talk page be lifted<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Hauke" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Hauke" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. At the very least that qualifies as a meatpuppet. I'm sorry, but Tobias used up his allotment of good faith quite a while ago with his personal attacks and repeat sock use, and I will not unblock him, nor will I apologize. I see you are his friend, but that doesn't mean his actions were appropriate. You forgot to mention his many other infractions up there, such as removing warnings from his talk page, calling decent editors vandals, and his history of incivil remarks (and prior blocks for this incivility!) and personal attacks in edit summaries.Some examples just from edit summaries:</dd>

Sorry, but the facts are, when you use sockpuppets to evade your block (which was originally short) your block gets extended. He had plenty of opportunity to use {{tl:unblock}} and has done so in the past, and has not put that up since you unprotected his page, so your accusations of him being not allowed to contest the block are baseless. Email is always possible too, and he seemed to be able to use that just fine to contact you. Also, he admitted to using the socks, so I see no reason to overturn the block. Just because you admit to your bad deeds doesn't mean that it nullifys your action or justifies them. A wiser user would have sat out the orginal short block. Please speak to InShanee about the original block, as I had nothing to do with that. I only dealt with the sockpuppets. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 16:24, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the comments so far.I would like to reiterate that I am not trying to present the matter at hand in a way that would make Tobias look like an angel.My main point is that the whole mess started as a misunderstanding.When you create an article and it gets deleted without explanation, and so does one that you re-create, <i>and</i> then you get blocked for something you did not do (part of Tobias's block was for "disruption and vandalism" because the title of the new article he re-created happened to start with the word "Bad", which was interpreted as vandalism), you have all the reasons to be angry and confused.It is true, Tobias's choice of the way he decided to convey his anger was largely unacceptable, but that does not change the fact that some of the very early actions against him had been unfair.All I am asking is understanding and apologies for what became a spark for further hostilities by both sides.If the community decides to apply the rules without looking further into the human factor, I will, of course, submit and withdraw, but it will indeed be regrettable.With all Tobias's downsides, he is a valuable editor.Knocking him in the head and kicking him in the groin every time he makes a mistake, harder and harder every time based on his "previous conflicts" history, will not make him a better Wikipedian.Understanding his concerns and helping him out in conflict situations will, although one would be naïve to believe it will happen overnight.</dd>

<dd>He is welcome to make an apology on his talk page, and certainly is able to do so as his vast amounts of editing it today have shown. I would consider reducing the block should he show geniune contrition, but I think completely removing it is incorrect. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 18:48, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Blocked users can still post to their own talk pages unless there has been egregious vandalism or uncivil behaviour or other abuses, as by practice, we do not protect talk pages of blocked users unless there is a need. So he can comment there, if after reviewing this thread, he wishes to do so. My suggestion is that he consider his actions so far and think about the consequences. If some contrition were shown, some understanding that even if things go badly you still can't be incivil, some agreement to abide by the norms here, I'd be inclined to look more favourably on a request to reduce the length of the block request, should one be made. As yet I've seen little sign of that understanding.Hope that helps. <b><font color="green">+</font><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Lar_3e70.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Lar">+</a></b><a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 18:42, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I happen to be able to read German, and yes, the real meaning is inflammatory. However, I checked the google finds on these German Wikipedia discussions (I had to check the google caches of course). ALL of them are accusations against Tobias on the basis of his behaviour on ENGLISH Wikipedia. They mention his 2004 block (on English Wiki) and his edit war with <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexPU_ea69.html" title="User:AlexPU">AlexPU</a> (who in 2005 accused him of being a Russian propagandist). I do not know how grave the accusation ofbeing a Russian propagandist is for a German, but mentioning these "discussions of edit warring" here is like sentencing someone twice for the same offense, whatever that offence was. For those who know German, this is where the discussion about edit warring started: <a href="http://66.249.93.104/search?q=cache:qUwgvvthGdUJ:de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benutzer_Diskussion:Tobias_Conradi+site:de.wikipedia.org+%22Tobias+Conradi%22&amp;hl=nl&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=3" class="external autonumber" title="http://66.249.93.104/search?q=cache:qUwgvvthGdUJ:de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benutzer_Diskussion:Tobias_Conradi+site:de.wikipedia.org+%22Tobias+Conradi%22&amp;hl=nl&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=3" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> (see end of the page) --<a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Gerwazy_8ca1.html" title="User:Pan Gerwazy">Pan Gerwazy</a> 15:52, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Seriously, you need to stop calling people stalkers. There is no stalking here and to say so shows either bad faith or a lack of understanding of what admins do to carry out what they are asked to do. You've demonstrated a history that suggests that it makes sense for admins to watch your contributions and see what you're up to. That's not stalking, that's admins doing what the community asks. You are hereby warned to stop using that term, or other pejorative terms, when referring to admins carrying out their duties, or I will consider you in further violation of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> and will extend your block further (after presenting it for review from my peers).

<dd>If he can convince us that he is he (email, IP address, etc.) then his account password should be reset to allow him to regain control.If there is no way for an administrator to do it then a developer (I suppose) would have to do it and I would recommend adding a feature for it. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small><a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../j/u/l/July_6.html" title="July 6">07-06</a> 07:51Z</small></i></span></dd>

<p>Ste4k has been engaged in some very hostile and disruptive editing behavior on the articles <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Buell_Anderson_2c75.html" title="Charles Buell Anderson">Charles Buell Anderson</a> (and likely others, such as <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endeavor_Academy_b302.html" title="Endeavor Academy">Endeavor Academy</a> and <a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Course_in_Miracles_e1cf.html" title="A Course in Miracles">A Course in Miracles</a>).For instance, he/she has removed multiple times from the section <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Buell_Anderson_2c75.html#See_also" title="Charles Buell Anderson">Charles Buell Anderson#See also</a> a link to <a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Course_in_Miracles_e1cf.html" title="A Course in Miracles">A Course in Miracles</a>.As a look at <a href="http://www.endeavoracademy.com" class="external free" title="http://www.endeavoracademy.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.endeavoracademy.com</a> shows, this is the name of the primary text used by Anderson's organization, Endeavor Academy.Yet Ste4k has repeatedly removed that link, with bizarre edit summaries such as "See also - removing incorrect POV"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Charles_Buell_Anderson&amp;diff=62069941&amp;oldid=62069552" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Charles_Buell_Anderson&amp;diff=62069941&amp;oldid=62069552" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> and "See also - Removing POV again.

<p>When I restored the link (because its relevance <i>is</i> rather blatantly obvious) Ste4k left <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Antaeus_Feldspar&amp;diff=62151054&amp;oldid=62121755" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Antaeus_Feldspar&amp;diff=62151054&amp;oldid=62121755" rel="nofollow">a message</a> on my user page alleging that I had added "unsourced information" that had not been "published by reputable sources" and carefully avoiding the fact that there was no "information" whose truth or falsity could be supported or debunked by "reputable sources", but rather a link in the "See also" section.Ste4k also added <i>twenty</i> articles to the "See also" section, including <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_weapon.html" title="Nuclear weapon">Nuclear weapon</a>, <a href="../../../d/i/s/District_court.html" title="District court">District court</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heaven.html" title="Heaven">Heaven</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hell.html" title="Hell">Hell</a>, asking that <b>I</b> explain how each one was <b>irrelevant</b> to the article (also accusing me of vandalism via a template inserted in his/her edit).<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Antaeus_Feldspar&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=62219977" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Antaeus_Feldspar&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=62219977" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>When challenged to explain why those twenty links were relevant, Ste4k gave such rationales as:</p>

<dd>Indeed, Ste4k is apparently concurrently involved in multiple controversies.I have found written Ste4k a couple times about his AFDs.He likes to quote policies at well-established users (and administrators) who have much more experience than himself.In his defense, I think he is usually acting in good faith - just not communicating in a way compatible with Wikipedia.I would call him a "verifiability warrior"; he wishes to delete anything without (what he considers) reliable sources.(One disagreement I have with him is due to his wanting to delete entire articles if he didn't see citations in the article.) <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small><a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../j/u/l/July_6.html" title="July 6">07-06</a> 07:43Z</small></i></span></dd>

<li>Thanks for inviting me to the chat. Per the original matter under discussion, there are at least two, known to be three, and possibly more different types of material, books, courses, educational systems, etc. that are referred to as "A Course in Miracles". It doesn't help anyone to assume bad faith on my part simply because of a lack of research on anothers' part. Nor does it make much sense to simply add material that is nonsense, avoid discussing it rationally in the talk pages, and then run hither to the incident board to make false accusations. Thanks. Ste4k 01:33, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Per the second matter regarding the 48 Hourse material, as I mentioned earlier, if anyone would like to write an article using that source as reference, then they should include into the article material from the reference. Listing it as a reference to content without any context is misleading. The page in question is a biography and the article in question is seven years old and contains prophetic statements that have turned out to be untrue. Per the biography in question nominated for AfD, it is plain that there isn't even a reference to this man's date of birth, family status, hometown, importance to the community, etc., etc., According to the one reference that has information speaking about the man, it is a primary source, and it shows that the man was in the Marine Corp as Private First Class. That in itself is simply not notable enough for a biography. He hasn't earned any medals, and the story about Nagasaki takes up 90% of the article since there isn't anything else about this man that is known. Ste4k 01:42, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yes, you prepared well for the mediation, and I hope those preparations were useful in updating the articles.

<li>I assure you that I am not Vaquero, nor do I know him.I realize that I have only edited relative to the Catholic Church naming issue - you have to start somewhere.I was moved to contribute when I saw the bias in Wikipedia related to this issue and when I researched relevant Wikipedia policy and guidelines.I welcome you to discuss the most commonly used name for the Church in question and the most common understanding of "Catholic Church."I believe that it has been demonstrated that most readers expect that "Catholic Church" refers to the Church lead by the Pope and that the Church lead by the Pope is called the "Catholic Church."If you doubt this, please read what was written at <a href="../../../r/o/m/Talk%7ERoman_Catholic_Church_Name_5ee0.html" title="Talk:Roman Catholic Church/Name">Talk:Roman Catholic Church/Name</a> and what Vaquero has compiled at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Vaquero100/Catholic_Church_naming_arguments" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Vaquero100/Catholic_Church_naming_arguments" rel="nofollow">CC vs RCC</a>.I don't believe that you really intend for Wikipedia to be just an on-line re-compilation of printed reference works with its content determined by the editors of those works. <a href="../../../s/y/n/User%7ESynKobiety_1792.html" title="User:SynKobiety">SynKobiety</a> 02:35, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, <b>I</b> do, but I'm weird.(Actually, I think our content can be superior, is already more vast, but I think we serve readers conditioned by printed references and so, until our readers expect differently, we should name according to greatest use, and this is separate from the theological, historical, and political arguments, which, for me, also come down to using the longer name.)<a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:05, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>George, I suspect that you are afraid to look intellictually sound arguments.You keep reasserting your own opinion without making reference to actual WP naming convensions or policies.This seems to me to be unbecoming of an administrator.If you are unwilling to engage the arguments based on WP standards, I would hope that you would simply refrain from expressing any opinion at all, because your present approach is fundamentally illinformed, and intellectually and morally dishonest. <a href="../../../v/a/q/User%7EVaquero100_66a7.html" title="User:Vaquero100">Vaquero100</a> 03:29, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>If this <a href="../../../g/e/o/User_talk%7EGeogre_8a92.html#Nasty" title="User talk:Geogre">User talk:Geogre#Nasty</a> discussion represents the quality of thought of WP administrators, WP is in trouble. The refusal of WP editors and administrators to actually engage a dispute based on WP conventions and policy is evidence of an ingrained bias in the WP community.A more thorough supervision of administrators, their editing biases and the degree to which they base their editing on WP conventions and policies appears to be severely lacking on Wikipedia.<a href="../../../v/a/q/User%7EVaquero100_66a7.html" title="User:Vaquero100">Vaquero100</a> 03:47, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh, darn.I'm sorry that you're disappointed.Please do devote some time and energy in getting all other reference works to change to match your own preference, and then you will have a cast iron reason for us to change.However, the lack of other administrators rushing in here <i>might</i> in fact be evidence that Wikipedia is run by a purblind cabal that fears intellectualism.It could also be evidence that you are asking for everything to match your private view and no one else agrees or sees any profit in trying to prove the obvious.<a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:28, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Having reviewed said discussion, I will agree that it is not Wikipedia at its best. There has been a lot of sarcasm &amp; emotion on both sides. However, I can't help thinking that no matter what Geogre wrote, both Vaquero &amp; SynKobiety would reject it &amp; reiterate their entrenched opinions. It's obvious that there is an impass here, &amp; until someone can find a way to break thru to some kind of consensus the best thing for all parties to do is step away from this conflict &amp; not do anything to further enflame either side -- including renaming the articles in question. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 19:52, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> In 12 years of elementary and secondary education from priests and nuns, I never once heard anyone object to the term "Roman Catholic", or express the belief that it is in any way a derogatory term. I've asked a few others, and similarly can't find anyone who's ever even heard any objection to the term. I have to believe that those who object to it are a tiny minority. The simple fact is that there are other churches that also use "Catholic" in their name, including long independent bodies like the Assyrians, as well as traditionalist breakaway sects formed after both Vatican I and II. There are some who would argue that only one church has the right to use the word, but that is a POV which I believe has no place in an objective encyclopedia. Just my 2¢. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 20:08, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I didn't know this was continuing here.All I can say is that I have most emphatically <i>not</i> been sarcastic.I am not interested in discussing the righteousness of the name change, either way.I don't think that we're in a position to follow dictionaries in descriptive definition, either.I was sincere in referring continually to the one argument that I think is the stopper: we have to be useful to our readers, and our readers need for us to use the most precise terminology.Therefore, as all other reference works use "Roman," we should, because that is where our articles can best be found.I do, indeed, have suspicions about why these two editors are motivated to have a name change, and I am quite, quite certain that such a change would offend readers.Therefore, I see no advantage to a change and a huge disadvantage, but I am not going to engage in discussing the personalities involved.My attempts to side-step their emotions were not sarcasm; they were, I hope, a refusal to engage.There is no way we're going to get anywhere at all if we start talking about personalities, ignorance, etc.It just won't move us forward, so, if I have someone say something nasty, you must expect a "I wish to subscribe to your newsletter" sort of response (a non-reply, in other words).I'm sorry that it has been perceived as an attempt to antagonize, as I am really just trying to avoid antagonism.<a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 18:08, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It wasn't intended that way.It was perhaps dismissive, but that's what I've been saying: I will dismiss attempts at getting personal.I may start using H.L. Mencken's form letter response: "Dear Sir/Madam, you may be right."I.e. it's just not going to do any good to have people question my intelligence or motives and have me defend them, nor for me to attack your intelligence or motives and have you defend them.Those are keys to fights, not discussion.My comment was saying, "Think of you what I will.I wish you weren't disappointed, but there it is," with a little barb tossed in as payment for trying to take the discussion to the personal level.<a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:45, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Despite your best interests (which I fully understand), it <i>did</i> come across as sarcastic.

<p>Hello? Hello?Is there anybody out there at all who is willing to engage a conversation based even remotely related to the WP policy and naming conventions?I am not asking for WP administrators to play the relativist or some Solomonic chop the baby in two.

<dd>We <i>are</i> using our intellects. (BTW, claiming that people involved in your discussion are admins who are playing politicians &amp; do not "used [sic] their intellect" could be understood by some people as <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECivility_3fb1.html" title="WP:Civility">incivil language</a>.) We are maintaining the status quo until you, the people who agree with you, &amp; the people who disagree with you all reach a consensus -- or at least agree what to disagree about.

<dd>Why the rush? Many times being bold is more efficient... obviously there was contention over the redirection and Wikipedia is proceeding normally regarding such contention.

<p>I would like to report a problem spanning Wikipedia and Wikiquote.User:Crestville is causing sever vandalism on Wikiquote, and ignoring talk page warnings. So, I tried to contact him here.He is very arrogant in his responses and tried to blame it on an imposter.However, there is no imposter.I need him blocked here, and I am working on blocking him on Wikiquote. You can contact me on Wikiquote under the same username I am using here.Good day.<a href="../../../w/a/z/User%7EWazzawazzawaz_20a6.html" title="User:Wazzawazzawaz">Wazzawazzawaz</a> 23:58, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I wouldn't pay this any mind. I suspect Waz is a sockpuppet himself - that's probalby why he has pasted here, following the link on his own userpage, rather than go to the proper page which would be the vandal page. Has created an account - User:CrestvilIe -with a name similar to mine (in lowercase it is indistinguishable but in upper case you can see I am CRESTVILLE while he is CRESTVILIE). He has then proceeded to vandelise pages on wikiquote.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Despite the obvious silly trick I then proceeded to recieve messages from a new user called User:Wazzawazzawaz - who had not even taken the time to create a convincing userpage - accusing me of the vandelism, despite the fact that if they had followed the link on the history page it would have taken them to the imposters page. This continued with my imposter vandelising something, then a few minites later wazzer would reappear and chastise me for it. It seems clear to me that wazzawazzawaz or whatever is a sockpuppet for my impersonater and this is just some silly joke. I must say, however, it is flattering to have both an imposter and a stalker. I must be a mini-wiki celeb.--<a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECrestville_26d9.html" title="User:Crestville">Crestville</a> 00:11, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Contrary to Crestville's explanation I feel this should still be neutrally investigated.

<dd>As an interested party: actually the last block removal was on my request. The block was for 1 week, and as you see, she did what she did after the block was supposed to have expired. The autoblock system kept extending the block on me because of some error (something to do with autoblock choking on caps or spaces or underscores in the ID), and though I my block was supposed to have expired on July 5th, autoblock was pushing it forward into the 7th. She wasn't reversing anything, just undoing a system problem because she happened to be on the IRC channel when I made the request. Several other admins tried to fix it before her and couldn't.The block prior to that has an ANI entry regarding it, and the vast majority of observers in that situation agreed the block was unreasonable given the offense (the single use of the word 'bigot).</dd>
<dd><b>On the rest of this nonsense</b> (all of this is irrelevant to this ANI entry), on every single instance where Bishonen either reversed a block or questioned the validity on it, several if not a majority of others observing the ANI entry on the blocks in question noted the same things she did: that the blocks were unreasonably harsh considering the alleged violations they're founded on, or that the violations they were grounded in were not actual WP: violations at all. Bishonen was simply doing her job, and an objective view of her decisions would suggest she made the right choices. It should be noted that Timothy Usher has a long standing conflict with me, and that he has made it a point to go from talk page to talk page where I had participated and make remarks against me.Another behavior characterized these actions as 'stalking'. Indeed, Timothy Usher had apparently gone so far as to 'google' my old ID, begging the question of what he intended to do with any information he'd recieve.Clearly, he's made his grudge against me a personal matter separate from any 'content dispute'. Amongst the blocks Bishonen commented on, criticized, reduced or reversed, are those that were put in place on Timothy's request. It is apparent he has taken these personally as well, and is now stalking Bishonen too. It is clear he is now using the same offensive methods against Bishonen. Perhaps this deserves an ANI entry of its own. <a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHis_excellency_ec70.html" title="User:His excellency">His Excellency...</a> 21:19, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have no opinion about Bishonen, or any basis for forming one, outside of her work on behalf of His excellency.In aiding him, she is knowingly, and by now it would seem quite wilfully, subjecting other editors to his relentless personal attacks and copious streams of racist, sectarian, anti-Semitic and homophobic invective.Her reasons for doing so have never been clearly and overtly expressed, and by this time I've given up any expectation that I'll ever hear them.I've asked her not to keep bringing him back, but she's refused.I can think of nothing else to discuss, and have nothing much to express other than the strong desire not to partipate in any forum to which HE is also invited.Timothy Usher 01:00, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That kind of misstatement has to come from either malice or incomprehension.There has been no work by anybody "on behalf of HE," so cut that nonsense out right now.If Bishonen hadn't shortened the block, I would have.If I wouldn't have, someone else would have.Had that person not, someone else would have.Give it up.The reason the blocks have been shortened is that they were <b>out of process.</b>That's it.No statements for or against the user, only a discussion by admins with admins on whether the block for "personal attacks" was appropriate.One person seems to think it was.Several don't.The Personal Attack "policy" merely says that it is our policy not to launch personal attacks.There are no sanctions specified.Further, the speech you consider yourself so maligned by appears to several other readers to be inflammatory but not insulting, and the rest of us see your own words as being pretty inflammatory, too.You're not getting your way.That's too bad, but it has nothing to do with anyone working for or on behalf of your bete noir (or is that Bishonen now?).<a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:26, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I reject the implication that there is some sort of moral equivalence between Timothy Useher's conduct and His excelleny's. As far as the propriety of the many blocks, "One person seems to think it was. Several don't" is also a misstatement; I'm sure it is no more from malice or incomprehension than Timothy Usher's. If you find his conduct so worthy of condemnation, follow the process you recommend: start an RfC. It's astonishing to me that some are eager to bend over backward to give His excellency every possible benefit of process, but are quick to condemn Timothy Usher for, apparently, having the temerity to protest sustained and vicious attacks. Every time Amibidhrohi/His excellency has been unblocked, or his block has expired, the attacks have resumed, and have gotten worse. After this has happened two or three times, it's hard for me, and maybe harder for Timothy Usher, to see how a reasonable person expects a different result the next time. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 03:49, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Read what I responded to, Tom.Timothy's behavior <i>is</i> certainly crossing the line between sense and disruption, but I, unlike some people, <i>don't</i> believe in blocking and blocking and blocking some more because of "insults."The equivalency is on the offense: HE provokes Usher, and Usher provokes HE.That's the only thing that unilateral blocking is concerned with.I responded, though, to Usher's continuing accusations that anyone insisting on process is working "on behalf of HE."He has gotten obsessed with Bishonen as HE's friend.He is continuing to accuse everyone who doesn't do as he wishes of being on HE's "side."That's nonsense, and now you're effectively repeating the same gesture by saying that we must all be in favor of HE because we're in favor of following the rules.The choice is not Usher and HE.The choice is behaving like responsible administrators who know that there are rules and apply them fairly and evenly and taking sides.<a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:01, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

I would think that the consensus was pretty obvious here. Besides, there's nothing that the folks at DRV love more than out of process closures, and it's the proper place to contest the decision.

<p>Great, we now have parallel discussions and separate fiefdoms.&lt;sigh&gt;On DRV, there is significant objection to the speedy keep, even though no one among them (well, almost) thinks that the thing should be deleted.The point is that "speedy keep" is rapidly turning into a weapon.I think, personally, that 24 hours would be a speedy keep or speedy delete.We really ought not be removing listings before the earth has done a half a turn, if nothing else.For all Tony knows, there is going to be someone in Jakarta with a compelling argument for the delete.The point is that we can't know if there is unanimity if we don't give .75 of the earth a chance to be awake.Is SPUI making a point?Probably.Is there reason to remove a nomination in twenty minutes?No.The futher debate is going to be supermajority anyway, so let it run.So far as I know, SPUI's not on an instant revert ban.Again, though, this isn't about him or you or you or you: it's about what a "speedy" decision is, and a speedy decision should at least let the world turn.<a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 17:59, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, Tony, claiming it as a fait d'accompli and then saying that the discussion's length of time proves you were right does <i>not</i> make it right.DRV is necessary for admins and regular users, and AfD, CfD, and TfD are necessary for regular users and admins alike.Announcing that your opinion is sufficient to shortcircuit the world is not appropriate.If nothing else, I hope you'll take from the discussions here and DRV the message that you handled it incorrectly and, in the future, will allow 24 hours and <i>have some faith in Wikipedians</i> to decide for themselves.Rely on the strength of your arguments and the obvious logic, not on power and coercion.<a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:20, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Whether the discussion takes place in TfD or DRV, I'm confident that the close will be vindicated.However by closing early I offer the possibility of accepting the blatantly obvious.I can't <i>coerce</i> anyone, I can only essay a sensible close.And that's obviously better than just sitting around while an ill-conceved nomination is robotically put through the motions. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 02:52, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Having discussed this further with Antandrus, we have come to the conclusion that the majority of vandalism is coming from the 207.200.116 range (and some from 207.200.112). Vandalism begins again as soon as the block expires. Longer blocks on 207.200.116.0/24 and 207.200.112.0/24 may be appropriate (I recently range blocked 207.200.116/24 for 30 minutes).

<p>The weird thing about that is that it would need to be an AOL user who remains connected via dialup, as I think their broadband issues stable IP's.This means that some vandal is actually dialing in and leaving it going or there is an open relay somewhere.I wonder if that's possible.<a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 01:40, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm glad to see you're not affected by this particular range-block.The bot seems to be set to run non-stop, and immediately detects when the block lifts:you will see it return immediately at 02:35 UTC, unless the vandal has given up for the time being.Don't AOL users get a new IP on each page load, in some cases?I wish I understood how AOL assigns its proxies but it's not obvious to me.</dd>

<dd>It would be nice if the talk pages of AOL IPs, and other IPs, were labeled as stable, regular dynamic (changing with each session) or super dynamic (changing with every page load), if it is possible to get the information.

<dd>Look, if we have a real -bot going, we have to range block.What I don't want to see is out of process blocks for days and weeks and months and (as one person decided to do), indefinite.I'm using an AOL-owned ISP for the time being, and I'm not at all fond of it; however, I can't figure out when and how I get a new IP, either.AOL doesn't <i>appear</i> to assign with every page load, but it doesn't appear to assign at timed intervals, either.I'm sure, if I were more knowledgeable about TCP/IP, there might be some resource call that I could figure out is triggering it (or just AOL's servers are working on <i>their</i> clock, so they reassign themselves based on their server load).It <i>appears</i> that each region of AOL's domain (and we all know that a region might not be geographic, given the looping of backbone resources) gets a different range for some period of time, and that's why some AOL users have never been collaterally blocked, while I'm getting a collateral block 3-4 times a day.We all wish the vandals straight to their high school principal's office, but there are good users who suffer for their sins.Additionally, at this point <i>we can't get any legitimate AOL accounts,</i> as the vandals are registering names so fast that an AOL user can't even sign up, much less get a single edit in.If I weren't an admin, I'd be unable to contribute at all.<a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:15, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A couple of months ago there was great excitement and discussion of a range of semi-static (172., I think) AOL IPs that individuals could use based on some kind of configuration. Not being an AOL user myself, I've obviously never tried it, but unless I've totally lost my mind, this was supposed to be at least a partial solution. I can testify that I do sometimes run into AOL addresses in the 172. range, and that it does appear they are far more stable than the normal AOL IPs. Is this something that just never got wide enough disclosure, or is there a problem with the solution that I just missed? (Someone who actually remembers what the details were and how to set it up filling in the gaps here would be greatly appreciated.) <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <font color="#7B68EE">(<small><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">Talk</font></a> • <font color="#7B68EE">Connect</font></small>)</font></span> 13:29, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I range blocked 207.200.116.0/24 for 12 hours last night but, of course, it started back one minute after the block expired. I ranged blocked for another 12 hours a few minutes ago (there is little point blocking for very short periods of time but at least with a medium length block we can regularly check to see if it is still running). I have also raised a request for an ISP abuse report <a href="../../../a/b/u/Wikipedia%7EAbuse_reports_baf1.html#207.200.116..2A_and_207.200.112..2A" title="Wikipedia:Abuse reports">here</a>. When it is not blocked, the RC patrollers don't seem able to keep up with all of the vandalism, so I think that we will need to keep blocking for now. Another thought that occurred to me was whether we could have a bot that reverts all edits made in this range. There would be the problem that it would revert some good edits, but at least logged in users would be unaffected. Does anybody have any thoughts on this?

<dd><b>No.</b>I really think this is some other business, here.It's possible that someone is just busying a phone line for days at a time, but it's much more likely that someone with an always-on connection is hooking into AOL's rolling system.Would anyone be shocked to think there is a backdoor to AOL?More to the point, I suspect that an open relay is being used for someone to log into his AOL account from another, always-on connection.<a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:55, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, it was unblocked early this morning, but since then there have been at least a couple of dozen individual IP blocks and probably a lot of missed vandalism overnight. I think we need to balance the damage that it is doing, and the time that it is taking to clean up against the collateral damage being caused, post report and apply individual blocks. I have range blocked again for 12 hours. Any thoughts on the idea of having a bot that reverts in this range?

<dd>Having a bot that blindly reverts in this range would effectively be indefinitely blocking the range, except it would take up the server use that all of the edits would cause. The only benefit to this would seem to be that registered users could still edit, but the fix to the blocking software that allows logged in users to edit when their IP is blocked is supposedly coming any day now. <a href="../../../e/w/s/User%7EEWS23_debe.html" title="User:EWS23"><font color="green"><b>EWS23</b></font></a> (<a href="../../../e/w/s/User_talk%7EEWS23_56e9.html" title="User talk:EWS23">Leave me a message!</a>) 08:21, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The only piece of response above that seems to address the question at hand -- recommending AOLers to use a different browser -- is as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>from my understanding, you <b>need</b> the AOL "browser" since it's not really a browser, in such much as it's the shell of a browser, and you need it open in order to actually use AOL, without it, you don't have a connection to the internet,</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>However, there's nothing saying that you can't leave the "AOL browser" open (minimized) and use a different browser to edit Wikipedia.</p>
<p>The ongoing problem is that legitimate non-logged-in AOLers using the proxy system are indistinguishable from known severe abusers. It would seem to me that any AOLer who <i>wanted</i> to be distinguished from abusers would be <i>very interested</i> in pursuing any technique which would accomplish this. Insisting that it is impossible, when it appears not to be, is an unproductive and self-destrucive response. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 01:18, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You guys are very, very, very wrong, and the 152 fellow is much righter.I use Mozilla, and I use Firefox, and I use Netscape ISP.Netscape is owned by AOL, but it is not AOL.(I pay $10/month and am very poor.AOL would be too expensive.)So, do I get rolling IP's?Yep.Do they roll every page load?Nope.Do they roll every X minutes?Not that I can see.Are they stable?Nope.It might be fine for an AOL user to use the Wikimedia stuff, but it's a huge, huge load on our services and it slows Wikipedia down to a crawling snail with an injured pseudopod.Now, "how much do we have to put up with?"We have to put up with issuing&#160;:15 blocks until some development scheme solves the problem or AOL stops its methods.I put my hopes on the former, as the latter would need to rewrite its basic operations and is unlikely to do that.<a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 01:34, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I suggest we allow AOL users to contribute only after creating an account.The amount of work we have to do because of AOL is a big drain on the project.If user's don't want to log in, they can switch to a different internet service provider, but we're doing too much work simply to preserve their ability to edit anonymously. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 19:43, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Money.I use Netscape ISP for $10/month, as opposed to $20/month for everyone else.Netscape is owned by AOL.I have some choice, but there are plenty of people living in rural areas who <i>won't</i> have a choice about ISP.What irritates me is not the consequences but when we develop a cavalier attitude about these blocks.If people vandal hunt all day, they'll start to think that there is nothing from a given ISP except vandalism.The good AOL users are going to be invisible, because they're good users, but they're getting bombed daily by overly enthusiastic blocks.I don't blame anyone for blocking a named user vandal, of course.I'm just saying that the vandals are getting names, so blocking non-logged users won't really help this problem.<a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:17, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>To be honest, this is one of the nastier cases I've seen; beyond engaging in vandalism with the sockpuppet accounts while pleading innocent with others, he actually went as far as to welcome some of them. The unblocking exchange, where he confirms his use of 216.164.203.90 (for other's benefit, I obviously already know from checkuser), can be seen at the top of his talk page; a similar confirmation appears at the top of <a href="../../../2/1/6/User_talk%7E216.164.203.90.html" title="User talk:216.164.203.90">User talk:216.164.203.90</a>.</p>
<p>As is generally my practice in these cases, I have blocked anything I found unblocked indef, as wellas blocking the IP for six months to prevent further attacks. Given that the task of checkuser is to investigate and report, I leave the decision of what to do with Nookdog to the community. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <font color="#7B68EE">(<small><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">Talk</font></a> • <font color="#7B68EE">Connect</font></small>)</font></span> 17:00, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What Mbuk forgots to say is that Irpen presented a load of references to support his claims, as can be seen at <a href="../../../u/k/r/Talk%7EUkrainization_9511.html#Dispute_tags" title="Talk:Ukrainization">Talk:Ukrainization#Dispute_tags</a>, while Mbuk just kept on insert the tag. Of course if he said that "I am very critical and always use my own head". To me, these references are perfectly OK. Even if they're not for Mbuk, it is not a reason for an OR tag. -- <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrafikm_fr_a2d0.html" title="User:Grafikm fr"><font color="blue"><b>Grafikm</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrafikm_fr_126e.html" title="User talk:Grafikm fr"><b><font color="red">(AutoGRAF)</font></b></a></sup> 22:38, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I believe Mbuk is abusing process and wikilaywering. He is marking the entire article with an {{<a href="../../../o/r/_/Template%7EOR_cecf.html" title="Template:OR">OR</a>}} tag purely on the basis that he thinks the definition of ukrainization is unsourced. Apart from the fact that that the meaning of the word is obvious and extracted from the "acceptable" version to AndriyK (frankly, I would define is as a voluntary or involuntary cultural change in which something not Ukrainian becomes Ukrainian), when the status of a sentence or two as sourced or unsourced are disputed, you use {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}} templates. I can't think of another reason for his actions but to sabotage an article which says something (not the definition, because he could sabotage that with a fact template) he doesn't like. <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> no longer applies in this case due to the similar tag edit wars over at <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_architecture.html" title="Russian architecture">Russian architecture</a>. --<a href="../../../t/e/l/User%7ETelex_3d37.html" title="User:Telex">Tēlex</a> 22:47, 9 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>The last three were only used in discussions with about two links each.</p>
<p>The Wikipedia minilogo (BTW of course not my image, I only uploaded it as found on Meta) was used on almost all help pages and elsewhere for several months.</p>
<p>"Lock-icon" was a replacement for an out of process deletion of another image discussed here, on DRV, and elsewhere (the erroneously deleted JPEG wasn't my image and admittedly ugly). It was also a proposed replacement for "lock-icon.png" (again not my image), because the quality of this PNG is questionable.</p>
<p>"Octagon-warning" was AFAIK used, because warning icons should be visible with "any" browser, as long as the quality is acceptable. The same is true for "red-x", also used on several templates.</p>
<p>"Clear1x1" was a single transparent dot, used on a few project and help pages like <a href="../../../e/i/s/WP%7EEIS_9507.html" title="WP:EIS">WP:EIS</a> for documentation of image-syntax. --&#160;<a href="../../../o/m/n/User%7EOmniplex_327d.html" title="User:Omniplex">Omniplex</a> 03:11, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

I quote "Please upload only files that are used (or will be used) in encyclopedia articles or project pages; anything else will be deleted." These images were down-sampled versions of existing images that are widely used, and as such are redundant, and undesirable. You state "because the quality of this PNG is questionable." In response, I would like to say that the quality of your gifs is questionable. Actually, they're downright ugly, and the web has since moved on, even if your browser has not. The vast majority of Wikipedia users can view the png and svg versions of these images quite fine, and don't need down-sampled gifs.--<b><a href="../../../d/i/g/User%7EDigitalme_b457.html" title="User:Digitalme">digital_m</a><a href="../../../d/i/g/User%7EDigitalme_EA_0684.html" title="User:Digitalme/EA"><span style="color:green;">e</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../d/i/g/User_talk%7EDigitalme_e893.html" title="User talk:Digitalme">Talk</a>ˑ<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Digitalme_d720.html" title="Special:Contributions/Digitalme">Contribs</a>)</sup></b> 03:22, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I discovered this discussion after restoring <a href="../../../r/e/d/Image%7ERed-x.gif_bacf.html" title="Image:Red-x.gif">Image:red-x.gif</a> (which was deleted as a "test page," despite the fact that it was actively used on almost 500 pages)!Naturally, I assumed that this was accidental.</p>
<p>Omniplex created the image as a solution to the infamous IE PNG-24 transparency bug, and he did a remarkably good job.The source PNG (a modified version of an SVG with different relative dimensions) had a solid background and took up 946 bytes.Omniplex managed to convert this to a GIF with a transparent background that takes up only 269 bytes!Even an optimized PNG-8 version of this image has a <b>larger</b> file size (306 bytes via <a href="http://advsys.net/ken/util/pngout.htm" class="external text" title="http://advsys.net/ken/util/pngout.htm" rel="nofollow">PNGOUT</a>), so there's absolutely no valid reason to replace the GIF.But if there were, this would be a matter for IfD.This deletion was an utterly outrageous breach of process that compromised the integrity of the hundreds of pages on which the image appears.</p>
<p>The other images were also deleted out-of-process, and it's only because I don't wish to wheel-war that I haven't restored them.I actually would vote to delete some of them, but that's beside the point.—<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 06:51/07:07, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

It also says that GIF images that are not animated should be switched over to PNG (and now SVG).

So 85 percent of WP users cannot really use SVG; that is why I said get the non-broken browsers.

<li><i>I look forward to the day when Chinese culture and society is as self-critical and self-examining as European/British/North American societies have become; but by the look of the cant kicking around the press, the net and Wiki, it'll be a while yet.....</i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Chinaman" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Chinaman" rel="nofollow">[31]</a></li>
<li><i>"Celestial" is in reference to "subject of the Son of Heaven" and is somewhat akin on context to "British subject", and was meant in a complimentary, even respectful fashion; but Chinese insecurities demand that it be pronounced "racist". Fix your own language's many racist and sexual biases before demanding other cultures kowtow to your need to rewrite history to suit yourselves.</i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:HongQiGong#.22Offensiveness_and_common_usage.22_.28ref:_Chinaman.29" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:HongQiGong#.22Offensiveness_and_common_usage.22_.28ref:_Chinaman.29" rel="nofollow">[32]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And he also has a habit of inserting his opinions as inline comments into an article itself:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>it was a racist response to racist times; natural enough, but don't pretend it's not based in racism and the attached insecurity; the clue here is that word "humiliation", apparently one of the driving forces of the Chinese cultural ego.</i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Chinaman#Mark_Twain_on_.27Chinaman.27" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Chinaman#Mark_Twain_on_.27Chinaman.27" rel="nofollow">[33]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These kinds of comments are really bordering on racism.If this doesn't require admins' attention, advice on how to work with him on edits would be much appreciated.I'm having a difficult time assuming good faith on his part.<a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> 04:14, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>What is the rule on profanity?</p>
<ul>
<li><i>bullsh*t. Laundry was an entrepreneurial business and not something they were forced to do.</i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_Chinese_immigration_to_Canada&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=62917631" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_Chinese_immigration_to_Canada&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=62917631" rel="nofollow">[34]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>More examples of his questionable comments:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>gag; more sinothink newspeak distortions of reality; gag, gag, gag</i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chinatown&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=62943594" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chinatown&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=62943594" rel="nofollow">[35]</a><a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">--- Hong Qi Gong</a> 05:56, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Another thing I want to point out is that he's basically been using Wikipedia as a soapbox for his opinions about racial problems in Vancouver involving Chinese people.Check the edits he makes in Talk pages and the inline comments he makes in the articles themselves.<a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">--- Hong Qi Gong</a> 06:34, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I blocked Anirudh a few days ago for spamming and incivility. I recommend another one. He seems to have been doing nothing recently but to add external links and troll, so a community ban is probably impending. I don't think we've reached that stage yet - I do think another block may be justified, but would rather a previously uninvolved admin takes a look at this.</dd>

<dd>This is a shocking assumption of bad faith. Giovanni33 has a pretty mixed history on Wikipedia, but has made some decent contributions, and I see absolutely nothing to suggest that he edits in bad faith. Indeed, he seems to be learning to drop things - his contributions from the last couple of days (since he was last unblocked before this most recent one) have been fine. I see absolutely nothing in his contributions of the last couple of days that warrants a week block - a block which seemed more destined to settle past scores than stopping him from causing ongoing trouble.</dd>

</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If Giovanni33 does cause trouble, he deserves a block - as I noted when he returned after the initial block and started making a nuisance of himself. He was blocked again - deservedly - but after that, has stuck to making useful and non-controversial edits. Today's block for a week, however, was thus completely undeserved. I posted on Geni's talk page asking for an explanation, but after waiting some hours and receiving no response (and not being able to find any justification for the new block anywhere), overturned it.</dd>

<dd>The problem here is that least some of his suspected sockpuppets (including one of the two you're referring to) are not his sockpuppets, as verified by CheckUser (there didn't seem to be any CheckUser data on the other sock). I believe that he has created sockpuppets before, based on evidence submitted to me via email, but it also seems that people are being far too quick to assume that sockpuppets are indeed his. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 14:00, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First, this is a problem, not because you (Rebecca) unblocked, but because you are doing it unilaterally, and starting what is becoming a nice little block war.No one dies if you wait on the the response of the blocking admin before unblocking.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AGeni&amp;diff=63033313&amp;oldid=62897019" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AGeni&amp;diff=63033313&amp;oldid=62897019" rel="nofollow">[44]</a>.Second, Checkuser is not the oracle of sockpuppetry.It can tell you if someone is a sockpuppet, but it evidently can't tell you they are not.I have a good guess as to how it works, and it would not be hard to make it so that CU can't be definitive.Have you researched what CU returns and what the public from Gio and company returns? <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikibofh_f636.html" title="User:Wikibofh">Wikibofh</a><sub>(<a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikibofh_5845.html" title="User talk:Wikibofh">talk</a>)</sub> 14:15, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Yet FeloniousMonk says: <i>"The sockpuppetry is not why he's constantly getting blocked, it's because he's a chronic 3RR violator and source of disruption once caught."</i> While the blocking admin Geni says it's because he <i>"didn't stay away from areas he was told to stay away from"</i>.

<dd>Well, the answer is pretty clear why anybody would unblock him: because they thought <i>that particular block</i> was unwarranted. I apologize for misreading your statement, but reading it again in this new light, it seems you are suggesting that unwarranted blocks be allowed to stand if the person has a history. Is that indeed what you meant? Second, there is no clear understanding of what this block was for, hence the differing reasons in his block log. I'm not pretending, please assume good faith. Regarding <a href="../../../d/e/u/User%7EDeuteronomy2000_e78b.html" title="User:Deuteronomy2000">User:Deuteronomy2000</a>, my understanding is that even AnnH disagrees that this is a sock of Gio.

<p>Why don't you simply ask him to stop doing what he's doing before giving him a weeks block? I find it distressing to see such eagerness to block users. Judging from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giovanni33&amp;curid=5325239&amp;diff=63022623&amp;oldid=63012383" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giovanni33&amp;curid=5325239&amp;diff=63022623&amp;oldid=63012383" rel="nofollow">this</a> he seems willing to listen to reason. Also, perhaps blocking policy needs to be looked at, as I see very little emphasis on warnings, or discussing problems with the users involved. This is clearly a problem. More disruption has been caused by questionable blocks than by the activities that got the users blocked in the first place! Ironically, that's the subject that was being discussed when <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">User:Alienus</a> was controversially blocked, leading to him leaving WP, along with <a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESOPHIA_915a.html" title="User:SOPHIA">User:SOPHIA</a>.<a href="../../../%5E/%5E/j/User%7E%5E%5EJames%5E%5E_807e.html" title="User:^^James^^">^^James^^</a> 20:42, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

I suggest that the specific issues leading to a block be made crystal clear, and discussed first, thereby allwoing the person to comply voluntarily. Because it sounds like you are arguing that the recent week long block may not have been justified, but lets keep him blocked anyways because of his past transgressions. I don't think that's a healthy cycle. As he has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giovanni33&amp;curid=5325239&amp;diff=63022623&amp;oldid=63012383" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giovanni33&amp;curid=5325239&amp;diff=63022623&amp;oldid=63012383" rel="nofollow">stated,</a> you could have simply asked him to stop removing those sockpuppet notices. (If that's even the reason for the recent week long block, which hasn't been made clear.) Instead, his past is being drudged up to justify blocks that appear to have no valid reason today.

<p>Giovanni violated 3RR on 29 June, and was reported. Wikibofh blocked for 24 hours. One of Giovanni's puppets reverted back to his version, and Wikibofh increased Giovanni's block to a week. He said later that regardless of the puppet issue, which Gio was disputing, he felt that the week-long block should stand, because of Gio's history of being blocked for 3RR. That's perfectly normal, and I can even remember Alienus pushing for a 3-day block for Jayjg (after a false 3RR report had been filed against hime. (Jayjg's block log is long because there have been so many reoort, including one of blocking the wrong person!) During that week, Gio logged off and made an edit to WP:ANI in support of Alienus.On 6 July, Will Beback reset the block, to expire a week from the date of evasion. That is a perfectly standard admin action, and is completely in keeping with policy. Giovanni, when he was told, complained about the injustice, saying that what he had done</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>was not wrong, but in keeping with necessity and in accordance with more important rules and principals for which all the rules here are meant to service. . . . My comment to the incident board was necessitated given its time sensitive nature. It aided in an understanding of an important issue that may have affected the outcome differently had I waited.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>A few days later, he claimed that he hadn't known he was logged off, and had thought the block had expired when he found himself able to edit. It strikes me that he would have said that straight after having the block reset for evasion, if it had been true.</p>
<p>On 7 July, Rebecca unblocked, saying <i>Tentatively unblocking, as grounds for extending ban were a bit slight</i>.She did not inform Will of this (unless she did it through a private e-mail). Later that day, FeloniousMonk reblocked, saying, <i>Reinstating block, was more than justified in my view as well as others</i>.Several hours later, Rebecca posted to Will and Felonious, saying that a lot of his original behaviour was unacceptable, and he had deserved the block, but that an extra week wouldn't achieve anything. She said that if he continued this behaviour she wouldn't object to a reblock. She unblocked again, with <i>I've explained my reasons for unblocking this user to the two users concerned, and I still think a block is unwarranted at this time</i>.</p>
<p>Instead of quietly going back to editing articles, Giovanni continued to defend his past behaviour, posted confrontational posts about people he had been in dispute with, and started edit warring on the user pages of his suspected puppets (and of one proven one). The next day, an obvious sockpuppet <a href="../../../d/e/u/User%7EDeuteronomy2000_e78b.html" title="User:Deuteronomy2000">User:Deuteronomy2000</a>, whom I do not believe to be connected to Giovanni33 (though his past behaviour means that people will consider him as a possible suspect) posted a 3RR report on FeloniousMonk (who had blocked Giovanni).I removed it, as the account was obviously created for the purpose of making the report. Giovanni, who should have been trying to stay away from any kind of trouble, reverted me (who had caught him out in puppetry). I then looked at the report in detail, and found it was invalid anyway, as the fourth revert was not a revert.</p>
<p>FeloniousMonk then discussed the matter with Rebecca, who said that Giovanni had blown his chance, and was heading for a community ban) {see <a href="../../../r/e/b/User_talk%7ERebecca_0c84.html#Unblocking_of_Giovanni33" title="User talk:Rebecca">here</a> and <a href="../../../f/e/l/User_talk%7EFeloniousMonk_476a.html#Giovanni33" title="User talk:FeloniousMonk">here</a>. She raised no objection to a reblocking, and he reblocked. Geni then unblocked, saying, <i>agreed to stay away from chrisitiaity articles</i> (presumably that agreement was in IRC or by private e-mail). FeloniousMonk then discussed it with Geni (see <a href="../../../g/e/n/User_talk%7EGeni_0642.html#Giovanni33" title="User talk:Geni">User_talk:Geni#Giovanni33</a> and <a href="../../../f/e/l/User_talk%7EFeloniousMonk_476a.html#Giovanni33_2" title="User talk:FeloniousMonk">here</a> who said that Gio had agreed not only to stay away from Christianity, but also to stop the behaviour that Felonious was complaining about: "If not I'll just block him again."</p>
<p>Gio continued with confrontation, and Geni warned him to stop.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giovanni33&amp;diff=62755525&amp;oldid=62736647" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giovanni33&amp;diff=62755525&amp;oldid=62736647" rel="nofollow">[46]</a>Then he violated 3RR on one of the puppet pages that was being taggd, and was blocked for 24 hours by Wikibofh. Geni changed the block to one week, with <i>didn't stay away from areas he was told to stay away from</i>.Rebecca posted on Geni's page, asking for some explanation for the block, and a little over three hours later, left another message saying that Geni was obviously not around, and that Rebecca "was very uncomfortable leaving this user blocked". Rebecca then unblocked, with <i>Blocked for a week against policy, no evident justification for the block or consensus to make it anywhere</i>. FeloniousMonk reblocked and Rebecca unblocked again.</p>
<p>I take the point that the Deuteronomy accusation was a false one, and I did feel at the time that making that accusation weakened the case, when there are so many obvious socks.I would like to point out, though, that someone who has deliberately and deceitfully used puppets in the past, while pretending to have no connection to them, and who has never acknowledged this as wrong, is not really in a position to edit war over a false accusation.Gio could have e-mailed an admin and asked for help over the one false accusation.In fact, I had already asked Timothy Usher and Str1977 <i>not</i> to tag the Deuteronomy account as Gio's puppet. Timothy seemed unconvinced, but has not done it since. Str1977 immediately agreed.</p>
<p>I think it's misleading to claim that Gio was blocked for a week (or five days, or whatever) for reverting my deletion of Deuteronomy's report, or for not staying away from certain areas. In certain cases, his block was <i>reset</i>.He was not blocked for a week for posting to the noticeboard. His one-week block was reset, to a week after the post (four days after the "reblock"). Also, while it would be "against policy" to block for not staying away from certain areas, if someone is unblocked early under certain conditions, and breaks those conditions, and the block is re-implemented, it can't be seen as a one-week block for getting involved in those areas.</p>
<p>I would urge that nobody should reset this block again. If he does something else, give him a fresh block. At this stage, stopping a wheelwar is more important than keeping him blocked. (I don't think Jimbo would like the look of that particular block log!) I don't see why it was essential to unblock without waiting for a reply from Geni, when the unblock meant that he hadn't even served the 24 hours for his umpteenth 3RR violation, and hadn't served the original resetting to which Rebecca had not objected, and which had been undone by Geni under certain conditions which he had violated.The tag that he was edit warring over is a tag which says "suspected", and it is certainly true that he was <i>suspected</i> of being Deuteronomy (though not by me).He is more than suspected of being the others.</p>
<p>Finally, he has <i>never</i> been blocked on "secret linguistic evidence".When he has been blocked for publicly-verifiable offences, I have sometimes mentioned that I <i>have</i> linguistic evidence which I am not prepared to make public, as it will alert him to idiosyncrasies that he will need to avoid with his next puppets. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 07:38, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm just about to head out of town for a couple of days, but I'm trying to sort out a potentially amicable solution to this mess, after talking with both Giovanni33 and some of his critics.

<p>User Gibnews has been persistently censoring the <a href="../../../g/i/b/Gibraltar.html" title="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> article. His behaviour falls short of outright vandalism but it consists of imposing his NPOV view on all other users by daily revertals and refusal to engage in constructive discussion or consensus building. He accuses all wikipedians who do not agree with him on a number of issues (a majority of editors of the Gibraltar article) of being "pro-Spanish" and spreading "lies and propaganda".</p>
<p>The main problem with his behaviour is that he has erased dozens of respectable sources included in the article by a number of users over the past months. He considers they are not worthy of being included in the article since they contradict his biased POV. He has even gone as far as erasing the disputed tag from the article while imposing his view on all other users who disagreed with him.</p>
<p>A number of users (including myself, <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAsterion_ed2e.html" title="User:Asterion">user:Asterion</a>, <a href="../../../e/c/e/User%7EEcemaml_a689.html" title="User:Ecemaml">user:Ecemaml</a> and many others) have given up on contributing to the article but I have noticed that others (such as <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPanchurret_b95f.html" title="User:Panchurret">user:Panchurret</a>) continue to contribute sources which are promptly erased by user Gibnews.</p>
<p>I am suprised that he has not be banned (or atleast warned) by Wikipedia administrators as <a href="../../../g/i/b/User%7EGibraltarian_6c70.html" title="User:Gibraltarian">user:Gibraltarian</a> has.</p>

<li>I am disgusted with this hasty action. I've only just become aware that his block expired and I've been working through his edits. In the case of someone with OCD, considered responses leading to directed outcomes are infinitely better than taking the easy way out, which is interpeted by the sufferer as inconsiderate and thoughtless. I've advertised my willingness to help this user, and I am dismayed that I wasn't even given a heads-up. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperJumbo_33a0.html" title="User:SuperJumbo">Jumbo</a> 23:13, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Jumbo has made a very genuine effort to help this user mend his ways and I applaud his efforts. As one of the person who gave Pnatt the five week block after he started edit warring the moment he came back the last time, I had hoped that <i>this time</i> he would have learnt his lesson. Unfortunately it is clear that he hadn't. Even taking into account his problem with OCD his behaviour is <i>way</i> beyond what is tolerable on Wikipedia. Much as I applaud Jumbo for his efforts in trying to restrain Pnatt, Pnatt, by starting <i>yet more</i> edit wars as soon as his block ended (unfortunately his usual technique), seems to have shown clear evidence that he is irreformable. Reluctantly I have to endorse this block. This user has not changed his behaviour one iota since he came here and is unlikely ever to. I guessed that it was only a matter of time before he got himself permanently blocked. As usual his behaviour, as soon as one block ended, was such as to bring on another one, this time an indefinite one, almost immediately. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:green; background-color:pink"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 23:30, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have spent some time today trying to think of an alternate mechnism other than an indefinite block.

<p>In response to my warning, Karmafist has made an edit on my talk page, "Tony's Spam", saying "Please stop spamming my talk page. Thank you."</p>
<p>Which of course is a blatant breach of his civility parole.</p>
<p>Seems to me he's asking to be banned from Wikipedia.</p>

<ul>
<li>His actions certainly seem that way when you consider that his sig links to his "manifesto". I haven't seen him make an edit without a sig (ie, a useful edit to the articlespace) in a very long time. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 20:17, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think that an important portion of the ruling against Karmafist was the thought that a Welcome message, being that it is specifically aimed at new users (who would not know all the policies and who might reasonably be expected to give the comments undue weight).I don't think this is grounds for banning.I do agree the post on Tony's page is uncivil, and some action is meritted for that. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 20:32, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Karmafist is promoting his manifesto in his sig, and, while I disagree with this action, I do not think that we can hold it against him unless we can get a consensus together to amend <a href="../../../s/i/g/WP%7ESIG_e615.html" title="WP:SIG">WP:SIG</a> so that it is forbidden. In addition, I feel that the violation of WP:CIVIL is extremely mild, and does not merit a block any longer than 24 hours. -- <a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWhere_0f76.html" title="User:Where"><b><font color="blue">Where</font></b></a> 20:28, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Karmafist has announced in edit summaries <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:WGee&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=57961288" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:WGee&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=57961288" rel="nofollow">like this one</a> that he doesn't want to edit the encyclopedia proper because it "makes money for Jimbo." I don't really mind him responding to people on his talk page or theirs, which is most of what he's been doing lately, no matter what's in his sig. The book update things -- eh, I guess it's not offensive. I see the "spam" message as a borderline breach of civility, not blatant. However, I am bothered by the notion of somebody who is now expressly not interested in contributing to the encyclopedia voting at RfA, as Karmafist has been doing of late.—<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a>(<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 20:32, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I like his edit summaries (Snoop, Nirvana), I don't think his posting to Tony's page is anything to get upset about (Tony has a thicker skin than that).If someone wants to make the argument that his RFA votes be discounted at this point in time, it might be worth raising at the 'Crats' noticeboard - maybe we need to change the voting rules to take things like this into account, but I see no need to single him out.<a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 20:37, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Additionally, if Tony considers Karmafist's manifesto to be divisive he could always MFD it.It's not going to be made policy in any of our lifetimes, so I don't see the harm, but I agree that the spamming in the sig ought to stop: if you want people to come to your user page you should attract them there by the quality of the work you do for the project, not by advertising. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 20:42, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>If he continues to be completely uninterested in editing productively on the project, he probably should be warned and eventually blocked -- Wikipedia userpages are not meant to be generic message boards. At the same time, getting the judgement right on this is tricky -- we don't want to tell infrequent contributors to go away. I suspect working to sell his book and his frequent .. less productive contributions makes the difference.. but getting the tradition we set here right is essential. --<a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImprov_b282.html" title="User:Improv">Improv</a> 20:55, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Well, my instinct is that he's on civility parole for a reason.The open hostility to the project would, in a newcomer, quickly get him banned, but he's someone who has in the past done good work.I take Guettarda's point about my "thicker skin", but that's not really relevant to the case because he's on civility parole.There isn't really any significant history between me and Karmafist prior to his desysopping (we had a brief difference of opinion over the Maoririder case and made it up), so it isn't as if he's singling me out.I could just be anybody who came to him with a problem about his welcoming.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The signature itself is obviously completely out of order.Whether he types it out each time or keeps it in his signature makes no difference; it amounts to aggressive spamming in an attempt to promote a policy initiative. Even if it hasn't a hope of succeeding, the nature of that manifesto is such as to promote bad faith.That he's banned from engaging in similar campaigning behavior under the guise of "welcoming" is also relevant.I consider this promotional activity to be a violation of the ban, which is explicity intended to be interpreted broadly for precisely the reason that the arbitration committee envisioned that Karmafist might attempt to seek out wriggle room in the ban.</dd>

<dd>On Ontario, I did go a bit too far, and I'm going to stay out of that. But Germany has a <a href="../../../b/u/n/Bundesautobahn_1.html" title="Bundesautobahn 1">pretty clearly broken infobox</a>, and I've done the best I can to convince others of that. (Note how several different people reverted that, and others commented on <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EAutobahn_infobox_template_ca6f.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Autobahn infobox template">Wikipedia talk:Autobahn infobox template</a>.) Similarly, in the {{<a href="../../../u/n/b/Template%7EUnblockabuse_4969.html" title="Template:Unblockabuse">unblockabuse</a>}} case, which is what Tony is referring to, I brought it to the place one brings problematic templates.

<dd>I'll agree the Block abuse thing was brought to the right place in my opinion. However I can also see how he would have trouble assuming good faith in that instance as you do use the "unblock" template more often then most users and having it become less effective might be something that you'd want to avoid since you are blocked quite often. But I'll assume you had good reasons beyond that. As for the German infobox while I agree you've gotten the consensus ball rolling I don't think there is a clear enough view one way or the other on the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EAutobahn_infobox_template_ca6f.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Autobahn infobox template">Wikipedia talk:Autobahn infobox template</a> page to support the mass change you did.

<p>Notwithstanding this, SPUI is an editor whose work I really respect.He's a tireless worker and I don't want to appear to be taking him for granted (which I don't).We all want SPUI to stay and be happy enough and feel welcome to edit Wikipedia for as long as he feels he has something to add.If by calling him a troll, which I agree is out of order, I've made him feel that he wasn't welcome, then I apologise.However SPUI is not above criticism, for all his excellent contributions.</p>
<p>In short, it is sometimes frustrating to see SPUI take <i>us</i> for granted.I'm not stupid and I know when he's trying it on.I meant it when I said that repetition of provocative xfd nominations will result in banning from xfd.And SPUI, please don't take that as an invitation to game your probation. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 21:44, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm NOT commenting on this matter, I don't want to read through and do all the research at the moment - but I do have a suggestion.SPIU, is it really that hard to to <b>keep your head down</b>.If I had all those things leveled against me I'd sure find any way possible to keep out of trouble.Take a wikibreak.Research for an article you're interested about (you could even go to the library to find sources, that'd be awesome).Be a new user welcomer.There is so much to do here and it kind of puzzles me why (and how) you attract so much attention. Jeeze, I'll even show you how to use this cool spellchecking script that you put into your monobook.js Oh, and SPUI, that's not poison, it's Tony's sour <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus_juice.html" title="Jesus juice">Jesus juice</a> =D. --<a href="../../../m/b/o/User%7EMboverload_cce2.html" title="User:Mboverload">mboverload</a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Mboverload_00ae.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Mboverload"><font color="red">@</font></a> 21:48, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

I'm not in favor of unblocking but want to seek a wider review. Note, I was not the blocking or unblocking admin for any of these actions. My involvement came from moderating an article dispute that both accounts edited.</p>
<p>The originally block of Zigzogger occurred under false pretenses. Another user impersonated Zigzogger causing the account to be blocked. In the course of sorting out that situation I asked for Kitteneatkitten to have a usercheck. It was determined that it was an account being used by the same person using the Zigzogger account.This is not disputed. Kittenatekitten was indef blocked .</p>
<p>Knowing that the Kitteneatkitten was an older account with more edits, I asked this user if they would prefer to use that account. This change was made with Zigzogger indef blocked. About a month ago Kittenatekitten requested that Zigzogger be unblocked. See Zigzogger talk page for reason for the request. I reviewed the situation and suggested that the sockpuppet template be removed but the account stay blocked. No action was at that time. <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFloNight_10cf.html" title="User:FloNight"><font color="darkblue"><b>FloNight</b></font></a> <a href="../../../f/l/o/User_talk%7EFloNight_133a.html" title="User talk:FloNight"><font color="green"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></font></a> 21:22, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't intend to edit any articles with my other nickname, however after being framed and impersonated, having had nasty and obsene words attributed to me, then being banned by a malicious user, I feel that it is very unfair to still publicly punish me as a result of the person who impersonated me, even though in a way that has little to no practical effect.</dd>

<dd>My view is that one of my nicks was framed, causing me to be banned.

<li>Well, to have literally "no trace" would require deleting past history of both talk pages, and also the checkuser page.I think it's unlikely you will persuade anyone to do this.As Mackensen has said many times, its ok to have more than one account as long as you don't cross the streams.You apparently did cross the streams, albeit briefly, and pled ignorance.Assuming good faith, and that you will keep your nicks separate in the future, I won't object to unblocking both accounts.You can also <a href="../../../a/r/c/WP%7EArchive_8a9c.html" title="WP:Archive">archive</a> the talk pages to get the warnings and discussions out of sight.If you only want to edit from one account, you might even redirect the user and talk pages of the other account to your main account, so people interested in your old edits can easily contact you, and so there's no question that everything is straight up.Wikipedia is perhaps over tolerant and excessively generous with second chances, but that will work to your benefit, and if you establish a record of useful contributions, no one will have cause to remember this past episode. Hope this helps. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 03:13, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Deleting checkuser info and talk pages wouldn't erase the logs.

<dd>Hi. I don't care about erasing all traces of what happened, just having the pejoritive "sockpuppet" and "this user is blocked" tags removed. Once again the two nicks edited the same article only once and there was nothing misleading about the way I did so (I didn't talk to myself or say "hey that's a great idea" and anyone who was following the talk page closesly would have realized I was the same person). <a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKitteneatkitten_415d.html" title="User:Kitteneatkitten">Kitteneatkitten</a> 01:11, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Big.P created a sockpuppet, <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZigz0gger_3edb.html" title="User:Zigz0gger">Zigz0gger</a> (<a href="../../../z/i/g/User_talk%7EZigz0gger_e059.html" title="User talk:Zigz0gger">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zigz0gger_d36f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zigz0gger">contribs</a>). He used it to impersonate Zigzogger, doing an <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zigz0gger_d36f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zigz0gger">artful job of it</a>.</li>
<li>During this impersonation, Zigzogger <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Zigzogger" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Zigzogger" rel="nofollow">had been banned</a> for 48 hours for repeated reposting. Both Zigz<b>o</b>gger and Zigz<b>0</b>gger were blocked, 0 as a puppet of o.</li>
<li>Flo initiated the Checkuser that established that <i>Zigz0gger</i> was in fact the sock puppet of Big.P as a revenge tactic for edits regarding the aforementioned AfD</li>
<li>I unblocked Zigzogger immediately (obviously leaving Zigz0gger blocked) and banned Big.P for a month, which expired yesterday. I blocked <a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKitteneatkitten_415d.html" title="User:Kitteneatkitten">Kitteneatkitten</a> (<a href="../../../k/i/t/User_talk%7EKitteneatkitten_b8c2.html" title="User talk:Kitteneatkitten">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kitteneatkitten_11fd.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kitteneatkitten">contribs</a>) as a sock of Zigzogger.</li>
<li>Flo recognized that Kitteneatkitten was the older account and asked Zigzogger whether they'd alternately like the Kitteneatkitten account unblocked in lieu of a block on the Zigzogger account, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zigzogger&amp;diff=57980915&amp;oldid=57821064" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zigzogger&amp;diff=57980915&amp;oldid=57821064" rel="nofollow">to which Zigzogger agreed</a>.</li>

</ol>
<p>Despite Kitten/Zig's mischaracterization of me <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zigzogger&amp;diff=61603103&amp;oldid=61601793" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zigzogger&amp;diff=61603103&amp;oldid=61601793" rel="nofollow">on the Zigzogger talk page</a>, I have no problem with removing the block, <i>provided that the reason according to <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html#Legitimate_uses_of_multiple_accounts" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK#Legitimate_uses_of_multiple_accounts</a> is enumerated and the user pages of both accounts are tagged as shown</i>. So far, there has been no solid reason given for Kitten to be using multiple accounts, and Kitten has already stated that they don't intend to use the account to edit anymore either. In addition, the monthlong block I applied to Big.P was (despite Kitten-zig's protest) appropriate. It's a significant period of time. My personal feeling is that if the Zigzogger account is no longer going to be used that the User and Talk pages for the account be redirected to Kitteneatkitten's as has been previously recommended. <a href="../../../r/a/s/User_talk%7ERasputinAXP_2a9a.html" title="User talk:RasputinAXP"><font color="#FFFFFF" style="background: maroon;">&#160;RasputinAXP&#160;</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RasputinAXP_8e7a.html" title="Special:Contributions/RasputinAXP"><small>c</small></a> 13:35, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Basically, she was framed for a big crime, but in the course of the investigation an unrelated minor offense was uncovered.I sympathize with her desire to have both accounts unblocked on principle (as she wouldn't have been caught without Big.P framing her) but I agree that they should either be tagged as legit socks or she should redirect to the one she wants.Absent a clear explanation of what she intends to do, keep the status quo. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 14:29, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But I wasn't using a sockpuppet.

<dd>As we have already discussed, that did not mean that I thought you were doing something wrong by changing user names. Rather, I thought that you were too familiar with Wikipedia dispute resolution process to be a total newbie. If you change user name, it raises red flag to experienced users/admin. For that reason, I would encourage you to settle on one user name. In the future if you want to change tell an admin, even if you want them to keep it private. This way it will not cause concern, okay. <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFloNight_10cf.html" title="User:FloNight"><font color="darkblue"><b>FloNight</b></font></a> <a href="../../../f/l/o/User_talk%7EFloNight_133a.html" title="User talk:FloNight"><font color="green"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></font></a> 01:55, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Disputed" is pretty severe, given that what's at stake is more "obsolete."I think Mackenson had it right: if there is more current research to contradict the old stuff, it should take precedence.Otherwise, we can really <i>suspect</i> that the information is out of date, but it's up to the reader to find that information and provide better or kind of leave it alone."Kind of" because something strong on the talk page would be very much warranted, contacting editors of the article who show up in history would be good, and clearly labelling the years of the reference is compulsory.We have reams of 1911 Britanica articles on the site, still (although I kill them where I can), and even worse than that.The "Brief Literary Encyclopedia" is darn near useless, but we have dozens of "articles" that are just clips from it.<a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 01:15, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>There has been much debate today about an article:Rory Demetrioff</p>
<p>I am running out of energy on this one, and may loose faith in the process.There is an article of importance for a Canadian speaker and advocate name Rory Demetrioff, which while not known outside of the Canadian is of value here.If Canada is not important or notable, that is a decision for Wiki to make.</p>
<p>In review of the history on this file, it seems that the Demetrioff article has been singled out a number of times for unsubstantiated claims:first not notable, which once demonstrated he is, was not given adequate consideration.Second, a number of similar articles on other Canadian political strategists were provided.The response on "talk" - he was the only one found out.</p>
<p>It appears unfair that this censorship has been allowed to take place.The Wiki rules were thoroughly reviewed and the Demetrioff article passes as an article of much interest for those seeking information on influential political figures in Canada.</p>
<p>I am leaving this be, as I have spent much time trying to make the case, but the individuals reviewing the information appear uninformed and unqualified to make the judgement on an article that merits attention beyond their scope of expertise.</p>
<p>Censorship is a damaging practice which only suits to hurt the fairness that democracy and freedom on information that is supposed to come with it.</p>
<p>Thank You for your understanding and I hope that someone who can be a fair judge in this can help to resolve:either by continuing to stand by the censorship with good reason, or by providing assistance on what additional information would need to be included in the Demetrioff article to make it acceptable to the Wiki rules.</p>
<p>Fairness and help is all that is being sought.</p>
<p>Thank You.</p>

<b>My conclusion</b> - I don't feel I am being authoritarian in the slightest.I know it is somewhat unusual to protect a redirect, but I feel this is an unusual case and that my action was proper.If anything, the fact that someone so interested in all things Jimbo/Foundation is trying to recreate the article is validation to me that I was right to protect the redirect to preserve the ruling of the AfD.I also feel like I have given this user several good options as to how to proceed.I think the protected redirect should remain in place for now, and that the user should create a temp-page and take it to AfD.<br />

<dd>If I may be so bold: did ever occur to you to just remove your novel fullprot on the article get out of the way and let Nature take its course?It strikes me as inevitable that Brad Patrick will have a Wikipedia biography and that he knew that it came with the territory when he accepted the "interim" position of Executive Director of the Foundation. He is in charge now: his experience, worldview and even his personality and mental stability now all a profound impact on some website known as Wikipeida®, which has an Alexa traffic ranking in the upper teens on the Internet. That immediately makes him notable, does it not?He is an expressive person with a healthy social pscyhe.

<p>BTW: None of you are going to resort to these fullprot tactics about about Gil Penchina, are you?

<p>Let us make a deal: you remove the fullprot on the Brad Patrick article in six hours or less and I do not post a hard-htting narrative about my disappointing and frustrating experiences today with this obstructionism to roughtype.com.Deal?

<dd>Johntex acted reasonably here. Do the article in your user space. If it is a significant improvement over the deleted version, we can move it and open a new AfD on the new content article. Based on the last post, though, you seem more interested in writing about your disappointment to an outside website. And your disappointment is because we don't do things exactly as you request, even though we give you a bunch of good options to accomplish the same end result. That seems a small disappointment compared to the normal disappointments we all experience in life. <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_Signature11_bf0f.html" title="User:NoSeptember/Signature11"><font color="green"><b>NoSeptember</b></font></a> 05:39, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As I confidently and firmly asserted on my IP-based talk page, other pathways of deploying a mainspace biography on Brad Patrick are wide open to me.I find that, by head count, there will always be consesus for obstructionism because it is so easy to mindlessly maintain the status quo. "Easy" quickly translates into populist obstruction against any overtly assertive person, regardless of their merits. I do not accept this obstructionism because it avoids the issues — which require thought and effort to cope with. None of you have talked about Brad.Who of you have ever communicated with him or even knew what he looks like or what his voice sounds like before June 2006? The AfD process, while superficially valid, was flawed because the article was flawed. I have refrained from simply taking one of those many pathways to get the job done, but my paience is not infinite.Please concede the point and remove the novel fullprot pronto. -- <a href="../../../6/7/2E/User%7E67.119.194.1.html" title="User:67.119.194.1">67.119.194.1</a> 06:03, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well that seems to be an overly pedantic interpretation as it would effectively nullify the purpose of deleting material created by a blocked user in the first place, if they could then just get someone else to reinstate the article. However if it is substantially the same material it is still created by a banned user and so still deletable on the same basis. Either the person creating is a sock of the blocked user, or we have a GFDL attribution issue since visible history no longer reflects the original author. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User%7EPgk_d0c7.html" title="User:Pgk">pgk</a><sup>(<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk"><font color="mediumseagreen">talk</font></a>)</sup> 07:09, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I certainly agree with this; I was simply assuming good faith that the article was created by someone else.

<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>While on RC patrol today, I discovered a new spamdexing tactic being employed by zombie bots. As seen from this diff <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Child_pornography&amp;diff=63209141&amp;oldid=63208780" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Child_pornography&amp;diff=63209141&amp;oldid=63208780" rel="nofollow">[90]</a> spammers are now embedding their URLs inside diff tags so that they are not rendered when viewing the article normally.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
&lt;div style="position: absolute; left: -10000px"&gt;[http://spam-link.com] random string&lt;/div&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>Could someone with SQL access please do a search to find more examples of this hidden spam. The HTML tag parser willprobably have to do bounds checking on the values being used to position div tags from now on to put an end to this tactic.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

<dd>I didn't mean that there weren't any, just that I can't quite <i>see</i> them yet.One question that the new abilities will spring from the box is, "Should we block all AOL editing by IP's?"If we block <i>all</i> anonymous IP editing (as we were rumored to be doing a while back), fine, but picking on this ISP strikes me as a little questionable.After all, the problem that AOL gives us is the same problem that <i>all</i> non-static IP's do.AOL rolls every X minutes (maybe every 2 minutes, maybe every&#160;:30), but every other ISP rolls IP's as well.They just don't do it intra-session.Still, a kid dials in at XXX.XX.XX.XXX and the next day he's at XXX.XX.XX.XXY.Even DSL users roll a <i>bit.</i>It's a question of degree, of course, but...well...I'm just not sure yet that we're out of those woods yet, although I really am glad that we're nearer the edge of them by a good piece.<a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 23:35, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What's curious about this case is that, apart from those specific connections, the different incidents don't resemble each other much at all.Once one compares the edits from the different socks and IPs, there does appear to be a pattern including persistent reverting to vandalized versions, repeated vandalism to user and talk pages of users who have reverted them, misleading edit summaries and impostor accounts.But looking at the incidents in isolation, one might not guess that there's more going on than seems at first.</p>
<p>I've tried to compile a list of the socks and their identifying traits at the category page linked above, but it's probably incomplete.In particular, I expect there are probably more vandalized user pages and more impostor accounts than are listed above.The vandalism is pretty easily recognizable if you're involved in it, but the combination of socks, AOL IPs and misleading edit summaries often makes it hard to spot by simply browsing the page histories.If you've encountered any other incidents that seem to be related, please let me know (or just amend the category).—<a href="../../../i/l/m/User%7EIlmari_Karonen_d189.html" title="User:Ilmari Karonen">Ilmari Karonen</a> <small>(<a href="../../../i/l/m/User_talk%7EIlmari_Karonen_f3b7.html" title="User talk:Ilmari Karonen">talk</a>)</small> 19:18, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There was a series of edit wars on several articles, primarily <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Bourrie_ce95.html" title="Mark Bourrie">Mark Bourrie</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warren_Kinsella_5d74.html" title="Warren Kinsella">Warren Kinsella</a> (a political operative and a blogger involved in a libel suit).Two editors, <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete_Peters_7b3c.html" title="User:Pete Peters">User:Pete Peters</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Ellis_81bb.html" title="User:Arthur Ellis">User:Arthur Ellis</a> were the big problems along with a number of anonymous IPs (many of which allegedly came from the National Library of Canada and allegedly a university library).The articles were protected and then semi-protected (which remains).While both editors exhibited bad behaviour, Peters seems to have moved on and has attempted to edit several other articles.Unfortunately, a series of IPs are reverting virtually everyone of Peters edits wholesale, without comment.This has resulted in non-stop edit wars on several other articles such as <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinity%E2%80%94Spadina_44e6.html" title="Trinity—Spadina">Trinity—Spadina</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Ianno_b6a4.html" title="Tony Ianno">Tony Ianno</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamilton_Centre_eecf.html" title="Hamilton Centre">Hamilton Centre</a>.Peters has not been an ideal user but he has moved on from the earlier edit wars and seemed willing to act as a responsible editor.It is unfair to him that every edit he makes is simply completely reverted.It is also unfair to the community as several articles are already unusable because of the edit wars.I don't know what to do but if somebody can help I'd appreciate it.Thank you.--<a href="../../../j/g/g/User%7EJGGardiner_acaa.html" title="User:JGGardiner">JGGardiner</a> 19:39, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Under the new blocking software, the IPs can be given long-term blocks (say, a month or more) that will still allow registered users to edit but not anonymously.Seems like this is the perfect fix for this problem, as these IPs are evidently stable and used by the same person over a period of time.If you put a list of the IPs at <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> with a brief explanation that will probably do it. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 21:15, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for the advice.I'm sure that will be helpful with most of the IPs.<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKing_of_Hearts_dcbc.html" title="User:King of Hearts">User:King of Hearts</a> seems to have just blocked a particularily troublesome one today.Unfortunately not all of them are stable.In fact one of the more abusive ones, 209.217.96.48, had this to say after <a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">User:Crzrussian</a> blocked him the other day:</dd>

<dd>Well, you can ask for a range block as well.I'm not exactly sure how they work, but I believe you can block all the addresses between (for example) 129.0.0.1 and 129.0.0.255 with a single block command.This case should probably be listed at <a href="../../../l/o/n/Wikipedia%7ELong_term_abuse_53c2.html" title="Wikipedia:Long term abuse">Wikipedia:Long term abuse</a>.That would provide extra eyes and a basis for blocking these IPs as soon as they start making their characeteristic edits, without having to go through the nonsense of 4 warnings each time. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 01:07, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Thanks.Yes, I've seen a blocked range before.The problem is that it seems like the IPs come from several different ranges.At least one is at the National Library in Ottawa.A researcher or student in downtown Ottawa no doubt has access to many different computers unfortunately.64.230.36.153 began calling Peters a "lying douchebag" on his talkpage which was followed up by 209.217.75.250 inserting the same comments an hour later after they had been deleted.It looks like this is at least three ranges of which at least two are libraries.The lower range seems to be a home user but the (possible) public computer IPs will often make a entries for one day and disappear thereafter.I'd hate to see such a massive block and I don't know if one has ever been implemented.I'd hate to see something like that but so far the conflict has left several articles semi-protected also.Hopefully it won't have to come to such an extreme measure but this non-admin will keep an eye on it.Thanks.--<a href="../../../j/g/g/User%7EJGGardiner_acaa.html" title="User:JGGardiner">JGGardiner</a> 03:53, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Even though I'd addressed each removal in the edit summaries, I put forth a continued good faith effort to explain why I felt that content shouldn't be there and how it violates policy. Pilotguy then accused me of attacking them <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ACrossmr&amp;diff=63265819&amp;oldid=63265084" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ACrossmr&amp;diff=63265819&amp;oldid=63265084" rel="nofollow">[115]</a>, after I'd already been bullied into leaving the page alone, when all I did was ask them to ensure they used proper citations when adding content to articles. Asking users to follow policies is not a personal attack.</p>
<p>As far as I'm concerned this is pure intimidation on the part of administrators trying to push PoV and unsourced content into an article. I've made numerous efforts to get people to discuss the citations, and they just revert without doing so and try to intimidate and threaten blocking to protect it. The article currently sits on pilotguys revert and my addition of original research tags. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 19:44, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Consensus cannot supersede verifiability, in that we can't agree to include unverified content.Consensus is necessary, on the other hand, to determine in questionable cases what is to count as a reliable source for specific content.It's possible the wording on <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is lagging somewhat behind practice - I'm pretty sure I've seen usenet posts used as sources in the past, though I can't think of particular cases.Perhaps someone else can provide examples? -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 21:01, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The problem here is that in making an exception for this article, and the next article, you're almost giving license to any vandal, or PoV pusher who wants to go out, and quickly create a few sources for the information and work it into the article. I'm sure this is the reasoning by disallowing this as a primary or seconday source. I have no problem including the links as a "see also" or "here is an example of x" or "further reading". But using it to support claims makes no sense. Rather than discuss the citation issues the admin involved decided to unilaterrally decide that their position was the best and enforce it. I'm all for discussing issues rationally and calmly (see my user page) but the discussion has to come to a conclusion. When all you have is A cites a policy and B says "Yeah we don't really do that around here" and then goes ahead and makes the changes without continuing the discussion, that rubs me the wrong way.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 21:05, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Guys, who cares? We're agreed it's a tangent, let's pursue a solution instead. Crossmr, I agree that you deserve to have your questions answered about why sources that would normally be considered unacceptable are ok in this case. I wish someone would explain that to me about some articles here. I'm not sure it's a question of making exceptions - there may be a general principle at work here that we don't know about yet. Maybe someone can help us understand that, which would be a better use of energy than arguing about reverts. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 21:22, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it's a bit contradictory to nominate an article for deletion on the basis that it is unverifiable, and then make significant changes to it to try and make it verifiable while the nomination is still ongoing. If I nominate something for deletion for being unverifiable, then it means I think it's impossible to make it verifiable - otherwise, I would either make it verifiable myself or try and get someone else to do it. Trying to make it verifiable while simultaneously claiming it merits deletion as being impossible to make verifiable is confusing. It would be better to wait until the AfD ends, and then try to enforce verifiability. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 20:35, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My initial statement was that I didn't feel it could be made verifiable. Yet there were many people claiming that it could be made verifiable, yet they didn't want to be bothered to do so (which was also part of my reasoning for deletion). So many claims were made that it could, I thought why not try. This was also part of my reasoning that in making it verifiable the article would be so small it probably would become an unexpandable stub. However, after attempting to do that, I still put forth that its possible it coudl be expanded if proper references could be found and was willing to change my position on the matter if that could be agreed to. I've seen many occasion before where a nom was withdrawn or the nominator changed his mind. Rewriting it to look nice, but remain unsourced and push that through as rewritten so everybody rethink your position doesn't help the matter. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 20:40, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>GTBacchus has a point. Rather than just saying "That's the way it is" whats occuring clearly flies in the face of a policy. Let's start with something simple. This citation is the basis for about 3 paragraphs in the article <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/news.admin.net-abuse.email/msg/387e586f6dd859ca" class="external autonumber" title="http://groups.google.com/group/news.admin.net-abuse.email/msg/387e586f6dd859ca" rel="nofollow">[117]</a>. I've raised this on the AfD, but I think its very indicative of the problem here. WP:V clearly states there is only 1 exception regarding self-published sources (which Usenet is one of). The person posting must be a professional researcher or journalist and their work must be previously published by a 3rd party. This post to usenet gives us no indication of who this Vladimir is, and the page he links to no longer exists. How does this citation satisfy <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>?--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 21:27, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think GTBacchus gets to the nub of it here:</p>
<ul>
<li>"I'm not sure it's a question of making exceptions - there may be a general principle at work here that we don't know about yet."</li>
</ul>
<p>Here there is a guideline, <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_source_593b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable source">Reliable source</a>, which says "Posts to bulletin boards and Usenet, wikis or messages left on blogs, are never acceptable as secondary sources. This is because we have no way of knowing who has written or posted them."</p>
<p>Well that's only <i>partly</i> true.In fact we know from multiple independent Usenet posts about the source of the <a href="../../../l/u/m/Lumber_Cartel_bb26.html" title="Lumber Cartel">Lumber Cartel</a> document, and those posts were captured contemporaneously by Deja, whose archive was bought by Google.While we cannot be sure of the identity and precise timing of <i>every</i> Usenet post, we can be very, very sure of their time sequence as a body of work.What's more these are events that we lived through.Therefore, interpreted by Crossmr as rigid, non-negotiable policy, the exclusion of this easily sourced information about a near contemporary event must be wrong.We may yet decide that the Lumber Cartel doesn't merit an article, or that the degree of verifiability isn't <i>quite</i> enough for Wikipedia.However the <i>absolute</i> exclusion of the body of Usenet and other internet evidence for an event as recent in our own lives as 1997, is incorrect. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 21:44, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Most absolute exclusions are going to be incorrect, at some point.The principle Tony's elucidating seems to be something like: "We, as Internet denizens, are allowed to make judgement calls about cases where certain types of internet posts can qualify as reliable sources for certain information."That could do with a bit of specifying, but is that the general idea, Tony? -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 21:50, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Sort of.I think it applies in more general cases, too, not just Usenet.But yes, I think the main problem here is that Crossmr is presenting it as black/white thing and many of us are going "whoa! if this is your interpretation of written policy, it's probably wrong. It seems to be far too absolute an exclusion to be useful in the real world." --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 21:57, 11 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>well, it is black and white.The problem is twofold - a) a contradiction both in WP:RS and between WP:RS and WP:V, and b) that WP:RS is unnecessarily strict when it comes to non-dead-tree-media.The former is easy to fix, and may, in fact, be fixed now.The latter, well, I'm awfully sick of the battle. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 22:01, 11 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>WP:V solves the contradiction by saying "Hey I'm king and thats the way it is." I think WP:V directly addresses this situation in saying that we need to verify that vladimir is a professionally published researcher in order for his post to be considered usable. Applying different standards to off-line and on-line topics leads to a dichotemy on wikipedia. You will have two types of articles, thoroughly researched and verified articles dealing with off-line content, and articles dealing with on-line activity where anyone with a heart beat can spend a day creating notability and sources for any random thing they want to include here.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 22:05, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But if you're drawing it from Usenet as a body of work, are you not putting forth original research? You're trying to give verifiability to something that has none by saying "Well there were a lot of posts about it" Thats fine. We can say the Lumber Cartel existed, but this posting about a supposed essay found on a site that no longer exists is being used to do more than just say the Lumber Cartel exists. I have no problem in using internet chatter to establish notability of a subject, if a lot of independent people are talking about it, its likely real and notable. But basing the supposed foundation of a group on an anonymous post referencing a non-existent site I don't think meets that threshold.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 22:01, 11 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Verifying something from multiple redundant independent sources isn't original research, if that's what you're asking about.It does seem to me that you're determined to strain on a gnat here.The Lumber Cartel document existed and if our verification standards say it didn't then our standards are badly tuned.Start from there and we can't go wrong. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>

<dd>Except that our verification of their existence can be had outside of usenet. The Jargon file, and a couple of news articles. The verification of that document is only verifiable from Usenet, from an anonymous post referencing a website that doesn't exist. Remember what WP:V says about inclusion being verifiabilty not truth. While I don't contest that this document likely did exist, we can't put forth that claim based on an anonymous usenet source.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 22:24, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you don't dispute that the document existed, and I'm sure very few people do, then Usenet is all we need as a source.You claim that it's "an anonymous usenet source", and if that's all there was I'd agree with you. I think what we have really is a large number of independent verifications via various Usenet and internet sources.That changes the game somewhat.Since there isn't any realistic challenge to this fact, we don't need extraordinary proof to establish it.Just like we wouldn't (or shouldn't) need extraordinary proof to justify pointing to the Torvalds/Tannenbaum discussions. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 23:45, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Don't use the word large to lend credibility to something that isn't there. There are a couple of sources outside usenet that mention the Lumber Cartel, they really only speak to its existence nothing else. you can't use one or two legitimate sources to justify writing 75% of an article off anonymous sources. I also said it likely existed, I wasn't there, I can't say, and that article isn't proof to me. It sounds to me like you're saying "a few of us know it was true, so we can base the article off that". Random internet user who somehow finds himself on that article won't really have anything credible to base his information on. I also object to your closing the AfD early, we went through this with DS yesterday and there was someone calling for delete not that long ago.

<dd>Tony, this is a bad habit of yours.Closing disputed discussions early is poor dispute resolution behavior, and tends to create bad will.Please refrain from doing this.There are a multitude of better ways you can address this situation, the best of which all include increased communication.I think Crossmr is making very good points, and I find the referencing on this article pretty sketchy.At the very least we deserve some thoughtful, unhurried discussion of the dissonance between how verifiability policy is written and how it's applied, for the benefit of future discussions.Reaching out and making productive communication happen is precisely the right thing to do here, and early closing is the best way to subvert the possibility of productive discussion in favor of heat-generating drama. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 05:04, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Also, it is unclear even whether or not we need to implement this; I can see it being a source of major conflict in POV disputes also, e.g. "We will have X in this article, because it was in the stable version...". I don't think we should be trialling its implementation until we have consensus that 1) the methodology it employs is correctly defined, and as well-developed as possible; and 2) that it should be implemented on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicholasTurnbull_9d8a.html" title="User:NicholasTurnbull">Nicholas<b>Turnbull</b></a> | <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENicholasTurnbull_45f8.html" title="User talk:NicholasTurnbull">(talk)</a> 21:07, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Frankly, the images I saw looked well over 100 years old and (if so) are public domain no matter what tag a web site slaps on it.(PD material can not be recaptured, and the work needed to digitize it and create a web site does not rise to the level of creative input needed to create a copyright.Personally, I would tag them as PD but note the source and a qualifier that the original source is not known. (actually, sloppy of the web site not to indicate).If the web site objects, we can remove pending identification of the source. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 04:41, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How can you tell by looking that the photos are over 100 years old? The subjects may well be, but a photographer still has a copyright claim on the creative elements of taking photos. In this instance that might be a weak claim on their part, but you cannot just claim that because the subject is old that no copyright exists. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User%7EPgk_d0c7.html" title="User:Pgk">pgk</a><sup>(<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk"><font color="mediumseagreen">talk</font></a>)</sup> 07:04, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Where the purpose of the photograph is to duplicate or substitute for the artwork, there is no copyright interest held by the photographer, since reproduction is essentially technical, not creative.This was a US Supreme Court case that has an article somewhere around here.If the underlying artwork is PD, then the uploads are PD, even if the source they are reproduced in (book, museum catalog, etc) is more recent. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 19:35, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My review has found that this user has repeatedly copied substantial amounts of text from external websites without acknowledgment or attribution, and nearly all of the 60 images he has uploaded are probably mistagged.I have blocked him for a week, with a promise to unblock him if he promises to take copyright seriously and help clean up his mess.I have also engaged him in conversation at his talk page.I will have to leave soon, so I would appreciate it if others would also help watch over this situation.<a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 05:15, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>While the images I looked at may have their origins over 100 years ago, clearly the diff you gave and the edit summary <i>(nobody owns history)</i> show that this user either does not understand copyright or is deliberately ignoring it. Block until he shows some sign of understanding and agreeing to follow our procedures, or is that too harsh. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 05:25, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Anwar has a history of doing useful contribs and then using it to "buy personal attack credits" so to speak, which can be seen from his activity on RfA (the comments that accompany his opposes), FAC, FLC etc, and also he always does reverts in POV disputes with "rv vandalism by ...." which is an oblique form of personal attack and has been warned many times.<b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">rant-line</a> 05:28, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>1) I'm not a vandal, and stand by my work today, and see also Freemasonry talk page for <i>my</i> good faith. 2) I'm <i>Mousescribe</i> - <i>Imacomp</i> is my Father (currently in Hospital) and I have the same IP address as him, etc. I've turned the other cheek, thus far to a tirade of personal abuse and "Tag Team" reverts to avoid technical 3RR whilst reverting my edits. I always try to explain my edits, working in good faith. I've tried to discuss, and try asking for cooperation in editing in a +ve way, without wikilawyering. Again see for yourself @ Freemasonry, and @ Freemasonry talk. Thanks for your time.

<dd>I really do not have a problem with him having a opinion, but that he has not learnt that he must try to gain consensus before doing large changes. I truly belive it is due to inexperience. I personaly propose to lessen the block to maybe 2 days and complement it with a strong warning and maybe assing somebody to him that is intersted in teaching him the principles.

<dd>Grenavitar has blocked me twice for moving the pages but he doesn’t understand that I discussed the moving of the pages before I actually made the changes. The first he blocked me and also accused me of copying the Article of Qasim ibn Hassan (he didn’t even give me a chance of clarifying myself). The first time he did it I thought that it was a mistake or he might misunderstood something. Now again he blocked me from editing at wikipedia for 2 days and during that time I can not even say anything to defend myself. I am not going to tolerate this any more, I want someone responsible to take action against Grenavitar. I believe that if a person thinks that he is always right is wrong himself.

<dd>I have warned Xed that this is the last time I will protect him.I have felt that since he is getting blocked for personal attacks on me, he should be given much more latitude than if he was treating anyone else in the same way... I am me, and somehow I signed up for this job in a way that other people have not.I do not mind criticism, and I do not mind trolling, in the way that other people might.But I am finished protecting him.I think I have done my fair share here to make sure that he can not with any plausibility claim that he is being blocked merely for expressing respectful dissent.If he engages in vicious personal attacks not based in facts but rather in falsehoods, well, at some point there is nothing more I can do to assist him.--<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> 16:58, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's what I figured about the username creation. Essjay, I'm sorry if I sounded outrageously lazy, but the problem is I've <i>never</i> known how to do range blocks. After reading all the don't-try-this-at-home-if-you-re-a-luser-because-you-could-really-do-some-damage warnings plastered over the range block information, I didn't try. So "just as I would before" <i>is</i> what I'm doing.

<dd>The simplest-to-do rangeblocks are /24's; in most cases, it gets what you want without doing too much damange. (A /24 is 256 addresses, everything from 12.34.56.0 - 12.34.56.255; you block 12.34.56.0/24 and it takes them all out.) I went ahead and pulled his range and blocked it for 24 hours; it's 213.112.235.0/24 in case you need it in the future. I put a note in the block reason directing questions about it to you. <tt>:)</tt> <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">(<small>Talk</small>)</font></a></span> 14:15, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>However</i>, it seems I was mistaken in thinking that Betacommand's bot had actually deleted the category -- it was the edit summary on "user contribution" list that misled me.The category has not been deleted, presumably because the admin who deleted the other categories under discussion was sensible enough to recognise that discussion was not concluded.User:Betacommand is now seeking a resolution, and I thank him for that, although I'm not sure that this is the best way to go about it.

<dd>I think if this were about my company I'd have complained too.It's extremely negative.I don't know much about that company, but I used their service a few years ago.Nothing special.Most of the version of the article prior to your stubification seemed to be the usual endless wank from blog sites.Maybe some of it is verifiable from reliable sources, but perhaps we've been used just a teensy bit by the bloggers, commercial competitors, etc. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 22:10, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am a wikipedian in good standing, and I stand by that article. The complainant is a bad-faith IP editor, who has as recently as today tried to bad-faith speedy-delete the article. The spamming of hotmail contact lists is what this site is known for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=hotmail+spam+sms.ac&amp;hl=en&amp;hs=VDQ&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;start=40&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=hotmail+spam+sms.ac&amp;hl=en&amp;hs=VDQ&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;start=40&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[126]</a>, and it is what drew me to look up the article many months ago. At the time, there was one anon-IP making many bad faith edits, up to and including blanking the article, and deleting peoples' messages on the talk page. There does need to be mention of that - it is notable. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThemindset_22b6.html" title="User:Themindset">Themindset</a> 22:29, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Unfortunately reliable sources tend to get legal threats and then remove the information. But I've dug up some info. Also, the sheer quantity of blogs (and, as I mentioned, screenshots) must have some relevance. I mean, if one guy on the street told me he say a naked man in clown-makeup running down the street, I wouldn't believe him.

<p>Spamming behavior is <i>always</i> going to be reported on online sources first and chiefly, not the New York Times. Since the "negative" allegations have to do with spamming, we should expect blogs and other online reportage to be the primary sources for this article. We should check them carefully for sourcing -- e.g. make sure that all the blogs are actually from different people, not sock puppets. Anyone who is denigrating blogs as a source for this information is throwing away the sources which are assured to be the most (a) timely, (b) primary [as in "primary source" as opposed to "secondary source"] and (c) technically accurate.</p>

<p>my usual IP is 81.96.242.176, I am <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKing_of_the_North_East_f9ad.html" title="User:King of the North East">User:King of the North East</a>, the administrator who blocked me is unresponsive (<a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonflySixtyseven_c6ee.html" title="User:DragonflySixtyseven">User:DragonflySixtyseven</a>).</p>
<p>I have outlined my case for the unblocking of my IP on my talk page and dragonfly's. Perhapsit might be a litte better if D67 took a little more time to investigate before blocking people, since the only thing I blanked was the table I accidentally put there 9 minutes b4. All I did was cut and paste the table from one page to another.</p>
<p>The category I was editing at the time is Listed Buildings in Leeds, it can be found at the bottom of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marshall%27s_Mill_d3d0.html" title="Marshall's Mill">Marshall's Mill</a>, I moved the table to <a href="../../../l/i/s/Listed_buildings_in_Leeds_1d2a.html" title="Listed buildings in Leeds">Listed buildings in Leeds</a> where I meant to put it in the 1st place. Take a look at the History of Marshalls Mill if you want some confirmation of the duality.</p>

He's got a point with some cases, but completely misses the point with others. I don't assume all copyvios come from the web, but I do expect a source when one is claimed and as far as I know I am entitled (obliged even) to ask for one. And I wasn't following him around with the intend to question or revert all his edits. I was just checking on the edits of a then anonymous contributor who's edits I found questionable at the time (I think it included one case of vandalism, but I could be wrong about that)</p>
<p>Anyway, instead of contacting me on my talk page, this user reverted my edits. Not really a big deal there, but the comment he posted on his userpage is, in my biased eyes, totally inappropriate. I don't like being called "somewhat ignorant" and think it's a personal attack.</p>
<p>Should this page be reverted/deleted or am I overreacting? - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 12:41, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To make my response more clear: If he is a troll (probally) he wants to see a big reaction from you. If you just leave it alone, most will ignore it, he will get board and leave. Nookdog 13:21, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
