<p>This phrase about the Dutch navy is not correct: "The Dutch navy is unique in that there is only one Admiral in the navy and it is the reigning sovereign. As a result, the highest rank one can achieve in the Dutch navy is Lieutenant Admiral. Also, the Dutch have only two ranks with the title of Admiral, excluding the sovereign." The rank of admiral doesn't exist anymore officially since 1956 and it was only given twice in the 19th century: first in 1839 by King William I who made his son, allready Secretary of State for War and Navy and commander-in-chief, admiral; and the second time somewhere in the 1880's of 1890's when prince Henry was appointed admiral 6 days before his dead by his brother, king William III. There is no law or rule that the rank can only be held by the sovereign, in fact the only two time the rank was used, it was not the king.</p>

<dd>I rewrote the whole Dutch section due to heavy POV and bad grammer. Im not at all sure of the info contianed within, though, and am trusting that to those who put it in the article. <b>BTW</b>- What is the translation of "Schout bij Nacht"? That doesnt seem to me to look like any kind of Admiral rank. Also Nacht means night? "Night Admiral"? We need a Dutch Speaker to tell us. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 02:43, 30 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>Schout bij Nacht</b> originates from the 16th century (or even before). <b>Schout</b> is often translated with "bailiff" or "sheriff". There is a link with the (old) verb "schouwen" wich means "to watch" or "to look after". So, the "Schout-bij-nacht" (<i>Sheriff-at-Night</i> / <i>Watch-at-Night</i>) was the person who supervised the ship by night when the captain was asleep. Later he became the commanding officer of the fleet or a squadron at night when the (vice-) admiral was asleep. And somewhere in the 17th century he was associated with the rear squadron of a battle fleet (comparable to the English rear-admiral). It is an Admiral rank, he uses the same insignia (with 2 stars) as vice-admiral (3 stars) and lieutenant-admiral (4 stars).</dd>
<dd>The rank of <b>admiraal</b> (not 5 stars, but crossed batons) does not exist anymore. It can still be found in navy flag-protocols (tradition&#160;?), but not in goverment decrees since 1956 (but tradition still says that the rank can only be given to a prince of the royal family).</dd>
<dd>Besides two royal princes with the rank in the 19th century there is another royal link: in the 18th century it was ruled that the <b>stadhouder</b> (<i>viceroy</i> or <i>substitute-ruler</i>), a remarkable function in the Dutch Republic, was appointed <b>admiraal-generaal</b> of the navy and <b>kapitein-generaal</b> (<i>captain-general</i>) of the army. But most laws and rules regarding institutions of the Dutch Republic were abolished in the French era (1795-1813) and after the establishment of the Kingdom of the Netherlands (1813).</dd>

<p>I don't see the point of this section. Its authors seem to have gathered as many variations on the rank of admiral from different navies as they can find (plus at least one rank that never actually existed), then tried to put them in the order they would rank in a hypothetical navy that had the lot. Even if one accepts the validity of the exercise (which is undermined by the fact that rank titles have had different meanings in different times and places: e.g., Admiral in the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Netherlands_Navy_af92.html" title="Royal Netherlands Navy">Royal Netherlands Navy</a> corresponds to Fleet Admiral in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Navy_d2ed.html" title="United States Navy">USN</a>, while a <i><a href="../../../k/r/i/Kriegsmarine.html" title="Kriegsmarine">Kriegsmarine</a></i> Admiral is <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparative_military_ranks_of_World_War_II_7f65.html" title="Comparative military ranks of World War II">generally considered</a> to have ranked with a USN <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vice_Admiral_fa03.html" title="Vice Admiral">Vice Admiral</a>), some of the placings are problematic at best.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../a/d/m/Admiral_of_the_Fleet_9640.html" title="Admiral of the Fleet">Admiral of the Fleet</a> is the equivalent of the USN Fleet Admiral in the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Navy_80f7.html" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a> (and other navies), and belongs on the same line.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag_Admiral_e30a.html" title="Flag Admiral">Flag Admiral</a> never existed. It was proposed in 1945 as a rank in the USN above Fleet Admiral; however, it was never adopted. If it is to be included, it should be on the same line as <a href="../../../a/d/m/Admiral_of_the_Navy_1690.html" title="Admiral of the Navy">Admiral of the Navy</a>, to which it is considered an equivalent.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../l/i/e/Lieutenant_Admiral_bf6b.html" title="Lieutenant Admiral">Lieutenant Admiral</a> is not just a variation on <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vice_Admiral_fa03.html" title="Vice Admiral">Vice Admiral</a>; it is a separate rank in the Royal Netherlands Navy, between Admiral and Vice Admiral.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../c/o/u/Counter_Admiral_d083.html" title="Counter Admiral">Counter Admiral</a> is an alternative rendering of Ger. <i>Konteradmiral</i>, Fr. <i>Contre-amiral</i>, etc., which are usually translated as Rear Admiral; Counter Admiral and Rear Admiral should thus be on the same line.</li>

<li><a href="../../../c/o/m/Commodore_Admiral_2e21.html" title="Commodore Admiral">Commodore Admiral</a> was a short-lived USN rank immediately below Rear Admiral; it is thus the equivalent of Flotilla Admiral (Ger. <i>Flotillenadmiral</i>), and belongs on the same line.</li>

<p>So, if we have to have the table, it should more like this:</p>

<p>This is still less than satisfactory, for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>General Admiral was a <i>Kriegsmarine</i> rank, between Grand Admiral and Admiral; there is some dispute over whether this should be treated as ranking between the USN Fleet Admiral and Admiral, or whether it should be treated as the equivalent of a USN Admiral (making a KM Admiral = USN Vice Admiral, KM Vice Admiral = USN Rear Admiral Upper Half, &amp; KM Rear/Counter Admiral = USN Rear Admiral Lower Half).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Admiral in the Royal Netherlands Navy equates to a USN Fleet Admiral, &amp; Lieutenant Admiral to a USN Admiral.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Rear Admiral in the USN has since 1985 been split into two separate ranks, Rear Admiral Upper Half and Rear Admiral Lower Half; the former corresponds to Rear Admiral in most other navies, the latter to Flotilla Admiral (or <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commodore_%28rank%29.html" title="Commodore (rank)">Commodore</a>).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Port Admirals appear not to have been admirals at all, but senior captains.</li>
</ul>
<p>This would give us a table like this:</p>

<p>I guess if the Admirals from the different countries were all in the same room at the same time, it would matter who saluted who. It also comes to play in joint-international military operations with who has tactical control of a group fo ships from more than one country. I've served in task forces with U.S., Japanese, and South Korean ships. That was an issue as to which Admiral would have taccon of the whole group. Also, in World War II, the matter came up during surrender ceremonies where General Admiral von Friedeburg went to British HQ and back then the two sides were saluting enemy officers (try that today with Iraqi POWs!). In any event, the British actually <i>said</i> General Admiral was senior to Admiral. Some U.S. text books list it as "a rank between a full Admiral and Fleet Admiral".</p>
<p>I like the suggestions on these tables and I would say just go for it and make the changes in the article. I think the table should say, without a soubt, since this is an article about all Admiral ranks and a comparative table is something that the article needs. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 16:34, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I take your point about the importance of precedence between officers of different navies, whether in determining the chain of command or for matters of ceremony or protocol. But as I pointed out, the table as it stands is not reliable. It implies (correctly, according to the information you've supplied), that a <i>Kriegsmarine</i> General Admiral outranked a USN or RN Admiral; however, it also implies that the same German General Admiral would outrank an <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Netherlands_Navy_af92.html" title="Royal Netherlands Navy">RNN</a> Admiral, when the opposite is in fact true. The table could be expanded to take these kinds of things into account, but as you've said, it would make it significantly more complicated. Furthermore, it woud duplicate a number of the articles listed at <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparative_military_ranks.html" title="Comparative military ranks">Comparative military ranks</a> — in particular <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparative_military_ranks_of_World_War_I_1e2e.html" title="Comparative military ranks of World War I">Comparative military ranks of World War I</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparative_military_ranks_of_World_War_II_7f65.html" title="Comparative military ranks of World War II">World War II</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_and_US_military_ranks_compared_8594.html" title="British and US military ranks compared">British and US military ranks compared</a>, and <a href="../../../r/a/n/Ranks_and_insignia_of_NATO_8256.html" title="Ranks and insignia of NATO">Ranks and insignia of NATO</a>.</dd>

<dd>Almost certainly not. The King (when there is one) holds the ranks of Field Marshal, Admiral of the Fleet and Marshal of the Royal Air Force in the UK, and it seems to me extremely unlikely that the British Government would be willing to accept that a rank in another country was senior to that held by the Sovereign. They would almost certainly have been treated as equivalent to Field Marshals and Admirals of the Fleet. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProteus_e939.html" title="User:Proteus">Proteus</a> <a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProteus_c830.html" title="User talk:Proteus">(Talk)</a> 16:50, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Admiral is a word from the Arabic term Amir-al-bahr (commander of the sea). Crusaders learned the term during their encounters with the Arabs, perhaps as early as the 11th century. The Sicilians and later Genoese took the first two parts of the term and used them as one word, amiral.</i></p>
<p>Changed 'lord of the bay' to 'commander of the sea', which is the correct translation of the Arabic. (Amir was originally a generic word for a commander in the armies of the very early Islamic period, although today it has more of the import of a minor sort of royalty, as the Amir of Kuwait, etc.; 'bahr' can only mean 'sea' or 'ocean').</p>
<p>The rest of the passage is not quite right - the title was first adopted by the Norman kingdom of Sicily in the last few decades of the 11th century, based on the useage of the dispossesed Arab rulers of the island. (I.e., it's incorrect to cite the Crusaders).</p>

<p>This is an inaccurate, confusing mess.</p>
<ul>
<li>Admiral of the Navy was held by exactly one person, long since dead. Although U.S. Navy tradition may hold that it is senior to the rank of Fleet Admiral, it was created as an equivalent to the British Admiral of the Fleet, the German Grand Admiral, the Russian General Admiral, etc.; I doubt if any British Admiral of the Fleet considered Dewey his senior.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Flag Admiral never existed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Grand Admiral may have outranked General Admiral in the German Navy: however, the German Grand Admiral and the Russian General Admiral were equivalent ranks. In any case, both are defunct.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Lieutenant Admiral is unique (as far as I know) to the Dutch Navy, and is the equivalent of plain Admiral in other navies; it is not an intermediate rank between (four-star) admiral and (three-star) vice-admiral.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Counter Admiral is an alternative translation of ranks usually rendered as Rear Admiral (e.g. the French <i>Contre-Amiral</i>), rather than a distinct rank.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Commodore Admiral existed for less than a year in exactly one navy (albeit the world's biggest): only a handful of people ever held it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Port Admiral is a position, not a rank: historically it may have been held by a senior captain, but these days is likely to be an actual admiral of some grade.</li>
</ul>
<p>What is this table meant to achieve? If it's a clear depiction of the relative ranking of the most common grades of admiral, it fails for the reasons, and should be replaced with a simple list of the near-universal admiral/vice admiral/rear admiral.</p>
<p>If, however, it's supposed to be a kitchen-sink collection of every variation of admiral ever, levered into some strained notional order of precedence, we need to add a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lord High Admiral;</li>
<li>Vice Admiral of the Fleet;</li>
<li>Rear Admiral of the Fleet;</li>
<li>Admiral/Vice Admiral/Rear Admiral of the Red/White/Blue;</li>
<li>Rear Admiral without distinction of squadron;</li>

On another point, <a href="../../../a/d/m/Admiral_of_the_Navy_1690.html" title="Admiral of the Navy">Admiral of the Navy</a> can be argued to be a generic term for a senior Admiral of a naval service. Its common to see in literature and military history about "Admiral of the Navy so-and-so" even if they don't actually have a <i>rank</i> that is Admiral of the Navy. I think it should stay in the table to indicate a senior most Admiral position as well as a rank. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 17:38, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Taking your points in order:
<ul>
<li>It's not the article as a whole I'm talking about, it's the seniority table. Hence the comment's heading.</li>
<li>The table is inaccurate: see the list above. "Misleading" may be a better word than confusing, though inaccurate information can and does confuse. "Mess" is, I agree, subjective (though I feel its use here is justifiable).</li>
<li>If it wasn't clear from my edit summary, it is specifically the inclusion of the non-rank of Flag Admiral that I regard as absurd. The rank never existed, even on paper. Including it in a list of actual grades of admiral is a nonsense.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>That is incorrect. Flag Admiral did exist on paper. It was written up as a proposal and the proposal was forwarded to the War Department at the end of 1944.

Do not confuse disagreement and criticism with animosity.</li>
<li>I'm confused by your comment about Admiral of the Navy.
<ul>
<li>Are you saying that Admiral of the Navy is a conventional English translation of a rank or ranks found in some non-English-speaking navies?</li>
<li>If so, which navies? What equivalence does it have to U.S.N. or R.N. ranks — is it a four-star, five-star, or "six-star" rank?</li>

<ul>
<li>I know of at least five texts which use the term "<a href="../../../a/d/m/Admiral_of_the_Navy_1690.html" title="Admiral of the Navy">Admiral of the Navy</a>" to describe the top Admiral of a service (I dont have time to list them all right now).

<li>In U.S. Naval tradition, Admiral of the Navy outranks Fleet Admiral. The rank was only ever held by one U.S. officer, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Dewey_4a7a.html" title="George Dewey">George Dewey</a>; in 1945, the U.S. Navy considered creating the equivalent rank of <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag_Admiral_e30a.html" title="Flag Admiral">Flag Admiral</a>, but nothing came of the proposal.</li>
<li>In the <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_Russian_Navy_37fa.html" title="Imperial Russian Navy">Imperial Russian Navy</a>, General Admiral was the equivalent of an Admiral of the Fleet. The German <a href="../../../k/r/i/Kriegsmarine.html" title="Kriegsmarine">Kriegsmarine</a>, however, had both General Admiral and Grand Admiral ranks: Grand Admiral was the senior, equivalent to an Admiral of the Fleet; General Admiral ranked between Admiral and Grand Admiral, and had no exact equivalent elsewhere.</li>
<li>The U.S. Navy has two grades of Rear Admiral (Rear Admiral Upper Half and Rear Admiral Lower Half): the latter is the equivalent of a Flotilla Admiral.</li>
<li>Counter Admiral is an alternative rendering of ranks more commonly translated "Rear Admiral": e.g., the French <i>Contre-amiral</i>.</li>
<li>This rank is rare; many navies have an equivalent rank of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commodore.html" title="Commodore">Commodore</a> in this position. Commodores are not considered to be Admirals: depending on the navy, they may or may not be considered <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag_Officer_dd83.html" title="Flag Officer">Flag Officers</a>. For eleven months in the 1980s, the U.S. Navy had the hybrid rank of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commodore_Admiral_2e21.html" title="Commodore Admiral">Commodore Admiral</a>, before dividing the rank of Rear Admiral as described above.</li>
</ol>
<p>Flag ranks in the <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_Navy_7fc9.html" title="Dutch Navy">Dutch Navy</a> have some unique features that make them difficult to fit in the table above:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Admiraal</i> (Admiral) is a five-star rank, corresponding to Fleet Admiral or Admiral of the Fleet;</li>
<li>the equivalent of plain Admiral is <i>Luitenant Admiraal</i> (<a href="../../../l/i/e/Lieutenant_Admiral_bf6b.html" title="Lieutenant Admiral">Lieutenant Admiral</a>);</li>
<li>the equivalent of Rear Admiral is <i><a href="../../../s/c/h/Schout-bij-nacht.html" title="Schout-bij-nacht">Schout-bij-nacht</a></i>, which does not readily translate into English; see its article for more information.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Royal Navy has the position (not rank) of <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_Admiral_137f.html" title="Port Admiral">Port Admiral</a>; historically, this was often a senior <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain.html" title="Captain">captain</a> rather than an admiral proper.</p>
<p>Several <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_fiction.html" title="Science fiction">science fiction</a> sources also give mention of the additional Admiral ranks of <a href="../../../s/e/c/Sector_Admiral_754f.html" title="Sector Admiral">Sector Admiral</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_Admiral_be3c.html" title="High Admiral">High Admiral</a>, and Branch Admiral. None of these fictional Admiral ranks have ever been used, however, in an actual real world Navy. The rank of <a href="../../../f/l/e/Fleet_Admiral_%28SCIFI%29_7ad9.html" title="Fleet Admiral (SCIFI)">Fleet Admiral</a> is also common in science fiction sources.</p>

<dd>There was a discussion above about what would happen if all the Admirals were in the same room who would sit at the head of the table. I think that is what the table is trying to demonstrate. It simple points out that if an Admiral of the Fleet and a Rear Admiral were in the same room, the Ad Fleet would probably be senior and that a Commodore Admiral is junior to a Vice Admiral, etc, etc. The table, I feel serves to show all Admiral ranks from several periods and compare them in one place. We then have country specfic articles for such extensions to such common ranks such as <a href="../../../a/d/m/Admiral_of_the_Fleet_of_the_Soviet_Union_59fd.html" title="Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union">Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union</a>.

<dd>The table still can't meet that objective, as it can't allow for differences in time and place without descending into an unholy mess.

<p>Surely admiral is not a proper noun and should not be capitalised throughout. Only when part of a specific name. -- <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeardo_5fe6.html" title="User:Beardo">Beardo</a> 11:19, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I will mark this one as fact required....</p>
<p>ADMIRAL Appliances were sold in the US by Admiral Radio, and in Canada by Canadian Admiral Corp. Wards radios used "AIRLINE" as a brand. see for example <a href="http://www.scripophily.net/adcode1.html" class="external free" title="http://www.scripophily.net/adcode1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.scripophily.net/adcode1.html</a> and <a href="http://www.geocities.com/rxtxtubes/pa01077.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.com/rxtxtubes/pa01077.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/rxtxtubes/pa01077.htm</a> cmacd 19:14, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Does anybody know if 1- or 2-star admirals -- from any navy -- are ever assigned to single-ship commands? I'm not talking here about commanding squadrons from a flagship; I'm referring to commanding a single vessel on a day-to-day basis, or commanding a mission from a single ship. <a href="../../../s/a/c/User%7ESacxpert_3406.html" title="User:Sacxpert">Sacxpert</a> 07:22, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
