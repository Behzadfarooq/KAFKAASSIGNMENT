<dd>And of course, there's a grain of truth in their criticism. We do have a slight leftist systemic bias, in my opinion. And anyone with a modem can use us to rewrite history, and people do, leftwingers and rightwingers, though thankfully in most cases it doesn't stay around. I don't think it's reasonable to expect never to receive any bad press, and to ask FOX to refrain from giving it to us amounts to censorship. Let's just get used to and admit to our limitations. Then the bad press will be water off a ducks back, and we can get back to doing the best we can to overcome those limitations and writing our encyclopedia. -<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_sig_226e.html" title="User:Lethe/sig">lethe</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_sig_fced.html" title="User talk:Lethe/sig">talk</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" rel="nofollow">+</a></sup> 02:01, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

He's often described himself in the past as a libertarian (&amp; has been very explicit that it is spelled with a small "L") -- which only makes their own bias all the more comical.

<p>Wikipedia is competition to the media outlets. When a breaking story hits, some people that used to go to a media website or TV for details may now go to us for details. I suspect media outlets on all points of the political spectrum see us as competion, and therefore as a good target to be attacked. I doubt their political POV has much to do with their basic attitude about Wikipedia. <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_ac1a.html" title="User:NoSeptember"><font color="green"><b>NoSeptember</b></font></a> <a href="../../../n/o/s/User_talk%7ENoSeptember_6dda.html" title="User talk:NoSeptember"><font color="green"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></font></a></p>

<dd>Alienus is not on any sort of civility probation. He has apologised and it has been accepted. At the moment the block seems to be being enforced because he won't admit he intended to offend. He claims it was a badly worded edit summary that did not clearly make the point that <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakew_2ade.html" title="User:Jakew">Jakew</a> does not agree with his view on <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circumcision.html" title="Circumcision">Circumcision</a>. At the moment he is being punished for not saying what others want to hear regardless of the truth.

<dd>If you want to get right down to it, the fact is that Alienus is well aware of these policies, yet he keeps violating them.

<dd>Sophia, he tried to insert POV in an article, ignored my <a href="../../../m/u/t/Talk%7EMutilation_b6aa.html" title="Talk:Mutilation">Talk:Mutilation</a> explanation of why this was unacceptable (which was stated in general terms, and did not refer to my anatomy) and reverted, with the edit summary "rv whitewashing; the foreskin is functional, except in the case of Jakew's". In doing so, he a) assumed bad faith ('whitewashing'), in spite of a perfectly reasonable explanation of the policy problems with his edit, b) took a general issue and misrepresented it as a discussion about my body, and c) even if was not intended as a personal attack, it is wholly inappropriate to comment on another editor's genitals in an edit summary. He has apologised but admits no wrongdoing.</dd>

<dd>Fair enough. If the community feels a user who is trying to reform and made what he contests is a genuine mistake deserves a one week block then there is nothing more to add. To me the test of integrity of a system is how it deals with the least liked people which is why I have been following this one through. I will state that I think this decision is based on personality rather than facts and will ask how we are to encourage editors to behave civilly if the punishment for an offence is the same as for a mistake? <a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESOPHIA_915a.html" title="User:SOPHIA"><font color="purple"><b>Soph</b></font></a><a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESOPHIA_Esperanza_9ce5.html" title="User:SOPHIA/Esperanza"><font color="green"><b>i</b></font></a><font color="purple"><b>a</b></font><a href="../../../s/o/p/User_talk%7ESOPHIA_c099.html" title="User talk:SOPHIA"><small><font color="purple"><sup><i>Gilraen</i></sup></font></small></a> <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArchola_The_Centrist_Fellowship_1c2b.html" title="User:Archola/The Centrist Fellowship"><small><font color="blue"><sup><i>of Dorthonion</i></sup></font></small></a> 23:02, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have not looked at the history of all the circumcision-related articles that Jayjg and Alienus may or may not have edited together, but have looked briefly at the history of the one that DanBlackham cited. I can't say that I consider the fact that Alienus reverted Jayjg's 2 May contributions on 6 May makes Jayjg an "involved admin". In fact, Jayjg did not revert back to his own version; he did not contribute to an edit war. Being on the opposite side on some issues is not the same as being involved in a personal dispute. I see <a href="../../../j/e/s/Talk%7EJesus_Archive_39_3d96.html#Final_Candidates" title="Talk:Jesus/Archive 39">here</a> that Jayjg voted <i>the same way</i> as Alienus on article content, and the opposite way from me. Actually, I can't recall ever being on the same side as Jayjg on article content, but don't feel that there's any reason why I couldn't block him (or he me) for personal attacks in the (extremely) unlikely event that it proved to be necessary.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>So are they involved in a <i>personal</i> dispute, independently of Alienus's 6 May revert? If I look at Alienus's contributions, I see a lot of attacks against various administrators, Jayjg being only <i>one</i> of his targets (and certainly not the main one). I see no evidence of Jayjg responding in kind, or indeed of taking any notice. We have had problems in the past with aggressive users insulting so many admins that they were able to claim that no admin who wanted to block them was neutral. In fact, I recall one user (now banned) who requested arbitration against an admin who had blocked him for really vile personal attacks against another admin, and who announced that two of the arbitrators would have to recuse themselves because he had had run-ins with them. One of the arbitrators accepted the case with the words: <i>"Accept (Picking a fight with an arbitrator doesn't result in recusal)"</i>. Back to Alienus, if we take <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Alienus&amp;diff=49956074&amp;oldid=49950208" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Alienus&amp;diff=49956074&amp;oldid=49950208" rel="nofollow">these</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Alienus&amp;diff=49971766&amp;oldid=49956074" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Alienus&amp;diff=49971766&amp;oldid=49956074" rel="nofollow">three</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Alienus&amp;diff=49972117&amp;oldid=49971766" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Alienus&amp;diff=49972117&amp;oldid=49971766" rel="nofollow">diffs</a>, do we now say that Jareth may never block Alienus in the future? I personally would <i>not</i> feel comfortable blocking Alienus: I think he has been in dispute with me far more than with Jayjg. But I do feel that once an editor has been rude to more than five administrators, the X-isn't-allowed-to-block-me-because-he-has-a-grudge-against-me argument becomes less and less convincing. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 09:48, 11 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Indeed. The blocking policy is clear that: "Use of blocks to gain an advantage in a content dispute is strictly prohibited. That is, sysops must not block editors with whom they are currently engaged in a content dispute." Jayjg did not gain an advantage in a content dispute, and there's no question that Alienus made a personal attack <i>on the very day that he returned from a week's block for personal attacks</i>, so there's no reason to question this block that I can see. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 10:27, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If an approximate measurement of '5,000 miles' is given it doesn't really make sense to show that as; 8046.72&#160;<a href="../../../k/i/l/Kilometre.html" title="Kilometre">km</a> or with the metric first followed by the imperial... the non-round number and decimals give the impression of an exact measurement instead of an approximant. If a measurement was originally taken in 'cubits' it would be misleading to pick one of the common estimates of that length and display the measurement in metric/imperial. Basically, the measurement given in a source should probably be shown first or even alone in some cases. That said, if it is a straightforward constant that can accurately be displayed in different units then I think metric first followed by imperial strikes the best balance between international and local standards. The category above has templates for performing these conversions now (I used {{subst:conv-dist|5000|mi|km|3}} to produce the kilometer conversion above) so it should be fairly easy to include both types of units where appropriate and put them in whatever order makes sense. With the train gauge... I believe the original standard was set in imperial units and thus I'd think that would be the proper measurement to show first, but it probably doesn't matter much so long as both are given. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBDunkerson</a> 11:25, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Generally speaking, the original measurement or definition should be first and any conversions second. In this case, since standard gauge was originally defined in the Imperial system, that measurement should go first. Conversions often lose accuracy and it's often good to know the original measurement system used in any case. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorven_1e3d.html" title="User:Morven">Matthew Brown (Morven)</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorven_2a5f.html" title="User talk:Morven">T</a>:<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Morven_de06.html" title="Special:Contributions/Morven">C</a>) 23:27, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is no requirement to discuss before making changes, <b>Be Bold!</b> is our motto! I still suggest asking the user <b>politely</b> about their edits, accusing someone of vandalism in your first message to them isn't exactly going to make them want to reply!

<p>Hi folks. If this is no big deal, please excuse the interruption. However, it's my understanding that one general rule-of-thumb is that admins should not delete or otherwise 'administer' pages on which they have contributed substantively as editors. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhil_Sandifer_4f7e.html" title="User talk:Phil Sandifer">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Phil_Sandifer_5456.html" title="Special:Contributions/Phil Sandifer">contribs</a>) has just done so, on an AfD brought by a user. Phil voted 'speedy keep', another admin marked it as a 'speedy keep', and then Phil deleted the AfD. I'd like to get the response of some admins (from a policy perspective, not a 'Phil under attack' perspective) to whether such activity in essence amounts to unfair or excessive use of an admin's powers during the course of their routine editing of Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanFreisling_b27b.html" title="User:RyanFreisling">User:RyanFreisling</a> <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanFreisling_aab0.html" title="User talk:RyanFreisling">@</a> 01:42, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If it was just the nomination that was deleted I'd have had no problem with it. But a number of editors had already voiced thier opposition to the AfD, and the AfD was closed as a speedy keep. It's the record of the rejection of the AfD that I value and object to being deleted. However, I will say this is not a huge deal for me.

<p>Look, folks, I agree, too, but it's nice to have <i>some</i> consideration of the AfD voters who aren't monitoring the block logs. It would be a little bit more than courteous to put a note on the AfD page, or the <b>AfD Log</b> page letting folks know that the nomination had been done by a blocked user. It would have prevented some confusion and potential offense. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:21, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It may not <i>technically</i> have been a G5, but the nomination was clearly in bad faith. To prevent trolling, these things should be deleted--otherwise, a vandal could nominate any article for deletion and say "But your policy says you have to keep records, so you can't delete it!"

<dd>But you didn't just clean up his vandalism, Phil. You also deleted the responses to the AfD, and the record of the community consensus on the matter. Again, if you'd just deleted his nomination when he'd made it, I'd have had absolutely no problem with it. But a number of editors voiced their opinions in that AfD. So all I'm saying is that it would have been nice to have had a record of that... even if the AfD itself was originally initiated in bad faith. After all, I do believe most AfDs that result in a speedy keep are usually kept for posterity on Wikipedia, are they not? -- <a href="../../../n/o/o/User%7ENoosphere_6ec7.html" title="User:Noosphere">noosph</a><a href="../../../n/o/o/User%7ENoosphere_Esperanza_2f72.html" title="User:Noosphere/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../n/o/o/User%7ENoosphere_6ec7.html" title="User:Noosphere">re</a> 03:49, 11 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I can agree with that insofar is would not have done much damage to keep the AfD (though I fear such actions would futher encourage trolls rather than deter them). Nonetheless, I don't think Phil's actions were in any way wrong, and it's not a deletion that I would contest. And I would also argue that even an AfD that resulted in speedy keep could reflect poorly upon an article, in that someone felt the need to nominate it in the first place. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 03:56, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A speedy keep is rarely (ever?) the result of a long and drawn-out process in which a great number of editors participate. But a result of a speedy keep does demonstrate that there was enough consensus for the AfD to be rejected virtually immediately. I believe a record of such an event is valuable. But I won't belabor the point further. It's done. And the consensus here seems to be that Phil did nothing wrong by deleting the AfD, even though it may not have been done strictly according to the rules. I'll accept that and move on. As I said before, this is not a huge deal for me. -- <a href="../../../n/o/o/User%7ENoosphere_6ec7.html" title="User:Noosphere">noosph</a><a href="../../../n/o/o/User%7ENoosphere_Esperanza_2f72.html" title="User:Noosphere/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../n/o/o/User%7ENoosphere_6ec7.html" title="User:Noosphere">re</a> 04:56, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Could someone look into <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJachin_f2fc.html" title="User:Jachin">User:Jachin</a> and talk page history?

<p>He's now placed a message on his talk page stating "NOTICE: Messages placed on this page are deleted at my discretion." I definatly agree now that this is the start of something problematic. He should know that warnings should not be deleted so off-the-cuff, as it makes it very hard to judge whether the user's been warned previously. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 01:19, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just a comment - if we want to continue making an issue of 'removal of warnings' then it should be written into the policies. Currently this view is founded on <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVAND_6593.html" title="WP:VAND">WP:VAND</a>, which says only that removing <b>vandalism</b> warnings is considered vandalism, and <a href="../../../t/a/l/WP%7ETALK_766c.html" title="WP:TALK">WP:TALK</a> which says that removing messages without responding may be considered "hostile" or 'uncivil'... <i>but</i> that restoring such removed messages is "not proper" and edit warring. That's pretty weak grounds on which to base a claim that 'all warnings must be retained'... it actually makes the repeated restoration of such (as has been done) a blockable offense.</dd>
<dd>That said - I'm not a big fan of this approach. Nobody likes 'being scolded' and then being told that you have to keep the 'scarlet letter' on <i>your</i> talk page in perpetuity? It looks like, and sometimes <i>is</i>, harrassment. They've been warned. They saw the message. Mission accomplished. Forcing them to keep warnings on their talk page for every visitor on completely unrelated issues to see is unneccessarily punitive. The <i>only</i> 'plus' from such is to allow admins to see that the person has received prior warnings, but I don't think that's worth antagonizing people further. We can always check the history... use edit summaries like 'Warning: &lt;whatever&gt;' and they'll be easy to pick out. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBDunkerson</a> 11:45, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see that someone has been out at the barn wall with a can of paint again. Setting aside that it's usually a good idea to make the proposal <i>before</i> changing policy pages... this <b>is</b> still just a proposal. Which I (amongst others) strongly disagree with. The minor benefit of 'making it easier to see that the user has been warned before' is far outweighed by the negative effects of the antagonism inherent in the proposed procedure. Warnings ought to be friendly reminders or notifications of 'the rules' rather than scarlet letters used to humiliate people. There is no epidemic of people getting away with repeated policy violations because no one notices that they have done it before... and thus no need for this policy change. We have plenty of tools for keeping track of 'troublemakers' currently without needing to add one which causes more problems than it solves. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBDunkerson</a> 12:59, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I think there is a big difference between having to retain scarlet letters and <i>immediately</i> transferring selectively to archives. The question is whether we're talking about normal talk page behavior and an overt intent to mislead. It's a judgment call. Until the issue that generates the "warnings" gets up to RFC or mediation level, the transferring to archives is just a symptom. Once there is an RFC or RFar or Mediation attempt, I would say that those assessing behavior should see the transferring to archives and assess whether or not it is a piece of evidence. For me, it would be a heavily weighted piece of evidence of an intent to operate outside of consensus and against policy, whether the archiving were itself an offense or not. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:41, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm probably in the minority here, but I'd rather see him blocked for something he actually did wrong. There were earlier complaints that look well justified, and he's been blocked before.

<dd>Whether you want to call this wikistalking or disruption, I support a short cooling off for him. He's been acting out in similar ways for long enough that I've certainly noticed it. The issue isn't that he's making bad edits (necessarily, though some of them might be), it's that he's deliberately, purposefully inserting himself practically everywhere SlimVirgin edits, presumably as some form of payback for whatever his beef is with her. It's just not acceptable behavior. · <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0">Ka</a><a href="../../../j/c/a/User%7EJCarriker_TC_c598.html" title="User:JCarriker/TC">t</a><a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0">efan0</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKatefan0_4566.html" title="User talk:Katefan0">(scribble)</a></sup>/<small><a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_Poll_b43b.html" title="User:Katefan0/Poll">poll</a></small> 16:21, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I find it a horribly bad precedent to set that sensible edits can be considered wikistalking due to our speculation about bad motives behind it. I see reasonable behavior in his latest edits. If he was leaving edit summaries like "revert idiotic edit by &gt;whoever&lt;" or something, I would consider that strong evidence of stalking, but I don't see anything like that. If he was starting to get the hint, we're not helping by throwing another block at him. If he's going to be blocked for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hamas&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=52436538" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hamas&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=52436538" rel="nofollow">harmless edits</a>, he cannot be an editor- he should be community banned instead. If a community ban is what's really going on here, let's be up front about it. All I see so far is people continuing to take him to task for which articles he's edited, and I find that unhelpful- it's only going to reinforce his belief that he's being unjustifiably picked on. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 16:50, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with Friday (Mccready emailed me too, BTW). There is <b>no justification whatsoever</b> for blocking him for the edit on <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamas.html" title="Hamas">Hamas</a> that Friday linked to. In my opinion, the reason why someone is editing a particular article is not important at all. If they're harassing someone and/or attacking them constantly, then I think they should be blocked (and banned and get their backsides kicked), but if 'wikistalking' means editing the same articles as someone else (as long as the 'stalker' is being civil), then I can't see a problem with it. - ulayiti <font color="#226B22"><small>(talk)</small></font> 17:58, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>By Jayjg's own explanation here, the wikistalking was a few days ago. Then he stopped. The <i>only</i> evidence provided that he's been stalking again is that Hamas diff- which clearly shows a harmless edit, yet Jayjg still used it as justfication for a block. Are we punishing him for what he did a few days ago, or is there an ongoing problem here?

<dd>You keep saying "harmless edit" as if that makes a difference. The harm was in the <i>stalking</i>, not the edit.

<p>I don't have much involvement in articles that SlimVirgin edits, but even I have noticed that Mcready was stalking her. I can understand Friday's point about setting a precedent by blocking someone for sensible edits that just happen to be on the same article that another editor has edited. But I think it could be even more dangerous <i>not</i> to be allowed to block for that. I've seen a lot of wiki-stalking since I arrived here, and on many occasions the stalker denied it — explaining that he had found the article by clicking "recent changes", or by following a link from another article, etc. Since this is something that we can never prove, a block seems quite appropriate when it's "beyond reasonable doubt". If someone stalks another editor ninety-nine times, and then makes an innocent edit on the hundredeth time, without realizing that his opponent has just edited it, well, he doesn't really have grounds to complain if he gets blocked, does he? I'm sure that finding that someone you've had a dispute with has just followed you to yet another article must be quite creepy and must sap a lot of the joy out of editing Wikipedia. We need to have the ability to put a stop to it, and if the block is an unfair one (which I don't think to be the case here), by all means let's review it at this noticeboard. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 17:43, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The crime of wikistalking is not editing the same articles as another editor, it is harassing them.

<dd>Exactly the sort of behavior that's apparently continued until today. Jayjg warned Mccready that if he stalked SlimVirgin to one more article he'd be blocked. He did it again, therefore was blocked. Friday argues that Jayjg has essentially produced one edit and that can't be used to justify "stalking," and in another instance I'd probably agree. But this one edit was the one step over the line it took for a block (for which he was warned). It was bound to happen if he continued this behavior; good faith isn't limitless. · <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0">Ka</a><a href="../../../j/c/a/User%7EJCarriker_TC_c598.html" title="User:JCarriker/TC">t</a><a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0">efan0</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKatefan0_4566.html" title="User talk:Katefan0">(scribble)</a></sup>/<small><a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_Poll_b43b.html" title="User:Katefan0/Poll">poll</a></small> 22:07, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>For fuck's sake, making an edit 3 hours after SlimVirgin is considered stalking? He removed 1 word. <b>One word</b>. Does he have to check every single article he copyedits to make sure SlimVirgin has never edited it? In case you folks are a bit behind on wikipolicy, let me quote it: "a pattern of disruptive behavior that appears to a reasonable and objective observer to have the purpose of causing negative emotions in a targeted person or persons." Looking at the diff, Mccready removed the word "out". Wow. What a disruptive edit. I bet it made SlimVirgin extremely distressed that Mccready removed this essential word.</dd>
<dd>Maybe this is what happened: Mccready saw something about Hamas on the news, and decided to read the article. He thought the word "out" was out of place, so he went to edit it. <i>I have done this exact same thing many times</i>. Whenever I see something interesting in the news, I immediately go to Firefox and type in "wp [whatever]" to see if that news is in the article, and often I read it and I see something strange, I copyedit it. <b>I don't go into the history to make sure that certain editors haven't edited it</b>. That is simply unreasonable. Is that what you expected him to do there? Whether or not he meant it in bad faith, I don't know, but this isn't "zero tolerance", this is "negative tolerance". You folks were just looking for the perfect excuse to jump on him. Jayjg says that his edit occurred "within minutes" of SlimVirgin's edit; SlimVirgin's previous edit was a full <b>3 hours</b> earlier than Mccready's. That's certainly not "within minutes", unless you are referring to the alternate definition of "minutes" - and I doubt you were making an issue out of Mccready's relative geographical location. – <a href="../../../u/g/e/User%7EUgen64_718c.html" title="User:Ugen64">ugen64</a> 23:34, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>There have been many "yes but" reasons given here. It's clear that there's no evidence that the diff Jayjg labelled as stalking is a disruptive edit. And many have said, "yes, but look at all the other bad things this user has done." What you're arguing for with these reasons is a community ban, people. It may even be time for such a measure, but it should be discussed honestly, not disguised as something else. This editor has been a nuisance, certainly- nobody is disputing that. What we're disputing (and I continue to strongly feel is a terrible precedent) is the idea that editing the same article as someone you don't like is wikistalking. This would be a ridiculous, unworkable standard. If he's going to be blocked for harmless edits, let's be honest and call it community ban- that's what it effectively is. Maybe I have unusually strong feelings on this, having been repeatedly accused of stalking myself (and the evidence presented was, "Look, you edited an article that I edited!"). Anyway, this whole argument could easily have been avoided by doing one simple thing:<i>do not block people for made-up reasons if there are good reasons available</i>. If there <i>are</i> no good reasons, don't block. I suspect there would have been far less disagreement if this had been presented as a general disruption block. The moral of the story is simple: <b>When you block a user, leave a note on the talk page explaining why. The reasons given should be sufficiently explained that an uninvolved, impartial observer will agree that the block is justified</b>. I would have expected that this standard would have been obvious to anyone who's been given the block button. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 14:16, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes. And if 24 hour blocks for harmless edits are what he's going to continue to get, this is effectively a community ban. I'm just suggesting we be realistic and recognize it for what it is. If he's not going to be blocked again for harmless edits, that's another story of course. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 14:48, 11 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>No</b> wikistalking edits are "harmless", because they damage the victim of the wikistalking, and <b>all</b> wikistalking edits must be discussed in the context of "all the other bad things this user has done", because wikistalking is a <i>pattern</i> of behavior. As for the claim of a "community ban", that's just nonsense; this was a 24 hour block for wikistalking, and, as has been pointed out many times before, there are over a million articles Mccready can edit, he has no need to edit the 5 or 6 that SlimVirgin has just edited. Finally, the block was indeed explained, and all sorts of uninvolved, impartial observers have agreeed that the block was entirely justified. The <i>real</i> moral here is that some people will deny reality regardless of the evidence. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 15:47, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Maybe we just have to agree to disagree. You're continuing to assert that [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hamas&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=52436538" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hamas&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=52436538" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> was harmful to SlimVirgin. To me, this is such a bizarrely incomprehensible belief that I can only assume that your own prior involvement is impairing your ability to look at this situation neutrally. The reason I keep bringing up the community ban issue is just common sense: we have no article ownership here. If he's going to continue to be blocked for edits like that, <b>he cannot be an editor</b>. It's that simple. If we're deciding that he cannot be an editor, let's actually be honest about what we're deciding. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 16:12, 11 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What explains the fact that most of the other people who have commented here also share this "bizzarely incomprehensible belief"? Do they also have a "prior involvement" which is "impairing [their] ability to look at this situation neutrally"? As for your other claim, it's equally nonsensical; I'll just repeat - there are over a million articles out there. All he needs to do is stop wikistalking SlimVirgin to the paltry few she has just edited. It is absurd to claim that this means he "cannot be an editor" in any meaningful sense of the phrase. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 16:20, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You put articles you edit on your watchlist, right? So how would you feel if every time you edited an article, it jumped to the top of your watchlist with the same name attached? The name of an editor who has argued with you, filed arguably false complaints and made threats against you. At the very least you say, "oh no, not again" and you have to check the diff because many (but not all) of his edits are disruptive. How would like to log on in the morning to see the five or six or ten articles at the top of your watchlist all with the same name on them. If that's not stalking, then tell me, how many more would it take? If you think this is going to turn into a series of blocks amounting to a community ban, you are conceding more about Mccready than you think you are. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 16:24, 11 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Just had a couple comments and then hopefully I'll shut up. I'm not a fan of admins inventing new rules for users and enforcing them with blocks, but if it must be done, let's at least be reasonable about it. I know, "no wikistalking" isn't a new rule, but "no editing pages that user X has touched" <i>is</i> a new rule and should be treated as such. If it's actually true that Mccready can edit as long as he follows Jayjg's orders, what are those orders, exactly? Is he never to touch any article that Slim has ever touched? Or is there a certain timeframe involved? These are fairly extraordinary requirements; they should at least be spelled out, or he has no hope of being able to abide by the rules. I dislike such specific rules myself- I'd rather just base decisions on the actual edits, but there appear to be people who want rules along these lines. If orders are going to be invented and enforced, explaining this situation at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Mccready_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Mccready">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Mccready</a> and on his talk page is probably a good idea. I have to admit I'm far more comfortable with editor-specific restrictions being imposed by the Arbcom than by just one admin. I apologize for posting so much here- it's possible I've been doing nothing but feeding the troll with my objections here, but I do feel it's important to nail down what is or is not wikistalking. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 16:55, 11 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That may need to be done, but this isn't the proper place for it -- the wikistalking page is, or some other place such as that. Many, <i>many</i> people have commented here and agreed that what Mccready has been doing is harassing and disruptive, and his continuing lack of recognition of the reason why his behavior is being censured is just as disturbing. So in this instance I think the block was well justified. The straightforward direction Mccready can follow is simple: stop doing what you've been doing. · <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0">Ka</a><a href="../../../j/c/a/User%7EJCarriker_TC_c598.html" title="User:JCarriker/TC">t</a><a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0">efan0</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKatefan0_4566.html" title="User talk:Katefan0">(scribble)</a></sup>/<small><a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_Poll_b43b.html" title="User:Katefan0/Poll">poll</a></small> 21:19, 11 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>This block undermines wikipedia foundations. Read on and you’ll see the claim is not overblown.</p>
<p><a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg’s</a> accusation lacks substance and makes incorrect assumptions, particularly in regard to Gene Naagard. That a senior admin can jump to conclusions, accuse me of “baiting” and making “frivolous complaints” (they still haven’t been dealt with), and believe I should not edit articles which Slim has edited staggers me. Once again, there is no demonstration of harassment here despite requests to provide it. And this is where the foundations are being undermined. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> and others want to stop me editing pages another person has edited. There is no examination of the quality of my edits, no examination of whether I have harassed. No. Only “you shall not edit pages which Slim regularly edits – if you do, we define that as wikistalking”. This is a serious attack on the principles of wikipedia.</p>

<ul>
<li>Thank you Slim for finally removing from your list of my faults the gram-positive error I made and acknowledged as soon as it was discovered. I am still not happy that my legitimate criticisms of Slim have been removed from my user page and user talk, but hey ...</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Blnguyen, you misquote me. You don’t mediate against someone. Tell me which of my six points on Animal Rights doesn’t belong. Yes it may appear trivial which is why I couldn’t understand SlimVirgin’s constant reverts and refusal to discuss. Your sarcasm does you no credit.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Yes I emailed admins; the blocking template suggests I do. Now I’m attacked for doing so. Come on people. Yes I emailed people who appear to bear a grudge, appealing them to look objectively at the facts. I am attacked again for doing that. It takes all types.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Thanks to those admins who supported me and stood up against groupthink, including those who did so via email. To the others may I ask you to consider that the definition of wikistalking MUST involve harassment; it is simply absurd to ban someone from editing a page when they have had disputes with a person who also edits that page – no matter how you ASSUME they arrived at the page (check SlimVirgin’s actions on chiropractic<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chiropractic&amp;diff=47022158&amp;oldid=46902634" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chiropractic&amp;diff=47022158&amp;oldid=46902634" rel="nofollow">[77]</a> – perhaps she didn’t know I was a regular editor there, and it was much more than a “tweak” – it sided against me in an ongoing controversy AND without her discussion on the talkpage). Jayjg’s comments on this would be particularly welcome. And to those who find my broad range of interests sarcastically “interesting”, yes the world still has polymaths, or as my father used to say “Jack of all trades, master of none,” and some of them, usually, enjoy editing free encyclopedias.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Given the good job done by AnnH ♫ 13:56, 5 May 2006 (UTC) on Timothy Usher’s block by Sean Black, I’m a bit disappointed she didn’t spend the same time on my case, though I understand how complex and boring it may be.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Thanks Friday for your comments. I am no troll. I had come to the same conclusion as you long before your post, as a look at my posts will show.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Finally, if I may be allowed a small rhetorical flourish, and in the light of those who continue to rely on assumption, this will go down in the annals of wikipedia: the day a user was blocked for removing, correctly, one redundant word from an article which had been edited three hours before (not minutes before as first hastily alleged) by the blocker’s friend who had refused discussion with that user.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>AND May I or may I not make sensible edits, as I do, to pages Slim edits?</li>

<dd>I really believe the best thing to do here is for both sides to just drop the issue and get on with life. Mccready, you feel you've been mistreated. I'm sorry for that. Some folks agree with you, some do not, and many feel your past bad behavior is a mitigating factor. This is how it goes here- editors get in disagreements. Part of being a functional editor is to move on and not dwell on the past. If you'll agree to edit like a functional editor, I hope the rest of us can agree to not punish you for making decent edits.

<dd>Most folks here agree that the block was justified; a tiny minority of the dozens of people Mcready e-mailed do not. Mccready has not been "punished" for making "decent edits", he's been blocked for persistently <a href="../../../h/a/r/Wikipedia%7EHarassment_9843.html" title="Wikipedia:Harassment">wikistalking</a> another editor, even after being warned to stop. There are over a million articles on Wikipedia, and Mccready does not need to make even "decent edits" to articles SlimVirgin has just edited, and which Mcready has never edited before. This will be my final statement on the subject; I will not respond to Mccready's lengthy misrepresentations and wikilawyering, nor will I respond to his or your <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strawman.html" title="Strawman">strawman</a> arguments; however, if he wikistalks SlimVirgin to some other article she has recently edited, I will certainly block him again (if someone else hasn't blocked him already). <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 15:30, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks Friday. I hate to harp on, but the fundamental question which goes to the ethos of wikipedia remains open here. Does Jayjg have the right to ban me from making sensible good faith edits to articles Slim edits?

<p>I sound like a broken record, but what you guys are talking about is a community ban. If that's what you want, do it. But please don't keep picking on this guy. If he's trying to be a functional editor, he doesn't need people following him around saying "You did bad things last week!". If he's not trying to be a functional editor, this will become clear soon enough. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 15:49, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I said I wouldn't respond, but that was a bit too much. <b>He is not being banned!</b> There are a million articles on Wikipedia, he can edit all of them; he just needs to stay away from the 5 or 6 that SlimVirgin has recently edited. And <b>no-one</b> is "following him around" saying anything about him. Rather, <b>he</b> is following <b>someone else</b> around, and people are telling him to stop. These are two more fundamentally dishonest arguments, along the lines of the previous <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strawman.html" title="Strawman">strawman</a> argument you made that people were proposing that editors should blocked for making just <i>one</i> edit in isolation (rather, people correctly pointed out that that edit was the culmination of a long campaign of wikistalking and harassment), and the equally dishonest "it was a decent edit" <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_herring.html" title="Red herring">red herring</a>, since the issue was never the quality of the edit itself, but rather the circumstances surrounding it. Please do not use <i>any</i> of these fundamentally dishonest arguments again. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 16:05, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again, specific edits of Mccready's are red herring here. He was blocked for wikistalking, not editing. There are 1,129,346 articles at Wikipedia. All Mccready has to do is not show up at the 10 or so that SV is editing at at any given time and he's free to edit the other 1,129,336. It doesn't get any more simple than that. <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 16:12, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Arbcom defines wikistalking as INCLUDING harrassment. Three cases are listed. In one Jimbo said "Going around pestering RickK pointlessly and writing inane messages to the mailing list" was unacceptable. Have I done that? No. In the second case the harasser placed unacceptable edit summaries "enfeebled minds", "Some professional standards, please!", "A common pattern for this editor to produce poor English", "Low quality of Irish editor". Have I done that? No. In the third case a group of editors "hounded" another editor, dogging his every step. Have I done that. No. I have edited articles I am interested in which Slim is also interested in. I have given reasons on my talkpage during my block and was met with sarcasm, not good faith, for my efforts.</p>
<dl>
<dd>So do we have a new definition of wikistalking, devoid of harassment, invented by Jayjg? Sad for the project if true. I say again, this is fundamental to the wikepedia ethos. That Jayjg should fail to address the arguments is disappointing. Am I cast, horribly, in the mold of a Randian hero by Felonious’s insult that I rant? Have you examined my responses to Slim above, Felonious; if so which parts do you find unacceptable? Slim and I both edit many more articles than the few we intersect on. Does “tweak” to the lead, in the context on ongoing discussion on the talkpage, fit the new definition of wikistalking<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chiropractic&amp;diff=47022158&amp;oldid=46902634" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chiropractic&amp;diff=47022158&amp;oldid=46902634" rel="nofollow">[78]</a>? I find it sad if you really want to redefine wikistalking in this way and thereby redefine the ethos of the project. The argument that I can edit millions of other articles is unacceptable for the reasons already given. <a href="../../../m/c/c/User%7EMccready_a493.html" title="User:Mccready">Mccready</a> 16:35, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What constitutes harassment is in the eye of the victim not the accused. Certainly SV felt harassed.

<dd>IANAA, and I don't think the username issue to be altogether significant, but I do think it's clear that the user's principal purpose is disruption, and so I think an indef block is likely appropriate. Since the user is a relatively new user, I accept that he/she was acting in good faith in moving the True Jesus Church article (although one worries that the user registered expressly in order to make such move, in view of the user name selected), thinking Wikipedia to be endorsing the church (when, in actuality, we simply use the name the church ascribes to itself), but his/her subsequent actions show, at best, an inability to work constructively with others and to learn Wikipedia's policies, especially with respect to consensus. Perhaps an uninvolved admin should post a note to the user page to the effect that if the user agrees to comport his/her behavior with Wikipedia's policies, the user may be unblocked, with the caveat that any further vandalism/trolling/page blanking will result in an indef block. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 22:14, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks Syrthiss.

<dd>Looks legit to me. I'll go tag the sockpuppets, and we might consider blocking those accounts too, though I'm still not sure we want to consider this block as an indefinite "ban." He still might some day give up his past and decide to contribute effectively, and blocking the IPs may cause unnecessary collateral damage. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 05:43, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry to troubel with a "trivial" issue, but I'm trying to avoid being <b>blocked</b>. I have been criticised on several occasions for breaking process: my understanding is that editing one's own talk page to remove "negative" comments constitutes breach of process. My problem is that my talk page has been edited by someone else, not at my behest, and in doing so has removed "critical" commentary. On the other hand, I do not wish to revert this without some authority, in case this is treated as improperly reverting a senior user's edit. Advice, please. I have ceased any editing on Wiki for the time being, just in case. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoncursitor_1173.html" title="User:Simoncursitor">Simon Cursitor</a> 07:27, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I reverted his edit, as he was removing the section because the DRV was over, I guess (though it seems odd that it was an account that wasn't even in the conversation, and considering socks were mentioned...), but anyway, talk page messages are generally kept (and [[WP:ARCHIVE|archived when the page gets full), rather than removing sections that aren't necessary anymore. As it was your talk, people shouldn't be removing comments anyway, especially if it's not their own. --07:36, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../p/l/a/PlayStation_3_8051.html" title="PlayStation 3">PlayStation 3</a> has been the subject of an edit war over whether to use a free image <a href="../../../s/o/n/Image%7ESony_PlayStation_3.jpg_44ae.html" title="Image:Sony PlayStation 3.jpg">Image:Sony PlayStation 3.jpg</a> or a fair use one Image:Ps3stock.jpg. I protected the article recently to stop the war, but soon after unprotection somebody uploaded Image:PS3 Large Final.jpg, which is a slightly smaller version of the original fair use image, only it's been tagged as being CC-BY instead. I find this claim highly dubious, and have deleted both the fair use image and the almost-certainly-a-lie image (<a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> only goes so far). As far as I'm concerned, the issue was quite clear: a "fair use" claim can't override a quite sufficient image simply because the FU image is purdy, and re-uploading a FU image with a CC-BY tag is inappropriate.

At the moment this is having to be cleaned up each time he reoffends on a case by case basis. As all the edits come from two ranges, it would be far quicker to put a shortish block on the ranges concerned. Without the block, there's not much other option - it's not a case for AIV, and AN &amp; AN/I are massively congested. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aquilina_93cb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aquilina"><font color="gray"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">A</span></font></a><a href="../../../a/q/u/User_talk%7EAquilina_cc1d.html" title="User talk:Aquilina"><font color="teal"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">q</span></font></a><a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquilina_e23d.html" title="User:Aquilina"><font color="gray"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">uilina</span></font></a> 21:36, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Given that the vandalism has occured over a period of 48 hours so far, I'm actually surprised the block wasn't for longer. There's a good chance he'll be asleep for most of it (I assume he's English and it's 11.30pm right now). I appreciate that a range block of 1,024 IPs has very significant potential for collateral damage, but none of the IPs used so far have had a single contribution before Irate started using it. I can continue blocking individual IPs when he returns, of course, but when it takes him about 20 minutes to switch IPs, what does it matter whether they're blocked for 1 hour or 1 month? --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 22:28, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Range blocks and sprotect are the solution. Block enough ranges and he'll eventually have to reboot 10 or 20 times to get a working IP, which is quite discouraging. Sprotecting the pages he's editing means that even if he does, he still can't get his stuff into articles, which is also discouraging. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 14:51, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't know what legal action you suggest be taken. There's almost surely nothing illegal about one's posting the telephone number of an admin; at worst, such posting is in contravention of Wikipedia policies (and, to be sure, possibly of Bell Canada's terms of service). I don't think postings such as that relative to Alkivar are particularly egregious, inasmuch as he provides his full name and city of residence on his user page; it's not wholly unreasonable to assume that thence one will find one's telephone number. That is in no way to countenance the posting of the number which is surely against policy (which policy exists for important reasons), but only to say that, notwithstanding that there is no legal action to be taken, I'd not support the use of WF resources for any such action. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 02:57, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Given the rate at which posts are made on this page, it might not even be necessary to remove the edit. It's almost off the top 50 as it is, so it's quite unlikely that a prank caller will stumble across it (the user's information is also on his userpage, so the risk is probably higher that a user would get his num there, rather than off the ANI history). As for the legalities, I'm not sure of exact laws, but I know such actions go against Wikipedia's privacy policy. It's probably not necessary to bring the guy to go court, but a threatening letter would probably be in order as this is happening again and again and again... <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 04:20, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Google and others provide phone numbers, so I really doubt there's anything illegal here. Further, we ought to observe NLT for the good guys as well as bad. <i>However,</i> Bell Canada's ISP surely has an abuse account, surely has procedures for dealing with users who do this stuff. We ought to be contacting them and explaining the vandalism being done and how it amounts to DOS if done in a particular way. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:50, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, they don't. Google uses a database of numbers provided to them by whichever phone company the individual signs up with- at sign time the person has to explicitly and clearly state that they want their number published in the phone book (which is then at Google's request given to them). Giving out personal, private telephone information (or any other information) without the individual's consent is a violation of several harassment laws, at least in the US. Not sure about Canada. I know this because I did telemarketing for a while, and they made SURE we knew both the laws AND the loopholes regarding personal info. <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoom127_c0b1.html" title="User:Doom127">Daniel Davis</a> 12:02, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ryan, there is no current sockpuppet accusation and there is no block. Therefore it has not been concluded that Merecat is a sockpuppet. Further, since the accounts he is accused of being a sock puppet of have been inactive since November, it is not clear that they would be considered sock puppets at all. The sock puppet accusation is closed and is more than 7 days old. The account is not blocked so the accusations can be removed. Confirmed sockpuppets are blocked per policy. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 19:10, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I just wanted to add that I investigated Merecat and Rex071404's edit history in-depth and from my standpoint, it's confirmed that they are the same. Merecat has continually evaded and danced around the direct question, but not denied it. I find this to be anti-social behavior, and there's no merit in indulging the lawyering.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Note that I personally find Merecat's unwillingness to directly answer this question to be a far greater offense than anything in Merecat's article edit history. It shows not only a complete disregard for the community, but seems to show that Merecat has ulterior motives in editing Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>I will be glad to share any information I have if the RfAr proceeds, and I'm sorry it has to be this way. <i><a href="../../../k/w/h/User_talk%7EKwh_7c75.html" title="User talk:Kwh">KWH</a></i> 02:52, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Merecat's silence and the hysterical reaction to it, proves only that there is a bunch of overly sensitive editors here. And for your information, the question asked of Merecat was "are you Rex071404", to which the obvious answer was certainly "no" as Merecat was Merecat. Had any of you bother to ask Merecat, "did you ever edit as Rex071404, prior to moving to Texas", then you might have received an answer. Oh well, too late now. And if you think I am a sock, go look at the dialog with at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EArticles_for_deletion_Rationales_to_impeach_George_W._Bush_%283rd_nomination%29_3eef.html#2.1_Question_from_an_IP_editor" title="Wikipedia talk:Articles for deletion/Rationales to impeach George W.

I'm sure that he at least, and perhaps other folks, will not like this decision, but I stand behind it and welcome other administrators' review.

<dd>CU logs are largely immaterial -- there've been four arbcom cases on Rex, most of which involved accusations of sockpuppetry; arbitrators are familiar with his IP information and it's probably also available in different places of Wikipedia's pseudo-legal system. The evidence is conclusive; there's really no need for a full arbcom case.

<li>I would request that the Merecat account be unblocked as this is the recent account. The other accounts have not been used for some time (6 months or more) and if Administrators feel a block is in order, it should be those accounts that are blocked.

<dd>Rex editing under a new account isn't necessarily the problem. Anybody can correct their behaviors, frankly, and start over with a new account and a clean slate -- it's not like we know who's behind every new account. The problem is that he used this new account to edit <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Kerry_b44b.html" title="John Kerry">John Kerry</a>, sometimes tendentiously, despite his arbcom ban (and then started behaving badly when people figured it out). That makes it sockpuppetry, and worse, sockpuppetry in direct contravention of an arbcom decision.

<p><a href="../../../s/i/d/User%7ESiddiqui_f1da.html" title="User:Siddiqui">User:Siddiqui</a>, who apparently doesn't like the <a href="../../../a/h/m/Ahmadi.html" title="Ahmadi">Ahmadi</a> movement, created an article <a href="../../../q/a/d/Qadianism.html" title="Qadianism">Qadianism</a> in February as a POV fork of the article. An <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Qadianism" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Qadianism" rel="nofollow">AfD</a> was held in March, and the decision was to re-direct to <a href="../../../a/h/m/Ahmadi.html" title="Ahmadi">Ahmadi</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Qadianism&amp;diff=45195561&amp;oldid=44293910" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Qadianism&amp;diff=45195561&amp;oldid=44293910" rel="nofollow">[92]</a>. Three weeks later Siddiqui returned, undid the re-direct, and continued to edit the article. He now appears to be attempting to systematically remove any reference to Ahmadis from Wikipedia, and replace them with links to his own article, e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_religions&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=52900729" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_religions&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=52900729" rel="nofollow">[93]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Blasphemy&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=52859651" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Blasphemy&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=52859651" rel="nofollow">[94]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Islamic_and_Muslim_related_topics&amp;diff=52898096&amp;oldid=50445157" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Islamic_and_Muslim_related_topics&amp;diff=52898096&amp;oldid=50445157" rel="nofollow">[95]</a> As well, he's turned the article on the founder of the Ahmadi movement <a href="../../../m/i/r/Mirza_Ghulam_Ahmad_09f0.html" title="Mirza Ghulam Ahmad">Mirza Ghulam Ahmad</a> into a lengthy character assassination.

<dd>Generally, Muslims do not have family names in South Asia. In previous century the person was named after his city of residence. Thus we have people from Delhi added <i>Dehlvi</i>, from Lahore as <i>Lahori</i> etc. So Mirza Ghulam was called Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Qadiani since he was from Qadian.</dd>

<dd>The article is very POV and not consistent with our content policies, Siddiqui: for example, the section about the brain diseases he was suffering from, and writing like: "This self proclaimed intoxicated lover of Holy Prophet became so much consumed with his love that he started having revelations (delusions of grandeur!) informing him that all those verses revealed in the glory of Holy Prophet Muhammad are now being revealed in Mirza Qadiani's honor." The article needs to reflect the views of third-party published sources, preferably scholarly sources, who have written about him.

<p>Can someone have a look at this user. There was a discussion a couple of weeks ago on <a href="../../../e/l/v/Talk%7EElvera_Sanchez_d089.html" title="Talk:Elvera Sanchez">Talk:Elvera Sanchez</a> regarding a book on <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sammy_Davis%2C_Jr._4834.html" title="Sammy Davis, Jr.">Sammy Davis, Jr.</a> that claimed that his mother was not Puerto Rican but a New Yorker of Cuban descent, which was supported by her own relatives and contemporary documentation. Most editors agreed on the wording in both articles except the above who, despite hearing that Davis' mother had said she was not Puerto Rican which was accepted by Tony the Marine, the user still didn't believe it saying maybe she was senile... The user has now started continually making subtle POV changes with somewhat confrontational edit summaries to <a href="../../../e/l/v/Elvera_Sanchez_3316.html" title="Elvera Sanchez">Elvera Sanchez</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sammy_Davis%2C_Jr._4834.html" title="Sammy Davis, Jr.">Sammy Davis, Jr.</a> to try and weaken the book's credibility by adding "alleges" or "speculates" instead of "suggests" or "claims", ("alleges" is usually used in a negative context and "speculates" usually indicates that the claim is not backed up by solid evidence which is just not the case).

<dd>Well, my thinking it isn't isn't very important, really. It's certainly a role account. When a user's first edits are to talk pages of others, then to its own, we're not looking at a newbie. It's a reincarnation of someone or an existing user creating a second account to perform a role. I thought TWS's spelling was much better, and I think TWS may be part of a web-oriented religious or political group, but such secondary speculation really is irrelevant.

<p>I have been directed to this page. I have mentioned irregularities in the past to administrators, but they are not responding to me, probably as they presume it may affect their career path in Wikipedia. My concern is that people act in teams, if they disagree with someones viewpoint. The team's strategy is to annoy the person to such a point, he or she overreacts, and breaks a Wikpedia rule, any rule, knowingly or unknowling. An anology is a person stepping on a carefully placed mine. As soon as the "wikicrime" occurs, the leader of the team in question, an administrator, quickly acts, and promptly and permanently bans the person. I do not like this technique. It may be in the spirit of Wikipedia's Command Number 1, "thou shalt be NPOV", but it is uncivil. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWallie_96b2.html" title="User:Wallie">Wallie</a> 14:20, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi and thanks. To clarify, this was a general inquiry. I do not like to mention specific cases, as people get off the topic, if personalities are involved. I just wanted to get some ideas on how to handle this type of situation. I was not referring to teams of admins either. The team would typically consist of a number of like minded people, with one being the admin with banning capability. As for a career path, surely there must be one, or why would anyone want to be an admin? <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWallie_96b2.html" title="User:Wallie">Wallie</a> 21:36, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think a joke here or there lightens the mood and puts a positive spin on the Wikipedian community. Left and right I see vandals and POV warriors and all sorts of negative attitudes. They're part of the community too, but why should we let them dominate? The Wikipedian community is an essential element in the process of building an encyclopedia. Without it, I think many editors would get bored or burnt out. You wouldn't shut down <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza">Esperanza</a> or the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Wikipedia%7EDepartment_of_Fun_d4d4.html" title="Wikipedia:Department of Fun">Department of Fun</a> just because they're not directly building the encyclopedia, would you?

<p><a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">User:InShaneee</a> is abusing his admin position by issuing threats and blocks to people who "disrespect" <i>him</i>. He has a history of posting incivility blocks, frequently using highly uncivil language, on users. His behaviour usually follows the same format. Post a frequently highly provocative warning on a user's page. The user takes offence and replies. InShaneee then blocks them for their response to InShaneee's action. Tasc was blocked for 48 hours for how they <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tasc&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=52334959" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tasc&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=52334959" rel="nofollow">responded</a>. Ghostalker had a one day block extended to one week because of a sarcastic reply they <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ghostalker&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=52331244" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ghostalker&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=52331244" rel="nofollow">gave</a>. Another editor was threatened with a block for daring to use the word <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Retau&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=52327536" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Retau&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=52327536" rel="nofollow">propaganda</a> about clear <i>propaganda</i> being added to a page! Now they posted <i>This is your last warning. Disrespecting me isn't going to get you anywhere, either</i> on my page. The issue is calling bizarre edits by a user "bizarre". (InShaneee has a <i>big issue</i> with words. Actions don't usually provoke a response from them. But he goes all <a href="../../../d/i/r/Dirty_Harry_c2fd.html" title="Dirty Harry">Dirty Harry</a> over a word or two!) Put simply, a single user who have been pushing an extreme pro-monarchist bias on <a href="../../../r/e/z/Reza_Cyrus_Pahlavi_ecee.html" title="Reza Cyrus Pahlavi">Reza Cyrus Pahlavi</a> through deleting NPOV edits, deleting fully cited sections from the page that are in anyway critical of Pahlavi and replacing it with his <a href="../../../h/a/g/Hagiography.html" title="Hagiography">hagiography</a>, posting a {fact} template on a paragraph that has citations. For using a word InShaneee disapproves of, and not obeying InShaneee's orders when told to I am apparently on a final warning!!! lol Maybe we should have a list of <i>InShanee unapproved words</i> so users can know that "prograganda" gets a 24 hour block, "bizarre" a 48 block, while disrepecting them earns an automatically 1 week block plus a grovelling apology written in red. lol Looking on their contributions page, it seems that InShaneee spends much of their time posting "incivility" threats (without even using templates) on user pages, taking offence at the responses and then blocking people for those responses. (BTW his behaviour on this has apparently been raised here by other admins before!) <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:orange; background-color:blue"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 19:50, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>IMO, Tasc was being a little uncivil, but not making personal attacks, so blocking may have been too harsh. However, the two others seem fine to me, "hoping someone will die or catch cancer" is <b>definitely</b> worth at least a stern warning, and asking someone to stop describing another editors contribution as propaganda is a reasonable thing to do.

<li>Blanket deletions of sourced criticism, and reversion to unsourced hagiography.</li>

<li>Demanding that sources be removed before they were not the <i>right</i> sources (ie, they were critical, not glorifying).</li>

<dd>No, but the top of this page says "If you want to make an open informal complaint over the behaviour of an admin, you can do so here, but please only do either that, or file a RFC or RFAr, but not both", which appears to be what he's doing. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStifle_6acd.html" title="User:Stifle">Stifle</a> (<a href="../../../s/t/i/User_talk%7EStifle_2330.html" title="User talk:Stifle">talk</a>) 00:25, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Doesn't seem to be a vandal, though I don't think I agree with his moves. According to the naming standards, pages don't need a qualifier (<b>Episode</b> instead of <b>Episode (show name)</b>) unless needed to disambig, right? --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 20:25, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Correct, not all of the episodes need the qualifier, specifically if the name is unique enough that no other page would want to occupy that space. However, a few of these moves were definitely needed, such as <a href="../../../e/y/e/Eye_of_the_Storm_8d49.html" title="Eye of the Storm">Eye of the Storm</a> and <a href="../../../l/u/c/Luck_of_the_Draw_33f6.html" title="Luck of the Draw">Luck of the Draw</a>. I think these should either redirect somewhere else, have an article created there, or be deleted once all of the redirects are fixed, as people typing these phrases into the search box aren't likely to be looking for <a href="../../../s/l/i/Sliders.html" title="Sliders">Sliders</a> episodes.

<dd>Agreed, those ones should definatly have qualifiers, with their old pages redirecting somewhere more topical. The user's been unblocked (since he clearly has no ill intentions here), but someone should probably explain this all to him before he gets to far with further page moves (and so he can perhaps start moving them back himself). --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 20:45, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for the explanation. While browsing categories, I saw that in some shows, there are articles that are named either <i>Episode name</i> or <i>Episode name (episode)</i> or <i>Episode name (Show episode)</i>. Since this is very unconvenient, I decided to take action and name it all in the uniform manner. I find it really unpractical for some episodes to have qualifiers and some not, and as some certainly need them, as pointed out, it is better to name them all uniformly. Besides, there are two major types of naming, see <a href="../../../i/n/f/Inferno_%28Stargate_Atlantis%29_5ce1.html" title="Inferno (Stargate Atlantis)">Inferno (Stargate Atlantis)</a> and <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endgame_%28Voyager_episode%29_df10.html" title="Endgame (Voyager episode)">Endgame (Voyager episode)</a>. I was thinking to addres this to the according wikiproject. If different naming conventions are used, it results in a mess. --<b><a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETone_f843.html" title="User:Tone">Ton</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETone_Esperanza_c538.html" title="User:Tone/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a></b> 21:01, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>An excellent point, but do keep in mind that for the moment the naming policy is as above about qualifiers. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 21:19, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The contributors User:Americapd, User:209.71.15.194, User:Jameswchen, User:Ndt 123, and User:Topdog08 have made numerous edits in the last week and a half to remove critical content about U.S. Rep <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curt_Weldon_0195.html" title="Curt Weldon">Curt Weldon</a> and inserted content critical of <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Sestak_fe88.html" title="Joe Sestak">Joe Sestak</a>. Sestak is Weldon's Democratic opponent this year. I don't have any particular requests for action but I would like advice on what to do before we start getting into revert wars, and I don't want to be fighting tag-team edits by a coordinated group. I don't have any real issue about them inserting opposition research into the Sestak article as long as they don't try to whitewash Weldon.
