<p>I seek advice on the disruptive behaviour of <a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">User:Piotrus</a> who, as far as I can recall, never uses rollback for reverting vandalism, but reserves the button for content disputes only.

Reverting a good-faith edit may send the message that "I think your edit was no better than vandalism and doesn't deserve even the courtesy of an explanatory edit summary." It is a slap in the face to a good-faith editor; do not abuse it. If you use the rollback feature other than against vandalism or for reverting yourself, be sure to explain on the talk page of the user whose edit(s) you reverted.</i> Yet he recently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Renaissance_in_Poland&amp;diff=43640386&amp;oldid=43625284" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Renaissance_in_Poland&amp;diff=43640386&amp;oldid=43625284" rel="nofollow">abused the rollback again</a> and, despite my remonstrances, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Renaissance_in_Poland&amp;diff=44108164&amp;oldid=44049755" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Renaissance_in_Poland&amp;diff=44108164&amp;oldid=44049755" rel="nofollow">yet again</a>.

<dd>I'm going to let another admin rule on this one. But. Just wanted to say that there is no *policy* per say against using rollback in the way that he is using it. What you quoted isn't a policy.

<dd>It is indeed poor Wikietiquette to use admin rollback for non-vandalism reverts.

<p>My two cents on all this. First of all, Guanaco (and everyone else) should know that blocks for disruption, <i>with administrative consensus</i>, are supported by blocking policy. I should note, though, that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASCZenz&amp;diff=44382812&amp;oldid=44180305" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASCZenz&amp;diff=44382812&amp;oldid=44180305" rel="nofollow">Karmafist did explain and apologize for the edit summaries at the top of this section</a>. I would not have done this block myself, but Karmafist is either playing games with us or is very angry, and in either case some time to cool down might improve the situation. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 21:26, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I talked with him on IRC about this. I think the main problem is that he's very angry and doesn't have an outlet, so he makes provocative comments in edit summaries. I told him that if he's having a bad day, it's best to take it off-wiki and conform with <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>. Sometimes it's just best to write a bunch of insults in a text editor, and then trash the file. Better to release it all in private than let it bottle up and then escape onto the wiki. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 21:35, 18 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>I am fine with the new block, but 24 hours is unusually long for mild personal attacks and disruption by an established contributor. —<a href="../../../g/u/a/User%7EGuanaco_98c8.html" title="User:Guanaco">Guan</a><a href="../../../g/u/a/User_talk%7EGuanaco_7540.html" title="User talk:Guanaco">aco</a> 00:46, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>24 hours is <i>not</i> too long of a block for disruption, especially when hundreds of innocent newbies are being caught in the crossfire of some silly wikipolitic war. --<b><a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#0055AA">Cyde&#160;Weys</font></a></b> 00:49, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually an 'estabilished contributor' should know better, and the behaviour is not issolated but compounding earlier disruption and misue of edit summaries. Actually, I think 24 hrs is <i>extremely light</i>, and certainly should not be shortened. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><small><sup>ask?</sup></small></a> 00:50, 19 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well in this case it's being used to prevent him from disruptive welcoming after he was repeatedly asked not to do so over a period of weeks.

<p>For what it's worth, I think the block was probably a very good idea in this case and I support it. My interpretation of Karmafist's recent statements is that he is intentionally and maliciously setting out to break Wikipedia's dispute resolution system.

<dd>I did not get a fair chance to state my case and was blocked quickly that is why I protest. User Jersey Devil now uses this to smear me when he can, I consider this harassment. He also continues to call my edits "LaRouche" when they are not. Here is my response for the record: ---&gt;Jersey Devil did not like the fact that I deleted what I considered harmful commentary on the Gatekeeper deletion vote page (AfD). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FGatekeeper_%28politics%29&amp;diff=43327250&amp;oldid=43320329" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FGatekeeper_%28politics%29&amp;diff=43327250&amp;oldid=43320329" rel="nofollow">SEE HERE</a>. So he responded by going to my articles at <a href="../../../w/e/a/Wealth_of_Nations_445a.html" title="Wealth of Nations">Wealth of Nations</a>, and <a href="../../../d/i/r/Dirigisme.html" title="Dirigisme">Dirigisme</a> among others and reverting (REVENGE REVERTS he calls them) them without commentary on the talk page. I responded by looking into his edit history. I saw that he was engaged in the same thing at other pages. So I took a stand on something I knew about to stop this - <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democracy_Now_8942.html" title="Democracy Now">Democracy Now</a>! (I am a progressive Democrat afterall). I did this to give <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadical_Mallard_4f8d.html" title="User:Radical Mallard">User:Radical Mallard</a> a chance to respond to his reverts without discussion. We came to an agreement that it was not helpful to revert others material without discussing it (unless it is an anonymous user or obvious vandalism) and he apologized for his conduct. Then a few days later he again reverted Dirigisme without discussion (while a discussion was in process with another user Will Beback). I took offense first, because he broke our cordial agreement to not revert without first discussing why and second because after I reverted back he reverted again, until I could revert no more (each time he did not list a reason on the talk page). He continues as above to insinuate I am a LaRouche supporter when I am not. This is the same thing Will Beback has done to me since I arrived over disputes at the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_System_1f67.html" title="American System">American System</a> page. I have bent over backwards for them with citations and references and they continue to call me this name. I even wrote a brief about myself to indicate a little about me and where I am from and sent Wikimedia my real name to be on record. That is a little background to balance the above statement. PS. My <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_Buchanan_d9ff.html" title="Patrick Buchanan">Buchanan</a> edit was actually accepted by Will Beback after he found out it was well founded himself by the way. --<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthmeister_77ef.html" title="User:Northmeister">Northmeister</a> 07:42, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Northmeister is a newcomer, unfamiliar with Wikipolitics, and has something of a temper. That being said, it is apparent to me that Jersey Devil and Will Beback were deliberately goading him, violating the spirit and the letter of <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a>. Will Beback in particular should be admonished, or possibly blocked, for violation of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> in calling Northmeister a "LaRouche supporter." Will knows very well that Northmeister is not a LaRouche supporter, but continues to taunt him with the term as an epithet (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Northmeister&amp;diff=44439110&amp;oldid=43688404" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Northmeister&amp;diff=44439110&amp;oldid=43688404" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>) and as an implicit threat: Northmeister is aware of the sanctions which may be applied to "LaRouche supporters." As far as I know, I am the only LaRouche supporter left at Wikipedia, since Cognition has apparently left. --<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerschelkrustofsky_0973.html" title="User:Herschelkrustofsky"><font color="darkred"><font face="georgia">HK</font></font></a> 15:50, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This user is creating a few problems on Wikipedia for this short celebration of <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norouz.html" title="Norouz">Norouz</a>:</p>
<p>1- He started by creating a new article from a revert with no real source to suggest the festival is any different <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Norouz_and_the_Kurds&amp;diff=44370751&amp;oldid=21096430" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Norouz_and_the_Kurds&amp;diff=44370751&amp;oldid=21096430" rel="nofollow">[33]</a>. - This created much problems with the page now being protected (and half broken talk links to another page and so on)</p>
<p>2- He then started abusive comments to push his POV e.g. "Calling Kurds as well as their culture and tradition to be Iranian is another insult made by Iranian and many other people." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Newroz&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=44714884" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Newroz&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=44714884" rel="nofollow">[34]</a></p>
<p>Note:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>a</i>- The whole article <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norouz_and_the_Kurds_8c5b.html" title="Norouz and the Kurds">Norouz and the Kurds</a> is politically motivated: the pictures are from a political rally by [[<a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Society_Party_d94b.html" title="Democratic Society Party">Democratic Society Party</a>]] as admitted by the photographer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Khashayar_Karimi&amp;diff=44578794&amp;oldid=44572371" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Khashayar_Karimi&amp;diff=44578794&amp;oldid=44572371" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>b</i>- Kurds are atleast linguistically if not ethno-culturally Iranian (see <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian_people.html" title="Iranian people">Iranian people</a>), as seen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Iran_peoples.jpg" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Iran_peoples.jpg" rel="nofollow">here</a> and also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Caucasus-ethnic.jpg" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Caucasus-ethnic.jpg" rel="nofollow">here too</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>To show that this user is not new to such 'anti-Iranian' behaviour see his (infact second) warning <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Diyako&amp;diff=44590718&amp;oldid=44590399" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Diyako&amp;diff=44590718&amp;oldid=44590399" rel="nofollow">here</a> by an admin, regarding calling Iranians 'farsi', again, after being warned that this could be offensive.</p>
<p>3- Even though it is obvious that there are some Kurds living in Iran (See <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurdistan_Province_%28Iran%29_32af.html" title="Kurdistan Province (Iran)">Kurdistan Province (Iran)</a>), where <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norouz.html" title="Norouz">Norouz</a> is public holiday (New year festival), and Persian is the official language of the country, user still pushes POV by saying: "The word Norouz has no meaning for Kurds" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Newroz&amp;diff=44725553&amp;oldid=44725190" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Newroz&amp;diff=44725553&amp;oldid=44725190" rel="nofollow">here</a>, after many contributers are trying to compromise at <a href="../../../n/e/w/Talk%7ENewroz_424c.html#Compromise.3F" title="Talk:Newroz">Talk:Newroz#Compromise.3F</a>.</p>
<p>4- If all this was not enough, he then nominated <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Norouz_6d8f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Norouz">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Norouz</a> for deletion! a current event article which was fully cited and not disputed what so ever, just to push his POV even more and waste more time.</p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b>: This user has made all these problems just so the Norouz articles would be left with disputes and other problems, wasting many users time who could be actually enjoying this festival instead of trying to protect the article. I invite all neutral admins and users to comment on this matter. Further evidence can be submitted if required. --Kash 02:51, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Dear administrators, please glance through our discussions in <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norouz.html" title="Norouz">Norouz</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newroz.html" title="Newroz">Newroz</a> talk page. I always tried to offer academic evidences for my discussions from Encyclopedia Britannica, Encyclopedia Iranica and Department of Ancient Studies at Univ London. However User:Dyiako says: <b>Look sina, Maybe you are young, I do not like playing and wasting my time Duscussing with you has bo result and wasting time. This is why I prefer to discuss the matter with others than you.</b>. While we were discussig the pages, he nominated the pages for deletion without saying anything to us. He repeatedly made claims like "<b>the boggus norouz please respect the Kurdish world</b>" and also <b>Norouz in the case of Kurds is boggus, and uncorrect, and to the Kurdish culture an insult</b> with no source. Up to now he did not provide any <b>academic</b> sources for his claims. Please notice that the word is indeed in use in KURDISH media and also Persian, Tajik, Lor, Mazani, Gilak, Azeri ones. I have already provided sources for that. But it seems Diyako just do not want to accept the fact. I suggested to use a title like "Norouz celebrations among Kurds (Newroz)" but he keeps deleting it! No other editors agreed with him at the end of our discussions yesterday. --<a href="../../../s/i/n/User%7ESina_Kardar_7950.html" title="User:Sina Kardar">Sina Kardar</a>10:03, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Darren Ray is User:DarrenRay and User:AChan. He and Benjamin Cass are indeed different people, although they appear to have edited from each others' houses, both using their own accounts and their socks' accounts. Ben Cass (User:2006BC) has a string of his own socks.</p>
<p>If these guys aren't actually the exclusive operators of the phenomenon that the vandal-hunters have named "the Australian Politics Vandal" then they're the main operators. In addition, I'm now trying to work out what (if any) account Andrew Landeryou is using.</p>
<p>I've sent a fuller report to the AC. I also just blocked AChan as a sock indefinitely and DarrenRay for 48 hours for sockpuppet abuse to evade 3RR. Darren can, of course, still communicate with the AC via email. (You lucky people!)</p>
<p>And their obsession with small-time headkicking politics is remarkable. I got a query on my talk page from Ben Cass asking what my party affiliation is. WTF. I'm with the "we're here to write an encyclopedia, not play pitterpat with people using it for petty outside ambitions" party.

<p>I would like to invite any neutral admin and user to look at this case:</p>
<p>InShaneee has threatened to block me, because I asked a user to comment on something he posted on another users talk page. He believes that this action is a ‘blatant’ personal-attack, ‘plain and simple’. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKhashayar_Karimi&amp;diff=44269312&amp;oldid=44197323" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKhashayar_Karimi&amp;diff=44269312&amp;oldid=44197323" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and of course he has removed my comments on this user’s page using his admin tools.</p>
<p>The user in question is <a href="../../../a/u/c/User%7EAucaman_0f93.html" title="User:Aucaman">User:Aucaman</a>, he is known for breaking many policies as reported in <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Aucaman_c54f.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Aucaman">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Aucaman</a>.</p>
<p>InShaneee, an admin claiming to be neutral on the case has repeatedly given me and other Iranian contributors "personal attack" warnings. At first he was correct, I was knew to Wikipedia and did not know how to handle users such as <a href="../../../a/u/c/User%7EAucaman_0f93.html" title="User:Aucaman">User:Aucaman</a>, however recently he has threatened to ban me, because I asked Aucaman to comment on this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:201.252.133.159&amp;diff=43523628&amp;oldid=43432259" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:201.252.133.159&amp;diff=43523628&amp;oldid=43432259" rel="nofollow">this</a> where he called the founder of my country <a href="../../../c/y/r/Cyrus.html" title="Cyrus">Cyrus</a> of <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persia.html" title="Persia">Persia</a>, an illiterate murderer in <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_language.html" title="Persian language">Persian language</a>.</p>
<p>InShanee assumed good faith on behalf of this user (apparently), however when I reported the case to him, he came and warned me that he is going to ban me soon.</p>
<p>I believe InShaneee wants to ban me for unfair reasons. I have only been active on Wikipedia as a contributor for less than a month and if you look at the request for comment section you will see what I have had to deal with. And now I am being threatened to be banned simply because I asked Aucaman to comment why he has said that about the founder of my country. This was of particular importance to me as he is repeatedly editing Iran-related articles and I believe such users who have anti-Iranian POV should not be allowed to do so (as it is creating a lot of hassle for the rest of the contributors to fix it all up again).</p>
<p>If I am wrong in assuming that inShanee is ‘ought to get me’ on this case, please let me know. Thanks. --Kash 23:24, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I must admit, the diffs provided by InShanee aren't what I'd call blatant attacks; they were a bit confrontational, but within the bounds of acceptability, and certainly not grounds for blocking. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 23:32, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ah, good, I was just writing up my own summary to post here (as follows). I attempted to warn User:Khashayar Karimi about harrassing other users (this is one of the many users involved in the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Aucaman_c54f.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Aucaman">Aucaman RfC</a> and whatnot). He's been posting on Aucaman's page demanding an apology over something he said on an article talk page, and has been getting increasingly abusive about it (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Aucaman&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=44131354" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Aucaman&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=44131354" rel="nofollow">"What do you have to say for yourself?"</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Aucaman&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=44193965" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Aucaman&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=44193965" rel="nofollow">"You should be ashamed"</a>, ect), while spamming other user's talk pages in an attempt to get him banned (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:LukasPietsch&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=44195698" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:LukasPietsch&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=44195698" rel="nofollow">"Do you think he is fit to edit?"</a>). My warnings were met with nothing but more accusations against Aucaman and, more importantly, repeated mocking (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Khashayar_Karimi&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=44273325" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Khashayar_Karimi&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=44273325" rel="nofollow">"I almost laughed when I read this"</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:InShaneee&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=44275319" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:InShaneee&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=44275319" rel="nofollow">"such amazingly good faith", "such amazingly fair admins"</a>).

<dd>InShaneee thanks for your comment here. First of all my object is ofcourse to your whole attitude! you call me asking about a user's comment 'harassment', yet you come and warn to block me for something which is obviously not personal attack! I thought an admin on Wikipedia would know the policies better than that!</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Secondly ofcourse as you said yourself - people get angry and especially someone like me who has spent the last few weeks trying to make this user (Aucaman) come to his senses, you should appreciate that I would get a little angry and ask why he has done this. 'What do you have to say for yourself' is not what I call abusive. He had called the founder of my country, whom I respect a lot, an illeterate murderer. You assumed no good faith on my behalf, yet you assumed all the best on his! why is that? and as we both know, this is not the first time. You have done this to several other Iranian editors too.</dd>

<dd>Thirdly you did not submit this - I did, and I would like admins to look at it. I assume (and I think I have the right to on this case) that you would have probably banned me sooner or later if I had not got people to look in to it --Kash 23:48, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This issue is going to need some attention, because the entire thing is getting complicated. I've been a bit involved in this issue, reminding some of the editors involved to remain civil. In an already controversial article, Aucaman made a pretty blatantly incivil and harsh comment, which he has since acknowledged was a mistake. There are now a handful of editors demanding that he apologize to them and repeatedly bringing the incident up. These other editors are actually getting to a point where their demands are starting to be disruptive, and now admins are getting pulled into the conflict. Because the comment by Aucaman was made several days ago, there's not much administrators can do except tell him not to make more offensive comments, which I have, and to which he was amenable. All that administrators <i>can</i> do is enforce <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> so that they do not occur in the future. The editors who were angry about Aucaman's edits are now even angrier because it appears that we're siding with Aucaman, when really, we're just trying to start enforcing the policies in this situation. As the above comments indicate, some editors believe it is their role to get Aucaman to "come to his senses", when, of course, that's not their job. Compounding the issue, of course, is the <i>actual encyclopedia article</i> which it will take some cool heads with strong understandings of the related suject matter to get any sort of resolution to (and even then, I suspect that the page won't cool down <i>too</i> much). I don't have the expertise in the subject to weigh in, except to enforce the policies when they get stepped on or broken. In any case, long story short, I don't think InShaneee is "out to get" anybody, and the notion that InShaneee was gearing up to ban anybody (barring, of course, the type of gross policy violation that would get anybody banned) is just silly. It's just a very touchy issue that's going to need more sets of admin eyes on it before it can get resolved. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorj</a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_Esperanza_93c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">m</a> <a href="../../../j/d/o/User_talk%7EJDoorjam_230c.html" title="User talk:JDoorjam">Talk</a> 23:55, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you JDoorjam. OK - I understand that it is not my or anyone else's job to bring him to his senses, correct. I agree and I apologize for mentioning that. I must admit I will be happy as long as admins to get involved in this issue, because some admins (and I am greatful) do acknoweldge that he is not helpful, which is great! however as seen for example in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AShanes&amp;diff=44209892&amp;oldid=44209709" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AShanes&amp;diff=44209892&amp;oldid=44209709" rel="nofollow">here</a> no one wants to take the case on board properly. I mean Aucaman made this comment while trying to say that he is innocent at the same time on his RfC!</dd>

<p><a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">User:Stbalbach</a> has put together a page linking a number of IPs to poor editing behavior, <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_anontexan_99cc.html" title="User:Stbalbach/anontexan">User:Stbalbach/anontexan</a>. Included on that list is one IP strongly associated with Shran/CantStandYa, and there is some overlapping editing of obscure articles. Due to those factors I assumed they were the same person but I have come to realize that I was wrong. I had combined two cases which should be treated separately. While compiling that case I came across numerous transgresions in this re-separated case, which I think it merits independent treatment.</p>
<p>Perhaps <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">User:Stbalbach</a> can list the diffs, but I've seen instances of 3RR violations, several cases of fraudulently changing the IP of his signature, and POV disputes and edit warring with Jimbo Wales <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jay_Rockefeller&amp;diff=41066390&amp;oldid=41053492" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jay_Rockefeller&amp;diff=41066390&amp;oldid=41053492" rel="nofollow">[38]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Jay_Rockefeller&amp;diff=41067473&amp;oldid=39850822" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Jay_Rockefeller&amp;diff=41067473&amp;oldid=39850822" rel="nofollow">[39]</a> and many other editors. There are complaints on his IP pages to which he's never responded.

<p>Ok here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>3RR</b>:The use of multiple anon IP's to get around the 3RR rule can be seen on March 10th of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Movement_to_impeach_George_W._Bush&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Movement_to_impeach_George_W._Bush&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">Movement to impeach George W Bush</a>. It's difficult to diff them all here but a scan of the history page linked above shows it clearly from 70.84.56.172 and 66.98.130.204 on March 10th.</li>
</ul>

<dd>It is very difficult to "dialog" with someone who has no identity, or who alters his identity, who refuses to discuss, and who doesn't have a user talk page. Using multiple IPs does not grant you a waiver from our policies, including 3RR and NPOV. Regarding the Shran mixup, that was an honest mistake for which I have apologized. Now please make sure that you are familiar with our policies and guidelines. Further violations may result in range blocks or sprotects. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 20:54, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The Anon Texan certainly has been disruptive, is generally (but not completely) unwilling to engage on talk pages, and is unwilling to engage in consensus forming. He blanked a section of <a href="../../../k/i/l/Killian_documents.html" title="Killian documents">Killian documents</a> for being "POV crap" and posted this on the talk page. " <i>The section which was deleted has no citations and is nothing but original research -and it's POV too. Either clean it up or it's going to keep getting deleted. That section is nothing but uncited speculative conjecture.</i> " The fact is I agree with him on the substance of the section, except that I proposed a rewrite in talk, waited for comments and consensus, and replaced the poor section with something better. The fact that he disagrees with a consensus that had been established on a contentious article does not give him carte blanche to disrespect the work of many before him by refusing to engage in even a token discussion and he is certainly more interested in edit warring than in working toward consensus.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>However, I must also point out that as a result of antagonizing some editors, edits by the Anon Texan are being reverted even when they are reasonable. For example, <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathunder_61f8.html" title="User:Jonathunder">Jonathunder</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/n/User_talk%7EJonathunder_55ba.html" title="User talk:Jonathunder">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jonathunder_46a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jonathunder">contribs</a>) reverted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Killian_documents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=44905270" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Killian_documents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=44905270" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> even though it was a minor grammatical point that probably made a small improvement. (Unfortunately, the Texan had previously baited Jonathunder on his user sandbox <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Jonathunder/sandbox&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=44905027" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Jonathunder/sandbox&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=44905027" rel="nofollow">here</a>). On <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pat_Tillman_719d.html" title="Pat Tillman">Pat Tillman</a>, the Texan changed the comments of Tillman's brother at his memorial service from <i>he's fucking dead</i> to <i>he's f--ing dead</i> on the basis of published accounts <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pat_Tillman&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=44478500" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pat_Tillman&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=44478500" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pat_Tillman&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=44478209" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pat_Tillman&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=44478209" rel="nofollow">here</a>. He was reverted on the grounds that wikipedia is uncensored, and then the page was sprotected. The thing is, I checked Lexis/Nexis and can find no source that quotes Rich Tillman as using the actual word <i>fucking</i> at his brother's memorial service. Maybe all the news sources bowdlerized the quote, and maybe Rich Tillman bowdlerized himself. The point is a minor quibble but the Texan is technically correct in this case.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It seems that the Texan is more interested in provoking people than being productive, but do we really want to adopt a policy of reverting all edits on sight? <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 06:24, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My response to this editor was initially colored by the mistaken belief that it was Shran. Except for specific cases we should not revert any user's works on sight, without proper review. Howeverit is a fact that annoying, abusive editors get less assumption of good faith than average users. I can't speak for <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathunder_61f8.html" title="User:Jonathunder">user:Jonathunder</a>, but I do notice that his reverts occured before we cleared up the Shran/Texan confusion, so he may have been under the same mistaken belief as me. While we should not bite newcomers, the Texan is no newcomer. Other than range blocks or sprotecting articles I don't see a way of minimizing the disruption of an editor who won't confer with colleagues -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 06:43, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>My first comment: [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AFreemasonry&amp;diff=44693095&amp;oldid=44685890" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AFreemasonry&amp;diff=44693095&amp;oldid=44685890" rel="nofollow">[41]</a>]</li>
<li>Seraphims removal of my comment with inaccurate summary: [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AFreemasonry&amp;diff=44701476&amp;oldid=44699555" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AFreemasonry&amp;diff=44701476&amp;oldid=44699555" rel="nofollow">[42]</a>]</li>

<p>This strikes me as, at the very least, vandalism as it is removing reasonable comment from the talk page in an attempt to bolster the editors own position and minimise evidence of disatisfaction with her conduct. Diven the inflammatory nature of the edit summary there is clearly an effort to antagnonise me into reinstating my comments again however I choose not to be drawn into an edit conflict.</p>

<p>Just for the record. What I was removing as a personal attack was " So I look forward to you actually making a substantive contribution to the article then?

<p>I have unblocked SPUI, as I feel the current block was inappropriate. I will not unblock again if someone decides I shouldn't have unblocked. Note that SPUI has been blocked <i>many</i> times during his time here, and usually for a damn good reason; it's a marvel he was able to extract any sympathy at all. SPUI: if you continue to be a dickhead, you <i>will</i> run out of people willing to unblock you. Nlu: I don't think you or Rschen should block SPUI for, at least, a very long time. You are too personally involved; this thread, while hardly a shining moment even for someone held to as low a standard as SPUI, does <i>not</i> qualify as a personal attack and could only be considered one by someone who is truly unable to be objective. Please, take a step back, enjoy a nice cocktail, and relax and go worry about someone else. If SPUI steps over the line, there's a long enough queue of people watching him that you don't need to.

<dd>Just an additional thought on this: please reflect on this question; if this were an anonymous IP engaging in this behavior (including self-admitted sockpuppetry), would he/she be blocked the same length, if not longer?

<dd>He made no personal attacks in this thread. However, you cite personal attacks here as your reason for blocking.

<dd>Whoops, missed the "additional thought". No, an IP would <i>not</i> be blocked for the same length or longer: I rarely block IPs for more than 24 hours, and often I'll block for less. Secondly, his behaviour in this case (making a joke on CASH, asking to be unblocked, and insisting that non-vandalism edits aren't vandalism) would not see <i>anyone</i> blocked, not even SPUI. As for "self-admitted sockpuppetry", I mean, <i>he called his sockpuppet "Sockenpuppe"</i>, and one of the first things the sock did was identify itself as a sock of SPUI. That is hardly the same thing as your common or garden-variety sockpuppet block-evading routine. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 06:21, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If the first block (yesterday) had stuck, we wouldn't need the second block, would we? And if the second block had stuck, we wouldn't need the third block, would we? Accusing me of blocking him too many times is self-contradictory, for someone who unblocked him. If he had remained blocked from yesterday, he wouldn't be around today to provoke Rschen; ergo, the subsequent block (and reblock) would not have been necessary.</dd>
<dd>In any case, most "registered user blocks" are one-time things, since those tend to be indefinite blocks, and of course you wouldn't need to indefinitely block three times. I've certainly blocked some IPs more than a couple times.

<dd>There seems to be a certain degree of SPUI-baiting going on here, and the whole circle of <i>"provocative edit, over-reaction, more provocative edits"</i> is unfortunate. Is there any chance that we could <i>stop</i> kicking in the guts someone who's known to flare up? The use of {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}} was about a three (out of ten) on the dick scale, but using the rollback button was a five. I don't give a rat's arse about <i>de facto</i>, it's bad form if for no other reason than it doesn't give an expository edit summary. (Which I note with some amusement SPUI gets tuned up for by Oleg Alexandrov on his talk.) The topic here is just another in a <i>slight</i> edging upwards of hostility that all parties are to some degree taking part in, but it's not a "personal attack". - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#000000">brenneman</font></a><span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" rel="nofollow"><font color="#000000" title="Admin actions"><sup><b>{L}</b></sup></font></a></span> 06:45, 21 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I've never had an encounter with SPUI prior to yesterday, and yesterday, upon on seeing what I considered inappropriate behavior, I blocked him a week -- the same length I would impose for someone for whom prior 48-hour blocks did nothing to reform the behavior of. How is that "SPUI-baiting" or overreaction? Again, would an anonymous IP which displayed the same pattern of <i>failure to reform</i> not have gotten progressively longer blocks? --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 07:33, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Per <a href="../../../b/p/_/WP%7EBP_c8aa.html" title="WP:BP">WP:BP</a>, I do not feel that anything SPUI has done here rises to the level of requiring an *extremely harsh* one-week ban from editing. There is a heated content dispute, and hackles are raised on both sides. I feel that a 12-hour ban fulfills the apparent need to cool the situation down. I suggest that *no action* be taken with regard to the dispute at this point until a mediator be appointed, or a <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">request for comment</a> filed. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 06:47, 21 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>And evidently deleted a number of links to full text authoritative scanned books on key subjects (e.g., probably one of the most authoritative books on horse carriages ever written).

These books are on CMU SCS servers with a handful of exceptions having to do with technical issues, and are not by any stretch of the imagination up for commercial purposes. I index them from a .net site which was built at CMU many many years ago, etc etc. I find it abhorent that you would think Wikipedia could write a page on Saxe and prohibit a link to all his poetry in one place as originally published (for reading), with full text search (for research), when he was still alive.

John Saxe wrote "six blind men and an elephant" but it looks like Wikipedia editors are just that: you can't recognize the value of the ORIGINAL source material from over a century ago and can only value vague second source descriptions of it. I honestly thought, for a minute there, that Wikipedia wanted to get out the truth and not be a commercial outfit.</p>

Other deletions: 1. Weems original Biography of Benjamin Franklin written and sold in Philadelphia during the time when people who knew Franklin still lived. Free Full image text of early 1800's book, Full Search, and deleted this from the page describing the life of Benjamin Franklin. 2. *Actual* Little Golden Books scanned from the Golden Books Family Entertainment Library (corporate library, with permission, ten years ago) to show people what these books actually looked like on the page that only describes Little Golden Books. Free to read. Only full text copies free to read on the web (Random House later bought the company). 3. United States Army Regulations from 1861: not A SUMMARY, not a partial description, not a reference to some obscure ISBN number, but the actual book published in 1861 with every page scanned and full text indexed for researchers, on the US Army page talking about Civil War regulations. 4. Almost 2000 pictures from the history of art assembled by faculty from a half dozen universities and put in the public domain and labelled carefully as to content and provenance. Picked to be the most representative. Free to view at high resolution (pictures can go to resolutons based on average 20 megabyte jpeg. -- no attempt to extort money for view here.) This on the History of Art page. What could be more relevant content? 5. An incredible book describing a Frontier Town in the old west cotemporaneous with the Old West (not a 'cowboy book'). This referred on the page that only describes second hand what the old west was like. Again, no ISBN reference but the actual book, free to read, every page as it was originally presented a century ago in full color, and search in full text.</p>
<p>The other cases are all similar. I hand scan these books because often the original book is the most authoritative source.</p>
<p>I personally find that a library reference or a reference to a book I have to pay money for is an afront, when the web should make these original source materials free to read, view, and search. To call these commercial links is beyond belief. It took me about five years to get around to putting in a dozen or so because I thought people might actually appreciate original source material. Obviously you don't. I suspect this is not a mistake on your part since you want to create "a printed or DVD wikipedia" which implies commercial intent on your part. Maybe you should look to a better calling and maybe all the people who contribute to wikipedia (as I have) should reconsider what they thought was a process to get high quality material out to the world for free access. <small>—This <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Rhtcmu (<a href="../../../r/h/t/User_talk%7ERhtcmu_6606.html" title="User talk:Rhtcmu">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Rhtcmu_a8b0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Rhtcmu">contribs</a>) 03:41, 22 March 2006.</small></p>

<dd>The talk page-blanking is nothing new; Deathrocker has continually done this since December.

<dd>Im violating my Ban by doing this, but im using an anon to add this comment here.

<dd>We need to get something against Deathrocker, though, to stop the two edit warring. With Leyasu limited to 1RR, and Deathrocker still on 3RR, there needs to be levelling of the field 18:05, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>It seems there is no other way for me to voice my side other than this, (because some dunce has blocked my talkpage), Leyasu did the same so will I as my original ban is now up.</p>
<p>Firstly; I delete all messages I receive which is stated on my page! Don’t like that? Don’t message me. I did not "delete the warning" from the last ban, I kept it on while the ban still stood, I deleted redundant talk.</p>
<p>It is no different than people archiving their messages (they are still there for people to see if they wish), please tell me where it says I can't do that. And I can’t delete blocking logs so “boom” goes your silly little theory of “hiding“ anything.</p>
<p>Second to <b>Tawker</b>; I do not even use ICR, period. Either for Wiki or personal. Let alone "blast" you on it.</p>
<p>I put an “unblock” tag on my page, as I had been blocked for 4 days, for 3RR, which <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> states is not Wikipedia policy as admins can only block “up to 24 hours” for 3RR, a non admin user “Tawker” kept removing the tag, while the discussion was in process.. and before an admin has looked at the case.</p>
<p><b>EssJay</b> shows up to “look at the case” threatens me claiming I’m attempting to “game the system”, even thought I was just going by <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>, <b>EssJay</b> then threatened to block me for a week, if I put the tag back on my page (which is first ridiculous, blocked for requesting help?? haha and second, I didn’t re-add it after that).. I instead emailed the user, through Wiki to discuss the matter, to which they were still hostile, abrasive, and claiming Non existing Wikipedia policies to be golden, going against <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a></p>
<p>And on to Leyasu... (surprise, surprise)</p>
<p>This more applies to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:ANI#Leyasu_.28talk_.E2.80.A2_contribs_.E2.80.A2_page_moves_.E2.80.A2_block_user_.E2.80.A2_block_log.29" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:ANI#Leyasu_.28talk_.E2.80.A2_contribs_.E2.80.A2_page_moves_.E2.80.A2_block_user_.E2.80.A2_block_log.29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:ANI#Leyasu_.28talk_.E2.80.A2_contribs_.E2.80.A2_page_moves_.E2.80.A2_block_user_.E2.80.A2_block_log.29</a></p>
<p>But I’ll post it here anyway</p>
<p>I have never once claimed the policies don't apply to me, and do to others. Please feel free to show me exactly where I said that, you won’t be able to find it because you’re talking rubbish as usual.</p>
<p>Its also hilarious that you are pretending not to be the IP addresses whose only edits were reverting the articles back to your versions and even using the exact same line as each other in edit summaries once the I.P. address was switched the second time. It wasn't even me who first reported it as been a suspected sock puppet of yours. If you were smart enough to actually check the records, you would know this.</p>
<p>The only people who were siding with your reverts were anonymous I.P.'s which were suspected (not just by me) of been YOUR sock puppets, something which you have been suspected of in the past in totally unrelated debates... actual users who were not suspected of been sock puppets were also reverting your trolling.</p>
<p>Even if I was not involved in the day this went down, you STILL broke your parole anyway, you reverted three perfectly reasonable edits by <a href="../../../r/j/n/User%7ERJN_4c2b.html" title="User:RJN">User:RJN</a> to POV versions by yourself, because you think you own the article <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gothic_Metal_c57b.html" title="Gothic Metal">Gothic Metal</a>.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gothic_metal&amp;diff=44125624&amp;oldid=44124762" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gothic_metal&amp;diff=44125624&amp;oldid=44124762" rel="nofollow">[54]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gothic_metal&amp;diff=44123441&amp;oldid=44122971" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gothic_metal&amp;diff=44123441&amp;oldid=44122971" rel="nofollow">[55]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gothic_metal&amp;diff=44120291&amp;oldid=44119722" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gothic_metal&amp;diff=44120291&amp;oldid=44119722" rel="nofollow">[56]</a></p>
<p>You do not understand the concept that this is an open encyclopaedia where numerous people contribute into working an article, if its not your version, regardless of which user is editing it its "vandalism" according to you, and then after a revert war and both you and who you were warring with are banned, you come straight back with sock puppets.</p>
<p>The only way you can get any sort of pull in your edits is talking straight out of your ass, claiming to quote me on things I have NEVER once said.</p>
<p>There are no “rules” as to how users keep their talk page or user page that I am aware of or have read on here, there was no sexual profanity, or anything of that nature, so again, you’re clutching at straws.</p>
<p>You want Ironic? Here’s Ironic;</p>
<p>1. On your userpage you have a box that says “This user is short sighted.”... no kidding! You see everything that isn’t an edit by you as vandalism, or not worthy of been included in the articles you troll on a regular basis.</p>
<p>2. The fact that you kiss <a href="../../../s/c/e/User%7ESceptre_44d8.html" title="User:Sceptre">user:Sceptre</a> ass to have an admin on your "side", notice how on your talk page Sceptre said "be careful" trying to save your pathetic hide, did Sceptre give me the same warning beforehand? No... hardly an impartial stance for a so called "admin"... also, somebody who breaks a 3RR deserves the same punishment as somebody who is on parole for past idiocy, and is on a strict "1 revert a day" basis?.. ridiculous and a clear abuse of admin powers.</p>
<p>Examples of Leyasu been a liar and a manipulator</p>
<p>For onlookers here’s a prime example of how devious Leysau is with twisting words...</p>
<p>Example #1. Deathrocker on <a href="../../../g/o/t/Talk%7EGothic_metal_78d0.html" title="Talk:Gothic metal">Talk:Gothic_metal</a>: Also, stop the personal attacks and lies in the edit summary, I have not been "warned by 3 admins" one of which I have never even heard of, your ignorant behaviour is somewhat overwhelming at times</p>
<p>I was refering to the edit war that was going on at the time</p>
<p>Leyasu on <a href="../../../s/c/e/User_talk%7ESceptre_51b5.html" title="User talk:Sceptre">User_talk:Sceptre</a>: Hes taking advantage no end, and just made a comment on the Gothic Metal talk page, that you dont exist!!!</p>
<p>Ok, now where in that sentence did I say Sceptre did not exist? This is prime Leysau in action.. ass kissing an admin, I never even claimed which admin's name was not familiar to me, let alone claiming they didn't exist.</p>
<p>Example #2.</p>
<p>On Leyasu's tribute and rather odd little <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shrine.html" title="Shrine">shrine</a> to me that he/she has gone to the trouble of creating it says;</p>
<p>Quote: Deathrocker has also used edit summarys for making direct personal attacks at myself, including called me a liar, cunt, and shit.</p>
<p>This is an other blatant lie, I have called you a liar? Yes (because that is what you are). I have called you shit? No, I referred you to <a href="../../../b/a/t/WP%7EBATSHIT_42e6.html" title="WP:BATSHIT">WP:BATSHIT</a> though, asking you to stop the lunacy, Which isn't the same thing.</p>
<p>Called you a cunt? Total bullshit, I have not called a single person on Wikipedia a "cunt" and again you evidence of it either....</p>
<p>I have though called you an idiot, and a liar in the last, because your actions suggest that.</p>
<p>Example #3</p>
<p>Another one of Leyasu's greatest hits from his/her disturbing little shrine to me.</p>
<p>Quote: Deathrocker also vandalised my user page (Leyasu),.. Admin Sceptre reverted this himself, pointing out to Deathrocker that he cannot attack as being a 'sock puppeter' simply because Deathrocker cannot force his POV onto all articles,.</p>
<p>After Sceptre had removed it, Deathrocker readded it, claiming everyone was 'vandalising',</p>
<p>I added a "suspected puppetmaster" tag to Leysau's page, as he/she features on the suspected of using sock puppets page.</p>
<p>An anonymous IP (83.100.146.147) reverted and said "Guess I sock with 217.33.207.195, then (--Sceptre)"... to which I reverted back as that made little to no sense, was suspicious (why would an admin use an annoymous IP?) and had little/nothing to do with the whether Leyasu was suspected of using sock puppets or not, the line I used in the edit summary was.... "unexplained tag removal, it applies correct?"... nowhere did I say in that statement that everybody was “vandalisng“, just more bullshit from Leyasu.</p>
<p>Rather suspiciously my last edit on that userpage was reverted back by (81.157.88.186) who was suspected of being a “sock puppet” of Leyasu and was reported as so on the sockpuppets page...</p>
<p>At this time Leyasu was still blocked, rather suspicious that a so called “newbie”/annoymous I.P. would not only be reverting all edits back to versions by leyasu while he/she was blocked, but also keeping an eye on his/her userpage too?.... very suspicious. Why would a bran new person editing wikipedia for the first time be doing that? They wouldn't.</p>
<p>If I am to be blocked for a month for arguing in edit summary, the other party who was involved “Leyasu” should too. - <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathrockerComment_0d1c.html" title="User:DeathrockerComment">DeathrockerComment</a> 20:34, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I never said that it is OK for me to call "anyone anything". If I called somebody a "cunt" or "twat", without any evidence of such activity, that would be a personal attack, thus I have <b>not</b> called you or anybody else for that matter, anything of the like.</p>

<p>According to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion</a>, articles are usually debated for "five days or so" before final action is taken. This debate lasted exactly three hours, culminating (after 5 votes) in a speedy keep by Sean Black. Under the heading of "AfD etiquette," participants are advised that "If you are the primary author or otherwise have a vested interest in the article, say so openly, and clearly base your recommendations on the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_Policy_a230.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion Policy">deletion policy</a>." SlimVirgin, the primary author, not only failed to declare her interest in the discussion, she also reverted the article three times, deleting the AfD template from the article in question, during the three hour time period. In addition, AfD etiquette recommends that participants should "Please be familiar with the policies of <a href="../../../p/l/e/Wikipedia%7EPlease_do_not_bite_the_newcomers_ec77.html" title="Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers">not biting the newcomers</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiquette_3717.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikiquette">Wikiquette</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">no personal attacks</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">civility</a>, and <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a> before making a recommendation as to whether the article should be deleted or not, or making a comment." In her comments on the AfD page, SlimVirgin characterizes the AfD as "vandalism" and the initiator, a new user named <a href="../../../i/a/m/User%7EIAMthatIAM_0fbd.html" title="User:IAMthatIAM">User:IAMthatIAM</a>, as "a LaRouche activist with a new account trying to cause trouble." She then blocked IAMthatIAM when he restored the deleted template (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:IAMthatIAM&amp;oldid=44685408" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:IAMthatIAM&amp;oldid=44685408" rel="nofollow">[60]</a>.)

<dd>I've spent some time looking into this. Here are my views on your various complaints:
<ol>
<li>Speedy keeps happen when well-sourced, notable articles are put up for deletion for no good reason. That's a judgement call of the closing admin, and it was the right one here.</li>
<li>SlimVirgin didn't vote, so declaring herself the an author wasn't really a big deal. In any case, it's less important than the next point.</li>
<li>I do wish SlimVirgin had been a bit more civil. However, it is clear that <a href="../../../i/a/m/User%7EIAMthatIAM_0fbd.html" title="User:IAMthatIAM">User:IAMthatIAM</a> was an account newly created by a knowledgable user (perhaps previously anonymous) for the express purpose of arguing about issues related to Lyndon LaRouche.</li>
<li>Likewise, SlimVirgin as an involved writer of the article ought to have gotten help dealing with this, rather than performing the disruption block herself.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>However, nothing that was done was unreasonable, so the case is closed as far as I'm concerned. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 23:13, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>Yes, socks of this nature may be treated as socks of Herschelkrustofsky and blocked indefinitely upon recognition and anything they do reverted.

<dd>First and foremost, Danteferno is under investigation for being the Sockpuppet/Sockpuppeter of the Deathrocker account: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_CheckUser#Deathrocker_.28talk_.E2.80.A2_contribs.29.2C_and_Danteferno_.28talk_.E2.80.A2_contribs.29" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_CheckUser#Deathrocker_.28talk_.E2.80.A2_contribs.29.2C_and_Danteferno_.28talk_.E2.80.A2_contribs.29" rel="nofollow">[66]</a>, to which end Danteferno has used the Check User board to make personal attacks at myself, and mentioned several times things having happened to himself, that have happened with Deathrocker.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Secondly, Danteferno has also ligiated in <a href="../../../l/a/w/WP%7ELAWYER_7fd4.html" title="WP:LAWYER">Wikilawyering</a>, targeting the Admins <a href="../../../s/c/e/User%7ESceptre_44d8.html" title="User:Sceptre">Sceptre</a> and WooWhoKitty, per association with Deathrocker. This has been in regards to having me banned from the articles that the Danteferno and Deathrocker account have both been previously/currently banned for revert warring on, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Woohookitty&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=45324851" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Woohookitty&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=45324851" rel="nofollow">[67]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Woohookitty&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=45324851" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Woohookitty&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=45324851" rel="nofollow">[68]</a>. The reason given was that i had violated my revert parole by one edit, after Danteferno went on to brag he had set up an anon to vandalise an article so i would revert it, so he could then revert to the version of the article he wrote, even though the revert was that made to the one by <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathrocker_4378.html" title="User:Deathrocker">Deathrocker</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>These two users have been recognised by both the Abbirition Committe, the ANI, the Mediation Committe, various Admins, the <a href="../../../h/m/m/WP%7EHMM_ece8.html" title="WP:HMM">Wikiproject Metal</a> and many other Wikipedians, as serially deconstructive users who have little to no intrest in editing in good faith. This is also confirmed with both users threatening and carrying out the use of Sockpuppets to disrupt and vandalise Wikipedia articles and policy pages when bans are given for their policy violations, per Danteferno's serial vandalism using anons on the Gothic Metal article, and his previous use of anon's to vandalise my talk page, and Deathrocker's open sockpuppet which he used to disrupt the ANI board and talk page, leading to his talk page actually being protected.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As such yes, i violated my rever parole by one edit, one edit from a user who was warned by Admin Spearhead and user <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesleyDodds_17ee.html" title="User:WesleyDodds">WesleyDodds</a>, about removing cited information from articles. Yes i violated my revert parole by one edit, reverting someone who bragged about having set up vandalism to disrupt Wikipedia and push their view onto the article. If the ANI board wishes to ban me for this for an example, then i accept and understand that. I however do ask that the above, and my reason for violating my revert parole, is taken into consideration when judgement is passed on me. <a href="../../../l/e/y/User%7ELeyasu_40c4.html" title="User:Leyasu">Ley Shade</a> 14:09, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"...he didn't call him an idiot either". How do you figure Sam? He <i>quoted</i> it right there in the first line of this section, "idiot trolling on Jimbo's talk". See up there? Just below the section title where he called Jimididit a "dick"? Above the paragraph where he calls him a "dick" engaging in "stupidity" a few more times? Trust me... that actually <b>is</b> "rude", not "just blunt". BTW, if you are going for semantic games about how it was the 'trolling' (which... actually <i>wasn't</i> anything like trolling) which was "idiot", and not the person doing it... I'll skip the whole spiel about how actions don't have minds ('idiot' or otherwise) and the description thus devolves to the actor, and instead just say, "<b>still</b> rude". --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBDunkerson</a> 10:25, 24 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>Thanks for the unblocking. It's good to know that it was a breach of wikipedia policy. How should I best complain about the actions of this administrator and seek an apology for the accusations? I've not once ever been involved in trolling and the User Jebus Christ block had nothing to do with trolling. It was a username block. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> didn't bother to even read what i'd written on Jimbo's talk he just assumed it was a rant about the username and that was enough to accuse me of 'idiot trolling' and being a 'dick'. What the hell kind of conduct is that? <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimididit_d3ee.html" title="User:Jimididit">Jimididit</a> 09:28, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would suggest that complaining about his actions will get you nowhere. Wikipedia is not a petty society where you need to seek retribution against those who have wronged you. An apology, I believe, is merited, but pushing for one is not yours or anybody's place. A single breach of Wikipedia blocking policy is not acceptable, but certainly does not merit a <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">RfC</a> or <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAR_b522.html" title="WP:RFAR">Arbcom case</a>.

<p>I'm not looking for retribution I merely want to see some sort of acknowledgement that what he did was wrong. I'd like to think this is a once off thing and that he doesn't always conduct himself in this manner. I'd also like to think that wikipedia doesn't find this kind of behaviour acceptible. I hope we don't have a culture of bullying here. Thanks <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimididit_d3ee.html" title="User:Jimididit">Jimididit</a> 11:09, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You got acknowledgement that the block was wrong- from other people. The block was undone, so what else needs to be resolved? If David Gerard, or any other editor, is regularly being rude and/or blocking inappropriately, this will hurt his reputation over time, and could possibly lead to other consequences. But for now, the problem has been fixed. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 21:05, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

(See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Freestyle.king&amp;oldid=45064519" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Freestyle.king&amp;oldid=45064519" rel="nofollow">[72]</a>.) I've reverted to his even older version (as I did previous to his last block). However, I would like opinions on this. Should his preferred version be allowed to stand? Is it a personal attack (albeit against a group, not an individual), deserving of yet another block? Am I wrong about this? --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 06:13, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>From my reading, I can't see any calling-for-disruption -- more of a complaining tirade more than anything else. The criticism is mild (and arugably with merit?) so I can't really see any attacking happening.

<p>umm...if you read my talk page. you'll know i copied "why is this page black?" stuff from this user called "Silensor" so yeah it is quite common. it is also unfair to say i'm making personal attacks because as you can see on my contribution, i'm becoming someone who is capable of useful edits. i even got involved in a new project. Also, Nlu is the one who told me I can post anything I want on my userpage and talkpage as long as I don't personally endorse it. If my userpage violate personal attack, isn't user "Jiang's" userpage and talkpage "Taiwan=shame" even an attack that provoke racial confrontation to a greater scale. This is like public racism and defamation toward a specific ethinic group and their president. I seriously don't get the Nlu's logic, no offense. Anyway thanks guys.

<dd>Actually, I've had extensive discussions with David and Charles myself, and it has not been at all established that no sockpuppeting was involved. Rather, it has been established that extensive sockpuppeting was involved, though it has also been claimed that it was merely meatpuppeting (a sub-variety of sockpuppeting). And, unlike you, I actually know what I'm talking about here, since I'm the one who has all the original evidence, based on which 4 different Arbitration Committee members agreed that serious sockpuppeting was going on. It's only because of my own great forbearance that I haven't re-blocked the puppets; please don't make me regret that decision. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 18:35, 23 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No user asked me to do this, I just saw Jay's comment by chance, and, as I know it is not true it is not acceptable to make false accusations against a user who has done absolutely nothing wrong. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewport_447f.html" title="User:Newport">User:Newport</a> is a friend of <a href="../../../r/a/c/User%7ERachelBrown_1109.html" title="User:RachelBrown">User:RachelBrown</a>'s who took on watching articles in December that Rachel had started and started articles which Rachel had planned before she left Wikipedia after almost having a breakdown caused by certain users aggressive behaviour. It is true that Rachel and I asked people to vote on Jewish lists and categories on afd and cfd as there was a strong suspicion that a <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntidote_a07c.html" title="User:Antidote">User:Antidote</a> was voting multiple times (see <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Antidote_e661.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Antidote">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Antidote</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Antidote_Voting_fad8.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Antidote/Voting">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Antidote/Voting</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Antidote_Contribution_table_cb45.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Antidote/Contribution table">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Antidote/Contribution table</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Antidote_User_comments_d0fe.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Antidote/User comments">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Antidote/User comments</a>.

The users were all friends of Rachel but at the time I saw admins asking their friends to vote on afds and cfds all the time so neither I nor Rachel were aware that we were doing anything wrong and the other users were never given a warning about it before being blocked (the users involved were: <a href="../../../p/o/e/User%7EPoetlister_675f.html" title="User:Poetlister">User:Poetlister</a>, Rachel's best friend, <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxwoman_c5ae.html" title="User:Taxwoman">User:Taxwoman</a>, a university friend, and <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELondoneye_eeac.html" title="User:Londoneye">User:Londoneye</a>, Rachel's cousin, all of whom had been making independent edits before there was any controversy over voting on afd or cfds). No action was taken by any admin to block the suspected sock puppets of <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntidote_a07c.html" title="User:Antidote">User:Antidote</a> despite all my work to demonstrate that he had broken Wikipedia rules time and again.

<dd>This is a non-issue so I'm not going to respond again after this, but I want to point out that (1) you do <i>not</i> know what's true and what isn't (unless you're the person operating the accounts); (2) you forgot about "Lisa," the flatmate; and (3) I wonder if you have any idea how often we're asked to believe that a bunch of users live together, work together, edit the same articles, hold the same opinions, and even make the same spelling mistakes (maybe because they all supposedly went to the same school). <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 23:06, 23 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is not a non issue at all as I know that these are all different people with different names who live in different places and are therefore categorically not sockpuppets and as they all previously had completely different edit histories and did not join just to vote on afds or cfds they are not meatpuppets. Despite my requests to various admins including <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">User:Kelly Martin</a> and <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">User:Ambi</a> to review the information on the Antidote case none of his sockpuppets were banned and no comments were made in support of my investigations. I believe this dispute has been tied into the debate between people who are against Jewish lists or categories (such as yourself and Jayjg) and people who contributed to the lists such as RachelBrown and her friends (actually it was only when people started attacking Rachel that her friends backed her up re:the <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_Year_Book_29e7.html" title="Jewish Year Book">Jewish Year Book</a> on <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_Jewish_jurists_20dd.html" title="Talk:List of Jewish jurists">Talk:List of Jewish jurists</a>) and that unfair bias has been placed on silencing the views of these users as opposed to the lack of action that was taken against <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntidote_a07c.html" title="User:Antidote">User:Antidote</a> who attempted to force the deletion of Jewish lists and categories by using multiple sockpuppets (as well as numerous other violations, see <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Antidote_e661.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Antidote">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Antidote</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Antidote_Voting_fad8.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Antidote/Voting">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Antidote/Voting</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Antidote_Contribution_table_cb45.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Antidote/Contribution table">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Antidote/Contribution table</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Antidote_User_comments_d0fe.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Antidote/User comments">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Antidote/User comments</a>). The British users all made good edits edits completely independently before they voted on the afds and cfds, and I doubt that they all made those edits from the same locations and ips. I believe this should be able to be checked as presumably some instances can be found where they edited at similar times. Arniep 00:00, 24 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Jay, the argument that they are the same people just doesn't stand up with detailed investigation. They all edited on completely different subjects before November and it seems extremely unlikely that they would have deliberately edited completly different subjects on different accounts just so that they could use the accounts to defend against an attempted forced deletion of Jewish lists by a sock puppet user that was going to occur in the future. I don't think they even visited afd or cfd before User:Antidote started. I have been in contact with them via email and they all have separate names and surnames, one of whom googles as working for the British government. SlimVirgin accused the Guy person as being Rachel- this is impossible as I asked him to ask Rachel to check the Jewish Year Book for references and he said why don't you ask her yourself and gave me her email, so it's highly unlikely that he is her and I find no reason to disbelieve that all the other users are as they are shown in the photographs on their userpages. I realize you are not against all Jewish lists but you did support IZAK's amendment to remove most Jewish-related lists. I personally voted to keep some of the lists involved in the dispute which I now probably wouldn't vote to keep so I am not in favour of keeping most of them either although I think it is perfectly acceptable to have a historical lists but I can't really see the encyclopedic validity of listing living Jewish people.

<dd>Well, I said I wouldn't respond again but there you go. Arnie, just because they gave you different names doesn't mean they really do have different names. Just because you've googled those names and found entries doesn't mean those are the real names. (And the one you mention as working for the British govt: it's a minor civil servant's position, and there's no evidence that person is connected to the Wikipedia accounts). There's other evidence linking them, nothing to do with check user, but to do with material that person has posted or e-mailed, and it can't be discussed openly because then he or she will know to stop doing it. In any event, it doesn't matter so long as they don't post to the same pages and act to deceive other users. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 00:49, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As I said above it is not just the names that make it extremely unlikely that these are all the same people. They made completely independent edits on completely different subjects for up to 6 months before the voting on the afds and cfds, RachelBrown on Bible and Jewish subjects, Taxwoman on fetish subjects, Londoneye on London locations, and Poetlister on literature. Why would they have made four different accounts in advance to stack vote if they had never shown any interest in afd or cfd until <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntidote_a07c.html" title="User:Antidote">User:Antidote</a> started his campaign of mass sock puppet deletion in late October? The other users only started backing up Rachel after she felt she was being harrassed on <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_Jewish_jurists_20dd.html" title="Talk:List of Jewish jurists">Talk:List of Jewish jurists</a> and they voted on the afds and cfds after me and Rachel asked them to do so. All the users involved have requested that their full ip data be sent to them but this has not been done. I still haven't received a reasonable explanation as to why an admin hasn't reviewed the Antidote case and the sock puppets of <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntidote_a07c.html" title="User:Antidote">User:Antidote</a> who wanted to delete the Jewish lists have not been blocked whereas these users who are not sockpuppets and supported the Jewish lists were.

<dd>See, Arnie, the difference between you and me is that your statements are all based on guesswork, "it seems reasonable to me" arguments, and e-mails from various alleged individuals with pretty pictures on their user pages. On the other hand, my statements are based on hard evidence, of which CheckUser results are only a part. And I'm certainly not going to release that evidence to you, nor to the often mentioned, but never actually seen, "request" by Rachel Brown that the evidence be released to her. We're not in the business of teaching sockpuppets how to be better sockpuppets. Now, since you are simply guessing about all this, whereas I actually know what I'm talking about, until you actually personally meet with the "individuals" in question, I'm going to have to insist that you stop bringing up this topic, which has crossed over the line from whining to actual harassment.

When I asked him to reexamine in light of the fact that we were travelling together, he declined to do so saying that it was impossible to verify. I realize that he still would not be able to tell if there was one or three individuals, but he could have at least done nslookup and whois queries on the IP addresses to verify that the edits were indeed coming from first Austin, then the Hilton in Albuquerque, then the Taos Inn and a cybercafe in Taos, NM. At the point I made the request, I was already back in Austin, Chai Walla was in Seattle and Baba Louis had made a edit to my talk page from the Dallas airport. It should have been easy to verify that we had separated. I know records are only kept for a week, so refusing to revisit the issue means that when another admin gets around to looking at it, it will no longer be possible to verify the travel, only that we are now in separate locations. Either there should be a formal process to request a second opinion, or the first admin should be willing to look again if asked. —<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdityanath_8e9f.html" title="User:Adityanath">Adityanath</a> 18:32, 23 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I've read your explanation as well. It turns out you weren't sockpuppeting at all, but you "all" simply worked together at the same location, and then travelled together to other countries, where "they" were all using your laptop without your knowledge, making the exact same edits as you.

<dd>I never said they used my laptop without my knowledge. We were collaborating, and passing it to the next person who wanted to make an edit. We are all members of the same Nath lineage and have similar but not identical opinions on the articles we worked on. If you couldn't tell we were moving, you must not be very ept with network tools. Why would we all lug laptops to NM when we could share one? You are making an insulting assumption rather than looking again at the data and the subsequent data which would clear me. Why are you so stuck on your own opinion? Are you afraid that you will have to admit to having made a mistake?

<p>The USAA page has a long history of vandalism by one user, originating with user Robertjkoenig, who was permanently banned by Jimbo Wales. Since then, numerous sockpuppets have popped up to attempt to prop up his POV airing of his perceived wrongs [Talk:USAA/Archive09]. It culminated with what I believe to be banning of several of the sockpuppets when children's pictures were posted in Koenig's diatribe.</p>
<p>The vandal has returned, with the same modus operandi, and reverting the page to the same language, and I request this sockpuppet be banned as well. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=USAA&amp;curid=562106&amp;diff=45209783&amp;oldid=45209632" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=USAA&amp;curid=562106&amp;diff=45209783&amp;oldid=45209632" rel="nofollow">[74]</a></p>

I can't cite the diffs because the whole talk page was deleted and re-created without these comments, but I guess an admin can still see them. Anyway, I found this to be a serious misuse of Wikipedia and further cause to block all Koenig sockpuppets. --<a href="../../../a/m/c/User%7EAmcbride_b12f.html" title="User:Amcbride">Allen</a> 03:59, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Then after I reverted that, 205.188.116.203 came along and said he would "rather be a vandal than a snot nosed little shit, like you." Since all three of these guys have vandalized my talk page less than two hours apart, have vandalized similar pages and were all blocked for various offenses, I heavily suspect these three are related somehow. --<a href="../../../a/p/o/User%7EApolloBoy_2382.html" title="User:ApolloBoy">ApolloBoy</a> 03:39, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There's more to it. Who exactly are you suspecting the socket puppets belong to? Evidence? Violation? Using sockets in it itself is not against the policy.

<dd>That's a valid question, of course, and I should have made that more clear. The reason I didn't was that I'm not actually <i>asking</i> for a checkuser (which isn't done here) I'm asking if I <i>should</i> ask (over at Requests for CheckUser).
<ul>
<li>If, for arguments sake only, these were <b>your</b> sockpuppets then you'd have broken the 3RR and would have violated a policy. In fact, I think that if <i>any two</i> of the three of these could be shown to be the same person, it would be a 3R violation.</li>
<li>Again, not making accusations but we've got you reverting to the explicit image four times, fuzzie doing so once, Gmcfoley twice, Sn0rlax twice and the "very new users" six times.</li>
<li>There are <i>lots</i> of possible combinations there that add up to 4 reverts, especially when noting that both you and Sn0rlax only started reverting after sprotect was applied.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Despite everything I've just said, I actually just wanted an opinion on the <i>bounds</i> in which check user was applied, as it's not something I'm terribly familiar with.</dd>

<dd>It is only pretty recently that we even started to formalize requests for checkuser. I think rules and practices are still a little bit fluid. In my opinion, in a case of lots of new accounts immediately joining a revert war, it is not even <i>necessay</i> to request checkuser, they can just be blocked unceremoniously as obvious socks, never mind who exactly is whose sock.

<p>Hi...if you have time, I'd like your help and assistance please!</p>
<p>I'm a relatively new member, so please bare with me&#160;:) I would like you help and/or advice in dealing with a certain user please. The user is question is <a href="../../../h/o/t/User%7EHotwiki_4fcf.html" title="User:Hotwiki">Hotwiki</a>. After making improvements to articles such as the <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spice_Girls_4805.html" title="Spice Girls">Spice Girls</a> (which I completely rewrote) and their members pages (<a href="../../../g/e/r/Geri_Halliwell_33b3.html" title="Geri Halliwell">Geri Halliwell</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melanie_Brown_ace4.html" title="Melanie Brown">Melanie Brown</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_Beckham_45d1.html" title="Victoria Beckham">Victoria Beckham</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melanie_Chisholm_de48.html" title="Melanie Chisholm">Melanie Chisholm</a> and <a href="../../../e/m/m/Emma_Bunton_b2c4.html" title="Emma Bunton">Emma Bunton</a>), its become very clear that hotwiki has a problem with me and constantly reverts any improvements I made to articles (best illustrated on the Geri Halliwell page, where he is also reverting edits made by other users).</p>
<p>There is a dispute over the Spice Girls discography; it was recently suggested that the Spice Girls library be merged with it and that the solo information included on the page be put on the girls own individual pages. The consensus agreement after discussions agreed with this view - with the sole exception of hotwiki, who seems to think he has some divine say over what does and does not go into the articles. And last night he made his objections personal, contravening wiki regulations on civility, in the Geri discussion page. This dispute has since spiralled and is effecting other pages. After discussions with other users on the best course of action, it was suggested that I should contact an admin to help resolve this childish situation - because quite frankly its petty and reflects very badly on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Hotwiki is generally rude, arrogant and very hostile with a range of users - simply look at his discussion page and/or the additions he made to other people's discussion pages for evidence of this. His problem with me personally could well stem from outside of Wikipedia; I was a moderator on a large internet forum, which stemmed from a Spice Girls fan site. I don’t know what hotwiki's username is on the forum, but he has made it clear he was/is a member; so his hostility to me might stem from the fact I gave him an official warning or banned him whilst being a mod. Who knows. What is clear though is that he cannot continue the way he is acting because it reflects badly on this site and creates a negative and hostile environment.</p>
<p>Any help or advice you can offer would be greatly appreciated - and for now I'd like to keep this conversation on your discussion page (rather than mine) if you don’t mind. I am also going to contact one or two other users to see if they wish to make a contribution to this complaint, that way giving you more scope and different points of view. Thanks for you time - sorry to bother you over something so incredibly lame! <a href="../../../r/i/m/User%7ERimmers_934f.html" title="User:Rimmers">Rimmers</a> 01:13, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>A lot of the rhetoric is similar to Lightbringer, recent socks have shown a tendency towards learning from his mistakes, the line about those who are prepared to identify as Masons didn't quite get to the 'should be banned' stage, but pretty close and some of the commenting in talk pages clearly shows some familiarity with the various viewpoints and previous discussions. I'd say likely but not definitive at the moment.</p>

<dd>Cyde, the manual of style is recommended style guideline, not a policy. Also, as someone who has contributed in the discussion on the style guideline yourself, you are well aware that there is significant disagreement over the appropriateness of the recommendation in question.

<dd>How am I supposed to discuss this with you if you do not even accept that there are people who disagree with you on this? You are presenting opinion as fact - and clouding the issue by suggesting it is about whether all dates should be linked. I don't think anyone is arguing for that. What I, and many others, want, is for articles to be treated on an article-by-article basis, with years linked to provide historical context for the events described in the article. I just saw Quadell delink, through the same script which Bobblewik used, every single date link on a historical list. I can't think of a more appropriate article to have links for years on. In any case, as I have argued on <a href="../../../d/a/t/WP%7EDATE_3c44.html" title="WP:DATE">WP:DATE</a>'s talk page, people like finding out what else happened in the year in question. I am one of those people. What is the point of having an encyclopaedia on the web, with all the advantages of hyperlinks it gives us, if we do not utilise them? I don't really want to summarise and duplicate all the arguments made on the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia_talk%7EManual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29_9d65.html#linking_of_dates" title="Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)">talk page</a>, but there is disagreement on the issue, and I think Wikipedia is better served by deciding and adopting a sensible compromise than one group of people removing as many date links as they can find and ignoring the fact that other people disagree, and another group of people finding out that a frequently-used group of links are being removed, causing much frustration all around. <a href="../../../t/a/l/User%7ETalrias_6b30.html" title="User:Talrias">Talrias</a> (<a href="../../../t/a/l/User_talk%7ETalrias_9ef0.html" title="User talk:Talrias">t</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Talrias_7d2c.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Talrias">e</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Talrias_2658.html" title="Special:Contributions/Talrias">c</a>) 20:10, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Talrias, contrary to your assertion above, we already have guidelines regarding dates, and that is that they should not be linked:<a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29_d981.html#Avoid_overlinking_dates" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)">Wikipedia:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)#Avoid overlinking dates</a> - this is hardly controversial. Also, was his behaviour that disruptive? Did you contact him before the blocking? I see no justification for blocking a longstanding editor in good standing on such dubious grounds, and I'm quite concerned about the apparent precipitousness of these actions. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 19:51, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don’t have an opinion on the date-linking issue one way or the other, but I am concerned with the blocking without warning of a longtime user and admin. Judging from Quadell's talk page, I don't believe his edits were disruptive enough to warrant a block (i.e., there aren't numerous messages there asking him to stop). Nor do I do see any evidence that you asked Quadell to stop before implementing the block—that, in my opinion, should have been the first step. —<a href="../../../w/a/y/User%7EWayward_b35f.html" title="User:Wayward">Wayward</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../w/a/y/User_talk%7EWayward_8c6e.html" title="User talk:Wayward"><font color="#6BA800">Talk</font></a></sup></small> 20:05, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In reply to both Wayward and Jayjg, I blocked Quadell without asking he stop first on his talk page was that he is making edits exactly the same as Bobblewik (in fact, using the same script as Bobblewik used/uses). Bobblewik was blocked for making similar edits. I am confident that Quadell knows that Bobblewik was blocked for these edits, and he knows that there is significant disagreement about the issue. Given this, I felt my blocking was appropriate. <a href="../../../t/a/l/User%7ETalrias_6b30.html" title="User:Talrias">Talrias</a> (<a href="../../../t/a/l/User_talk%7ETalrias_9ef0.html" title="User talk:Talrias">t</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Talrias_7d2c.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Talrias">e</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Talrias_2658.html" title="Special:Contributions/Talrias">c</a>) 20:10, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm afraid that Bobblewik was blocked for delinking dates, in (at least) one case for being rather fast at it. I don't think anyone has contended he is running a bot for some time (with the exception of Jimbo, though how he got the idea, I don't know). I also note that one of his critics who criticised his speed had edited faster than he did. I also note that Bobblewik requested at the time a statement of what speed was ok to edit at and got no reply. In other words his blocks were on a par with Quadell's, the only difference is that Bobblewik showed an incredible patience with being blocked, Quadell a merely credible patience. <i><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERich_Farmbrough_talktome_c24b.html" title="User talk:Rich Farmbrough/talktome">Farmbrough</a></i> 21:03 <a href="../../../2/6/_/26_March_04e7.html" title="26 March">26 March</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> (UTC).</dd>

<dd>As for Quadell's changes... I almost always link the birth/death years in an article, as well as years for important events in the person's life. I've written over a thousand articles and have done this in every one. So, I would disagree with Quadell simply because I don't want to go back and unlink all of those dates&#160;:) If Quadell wants to delink them, feel free. It's not important, and does not warrant blocking a valuable contributor. Now, if Quadell has limited himself to making such minor edits, then I would suggest finding something more important to do; I see many of the MoS guidelines as "guidelines on starting an article" rather than "guidelines on fixing an article". — <small><sub><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#444444">0918</font></a></sub><sup><span style="position: relative; left:-24px; margin-right:-24px;"><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><b><font color="#222222">BRIAN</font></b></a></span></sup> • 2006-03-24</small></dd>

<p>I did some digging around to find the basis for that section of the Manual of Style, to try and find some basis for the differing viewpoints we find ourselves presented with today. I found that it was originally added by, of all people, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AManual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29&amp;diff=12341149&amp;oldid=12255492" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AManual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29&amp;diff=12341149&amp;oldid=12255492" rel="nofollow">Bobblewik</a>, back in mid-April, 2005, where he made an edit saying he was eliminating an inconsistency. He also added the text "Other date forms such as year only (e.g. 1981) should be treated like any other words and linked only if there is some particular relevance.", without mentioning this in the edit summary, nor discussing it on the talk page. A related issue was raised on the talk page, which can be seen in <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia_talk%7EManual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29_archive17_5694.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)/archive17">archive 17</a>, however this mentions only the duplicate linking of years (i.e., where a year is linked more than once in an article). I believe this change should have been reverted and discussed on the talk page, especially since the edit summary does not mention this change.</p>
<p>Over time this gradually was changed by various people into the text we have today, as far as I can tell without much discussion, into requiring "special relevance" and a "strong reason" before linking a year. This is a good example of "creeping guidelines", where an important page has been modified slowly but surely over time into what its advocates can now declare are "uncontroversial" guidelines. Now, when people (such as myself) are questioning the guideline, I am being told "this is a part of the guideline, shut up and do something else". Well, I think that is appalling. There are only a few policies on Wikipedia which are not subject to change. I can count them on one hand, and this is definitely not one of them. I've tried to have a debate on this issue a number of times before, but it has always been the case that "the mos says this, end of discussion". Raul's <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_Raul%27s_laws_b426.html" title="User:Raul654/Raul's laws">7th law</a>, "[a]s time goes on, the rules and informal policies on Wikipedia tend to become less and less plastic and harder and harder to change", applies well here. This is the reason I suggested <a href="../../../t/a/l/User%7ETalrias_Task_forces_proposal_908d.html" title="User:Talrias/Task forces proposal">task forces</a> - to make sure policies and guidelines are discussed openly, are always available for debate and are not subject to this gradual and incremental modification we've seen on this dates linking fiasco <i>(note: I also wrote this on <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia_talk%7EManual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29_9d65.html#Date_delinking:_a_proposed_compromise" title="Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)">the proposed compromise</a> page; it seemed appropriate in both places)</i>. <a href="../../../t/a/l/User%7ETalrias_6b30.html" title="User:Talrias">Talrias</a> (<a href="../../../t/a/l/User_talk%7ETalrias_9ef0.html" title="User talk:Talrias">t</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Talrias_7d2c.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Talrias">e</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Talrias_2658.html" title="Special:Contributions/Talrias">c</a>) 23:28, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I can think of several reasons. Warning users that any edits they come across by this user may be suspect, for one. Indicating to other users that Wikipedia volunteers have the means available to prevent disruption, for another.

<dd>VSmith reverted or rolled back four edits, that had been made to articles he watches and was happy about. Ambi <b>rolled back</b> several hundred edits without checking them. Ambi has done this numerous times, and has had many people complain about it on her talk page (including me). Ambi is using her admin powers in a content dispute, as is Talrias. Ambi has also promised to revert any edits of this nature made by Bobblewik and I think Quadell. Yes there are arguments on both sides of the dispute, but using Admin tools in a content dispute is even worse than the edit war in the first place. Ambi and Talrias have also blocked users over this content dispute, which is in my opinion, plain wrong. <i><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERich_Farmbrough_talktome_c24b.html" title="User talk:Rich Farmbrough/talktome">Farmbrough</a></i> 22:00 <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_26.html" title="March 26">26 March</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> (UTC).</dd>

<dd>Another bit of info in Femmina's defense: after I removed the section in question for being largely irrelevant to the article, Femmina came by and removed the corresponding URL at the bottom, which I'd missed, which indicates to me that, at the very least, Femmina is not simply looking to attack, and perhaps didn't understand why posting pic links from articles like that should be avoided; I really think we should just AGF, instruct Femmina not to post photos corresponding to editors' real-life personae, and call this "resolved". <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorj</a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_Esperanza_93c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">m</a> <a href="../../../j/d/o/User_talk%7EJDoorjam_230c.html" title="User talk:JDoorjam">Talk</a> 02:07, 26 March 2006 (UTC)
