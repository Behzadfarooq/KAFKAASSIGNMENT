<p>Recently a Siberian-russian wiki was started and there is currently a motion to get is closed down again <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Proposals_for_closing_projects/Closure_of_Siberian_Wikipedia" class="external autonumber" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Proposals_for_closing_projects/Closure_of_Siberian_Wikipedia" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>Nevertheless it has some articles and bots are starting to add interwikilinks to articles here but they get reverted by the people, that want that wiki gone. I personally have no preference as to the existance of the wiki, but I think while it is alive it would be a violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> and a disription to enwiki to remove the interwikilinks. See <a href="../../../i/n/g/Talk%7EIngria_0a26.html#Ru-Sib" title="Talk:Ingria">Talk:Ingria#Ru-Sib</a> for some of the arguments involved.

<p>The issue hasn't really been resolved either way. None of the above answers the question whever there is some policy that would allow the removal of interwiki links. The debate on meta seems very heated, and despite the fact that the "discussion" is of extremely low quality and heavily politicized there do seem to be some genuine problems with the Siberian Wikipedia (though the POV argument can be also be called of many others, and from what I could read of that page, there doesn't seem to be anything really terrible on sib like for example <a href="../../../../tr/e/r/m/Ermeni_soyk%C4%B1r%C4%B1m%C4%B1_iddialar%C4%B1.html" class="extiw" title="tr:Ermeni_soykırımı_iddiaları">genocide denial</a>). I think this might be a cultural issue, with our Russian partners not understanding that in European culture there is an <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assumption_of_innocence.html" title="Assumption of innocence">assumption of innocence</a>. Therefor it has to be first determined if the Siberian Wikipedia violates the rules of the Wikimedia Foundation and only then, if it does, should the iwiki links be removed. --84.16.230.249 12:56, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry, it was a "'''delete''' ~~~~". Whether we like it or not, unreasoned "vote" type contributions on AFDs do count for something (how much is up to the closing admin) when they are made by well established contributors (I have even seen arbitrators make such posts). When an anonymous person makes such a contribution they usually don't count for squat. I would not recommend that you strike out anything, but if you will remove the the strikethrough and make a comment of the lines of "Please don't strike out anything unless it was made in bad faith" below it, then I don't think anyone will complain. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 13:13, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In general striking out the comments of any user in AfD is not permitted. Anon IP users are <i>welcome</i> to express their opinions in AfDs. I will remove the strike and ask the user who struck it not to do this again. We should allow the closing admin to exercise their good judgment in closing AfDs. In this case I doubt much weight will be given to the delete opinion expressed, but it is not okay to strike it out. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> 13:21, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've never had to report sockpuppets before and don't know if this is the right venue or format, but here goes. Five accounts were created within the past 24 hours which all appear to be <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPA_03df.html" title="WP:SPA">SPA</a> accounts, all have made near-identical edits to a group of closely related <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somalia.html" title="Somalia">Somalia</a> articles, blanked sections and images for POV reasons, and supported each other in revert wars on the articles and in the talkpages. The contrib histories are relatively short, and almost any diff in their histories supports my assertions. I'm not involved in the article itself, I became aware of this through RC Patrol and followed up. The page has been protected, but the dispute revolved around the assertions of these suspect editors:</p>

<p>There is an IP in the <a href="../../../o/l/l/Ollanta_Humala_f695.html" title="Ollanta Humala">Ollanta Humala</a> article who keeps adding false information that Humala's father is named "Alonso Vargas". As the de facto head of the Wikiproject Peru I can tell you that Ollanta Humala's father is <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac_Humala_519f.html" title="Isaac Humala">Isaac Humala</a> (whom himself is very well known in Peru). The IP seems persistant and it doesn't seem like he will stop. I am not sure if the IP is driven by malice, in order to vandalize the article, or if he simply doesn't understand that the information he is adding is false. Either way, I do not want to have to be watching this article and getting into a revert war over this and thus I ask for some administrator intervention.</p>

<p>We have one user from Bahrain who seems to be a Shi'a Muslim and an opponent of the current Bahraini regime. He edits from various anonIPs. After he reverted the <a href="../../../r/a/f/Rafida.html" title="Rafida">Rafida</a> article five times in two hours, I asked to have that article semi-protected -- which was done. This seems to have enraged him. As User:89.148.41.41 he left an epithet on my user page and a nasty comment on my talk page accusing me of being anti-Shi'a. Now he's using User:89.148.40.178 to follow me around WP, reverting anything I edit. Could someone please roll back the 178 edits and block that IP, or range of IPs? <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 06:44, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The article is NPOV, well sourced, provides only information which is absent on all other Gibraltar related articles and simply refers to a community of people (Gibraltarian Spaniards) explaining who they are and a bit of their history. No POV related to the Anglo-Spanish dispute on Gibraltar is even touched and thus is non-controversial. The article was deleted in with a very small number of votes and in a very short time (5 days?).</li>

<dd>I know that this issue got be posted at <s><a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">WP:DR</a></s> <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a>. But, Burgas and I thought it would be a good idea to inform admins that Burgas is planning to recreate the article under a diff title and NPOV. What didn't look fine at the AfD process is the duration of the discussion. It was closed after 5 votes and after only 5 days!</dd>
<dd>Anyway, i believe that after the article is freed from POV (in case there are), it can be recreated under the new title. Apart from the duration of the vote, the nature of the votes are also unfounded (most voters talked about POV -which not a valid reason to delete an article), the nomination was based on that "there exists articles on <a href="../../../g/i/b/Gibraltar.html" title="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demographics_of_Gibraltar_f34c.html" title="Demographics of Gibraltar">Demographics of Gibraltar</a>" is also questioble and not convincing at all as there exist people caled SPANISH GIBRALTARIANS.

I then checked his contribs to see if it was a vandalism-only account, which I would have blocked indefinitely. It doesn't seem to be, but it is a fairly new account. In that case, I'd just give him a warning. However, I'm wondering should he be blocked for his username. My feeling is yes, definitely, but I think I would tend to be less tolerant of such names than other people might, and I'm not actually experienced in username blocks. I may have done one or two, but if so, they were <i>really</i> offensive names. As it is, I haven't even warned this user for his vandalism, because it seems a bit silly to warn someone for vandalism if I'm going to block him two minutes later regardless of any possible change in behaviour.

<dd>Just as an opinion, there have been a lot of requests for uName blocks recently for names which are really fairly inoffensive, and it seems to me a trend is starting which may be ill-advised. We're not Disney, after all. This one could offend some; however it is not "profane" - bastard being a legal term, and dirty having several meanings - and may be a semi-witticism on the part of the editor.

I (<a href="../../../a/_/j/User%7EA_Jalil_1957.html" title="User:A Jalil">A_Jalil</a> (<a href="../../../a/_/j/User_talk%7EA_Jalil_f3e6.html" title="User talk:A Jalil">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Jalil_8879.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Jalil">contribs</a>)) have nothing to do with the sockpuppet nor the edits that led to the block. Can you please unblock my username so I can do some edits. Thanks.</p>
<p>the block note is:</p>
<p>Your account or IP address has been blocked from editing. You were blocked by Fred Chess for the following reason (see our blocking policy): Autoblocked because your IP address was recently used by "<a href="../../../f/e/a/User%7EFeatured_article_8042.html" title="User:Featured article">Featured article</a> (<a href="../../../f/e/a/User_talk%7EFeatured_article_1d61.html" title="User talk:Featured article">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Featured_article_3f68.html" title="Special:Contributions/Featured article">contribs</a>)". The reason given for Featured article's block is: "Blocked user, sockpuppet".</p>
<p>Your IP address is 213.216.199.6.</p>
<hr />
<p>I don't have the time to investigate this right now, but I think it is important not to block innocent people, if that's the case here. Could someone take a look and take appropriate actions?</p>

<dd>OK, what we have here is a heated but legitimate difference of opinion between two editors in good standing. It's been to ArbCom but the disputed text is not really covered by that ruling (it's too content-specific). What it needs, more than anything else, is more eyes. I can't really pitch in because I have a pretty strong bias against the subject, plus I always tend to make things worse these days, so if any experienced pourers of oil on troubled waters want to take a look I think it will be appreciated by all concerned. It's certainly not straightforward. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 21:25, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is a complex issue because there have been a number of editors banned on this page, and this editor could just be taken a hard nose skeptic to the article. My suspicion, however, stems from this editors "blanket revert" then edit. Also, there has been a number of sesible edits mixed with the blind importing of edits written by banned users. This were both characteristics of the banned editors, and a behaviour that led to months of circular discussion, failed mediation, failed mentorship, and bans. The banned editor had create a complex network of sockpuppets that work together to evade arbcom rulings. This editor, <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlanBarnet_91d4.html" title="User:AlanBarnet"><tt class="userlinks" style="1.3em">AlanBarnet</tt></a> (<span class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../a/l/a/User_talk%7EAlanBarnet_dbcb.html" title="User talk:AlanBarnet">talk</a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AlanBarnet_1aca.html" title="Special:Contributions/AlanBarnet">contribs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">logs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../b/l/o/Special%7EBlockip_AlanBarnet_6e07.html" title="Special:Blockip/AlanBarnet">block user</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">block log</a></span>) appears to be a carefully planned attempt.

<dd>Gimme an hour or so to investigate their edits further. From what I saw during the last days, I had the impression the contents and profile of their edits was sufficiently dissimilar that I wouldn't have supposed sockpuppetry. In particular, Karcha had some particular issues that didn't seem to be shared by E. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 08:19, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Having looked into their contributions a bit more, let me express some doubts:</p>
<ul>
<li>IP addresses/checkuser: In his e-mail, E declares that his main IP is a stable non-shared address at his workplace, while others he's used are from a public pool. Dmcdevit, could you perhaps check if that stable IP has also been shared by Karcha? (I'll forward you the IP from E's e-mail).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Temporal patterns: E and K have sometimes been editing simultaneously, in ways that only a very skilled sockpuppeteer could fake. For instance, 17 Nov, 10:16-10:17: 3 edits by K (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jalayirids&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88396991" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jalayirids&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88396991" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kara_Koyunlu&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88397101" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kara_Koyunlu&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88397101" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kara_Koyunlu&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88397149" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kara_Koyunlu&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88397149" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>), one simultaneous edit on an entirely unrelated topic by E (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Mustafa_Kemal_Atat%C3%BCrk&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88397088" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Mustafa_Kemal_Atat%C3%BCrk&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88397088" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>), all of them substantial. 16 Nov, 21:34-21:42 two edits each by K (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Arash_the_Bowman&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88287362" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Arash_the_Bowman&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88287362" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Azerbaijani_people&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88287276" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Azerbaijani_people&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88287276" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>) and E (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Babur&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88285944" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Babur&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88285944" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Arash_the_Bowman&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88287362" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Arash_the_Bowman&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88287362" rel="nofollow">[33]</a>), alternating with only a minute in between.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Language: While both accounts are clearly not native speakers of English, K's English seems substantially poorer than E's.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Editing interests: K has a bee in his bonnet about removing historical Ottoman spellings of Turkish names. E does not seem to share this obsession. Examples:

<dd>Hate to butt in, but I just would like to point out that even new users have a right to jump into the middle of edit wars.. Hasn't the possibility that K is a friend of E, and E told K about Wiki and his contributions, and when K joined wiki, he automatically went to articles that his friend E told him about, but later found his own interests, crossed anyone's mind? I am not vouching for the guy by no means, but let's just not be so impulsive and not slap six-day bans on users before a detailed check had been done, as was the case for E104421.

<dd>Well, to be fair, tag-teaming revert wars are quite common on these articles, everybody seems to be doing it, and it's not really evidence of planned coordination. And about the reliability of the checkuser, I've only heard Dmcdevit saying they were using the same university's IP range. However, we are dealing with particular, stable workplace IPs, so I've asked Dmcdevit for clarification if he's also checked that. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 10:31, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Daniel, what u say doesn't make sense: there are tag-team reverts happening by the masses by people who live in the farthest corners of this planet. I don't even know if E knows K, and the link that you gave doesn't mean anything, the fifth edit in question is 12 hours after the fourth one, how is that tag-team revert meatpuppetry?????? Such things happen in the space of tens of minutes. There is nothing wrong with a number of people who feel strongly about a subject to edit insistenly, without being part of a planned conspiracy. The six-day ban was given for sockpuppetry, and unless you have more evidence about meatpuppetry than a fourth and fifth edit spaced by a period of 12 hours, this ban should be annulled and these editors re-instated, and their revoked edits undone. The fact that their IPs are similar doesn't mean much, pls read my post below about that issue. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 10:56, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>People doing these edits believe in what they do, that's why they are doing those edits. We are not talking about vandalism here, the edits in question are legitimate edits. I also exchanged emails with E on this, he says that he goes to university in METU, a university in Ankara that has 50,000 students, and that teaches in English. So it is extremely probable that there are other wiki users in the same campus. And generally, big organizations like universities have computer centers that assure their Net liasion, and as such they dish out range of IPs. Your temporal check was particularly enlightening, nobody can simply switch back from a computer to another with 60 sec intervals. A six day ban is extremely unfair, since, even though not an administrator, I am not at all convinced by this evidence that they are the same person. I just think that it is not too fair to slap such a ban, without more concrete checks like the one you had done.. That's all.. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 10:46, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Update: In addition to what I pointed out above, I have forwarded some further evidence to Dmcdevit which, I believe, establishes with sufficient certainty that E104421 and Karcha are in fact two different individuals. They just happened to be both at the same university (which is one of Turkey's largest) and shared certain opinions (which are likely to be shared by 90% of all Turks). Contrary to all appearances (which, I admit, were strong), Karcha seems <i>not</i> to be a sockpuppet of E. E has plausibly explained to me that he doesn't even know K.</p>
<p>Unless there's some strong objections here, and pending ultimate confirmation from further checkuser details, I'd propose lifting the indef block on Karcha and reduce both blocks to something appropriate to "normal" 3RR offenses. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 18:24, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I oppose lifting the indef block on Karcha. In his short time here, he has been nothing but disruptive, with 90% of his edits being reverts, and the rest being personal attacks like "Kill Persianism". I don't see what good to the project we'd be doing if we unblocked him. He is essentially just another version of <a href="../../../-/i/n/User%7E-Inanna-_9e9b.html" title="User:-Inanna-">-Inanna-</a>. I have no problem with lifting the block on E104421, however. <tt class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">Khoi</a><a href="../../../k/h/o/User_talk%7EKhoikhoi_f6d5.html" title="User talk:Khoikhoi">khoi</a></tt> 18:34, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Point taken - in fact, I have no doubt Karcha is pretty disruptive (just like many of the people he keeps warring against). Just a question of whether he's disruptive enough for an indef; I haven't watched him closely enough for that. But I'd like to cut back E's block to normal. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 18:43, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>I Agree with Khoikhoi; Karcha should remain blocked, as he is an extremely disruptive editor. As for E104421, while I can't help feeling something fishy in what seems his coodination with Karcha, I think we should always in doubtful cases assume good faith, so the unblocking is OK for me to.--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 18:46, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>User:Dmcdevit is the only admin here with the checkuser tool, his findings indicate that Karcha (<a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKarcha_addc.html" title="User talk:Karcha">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Karcha_1ffa.html" title="Special:Contributions/Karcha">contribs</a>) is indeed a sockpuppet of <a href="../../../e/1/0/User%7EE104421_300d.html" title="User:E104421">E104421</a> (<a href="../../../e/1/0/User_talk%7EE104421_cfd3.html" title="User talk:E104421">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_E104421_649c.html" title="Special:Contributions/E104421">contribs</a>).

I find this whole thing very disturbing, especially considering User:Future_Perfect_at_Sunrise's history, under his previous username, and the fact that he unblocked Zaparojdik, a freind of E104421, and another problematic Turkish user only last week <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Zaparojdik" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Zaparojdik" rel="nofollow">[47]</a>, or how he tried to justify Karcha addressing an Iranian user as "KhorSHIT". <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents#Help" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents#Help" rel="nofollow">[48]</a> There is a trend here, and it isn't good. --<a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EManiF_8d90.html" title="User:ManiF">ManiF</a> 23:59, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was surprised, to say the least, to see that E104221 had already been unblocked. (Especially since we exchanged emails afterwards still discussing this without Future Perfect at Sunrise telling me he'd already unblocked.) The "further evidence" he sent me was <i>not</i> very strong, and he shouldn't have unblocked over it, without consensus. Keep in mind tha "CheckUSer is not a magic pixie dust" works both ways: seemingly vague CheckUser results are not proof that two users aren't the same person, especially when the behavior is proof in itself, and the CheckUSer only serves to confirm it. As I replied in email, Many of FPAS' objections seem oversimplification: remember that both were on many common <i>shared</i> IPs. The behavior is just too coincidental to be believable: hardly ever do two users on the same IP range, much less the same university, edit the same articles at the same time. But editing the same articles at the same time, both involved in the same dispute, reverting to each other, and doing it in such a way that each avoids 3RR by the other's reverts? I think we may be grasping at straws here trying to find a way to demonstrate their distinct, when the opposite is much more obvious. Please remove blocks without consensus in the future. I've reblocked E104221 since the sockpuppetry was in no way "disproven". <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 21:10, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, they can be two friends in the same university. Did that cross your mind DMC? And how do you know how this university dishes out its IP addresses? avoiding 3RR blocks by tag-team reverting is done by people who lives tens of thousands of kilometres away, are we going to block all of them too? And besides there are many software tools and web-sites out there to escape such IP identification. This guy goes to Middle Eastern Technicla University in Ankara, the best technical university in Turkey, so I guess he would have been much smarter if he wanted to engage in sockpuppetry instead of just jumping into the computer next to him and typing away. There is no question of coincidence. So you are basically saying that I have no right to tell a friend at office or university "hey, why don't you check out wiki, these are some of the articles that i have been involved in"? I don't know that guy, and I don't know how anything happenned, but he told me that he doesn't even know Karcha. And escape 3RR in a period of 14 hours? You gotta be joking. In the case that got E suspended in the first place, there is a period of 14 hours between the fourth and fifth revert, how is that such a blatant case of tag-team reverting? <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 21:37, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>I haven't found that type of vandalism in my first nine months since i've started to edit at Wikipedia. But over the past two days, i've been concern about a new trend of vandalism. There have been tons of IP's along with registered users doing vandalism by using the edit summary&#160;: <b>Replacing page with XXXX</b> (which is generally non sense). I've first spotted in the <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco%2C_California_b6e2.html" title="San Francisco, California">San Francisco, California</a> article when it was a featured page. Then multiple pages such as <a href="../../../s/%C3%A9/g/S%C3%A9gol%C3%A8ne_Royal_0f8e.html" title="Ségolène Royal">Ségolène Royal</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colombia.html" title="Colombia">Colombia</a>, <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottawa_Senators_7db8.html" title="Ottawa Senators">Ottawa Senators</a> and many many more were attacked by the same method. Even my own User Page got attacked today.</p>
<p>I'm wondering if those types of vandalism are coming the same group or a same user using multiple suckpuppets and IP's or it. Or it's just a new option I haven't notice? Thanks!--<a href="../../../j/f/o/User%7EJForget_e21d.html" title="User:JForget">JForget</a> 03:50, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ardo, welcome to Wikipedia in case no one's said that before. I wouldn't worry too much about the last person who posted on your homepage. He seems to be involved in a dispute with Crzrussian that you don't have anything to do with. As for the note you got from Crzrussian, I think he is right that you are probably being a little bit too quick to put deletion tags on bios of potentially notable people. You might want to wait a couple of days after an article is created before tagging it, for example, in case the original author is planning on expanding it, and speedy tags should only be used on bios of people who are <i>definitely</i> not notable. I might not have said what Crzrussian said in exactly the same words he used, but he does have a point, and I'm sure you'll bear it in mind.</dd>
<dd>In hopping over to your userpage and talkpage as you requested, I noticed that you have a lot of information about your "real world" self on your userpage. There has been a lot of discussion about whether it's a good idea for younger editors to be revealing too much identifying information. Especially if you're going to be active in vandal-fighting and proposing articles for deletion, you might not want some jerk who gets annoyed with you to be able to see that information. I say that not because I want to breed paranoia here, but it's a concern that's been expressed from time to time and you might want to delete the information like your real name and school from the page. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 04:40, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Process (i.e. the rule of law) is the only thing that keeps wikipedia from descending into a Hobbesian state of eternal wheel warring. An admin that shits all over process - whatever the Cleveland Steamer of the moment - thereby demonstrating pure disdain for fellow users who are participating in good faith in the process, should not be an administrator. An administrator who becomes convinced that his judgement is more worthy than the collective contribution and thinking of hundreds of other users no longer has the self control to act as an administrator. This event was a good example of why all admins should be open to recall. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 23:04, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Now now, I don't think we should be recalling Improv because of this. He's a good admin and deserves to keep those responsibilities. Does he make bad decisions now and then? Sure, but so does everyone. A bad decision once-in-a-while doesn't mean we should take away a person's admin duties. Here, just like with the cookie fiasco, I believe he was acting in good faith. He might have made bad decisions, but he was certainly editing in good faith. - <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperlex_32b0.html" title="User:Superlex">Lex</a> 20:03, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I must say, though Improv might have broken process, that seeing it go would have been very good riddance. To give my nasty opinion, it's a shame that humanity would even think of such an awful deed, let alone practice it and glorify it with an article. One thing Wikipedia does not need for publicity is Jon Stewart standing on comedy central and quoting directly from this article. Granted, I can't support this with rule (hence the reason I didn't vote in the last afd), but wow, this is pretty low. -<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatstuart_7fbf.html" title="User:Patstuart">Patstuart</a><sup><a href="../../../p/a/t/User_talk%7EPatstuart_e8fd.html" title="User talk:Patstuart">(talk)</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Patstuart_a3f0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Patstuart">(contribs)</a></sup> 03:13, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It isn't at all clear to me that this should have been deleted. The matter is sourced at this point and I see no obvious foundation issue. As for Jon Stewart, I think Wikipedia can survive ribbing from Comedians. I could very well see someone see this as a reason to get rid of <a href="../../../b/d/s/BDSM_7cde.html" title="BDSM">BDSM</a> or some other sexual article that offends people's sensibility. Personally, I find this topic disgusting and revolting to the point where I almost have to work to suppress my gag reflex. However, none of that is a reason for deletion and is certainly not a reason for an out of process deletion.<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 03:19, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agree completely with JoshuaZ and JJay above. I don't see "Does Jon Stewart find this article amusing? (YES/NO)" on our list of inclusion criteria. A) I don't understand why this is a Foundation issue; B) It is inherently <b>outrageous</b> and anti-wiki for an admin to blatantly overide consensus; C) It is deeply offensive (far more offensive than the article itself) that anyone should seek to censor the encyclopaedia because they don't like the information it contains- see e.g. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4646360.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4646360.stm" rel="nofollow">this</a>, and many similar, for some examples of how and why this is done. 6 AfDs is enough. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 04:06, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The problem is not that people don't like it, but that the article consists of a dictionary definition, some original research, and "pop culture references" (aka cruft).

<dd>I didn't say to censor it, I said it would be good riddance if someone did. But, in any case, my personal opinion (not Wikipedia policy, so I can't ask for it to be enforced), is that sometimes we take free speech, which is supposed to be a means, and make it into an end. Free speech is supposed to help people become more informed for a useful purpose (a means), help improve something (a means), etc.; becoming offended at the lack of free speech (an end) does not fit into this category. It's proper to become offended at the lack of free speech where it's used repressively, or in order to hurt content. Do you see my point about free speech being a means, not an end (I'm not sure if I'm communicating it well). Even Wikipedia says Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">NOT</a> anarchy, meant to test the limits of free speech. Again, I don't think it's policy, so I have no right to enforce it or call for its enforcement; just my opinion, as we all have opinions. -<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatstuart_7fbf.html" title="User:Patstuart">Patstuart</a><sup><a href="../../../p/a/t/User_talk%7EPatstuart_e8fd.html" title="User talk:Patstuart">(talk)</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Patstuart_a3f0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Patstuart">(contribs)</a></sup> 04:15, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>For reference, my deletion had nothing to do with finding the subject disgusting or anything of that sort. I am libertine when it comes to such things. I deleted it solely because it was very clearly a dictionary definition. Consensus is not about voting, it's about discussion, and good arguments. This is an exceptionally clear case of when loud users who don't understand our project goals lead a bunch of fans away from them, ignoring everything our project is about and confusing consensus with democracy. I don't intend to redo my deletion (although I would encourage other admins to do so) because I don't wheel war, but I stand by it entirely. Wiktionary and Wikipedia are not the same project, and process is not sacred. People who would never go against a "vote", no matter how ill-informed and ill-conducted, even when it stands in the way of project goals, are people who should probably never be either closing discussions, nor should they be administrators. --<a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImprov_b282.html" title="User:Improv">Improv</a> 07:05, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>So although you have no intention of engaging in a wheel war personally, you encourage other admins to do so? Take a bow my friend. <a href="../../../r/f/e/User%7ERFerreira_c585.html" title="User:RFerreira">RFerreira</a> 07:09, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>I encourage other admins to delete it, not to wheel war. This is how we reconcile project goals, IAR, and a desire not to wheel. As you say, I shall take a bow. *bow*&#160;:) --<a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImprov_b282.html" title="User:Improv">Improv</a> 07:32, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But the way you deleted it implied it was something you would have happily deleted on sight, seeing as you deleted it in the midst of a DRV (which is about process, not content), which was endorsing the previous decision anyway. If it is so "exceptionally clear", how come admins support both sides? Should the admins who closed the 6 AfDs on the article all step down? I would say that people who will happily delete something, out-of-process, against consensus from experienced editors and admins, because of their <i>personal</i> opinion of the arguments shouldn't be an admin either. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 07:41, 17 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Look at the AfD. Half of them don't even address the article, merely saying "abuse of AfD" or something, and are invalid on their face because they ignore the question of if the article should be deleted. None of the other arguments adequately deal with the fact that a definition and a few references that the term is indeed used does not make it anything more than a dictionary definition. Neither consensus nor AfD consist of taking votes. I am not proposing that anyone step down, merely that people had mistaken ideas about what AfD is about. We all make mistakes, and we all come to understand the project and its goals better as time goes on - demanding "justice" for an inadequately thought-out position would be a bad idea. I should note that what actually happens always comes down to judgement, whether from one person or from some combination of people - there is no shame in "personal opinion/judgement". --<a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImprov_b282.html" title="User:Improv">Improv</a> 07:57, 17 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The reason they don't address the article is because there were <i>five</i> previous AfDs. The issue had been discussed at length and every time no consensus formed to delete. And no, you didn't ask anyone to step down, but you did say they shouldn't be administrators (and the only way for that to happen is via voluntary desysopping or arbitration). Of course the issue comes down to judgement, but when many users have the same opinion on something it is called consensus. Your opinion is not worth more than anyone else's, and where there's disagreement you shouldn't take action on it alone. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 16:26, 17 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Or, alternatively, they could come to understand what's needed to keep the project working. I'm not a big fan of removing admin bits from people - if it becomes too common, then the project will fall to rabid populism and we'll see even more use of the resources of the project by people doing unrelated things. I'm not saying I don't believe in consensus, but I have a very different understanding/definition of it than yours, and to whatever extent yours means "let people vote and give them whatever they vote on", I think that's a recipe for killing Wikipedia. Long-term users should be educating less long-term users, and having discussions on where the project is going and how to interpret/apply policy. This is very different than voting, and it's what's needed to keep the project healthy. Previous AfDs don't give one a blank checque to not contribute to the current one. AfD is about judgement, not voting, and people pretending that they're voting while not contributing to the discussion should be ignored. The case is clear, most of the people aiming to keep are people who have never shown a significant understanding of policy (newbies), and previous people who closed the AfDs were not doing their job (as is anyone who goes by numbers rather than argument). --<a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImprov_b282.html" title="User:Improv">Improv</a> 19:36, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>My opinion isn't so much "let people vote and give them whatever they vote on", but I don't think that this applies in this case. You say previous AfD closers weren't doing their job because they went by numbers, not arguments, but in this case I don't believe that applies. Do you honestly think that the decision on this debate was clear-cut, that it should be deleted beyond a doubt? Because that means there are a lot of experienced editors and administrators who are seriously misunderstanding policy, which is not encouraging for the project as a whole. I think this is a judgement call. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 21:49, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>You have it exactly. I believe that the decision was clear-cut, and that the project as a whole is not in a good state. What we need, I think, is a very hard push against voting and towards discussion with a strong reliance on project goals. As a thought experiment -- what would need to change about the article to make it a dictionary definition? --<a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImprov_b282.html" title="User:Improv">Improv</a> 21:59, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

Do you think they should be deleted? And if so, should you/would you delete them on sight as in Cleveland Steamer? To be honest, my concern is not so much about the merits of this specific article but the deleting of it in such an out-of-process way. You essentially speedily deleted it based on a dicdef argument, which is specifically listed as a non-criteria on <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a>. Under what grounds did you think that was justified? <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 22:45, 17 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I haven't looked at them, but if they're nothing more than a dicdef, then I'd delete them on sight if it became clear that Wiktionary did not want them. Very few "processes" on Wikipedia are hard rules - they're guidelines that, as per <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>, are ignored when they lead to problem results. That naturally causes trouble/conflict when people notice (and in situations like this, people are bound to), but when people arn't so caught up in rules that they lose sight of the project, sometimes the right thing happens despite the rules and the people who are sticklers for them. Process is not sacred here, and out-of-process is not always a mark of something bad happening. I felt it was justified based on the content, the fact that we have a project specifically for that stuff, and that having talked with some representative folk for that project, they don't want it there either. Wikipedia is not a "rule of law" type community. It's a bit more cowboy, and involves judgement, give and take, a certain amount of oligarchy, and a lot of messiness. People who attempt to simplify it *into* rule of law generally find their stay here disappointing. --<a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImprov_b282.html" title="User:Improv">Improv</a> 00:30, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree very much with your last 2 sentences, and I think I now understand your reasoning behind your action. The problem with <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>, however, is that it can be invoked in either direction (and if I recall correctly, someone used it as an argument in one of the AfDs). You could say delete it on sight per IAR, because it violates policy. I could say keep per IAR (because it's useful and not actually gonna be found in a dictionary), and don't delete on sight because <i>that</i> violates policy. The result? A mess. I don't think you're going to change your mind and say it's useful and should be kept anymore than I'm going to say it should be deleted - we both have our views. I would merely ask you take more care over using IAR on an obviously contentious issue (and, I suppose, state explicitly that you're using it). <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 01:05, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Exactly. The big problem with <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">IAR</a> is that it might encourage people to ignore all rules! The end result? Either a) complete chaos (likely) or b) domination of the project by an elite "superclass" of users (i.e. admins) who, despite making up, what- 0.01% - or less- of the project, can take action in spite of clear consensus. Depressingly, I often see comments by certain admins that come very close to actively agitating for the latter scenario. This article has been nominated for deletion 6 times, survived every time, and yet I do not hear trumpets sounding or the walls of Wiki-Jericho crumbling. Is there any scenario that would justify ignoring consensus in such a blatant fashion. By the same token, I'm not necessarily arguing that the admin concerned was acting in bad faith- but it was, IMHO, a bad, bad call. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 19:12, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>No, it means don't follow a rule that will result in the wrong outcome. Ignoring people who want the wrong outcome may be a side effect.

<li>But then you have to decide which is the "wrong" outcome. Which in a contentious issue is not agreed on. So how do you decide which is wrong? By looking at the arguments made by the people. Which you can then choose to ignore...it's a circular argument. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 21:22, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Admins, See what I mean? After two admins have already read that post and after looking things over desided it was not a personal attack this editor keeps proving my points through his actions. Just defending myself becomes a personal attack in his eyes. Read the warning and block section of my talk page and you will see the reason given for both. Its worth noting the warning and block resulted from the same edit,at least according to the admins that posted them, maybe not in the mind of my accuser<a href="../../../n/a/z/User%7ENazireneMystic_07c5.html" title="User:NazireneMystic">NazireneMystic</a> 18:44, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>As far as your unfounded report of socketpuppetry please read up on the socketpuppetry artical and maybe your unfounded personal attacks of me would stop. It is clear the account was created after I forgot my password to the Nazirene account and in my first edits using it I ID'ed myself as NazireneMystic. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=SpiritualEbionite" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=SpiritualEbionite" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=SpiritualEbionite</a> Hardly a socketpuppet.</p>
<p>It should be noted this editor has already tried to claim on the Wikipedia:Personal attack intervention noticeboard I evaded a block by the use of this account when it is clear from its contributions page it was not even used during that timeframe. So now the claim that I moved my tlak page because I anticipated a block? what evidence do you have&#160;? I moved my tlak page because of past vandalism to it by you as can be seen in your frivolous warnings and wiki lawyering tactics and ongoing reports of things that do not exist. Please stop throwing invented crap up on the wall hoping something will stick.</p>

<p>Yes he/she did sugest a suspected socket puppet report after this editor made false claims I evaded a block. This editor still seems to be fixated on this even with evidence given from Durval in the above post that I did not evade a block and both contribution pages that during the block I did not edit. This is the hostile stance I have faced from him since I attemped to NPOV an artical he has strong religous and or political interest over and has lead to all the tactics shown in my talk page. Some of his deception I exposed that is on the talk page was mearly a defense from acusations against Allan Crownshaw in the edit were you called him my leader and tried to make it seem that Phillps person is a mear secetary as can be seen in the archived section or my talkpage. Just constantly facing his allegations becomes a personal attack to him. This editor has even ran off one of the scholars mentioned in the artical as a source and he is only after me because I stand up to this garbage he post<a href="../../../n/a/z/User%7ENazireneMystic_07c5.html" title="User:NazireneMystic">NazireneMystic</a> 18:44, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry if I'm seeming suspicious, but it's just an odd coincidence. You've got a provocative username, you claim to be 14, and your first edit was to create an article on a fringey topic brought up recently by a banned editor. Not harshing your buzz, I'm not an admin and I am not trying to razz you or whatever. It just seemed a bit peculiar.

<dd>Using the word 'shit' in an edit summary is not offensive in itself. Wikipedia's not censored. However, some of the uses are not particularly civil. To see which ones are incivil (see <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>), just replace the word 'shit' with the word 'garbage' - does it still seem unnecessarily blunt or terse? Then it's incivil. If it's just because he's used the word 'shit', then those warnings are not fair. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">type</span></a></small> 15:32, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>I've brought this topic up before and I think it bears repeating- please people let's excercise some common sense. Wikipedia not being censored for minors means we have articles like <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clitoris.html" title="Clitoris">clitoris</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis.html" title="Penis">penis</a> with pictures. This doesn't mean we should use profanity when it doesn't advance the encyclopedia. All that does is drive more people away from the project and make fewer parents and teachers willing to have their kids use Wikipedia. Furthermore, edit summaries are one of the places that people are most likely to read and because of the GFDL will under most circumstances be there indefinitely and are not even easily refactorable like talk pages. Our goal always should be what will help the project most and we should use language accordingly. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 15:43, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well said Joshua!!! It's about common sense Proto. Why not use something else instead of "shit"? The problem is that when the user in question used that word in the edit summary, he/she was refering to something he/she didn't like and wanted it removed. So it is about respecting other contributors and not censorship. I believe <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Civility#Examples" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Civility#Examples" rel="nofollow">this section</a> explains a bit what i am talking about. -- <i><a href="../../../f/a/y/User%7EFayssalF_b498.html" title="User:FayssalF"><font size="2px" face="Verdana"><font color="DarkSlateBlue">Szvest</font></font></a></i> Ω <small><a href="../../../f/a/y/User_talk%7EFayssalF_f604.html" title="User talk:FayssalF"><font style="background: orange"><sup><i>Wiki Me Up ®</i></sup></font></a></small> 15:56, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I see that you decided to make a comment and then <b>immediately</b> post this on AIV.

<dd>Frankly, it <i>is</i> about common sense. Using the phrase 'no shit' is perhaps a bit sarcastic, and maybe not the most suitable phrase. Come on, though - it's not 'really abusive'. Kinda reaching there, the guy (assuming it's a guy) has done nothing particularly wrong. Of course, it's not ideal, and avoiding the use of 'shit' would be preferred. Finding, as Elara says, just three, extremely mild uses of 'shit' in edit summaries across months of good edits is not a problem, at all.

<p>Hello. I just semi-protected <a href="../../../r/o/r/Rory_Fitzpatrick_ee1b.html" title="Rory Fitzpatrick">Rory Fitzpatrick</a>. I figured I would post about here, since it isn't may not appear justified at first glance. The basic story is that a message forum wants to nominate Fitzpatrick to the NHL all-star game as a joke. They have set up a website and are discussing various ways of promoting it, including adding the information to Wikipedia (see their thread about it here: <a href="http://hfboards.com/showthread.php?t=313113" class="external autonumber" title="http://hfboards.com/showthread.php?t=313113" rel="nofollow">[68]</a>). I have removed the unverifiable information a couple of times and just semi-protected it. If another admin feels I was out of line, feel free to unprotect it. Otherwise, I'll unprotect it in a few days. -- <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesTeterenko_c1e2.html" title="User:JamesTeterenko">JamesTeterenko</a> 04:45, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have it on my watchlist. My comment in his talk page has made it back to HFboards with general acceptance that a major media outlet has to report this first. Most users accepted this (oddly apparently not realizing that I was posting in that very thread all the way through), but, of course, a couple wish to add the website anyway. FWIW, I believe these are good faith edits rather than deliberate vandalism, and given how many people (and how many forums) are on board, I am surprised that the level of incidents has been this low. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a> 23:47, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I will leave it to others to discuss the etiquette of the WP:AN/3RR page and the merits of the initial three-hour block, or for that matter of an 8-fold increase in the length of a block based on the protest of the original block. I will note, however, that there appear to be differing views as to when it is appropriate to protect a blocked user's talk page, a step that cuts off all possibility of on-Wiki communication. My understanding had been that this step was considered drastic and was reserved for situations where the page is degenerating into true personal abuse, revelation of private information, or the like. More recently, however, I have seen page protection invoked based on allegedly "disrespectful" responses to a block or replacing one unblock request with another. It might be appropriate to develop a broader consensus on this issue. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 16:32, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A general discussion on the issue is probably a good idea. I went on the logic that you're entitled to one appeal (the unblock template clearly says not to try again), so once you've had that appeal, you have no need to edit your talk page, and it's just a waste of admin's time to let you keep going. Combining an extended block with protecting the page (as I did) is questionable, I think it's right, which is why I did it, but I can see good reasons not to, which is why I undid it again. --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> 16:41, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It looks like Fys may of gotten a bit ahead of him self.. but since when did being interested in 'helping' become part of the blocking policy? Fys actions don't seem overly disruptive, I concur with Brad above about the protection of his talk page. MatthewFenton (talk 16:36, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The disruptive nature was because he "helpfulness" looked like an admin making a decision (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR&amp;diff=88984300&amp;oldid=88982387" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR&amp;diff=88984300&amp;oldid=88982387" rel="nofollow">[69]</a>).

<p>This is a disgrace. Am I to understand that he was blocking for the offense of disagreeing with an administrator? And that the block was extended because he thought that was ridiculous.

<dd>No, he was blocked for disrupting 3RR and refusing to stop when warned.

<p>First post since I got told to basically fuck off from ANI... I haven't read the rest of the conversation, and I don't have time to right now, but in case it's of any importance, Fys sent me an e-mail earlier asking if I wanted to review his block.

<p>I think that Fys has been acting in disruptive ways, (inventing Duty Solicitor as a role, changing the 3RR writeup, claiming ("no block") that 3RR blocks are not to be imposed and giving the impression of being an admin, etc) but I'm not sure I agree that everyone else has been sufficiently sensible in their communication of these issues to Fys. I'm also not sure I agree with Giano's characterisation of events or his comments bordering on personal attacks either, but that should not be much of a surprise, really, we rarely agree on approaches to matters these days. But if Mackensen says that there is reason to be concerned, then stepping back and reviewing matters with a view to making sure things go more smoothly in future might be a good idea. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 17:07, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Giano, I don't think you should bother responding. Anyone following Lar's crusade against yourself knows what to think about his latest comment. Some people are here to write encyclopaedia; others to block these people from editing and to follow them with incivil comments for months. We <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/whowriteswikipedia" class="external text" title="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/whowriteswikipedia" rel="nofollow">now have 1,5 admins for each active editor</a>. Some of these admins find it prudent to block more active and dedicated wikipedians, who contributed to multiple featured articles, as their first action after obtaining the tools. Some defend this behaviour as perfectly reasonable. Since RfA has been broken, it's quite useless to point your opinions on <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a>, <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> or other public boards. --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo">Ghirla</a> <a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo">-трёп-</a> 17:28, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>We have a tradition here that a user can abandon an old account, make a clean break of it, and start over with a new identity and a clean slate, as a fresh start. (with no reputation, good or bad, to build on) If the new identity edits in good faith, and doesn't get into trouble, bygones are bygones. This even holds true (defacto) for people who are indef banned, as long as they don't repeat what got them banned, and never connect the accounts no one would ever know. We also allow changing user names with a retention of history (the name is changed, the old name redirected, etc.) but no "start over". Where it gets muddy is when it seems like some of each is desired. It does seem that way to me, Fys moved some things by copy/paste with a stated reason of wanting it to be harder to tie things together to his older ID. That's not a clean break... a clean break is in my view starting over completely. Many people who are indef banned don't seem to want to really break with their past, they want the best of both worlds. I don't favour that, it needs to be one or the other. If there is probation evasion, etc, the terms of the probation come over if any deliberate connection is made. Including copypasting things to evade easy linking. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 18:02, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've moved Bishonen's post out so it's clear it's not a response to this post, which I think is still an open question... do we have enough people helping out on 3RR to avoid potential conflicts of interest?

<p>I'm quite upset. I agree 100% with all the comments of <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> above, and with his unblocking of Fys. Tango, your notion that a blocked user, confined to his talkpage (how is he going to disrupt the 3RR board from there?) needs to have his block extended, and his page protected, for talking back to you <i>on</i> that page, is hair-raising, and so is your statement above that he has ""no need to edit his talkpage" once the unblock request has been reviewed. Do please consider the unequal power balance between an admin and a blocked user, and the shock effect of being blocked at all; it is to be expected that a newly blocked user will be terse rather than humble, and it is expected that you, from your position of power, be prepared to put up with some of that and stay cool. Yes, even that you extend a little patience to such "disobedience" as restoring the unblock template--what's the huge deal there? What are the tremendous swathes of "admin time" being wasted, what's the "quiet life" being torn to tatters? I'm very sorry you didn't see any need to post here for review <i>before</i> performing those actions, because they're a big deal. Perhaps you should be excused for being a new admin... or perhaps, being new, you should all the more make a point of posting on ANI before zapping a productive user for 24 hours and simultaneously closing off their single means of communication? Please request input from the community next time you feel that a user must be prevented from wasting your time by speaking to you. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 19:30, 20 November 2006 (UTC).</p>

<dd>I think you have a point, additional communication and help might be good, but did you mean it as a reply to my inquiry as to whether more eyes on the 3RR process and notice board might be beneficial? Also do you think that Tango is more likely to learn from friendly feedback and guidance or from the sort of feedback that uses "utterly stupid" and similar phrasing? ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 19:57, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

Even I, who can read your subtext, am bored by seeing you trot out that old Giano grudge/Bishonen grudge for the nth time—how bored must other people be? Sorry if the thread formatting seemed to imply I was speaking to you, I'm not entirely clear on these intricacies. Please note for future reference that unless I should directly address you, you can quite safely assume I'm not speaking to you. I was speaking to Mackensen and Tango.

<dd>Sorry, I redact any claim that you precisely said "utterly stupid". Instead you just said "could be construed as stupidity", "proved that newly qualified admins should not be allowed the block buttons", and "disgraceful" (not your initial remark, just your latch on when someone else said it first)... for which you were warned by Dmcdevit. Twice. Seems pretty clear cut to me, you need to work on how you deliver messages, even when you're right. That's not a grudge, not a snipe, no matter how you or Bishonen spin it, it's merely an observation... that your input to this process may not have been as helpful as it could have been if you had been more collegial. Do you actually dispute that? Further, that it is I that points it out to you doesn't mean it's not true.

<dd>I think you're missing the fact that I extended the block after the *3rd* unblock request, I simply warned after the 2nd. And a blocked user can affect more than just their talk page - they can affect <a href="../../../r/e/q/Category%7ERequests_for_unblock_4c8c.html" title="Category:Requests for unblock">Category:Requests for unblock</a>, which causes other admins to waste time dealing with a matter which has already been dealt with. --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> 20:19, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think the point is, in relation to Tango, that he was an admin of not quite 24 hours standing. He chose to involve himself in a block review involving an admin of quite considerable standing. To decide to unblock is in effect saying to the other admin "You have broken policy and done something you shouldn't have done". I ask as a rhetorical question of human psychology whether a new admin, however fair they try to be, is really going to do that to someone much more senior? No, of course they aren't. They are going to bend over backwards to see the other admin's point of view. That's why Tango should not have chosen to be involved. I do not fault his inexperience as an admin, I fault his judgment in getting involved in something where there was only one conclusion he was ever going to reach. <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFys_bced.html" title="User:Fys">Fys</a>. “<a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFys_bced.html" title="User:Fys">Ta</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fys_a016.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fys">fys</a> <a href="../../../f/y/s/User_talk%7EFys_d202.html" title="User talk:Fys">aym</a>”. 20:04, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are right, I would never have unblocked you, even if I'd disagreed with the original admin, however that doesn't mean I would have endorsed the block. I would have sat back and let someone else deal with it. Agreeing with the original admin is pretty uncontroversial, so there is no problem with a new admin doing so. Disagreeing with the original admin is very controversial, so I wouldn't have gotten involved. You've assumed that I made the decision to get involved before assessing the case, which is completely incorrect - I decided if I felt the block was appropriate, and then decided if I should get involved. --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> 20:19, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is a clear problem with the unblock template, then. Much like flipping a coin where heads count and tails dosen't count, unless adminstrators reviewing unblocks have the courage of their convictions, the answers will ALWAYS be heads, regardless of how many tails were flipped already. How many adminstrators are reviewing unblock requests pro-forma?

<dd>I would imagine most administrators do have "courage in their convictions", as you put it. The only reason I wouldn't generally go against a decision another admin has made is because I'm new to the job - give me and month or two to get used to things, and if I disagree with another admin, I'll do something about it. Until then, I'll let someone else do something about it. --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> 21:54, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That is a slur on every administrator on this encyclopaedia. I, for one, am offended. Am I to understand that this is acceptable discourse? I believe I asked this question two months ago, but was told that because Giano had been so grievously violated by Tony Sidaway that some harsh language was understandable. Well, he wasn't even blocked this time and it's happening again. What especially troubles me is that everything obviously took place on-wiki. The initial block, the extension, the protection, my unblock--everything happened on-wiki. Yet this is all apparently the fault of those grievous off-wiki machinations, which Giano credits as the cause of all our problems. This is utterly unacceptable behaviour, <i>especially</i> from an experienced article editor who has been warned <i>repeatedly</i> that incivility is unacceptable. There have been many words of censure today for an inexperienced admin who made a mistake. Are there any for an experienced editor, who has yet again demonstrated his sovereign contempt for civility and politeness in public discourse? <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 23:01, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Maybe this is a good point for everyone to just stop posting in-thread. The extraneous conflicts are out of order here. Fys is back up and running; his point has been made and agreed with by a number of admins and users, and disagreed with by a number of other ones. I think that this would be an appropriate topic for a RFC for Tango, if Frys wants to continue the point. Everyone else getting into a fight on ANI isn't going to help anyone. Please calm down.

<p><a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a>'s unilateral moves for the remotion of diacritics in articles' names have been reported here on AN/I last month (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;oldid=82526136#Is_this_disruption.3F" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;oldid=82526136#Is_this_disruption.3F" rel="nofollow">[70]</a>) which resulted in a community probation banning him from non consensual article moves (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_sanction/Log#Gene_Nygaard_is_banned_from_non_consensual_article_moves_until_further_notice" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_sanction/Log#Gene_Nygaard_is_banned_from_non_consensual_article_moves_until_further_notice" rel="nofollow">[71]</a>). However, I believe that he might be trying to dodge the probation by his recent attempt to propose a move while tagging along more than ten other moves. On November 17, Gene contested moves carried out by <a href="../../../m/i/b/User%7EMibelz_2c33.html" title="User:Mibelz">Mibelz</a> by proposing <a href="../../../%C3%A1/r/p/%C3%81rp%C3%A1d_%C3%89l%C5%91_4d11.html" title="Árpád Élő">Árpád Élő</a> to be moved back to <a href="../../../a/r/p/Arpad_Elo_c424.html" title="Arpad Elo">Arpad Elo</a> (see <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html#17_November_2006" title="WP:RM">proposal</a> and <a href="../../../%C3%A1/r/p/Talk%7E%C3%81rp%C3%A1d_%C3%89l%C5%91_0f05.html" title="Talk:Árpád Élő">discussion</a>). 13 other moves were associated to Árpád Élő's, resulting in a lack of proper discussion relevant to each individual case. I am frankly worried about this situation because if there is consensus about removing the diacritics to <a href="../../../%C3%A1/r/p/%C3%81rp%C3%A1d_%C3%89l%C5%91_4d11.html" title="Árpád Élő">Árpád Élő</a>, the others would follow suit without even being discussed. This is the nth time that I try to explain to Gene that his moves are disruptive and compromise Wikipedia's accuracy, but it's hopeless really. Could somebody please verify this situation? I propose the 13 moves to be detached from <a href="../../../%C3%A1/r/p/%C3%81rp%C3%A1d_%C3%89l%C5%91_4d11.html" title="Árpád Élő">Árpád Élő</a>'s and I suggest Gene's conduct to be once again evaluated.--<strong><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_60c3.html" title="User:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">Hús</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_Esperanza_ea94.html" title="User:Husond/Esperanza"><font color="green">ö</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User_talk%7EHusond_a306.html" title="User talk:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">nd</font></a></strong> 20:24, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm sorry I didn't have time to dig into this when you brought it to my talk page, thanks for bringing it here. I'm thinking that each of these moves should be discussed and consensed on separately. Bundling them all together by Gene may not be the best approach.

<p>Hi, I have been watching the Indian Buddhist Revival page and it's talk page since I posted a response to an RFC there. I haven't made any edits to the article itself, because the article has a lot of...stuff going on and I want to be very careful to thoroughly source any edits I make.</p>
<p>In the past two days, I've watched as <a href="../../../h/k/e/User%7EHkelkar_b268.html" title="User:Hkelkar">User:Hkelkar</a> has removed every single edit from User:ShrilankaBuddhist. without any comment on the talk page first, and adding what I would describe as inflammatory edit summarys. I've done nothing, though, I really felt for this user - as far as I can tell,he has little command of the English language, and he's doing his best to make good faith edits.</p>
<p>When <a href="../../../h/k/e/User%7EHkelkar_b268.html" title="User:Hkelkar">User:Hkelkar</a> actually removed the post from this user on the article TALK PAGE, I put my foot down[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Indian_Buddhist_revival&amp;diff=89051885&amp;oldid=89045876" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Indian_Buddhist_revival&amp;diff=89051885&amp;oldid=89045876" rel="nofollow">[72]</a>]. This person at least has the right to speak. My very first edit to this page was to revert the talk page. In the edit summary I put "I double dog dare you..."[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Indian_Buddhist_revival&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=89051885" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Indian_Buddhist_revival&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=89051885" rel="nofollow">[73]</a>].</p>
<p>He left the Talk article as it was, and added a comment. He then put a civility warning template on my user page. Another user (whom I barely know) very kindly took it off - not at my behest, though I thank him for it. Hkelkar put it back. The other user removed it. There is now an EDIT WAR going on at my USER TALK PAGE[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:NinaEliza&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:NinaEliza&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[74]</a>].</p>
<p>I want someone to look at this. Hkelkar has no business editing my user talk page. He also, in my opinion, has no business removing a post from an article talk page. The other user is simply helping me do something I would otherwise do myself. I didn't ask him to do it, but I did post a thank you on his talk page the first time he did it.</p>

First he says millions of people converted to Buddhism, not in citation given, now he bumps it down to thousands, using an extremist Sinhala propaganda source. If he uses that then I will use tamilnation.org in the article as well). He clearly has no concept of wikipedia policy and perhaps you should drop a word on his talk pae about civility.In fact, these Neo-Buddhist editors seem to be shuttling back and forth. First Dhammafriend, then he disappears and Ambedkaritebuddhist, now he's gone and Srilankanbuddhist appears. Some kind of sock/meatpuppetry is definitely afoot.</p>

<p>In response to the evidence I presented at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Pseudoscience_f6ea.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Pseudoscience">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Pseudoscience</a>, <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> attempted to start an argument with me <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_arbitration/Pseudoscience/Evidence#Academia" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_arbitration/Pseudoscience/Evidence#Academia" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Essentially, Prosfilaes took aggressive exception to my observation that while academic credentials are correlated with notable ideas, they are neither a cause nor a logical prerequisite thereof. Shortly thereafter, apparently in retribution for requesting arbitration <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration#ScienceApologist" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration#ScienceApologist" rel="nofollow">here</a>, I was aggressively stalked by one "Haldane Fisher", who (among other nuisances) reverted all of my edits, and only my edits, to the article Academic Elitism. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Academic_elitism&amp;diff=88786008&amp;oldid=86586625" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Academic_elitism&amp;diff=88786008&amp;oldid=86586625" rel="nofollow">1</a>,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Academic_elitism&amp;diff=88786300&amp;oldid=88786008" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Academic_elitism&amp;diff=88786300&amp;oldid=88786008" rel="nofollow">2</a>,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Academic_elitism&amp;diff=88814453&amp;oldid=88811585" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Academic_elitism&amp;diff=88814453&amp;oldid=88811585" rel="nofollow">3</a>] Fisher was quickly spotted as a bogus account and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration#Statement_by_uninvolved_user_Cowman109" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration#Statement_by_uninvolved_user_Cowman109" rel="nofollow">blocked</a> by administrator <a href="../../../c/o/w/User%7ECowman109_5ea9.html" title="User:Cowman109">Cowman109</a>. But this was not the end of the problem, for Prosfilaes, apparently smelling a golden opportunity to extend his quarrel with me, immediately <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Academic_elitism&amp;diff=88838449&amp;oldid=88826544" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Academic_elitism&amp;diff=88838449&amp;oldid=88826544" rel="nofollow">capitalized on the situation</a> by following in the footsteps of "Haldane Fisher" and removing <i>all and only</i> my own edits to the page, using the false pretext that only my edits were not referenced. In fact, none of the generic references listed at the bottom of the page were cited <i>anywhere in the section I edited</i> ("Arguments For/Against"), which shows that this pretext was invented by Prosfilaes to cover his violation of WP:Harass. Nevertheless, while trying to hold the line against Prosfilaes' damage to the article, I attempted to reason with him/her on the article's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Academic_elitism" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Academic_elitism" rel="nofollow">talk page</a>. Unfortunately, in return for my patience, Prosfilaes indignantly reported me for "violating 3RR" while again <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Academic_elitism&amp;diff=89005571&amp;oldid=89004930" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Academic_elitism&amp;diff=89005571&amp;oldid=89004930" rel="nofollow">reverting on his own</a>, thus prompting administrator <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">William M. Connolley</a> to block me. When I explained the situation to Connolley, he irritably refused to lift the block. He did, however, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Asmodeus&amp;diff=89046860&amp;oldid=89042593" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Asmodeus&amp;diff=89046860&amp;oldid=89042593" rel="nofollow">advise</a> me to report Prosfilaes to WP:ANI. I'm following Connolley's advice, and would appreciate it if something could be done to prevent a recurrence of this blatant harassment.

Hello all, tis I the 'vandal' This is what happened: I added a remark, a reference from gnosticism ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosticism" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosticism" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosticism</a> ) to Huxely ( Ape and Essence ) that was perhaps too sophisticated for my own good. I got a note from Kchi ( I can't remember what he said, and my record, MY talk page was destroyed by someone ) so I clicked on the link he left on my web page... big mistake, I got the vandalism charge laid on, but I didn't understand what was happening so when other admin warnings ( attacks ) came I replied to the LINK Posted on my Page. I explained all this to no avail. I tried the help button and was roundly abused for it. Meanwhile the record has gone, God knows where and I'm not at all sure other conversations I had on my talk page have been restored by reversion. There's something smelly about the hole thing, some bugs at ( the very )least. Not much better here than the kids running Iraq. Disappointing. Gnothi Sueton.</p>

 The above is a load of thin skinned, small minded crapulence. My SERIOUS OFFENCE was to reply top the links LEFT ON MY PAGE ( there is no talk page on at least the first nasty admin, neither a page search, nor a wiki search turned one up ). There was nothing of vandal in my post. I posted "your God my Satan" on the God discussion page, which is well understood by those with serious interest, education, and intelligence. Not exactly a koan, it was none the less meant to Stimulate thinkers. Also, I didn't have time to discuss the Gnostics and others beliefs that the Old Testement God is the Demiurge, a persona =to Satan, and I said Jews intesd of followers of the old testement ( seems anything resemling criticism of ******* even saying the jews, is damnable while it is quite ok to criticise almost any other group! OH the lunacy in the world!). For the rest, I am not expert in this rather large rule set and rather than a polite redirect I have been threatened with banning'
</pre>
<p>The first page of the user's guide says "be bold", methinks boldness to some of these faux adminitrators would be such things as taking a smell of a can of beer. I am Very disappoited but I suppose I can only blame myself for being very surprised.</p>
<p><br />
Oh, and I "aired my 'dirty laundry'" by asking for help!!!! Methinks there's a student of Karl Rove running things here, now. Unreal the idiocy passing as lofty. It's a sadomaso thing.</p>

[ Saved from dispute res page for future ref: "Label the comment neutrally but do not sign and do not use names (type 02:47, 22 November 2006 (UTC), which gives only a timestamp)....". don't know if I understand this bit? My problems can be picked up at my user talk page, wblakesx talk. I have never modified an article itself, and have never had any problems before. I have found incivility and presumtions, from some admins, of bad faith where none existed. After removing the objected to material have "been left hanging in the air". I replied to links left on my talk page and have been threated for vandalism and serious vandalism. . I am here for procedural reasons only, feedback to avoid runaway system destruction ( info theory and electronics metaphor, also applied in a work called "The Nerves of Government" governance. I firmly believe I have met some admins who are not ethically ot tempermentally up to the job. I don't have a lot of time presently to deal with this but would like to see Wiki not taken by little tyrants. But who cares?Wblakesx 02:47, 22 November 2006 (UTC)];</p>

<p>Would someone mind looking at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mexica_Movement&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mexica_Movement&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">this</a>? I think that User:Aaronjonesinsocal and User:24.72.202.130 are the same person, violating 3RR. Normally I wouldn't take this here, but I'm more concerned by the content he insists on adding than by the 3RR violation. IMHO, if anyone from the organisation in question sees it their lawyers will go into overdrive. Luckily, looking at the IP's contribs, it looks like it's static. I'll give him a final warning, and if he adds the material again, I'll ask for a block.

<dd>I agree that he seems to be the same person as the IP, as they are putting in the same content with the same misspellings. So you can get him on 3RR if he keeps going.... or he can get you similarly. This seems to be a content dispute rather than vandalism, so you aren't immune from 3RR either, and shouldn't call it vandalism on his talk page. (<a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaronjonesinsocal_8739.html" title="User talk:Aaronjonesinsocal">User talk:Aaronjonesinsocal</a>). I suggest a compromise, rather than just reverting. You may be right that the source only mentions flag burning, not violence, but in your reversion, you took out the whole thing out completely, that's a bit much. At least leave in the stuff backed by the source. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 15:35, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry, I forgot to give precisions: of the three sources, 2 are youtube videos, and while the other source is (nearly) reliable, the author of the paragraph grossly misrepresents it, ignoring the content of the entire article (that supports the mexicans) and focusing on one image of someone holding a flag with their fist inside it (no flames). I deleted the entire section because there was already a criticism section that stated the facts: right wing groups have criticised the Mexica movement. 3RR doesn't apply to potentially libelous material, and IMHO this is. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYandman_8146.html" title="User talk:Yandman"><font color="red"><b>yandman</b></font></a> 15:50, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article is basically on lock-down due to an allied group that is violating the spirit of <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>. Please look at all my work that was deleted, as all the reverts involved new information for the article. Disgraceful.</p>
<p>Can someone who is not INVOLVED or allied to this group please review? This POV oriented group of allies <b>is not interested in collaborating in good-faith</b> and the mass reverts without any discussion illustrate this clearly. I believe they are trying to get me to quit Wikipedia out of frustration, that is my honest opinion of this. Can a group of allied editors take over an article, and block all information they dislike? Please review the full content of these reverts tha include whole new paragraphs and sourced info, it's disgraceful conduct.

<dd>Kiyosaki, your edits are usually disruptive, often poorly written, often poorly sourced, and often involve the deletion of good material simply because you don't like it. That is why you're being reverted. You've been doing little else for a month since you got here, mostly on one article, when you're not complaining on AN or AN/I, or being blocked for 3RR. It's also very obvious that you're not a new user, but you won't say what your other accounts are/were, which gives rise to the — possibly unfair but definitely justified — suspicion that you're a banned user. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 07:31, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>SlimVirgin, you were asked as an involved party to not comment. It's obvious I am a new user, I don't know how to "game the system" like you do. You work with allies to violate <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> and limit properly cited, relevant material without explanation . Please stop attacking me and trying to discredit me, if anyone looks at the article's Talk page they can see through your lies. I edit in good-faith, I don't think you do at all. Perhaps you could review <a href="../../../r/e/v/Help%7EReverting_1fd5.html" title="Help:Reverting">Help:Reverting</a> and the entire section on "Dont's" in particular. The "Do's" says: "If you feel the edit is unsatisfactory, improve it rather than simply reverting or deleting it." I have been doing the work, the research, you merely revert what you personally dislike.<a href="../../../k/i/y/User%7EKiyosaki_cbdf.html" title="User:Kiyosaki">Kiyosaki</a> 07:45, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

I did note that I use three separate static IPs, in response to Fact Finder's assertion that to use a static IP is "insane" - the fact that I edit from multiple locations, each with a static IP absolutely does not mean that I am in some way gaming the system, it simply means that most of the places where I edit have static IPs.

<dd>His initial block, as one of a series of socks on the Ecopave AfD, was perfectly valid. Since he was unblocked (on the kind-hearted theory that he'd try to be a productive editor) he's just trolled, edited other users' comments, made legal threats, attacked other users (including kind-hearted Guy, whose idea it was to unblock him in the first place), made the bad-faith speedies of Ecopave's competition Guy mentioned, and filled his talk page and others with increasingly paranoid rants about the army of sock-admins out to get him. While his silliness was confined to his talk page I was content to let him stew, but his renewed propensity to wage his pointless war elsewhere leads me to believe we've indulged his trolling long enough. His initial ban was valid, none of his (hundreds) of subsequent edits have been contributions to the encyclopedia, he's not interested in anything more than whining about his spam campaign being thwarted. Restore his block. -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinlay_McWalter_466b.html" title="User:Finlay McWalter">Finlay McWalter</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/n/User_talk%7EFinlay_McWalter_a93f.html" title="User talk:Finlay McWalter">Talk</a> 14:28, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFelix_Portier_45e1.html" title="User:Felix Portier">User:Felix Portier</a> has uploaded copyright images Image:Women's fiel hockey chile vs australia.jpg, Image:Las leonas vs India.jpg (and others, but it's over these I've had most dealings wih him). I have listed them at <a href="../../../c/p/_/WP%7ECP_e7b9.html" title="WP:CP">WP:CP</a> and informed him. I then removed the image links from the articles where he had inserted either of them: <a href="../../../f/i/e/Field_hockey.html" title="Field hockey">Field hockey</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/s/Las_Leonas_4752.html" title="Las Leonas">Las Leonas</a>. He later amended the image licensing information slightly (still clearly non-compliant however) re-inserted the images into <a href="../../../f/i/e/Field_hockey.html" title="Field hockey">field hockey</a>, and I then gave him 2 hours to remove them again, which he failed to do. So I reverted the addition. Overnight (UK-wise) he has attempted to claim that the images are logos (!) and again inserted them into the <a href="../../../f/i/e/Field_hockey.html" title="Field hockey">field hockey</a> article, and also converted <a href="../../../w/o/m/Women%27s_field_hockey.html" title="Women's field hockey">women's field hockey</a> from a redirect into a stub primarily consisting of the copyvio images. I have again reverted the addition of the images - in both articles. I am not clear if his actions constitute vandalism, and hence if I'm covered by the exemptions to 3RR. It does appear that he may now be a bit more prepared to enter into dialogue (he has just left a message on my talk page about the women's field hockey article). I'd appreciate it if someone else could take a look at his actions (this is not the first time he's run into trouble over images before). <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Underdown_0d41.html" title="User:David Underdown">David Underdown</a> 10:14, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>THanks MGM. Could you or someone lese jsut clarify the situation on 3RR, reverting repeated addition of unfree images doesn't seem to be specifically covered by an exemption - would I be OK to carry on reverting the images if they get re-uploaded? I notice from your edits that i didn't actually manage to remove them from field hockey this morning anyway, I got side-tracked by the changes to Women's Field Hockey, and some constructive intervening edits on Field hockey and didn't get roud to tidying them up. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Underdown_0d41.html" title="User:David Underdown">David Underdown</a> 13:11, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Bishonen then upped the block to a week and more personal attacks ensued after the blocks such as calling Bishonen a "facist" and Calton "sociopatic". Swedenborg's accomplishments here inlcude little more than incivil remarks, personal attacks, spam, edit warring, and attempts to solicit meatpuppets off site. Upon my review of Swedenborg's contributions I am inclined to extend the block to indefinite, but would like some other opinions first. <a href="../../../d/v/d/User%7EDVD_R_W_e2d2.html" title="User:DVD R W">DVD</a>+ <a href="../../../d/v/d/User_talk%7EDVD_R_W_d778.html" title="User talk:DVD R W">R/W</a> 19:27, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think Swedenborg losing his temper when blocked is a big deal, I wouldn't extend his block for such a thing as that. But the lack of constructive edits and the lack of comprehension of what the encyclopedia is for is extremely concerning. As for the edit war "dying down," edit warring is what he does; what makes you think it'll ever die down? Swedenborg seems convinced, from many comments, that he has a moral right to spam articles, that anyone thwarting him (such as Calton) is evil, and that any admin warning him (such as me) is Calton's evil sock. But there's no hurry about extending the block, as he just stormed off in indignation at the amount of evil in the place. I suggest we consider the indef issue when/if he and his edit war return. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 23:24, 22 November 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<li>Okay, I'll be more cautious in future. The other incidents you named : the Ba category incident was over a template that somebody else moved, breaking numerous double redirects without making any effort to redirect them. I didn't feel like fixing all the broken redirects myself, so I just undid his page move. When it became clear that he wouldn't accept my reversion of his move, I ended up accepting that, and fixed all the broken redirects - without any help from him. As for the image restoration: My memory is foggy, but if it's the event I think it was, <s>that was tagged for deletion by somebody who had previously vandalized my user page (or at least, had the same IP address as somebody who had).</s> But I can't remember the event accurately now, and thought that water was well under the bridge. Anyway, I think I have been a bit arrogant lately, and apologise. I will be more cautious, and will take care to follow the proper channels, from now on. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidcannon_cb6f.html" title="User:Davidcannon">David Cannon</a> 00:17, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>Ok, Mytone is *still* editing templates disruptively today. I'm blocking for 24 hours to prevent the continuance of this behaviour.

<p>I have been keeping an eye on <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyrtone86_be3b.html" title="User:Myrtone86">User:Myrtone86</a> for many weeks but never interacted. This is an editor that makes some useful contributions, but <i>does not play well with others</i>. Not at all. Somehow she skates on the thin edge of acceptability all the time. I'm still not sure if a block is warranted, but her activites definitely tend to be disruptive. Perhaps an official warning and a good "talking to" would be sufficient. At least it would establish some official presence on her talkpage for future reference. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_Tropics_7009.html" title="User:Doc Tropics">Doc Tropics</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_Tropics_88a3.html" title="User talk:Doc Tropics">Message in a bottle</a></sup> 17:07, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This user was warned before. Just because those warnings aren't still visible doesn't mean they don't apply. The block is short and contains another warning. That is sufficient.

<p>The page about the Russian language needs to be looked at. Here is an excerpt.</p>
<p>"Russian is not actually a language. It was invented in 1943, by dr. Egor Stravinski, during the second world war. It was originally German propaganda. They invented a race of monsters just like the catholics, which they have been known to persecute for the past 6 million years. Russians do not actually exist, they're just a myth, designed to sdcare children. In 1979, Andreas discovered this but was crucified before he could tell anyone. However he wouldn't have been able to tell anyone, because he doesn't have any friends."</p>

<p>Koavf has managed to rack up <b>eight</b> distinct blocks for 3RR, and 2 more for other disruptive behavior(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Koavf" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Koavf" rel="nofollow">block log</a>).

I just extended his latest 3RR block to idefinite, as I think the community's patience is likely exhausted by now. He has had many opportunities to mend his ways. Having recently returned from a week-long block, he started edit warring again almost immediately. His behavior is unmodified despite the volume of blocks he has received. Of course, I put this possibly-controversial action up for review. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 08:30, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think he deserves an <i>indefinite</i> block, but I think that some kind of length (maybe 3-6 month block) with the option of a "last chance" before indefinite would be appropriate.

<dd>I think this is a very strict block. I have edited on the Western Sahara articles before and I think that Kovaf has been struggling with some users who only have the aim to put certain viewpoints on Wikipedia. I'm not convinced by his neutrality entirely either, but I think the articles could become very unbalanced and that we would lose a valued contributor if he were indefinately blocked.</dd>

<li>I don’t want to interfere in your discussion guys but Robdurbar’s remarks justifying Kovaf’s behavior as just a "a struggle with some users" oblige me to do so. I think this is simply unfair from an admin.</li>
<li>There are reasons why Koavf has been blocked (no need to list them again) and this has nothing to do with any "other users". Trying to Justify his behaviour in this way is simply wrong.</li>
<li>The unbalance of the topic is an other wrong argument. He had the chance to cooperate with all and he clearly did not. Now there is a real chance that the topics will be more balanced and the atmosphere among the editors more co-operative and peaceful. All he was doing is (mis-) using Wikipedia for a platform to fight for the independence of a disputed territory and discouraging others with his obsessive reverts.</li>
<li>There are rules, and they apply for all, so remember which message you will give if you unblock this user; it's like telling everybody "ok, just continue with your edit-warring and reverts, you’ll always find a nice admin to defend and unblock you."</li>

<dd>User Koavf has been reverting and edit-warring on many articles, and especially on Western Sahara related. Normal when he declares in his user page "I try to particularly represent the interests of truth and the Sahrawis of Western Sahara (SADR).", and on Wikime that "I will do my darndest to free Western Sahara". His talk page and contributions show that he resorts to personal attacks, and has trouble issues with a large number of users on a wide range of articles. After coming form every block, he immediately started by reverting all the changes done in his absence, even the articles he was blocked for. Short period blocks seem to "only make him bitter" as he made it clear. Koavf has not shown any change after all the successive blocks. He misuses AWB for increasing edit counts at the price of creating confusion, although he was warned and blocked for it.</dd>
<dd>As to Robdurbar's comment, I think that Koavf has made the articles related to WS very unbalanced, and in his absence you are urged to watch if the "some users" commit the same mistakes as Koavf or are the articles becoming balanced by giving both views of the WS conflict.</dd>
<dd>An indefinite block, or at least (as Francis suggested) a 6-month block after which a "last chance" is given to him to show he changed, otherwise 3RR loses its purpose and becomes a short vacation from Wikipedia before one returns to resume reverting and edit-warring. --<a href="../../../a/_/j/User%7EA_Jalil_1957.html" title="User:A Jalil">A Jalil</a> 00:50, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I didn't mean to infer any bias from most users - including wikima - though I hope he would accept that he, like us all, has some sort of inherent bias. With there being so few contributors to Western Sahara pages, I don't think we can afford to lose Koavf. I appreciate this ban is over conduct, not content, but when banning we do need to consider what a user has contributed to Wikipedia. Equally, I agree, that koavd's contributions have been far from neutral but they have been in good faith. Can we agree to at least reduce this from an indefinate ban? --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 09:31, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is a rather difficult question, as he's mostly editting in territory which is *very* prone to POV-pushing. I'm fairly certain he has done it on occasion, too, and he's certainly revert-warred, but an indefinite block seems a bit harsh... Apart from all this, someone neutral should take a good look at all the Western-Sahara-related articles, as almost all of them contain either a pro-independence or a pro-Morocco POV. —<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightstallion_a8d9.html" title="User:Nightstallion"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Nightst</span></a><a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightstallion_esperanza_7d46.html" title="User:Nightstallion/esperanza"><font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">a</span></font></a><a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightstallion_a8d9.html" title="User:Nightstallion"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">llion</span></a> <a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENightstallion_e2b1.html" title="User talk:Nightstallion"><i>(?)</i></a> 18:08, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Francis, many others and me have been doing just that. We had experienced a very lenghty and hot debate at <a href="../../../m/o/r/Talk%7EMorocco_159c.html" title="Talk:Morocco">Talk:Morocco</a> recently and i am sorry to say that among around a dozen of participants, only Justin was the most <i>tendious</i>. The participants had reached a concensus but Justin kept arguing against that. This is what makes Justin's case a bit torn. On one side, we need to keep all the articles free of POV and on the other side, we need no tendious editing and edit warring.</dd>
<dd>However, as i am not for a permablock, i'd still suggest a ban from editing Morocco/WS related articles as his POV pushing has reached limits. <i><a href="../../../f/a/y/User%7EFayssalF_b498.html" title="User:FayssalF"><font size="2px" face="Verdana"><font color="SteelBlue">Szvest</font></font></a></i> <small><a href="../../../f/a/y/User_talk%7EFayssalF_f604.html" title="User talk:FayssalF"><font style="background: orange"><sup><i>Wiki me up ®</i></sup></font></a></small> 18:21, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As Fayssal said, I would also oppose a permanent block. Koavf is an obstinate user regarding matters relating to his personal views but he has shown willingness to follow dispute resolution procedures. I know this is not the point but Koavf truely believes he's doing the right thing most of the time. Regarding a topic ban or a revert parole, these matters would have to be decided by ArbCom. If anyone wants to take this to arbitration, I am more than happy to express my views on the issue. Personally, I feel a bit guilty as I was informally mediating on the WS/Morocco articles but eventually left these aside because time restrains. Koavf has been with us for long enough to deserve a proper arbitration process instead of a fast-track community ban.

<p>Those opposing a permanent block are doing it out of good faith and kindness rather than out of rational and reality. This is a very clear case of someone for whom 3RR means nothing, blocks mean nothing, and edit-warring is a style. He has proven it again and again and again. There is no hope at all that he will change. I am quite sure many users have been indef blocked for much less than Koavf's record, and if this case were to end in a no-indef ban, it will serve as an argument for warring-editors, and as a blatant failure to enforce Wikipedia's most basic rules.--<a href="../../../a/_/j/User%7EA_Jalil_1957.html" title="User:A Jalil">A Jalil</a> 21:05, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Considering you have been here for under 3 months, I find it hard to believe that you've seen enough of Justin to make that call. Furthermore you have edit warred from the opposite POV to him.

<dd>If three months is a short period, I have actually seen during it koavf racking up so many blocks, using aggressive language, and disregarding Wikipedia's most basic rules, I have seen him promising admins he will obey by the rules but did not hold his word. I have seen 3RR losing its meaning in his case. A bad example for newcomers, like me, Isn't it?. Moreover, you can "see" all one's history of talk and contribs, even if you've been for just one week. So, one's opinion is not weakened (nor strengthened) by how long he/she has been on Wikipedia. You can't help Koavf by trying to redirect attention from his unjustifiable abusive behavior to other users, it is an insult to the admins' intelligence. You (Francis) have been recently blocked for edit-warring. As to my editing on WS, Koavf has reverted me , and would revert you , and everyone who writes anything that does not go his way. Is it enough that I support the WS articles to be filtered from POV by neutral editors (like you), as has been suggested above?.--<a href="../../../a/_/j/User%7EA_Jalil_1957.html" title="User:A Jalil">A Jalil</a> 08:40, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd agree with that. He has put a lot of time into editing up until now, so I wouldn't want to see all that negated by an indefinite ban.

<dd>Personally I believe Koavf can still be of help to this project, and would agree with Nightstallion's idea of a short block.

<p>I may be late for this, and I'm not really into how the process works, but I would be very disappointed if Koavf gets a full-time, all-time, permanent block. As someone said above, his breaches of Wikipedia rules are almost all the result of a single POV battle, where I agree he has been playing rough at times, but he has hardly been the only one to do so. It has been about him trying to fend off Moroccan editors <b>Wikima</b> and <b>A. Jalil</b>, who have for a long time worked in tandem trying to change the tone of Western Sahara-related articles (for better or worse, that's up to anyone to judge). Tellingly, they're both arguing for an indefinite ban above. Perhaps equally tellingly, I'm arguing against it: I haven't edited much lately, but I was generally on Koavf's side in those same battles. So I realize I'm not necessarily more or less credible than his opponents, as I've been part of the same battle.</p>
<p>Now, with that openly declared, I think Koavf should get a second chance, <i>not</i> because we've generally (not always) been on the same side on that one topic, but for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>His edits have been in the grey zone, and he has broken 3RR. But his editing hasn't been malicious in the way I would expect is needed for an indefinite block. He's tried to stick to the rules, and I can't imagine he willingly broke 3RR -- that would just be stupid. There should be a sanction for failing to notice it repeatedly, but come on ... an indefinite ban for scraping up a handful of 3RR breaches over some thousands of edits and tens of edit wars?</li>
<li>Koavf has edited a myriad subjects apart from Western Sahara (something, I may add, which isn't the case with his WS opponents, who are clearly here on a mission), and has made a gazillion edits over a very long period of time. Apart from a good job expanding various odd topics, he has also done a lot of cleaning-up on his free-time, systematizing articles and correcting punctuation etc, which I think shows that he's no single-topic POV pusher: he's in fact a prolific and very serious editor who has unfortunately during this time also dirtied his hands in a few nasty, mostly interrelated, edit wars.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Koavf has made a zillion edits of the sort of blanket changing <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a> to <a href="../../../p/e/o/People%27s_Republic_of_China_82bf.html" title="People's Republic of China">People's Republic of China</a>, (or <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a> to <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_Federation_4de3.html" title="Russian Federation">Russian Federation</a>) without careful checking that the change was appropriate in context.

<li>On Western Sahara specifically, he has done a great job, even if at times his opinions shine through. It's mostly thanks to him that this topic is so well-covered, and he's done a tremendous work filling gaps and editing non-political articles in the periphery of that conflict: not just fighting the battle over flags and sovereignty. He was working diligently and, for the most time, with no apparent bias, on the subject long before these battles even started, and I think it would be a shame to see him blocked after having put all that effort into it.</li>

<li>You accusation against Jalil and me having a "mission" is grave and baseless. Truly, one can say that you and koavf have a mission in the Western Sahara subject.

Koavf has problems with many other users and in other topics as well. Some of them have given their opinion here.

<p>Despite my efforts to dialogate with <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThulean_fc3b.html" title="User:Thulean">User:Thulean</a> and try to be constructive with the infamous disputed article <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_people.html" title="White people">White people</a> (see <a href="../../../w/h/i/Talk%7EWhite_people_c468.html" title="Talk:White people">talk page</a> and <a href="../../../w/h/i/Talk%7EWhite_people_Mediation_9715.html" title="Talk:White people/Mediation">mediation page</a>, and despite having only one single warning (and a totally clean historial before this awful conflict), I have been blocked by administrator <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShell_Kinney_fd26.html" title="User:Shell Kinney">User:Shell Kinney</a> on very unclear grounds.</p>
<p>She wrote (sounds very emphatic but there are no grounds):</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>You've been asked multiple times by many people to stop being incivil, stop attacking other editors and especially to stop harassing Thulean.

</dl>
<p>As far as I can tell (there's no PAIN case, no diffs, no nothing) she could have been decided that I was making a persona attack on the following items (all based on what is written in <a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7EShell_Kinney_fbce.html" title="User talk:Shell Kinney">her talk page</a>)</p>
<p>1. My comment inside a large discussion (almost unilateral teaching by my side) on European genetics (as per the diff provided by Thulean in Shell's talk page) that read:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Aditionally, I think you should check <a href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/21/7/1361/F04" class="external text" title="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/21/7/1361/F04" rel="nofollow">this map</a>, from a previously sourced paper, where it does make a rather conclusive division between Neolithic (Near Eastern) and Paleolithic (Basque) ancestry.

</dd>
</dl>
<p>2. My attempt of protest at his abuse on this kind of accusations that read:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>LOL - that's not an attack. I'm just saying that you really have no clear idea of where your ancestors may ultimately be from (and this is only in realtion with European genetics, a discussion on which you have shown very poor understanding).</i></dd>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>So where is the personal attack? I wonder. There's no such thing anywhere.</p>
<p>I am a little angry and sarcastic, maybe. But there's not a single personal attack in all those sentences (nor in anything I've written in a good while).</p>
<p>There are also no such repeated warnings that Shell talks about. I just have <b>only one warning</b> from Shell herself and surely two dozens of pseudo-warnings (harassment) by Thulean. Nobody else has said anything about my behaviour, much less in a formal manner.</p>
<p>The first comment must be contextualized in a longer debate between Thulean and I on European genetics (<a href="../../../w/h/i/Talk%7EWhite_people_c468.html#Just_for_the_record" title="Talk:White people">Talk:White people#Just for the record</a>), where Thulean made also despective comments like:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>LOL. By your "logic", the "European genome" is found mostly in Saudi Arabia...I dont want to dignify your other claims with more responses but I suggest you to read about this subject before making absurd claims.</i></li>
<li><i>What part of this can't you get into your head?</i></li>
</ul>
<p>And I was patiently replying in length, providing sources and all that can be done to reach an understanding, exposing carefully my understanding (based in many genetic studies) that European and West Asian genomes are strongly linked and that is dificult to find what is specifically European if anything...</p>
<p>He just made those short disdainful claims, no sources, no ideas... but specially no constructive attitude at all.</p>
<p>And then I bring up another source that suggests that Scandinavians are 50% West Asians and make that comment about playing with genealogies and the next I know is that he's writing to Shell to complain.</p>
<p>I protest and what do I get? A block.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p><b>I request</b>:</p>
<p>1. To find out wether any of those comments actually constitutes a PA and why. I just don't see it. I was trying to be pedagogical and hoping he might learn something of all this mess.</p>
<p>2. If nothing is found that the block is reverted retroactively, just for the record.</p>
<p>3. To recuse permanently Shell Kinney from any future case that I may be accused of. At this point I have not the slightest trust in her ability or neutrality and I am doubting seriously of her good will.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Additionally I have disconnected myself from the White people article, discussion and mediation. This has crossed all red lines and I just can't bear this anymore. The article is a collective responsability of Wikipedia (that means in abstract: all wikipedians) and I have done much more than my share, getting as reward only an unbearable witch-hunt and some scars that will take some time to heal.</p>
<p>And I am not the only one, I believe. This one-sideness of Shell Kinney is causing problems to all wikipedians of good will, as far as I can see. Soon that article will have only one editor and that one will be Thulean (and maybe ideologically akin Dark Tichondrias too). I have done what I could but I can't keep that push if the Wikibureaucracy, impersonated as Shell Kinney, is so hostile against me and other veteran serious editors. --<a href="../../../s/u/g/User%7ESugaar_6002.html" title="User:Sugaar">Sugaar</a> 07:08, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sugaar, on first inspection of your pages, the mediation, and Shell's talk page, Shell is right that you have been crossing the line into personal attacks. You seem to be extremely resistant to hearing that, but please listen: it's not ok to attack people on Wikipedia. What you're doing is beyond the limits of what the community feels are ok. The things that the people you're arguing with are doing aren't going across the line. Please, calm down, and listen to people in the mediation and elsewhere.

<dd>I think there's no PA anywhere. But more important: there are not the many warnings that Shell claims.

<dd>Block is according to <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> a measure against extreme cases:

<dl>
<dd>I am also worried about ALWAYS being judged by the same administrator and precisely by the one who seems most heavily biased against me. I hope not to get involved in any more PAIN cases now that I have detached myself from the conflictive article but you never know and, just in case, I request that the next time the administrator judging my hypothetical case is someone different. I think it's a very reasonable request. --<a href="../../../s/u/g/User%7ESugaar_6002.html" title="User:Sugaar">Sugaar</a> 08:24, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was the admin who declined your unblock request. I'd say that comparing someone to a skinhead ("like the Jewish skinhead of the BBC article, you may get burnt") is a personal attack. <i>I</i> for one would have been quite offended, had I been the subject of that comment. At the very least, it's a serious breach of civility, especially in a content dispute in <i>such</i> a contentious article as <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_people.html" title="White people">white people</a>. Additionally, you actively mock your opponent's knowledge of genetics in your second comment, and even <i>admit</i> that it may be a personal attack. That right there shows me that you know exactly what a personal attack is, and that you know when you're making one. For my part as a neutral, uninvolved party, (I don't think I've ever edited <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_people.html" title="White people">white people</a> in my life) I must support the (now-long-expired) block. <font color="#000000">♠<a href="../../../p/m/c/User%7EPMC_03a4.html" title="User:PMC">P</a></font><a href="../../../p/m/c/User_talk%7EPMC_cf58.html" title="User talk:PMC"><font color="#FF00FF">M</font></a><font color="#000000"><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Premeditated_Chaos_3dcc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Premeditated Chaos">C</a>♠</font> 17:57, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It wasn't a PA and that's why I feel that this is a witch hunt. It wasn't meant to compare with an skinhead but I mentioned the case earlier in the conversation (what seemed funny to Thulean, as he replied with one "LOL") and I thought the comparison was appropiate not because I may think this or that about his ideology but because the skinhead that found out that he was Jewish seemed a good comparison for a person who is claiming that Scandinavia has no West Asian heritage (my documentation suggested it is c. 50%), hence the "Nordic Semitic" irony.</dd>

<p>Its very disappointing to see this come up again. When Sugaar was first calling Thulean a nazi, he opened an Arb case, tried mediation and finally posted here complaining because I had warned him. He was told every place he went that it was a personal attack; he continued the attacks on the <a href="../../../w/h/i/Talk%7EWhite_people_Mediation_9715.html" title="Talk:White people/Mediation">mediation</a> page and was warned there by the mediator. He refuses to accept that warnings from the aggrieved party are valid as he has many of those as well. I spent more than a week discussing personal attacks and civility in great detail with Sugaar and gave him many ideas of how he could avoid this problem in the future. He is now following Thulean around and making belittling and rude comments where ever he goes - I hope the two agree to stay away from each other since they cannot work together. <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShell_Kinney_fd26.html" title="User:Shell Kinney">Shell</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7EShell_Kinney_fbce.html" title="User talk:Shell Kinney">babelfish</a></sup> 18:47, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't want to discuss with Shell. She has shown to be strongly one-sided and I doubt her sincerity and good-will at this point. I ask Shell to recuse herself from any further cases involving me, LSLM or Thulean, or anything related with the problematic article. If I can recuse her, I do it.</dd>
<dd>Still, just for the record:
<ul>
<li>I have not persecuted Thulean anywhere. I had Shell's talk page watched, as it activates as such when you write in it. So I protested his irregular pseudo-PAIN demand. Was it rude or just somewhat sarcastic? I sadly can't trust Thulean or Shell. And it is not a PA in any case, much less an extreme case that requires a block.</li>
<li>I opened the ArbCom because I got confused on what procedure to follow and misread Shell re. mediation. Later I admitted she was partly right and retrieved the case myself. We went to mediation as per her suggestion and the case was rejected as pertaining to ANI. I posted here and some administrators clarified my doubts. Fine: case closed (I hoped).</li>
<li>Andronico (the mediator) only said that Shell's only warn was right regarding the PAIN, something I disputed then. He did not warn me for any other thing but the same that she did. So it's not any additional warning in any case. Just that he agreed with Shell then.</li>
<li>The warnings from Thulean are as valid as any warnings I could post in his talk page. I am not so easily "offended" as he is, so I have not intiated any sort of action against him nor ever visitied his user page. I don't think that what he's doing is right and I don't want to fall to the same type of lawyering harassment. It would be against my own feeling of dignity and good will. Anyhow, Thulean's "warnings" are just his personal opinion and I consider most of them insulting and harassing. They are not official nor any thing of the like.</li>
<li>I don't agree with Thulean in almost anything, no matter how hard I try. But I have decided for my own emotional and mental health to disconnect permanently from that article, that was what Thulean wanted from the beginning anyhow. I hope not to find that element ever again in my life... but you never know. As he feels his tactics are successful, he may want to expand his area of action and we may find each other in any other article. I may also be unlucky enough to meet with someone else with his same more than dubious methods, or any other case, like I myself being attacked by another user, as happened in the past once and was solved to my total satisfaction and with remarks of having managed the case very well by the involved administrators. I believe that would Shell have to manage any other case involving me she would have a clear.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Finally I find quite offensive the a priori attitude of some administrators that read: "this user has a warn" and seem to understand "he's systematically problematic", without even looking at his/her historial, that in my case was perfectly clean until I stumbled with that element and his favorite administrator.</dd>
<dd>If the case is not reviewed, next time (hopefully never) they may say: "this user has a block: he's a convicted dangerous criminal", no matter I never had a proper trial. As blocks are only suppossed to be issued in very extreme cases, they could even have some reason to think so in principle, and that's why I am requesting that the case is throughtly reviewed to see if the alleged personal attacks actually constitute reason for a block. What I think is clearly abusive interpretation of the policy and dangerous abuse of power. --<a href="../../../s/u/g/User%7ESugaar_6002.html" title="User:Sugaar">Sugaar</a> 23:13, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

You also as administrators, maybe more than anyone else have to abide by our community standards. And it's clear that, if there was any fault (what I question strongly), it wasn't such a severe case as to generate a block.

<dd><i>In extreme cases, an attacker may be blocked under the "disruption" clause of the blocking policy, though the practice is almost always controversial.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Can you point out which is the personal attack(s) at all and, if it exists (that I deny), why is it so <b>extreme</b> as to justify a block? Else, can you proceed with the review, as requested? Thanks.</p>
<p>Note 1: my impression is that you're just backing each other (out of mere corporative solidarity maybe) without putting forward anything that justifies the application of such clause.</p>
<p>Note 2: I have never rejected the norms of Wikipedia, I may have violated them out of ignorance and maybe arrogance in the past, not in this case, but I accept that I must abide by them. Can you do the same and apply the policy correct and justly without prejudice against me? That's what we, the users of Wikipedia, expect from you: fairness and justice. Nothing more but nothing less. --<a href="../../../s/u/g/User%7ESugaar_6002.html" title="User:Sugaar">Sugaar</a> 01:35, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Aditionally, I don't mean to "wikilawyer". I just mean justice. I believe that the one wikilawyering was Thulean and that he does have bad faith whatever you may think. The common of us mortals has not the steel nerves he has to be so calculating.</p>
<p>I have 100% dropped any relation with the article in question voluntarily. I am not risking a heart attack for that. But I believe someone should investigate a little and find that Sugaar has a totally clean historial before this nasty problematic, two years editing Wikipedia productively (I don't know how many edits I may have but must be over the thousand or more), not a single conflict other than the typical POV riff-raffs (and not many). I am not any <b>extreme case</b> and your severity and lack of imparciality seems totally out of place.</p>
<p>I think honestly that some among you should step forward and try to see my point of view. I am no wikilawyerist. I have only filed a single RFI before this awful situation, I took attacks and hostility for one month before doing it, and that single case was ruled in my favor with all blessings (he did got a block, but only after repeated vandalism). I have never ever been accussed of anything by anyone before Thulean stepped in out of nowhere. So what's the problem?</p>
<p>For you I am not (apparently) but just another quasi-anonymous troublemaker. But I had a completely clean and productive historial and your lack of fairness and seriousness in investigating the case is dirtying it.</p>
<p>And some among you even dare to make threats, without even studying my appeal. This is total madness. I have no other name for this. --<a href="../../../s/u/g/User%7ESugaar_6002.html" title="User:Sugaar">Sugaar</a> 02:03, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

I was trying to discuss with a person that has very marked ideas on what he wants and is not used to Wikipedia working style (though he's getting addict at PAIN and your user page). I was trying to be pedagogic and constructive and the whole last section of <a href="../../../w/h/i/Talk%7EWhite_people_c468.html" title="Talk:White people">Talk:White people</a> page and <a href="../../../w/h/i/Talk%7EWhite_people_Mediation_9715.html" title="Talk:White people/Mediation">Talk:White people/Mediation</a> are evidence of my constructive and positive behaviour (though not of Thulean, but anyhow).</p>
<p>There were no <i>Persistent personal attacks</i>. Not since the warn and what you took as such isn't but a touch of irony and then a little more angry sarcasm. But no major nor constant PA, nothing that might justify a block of any sort. I was just discussing genetics, census of Latin America and future possibilities for the article structure and discouraging LSLM from keeping his tone of political denounce, as it seems to be problematic.</p>
<p>Besides <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBLOCK_89b0.html" title="WP:BLOCK">WP:BLOCK</a> says:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Blocks are used to prevent damage or disruption to Wikipedia. They should not be used as a punitive measure.</i></dd>
<dd>...</dd>
<dd><i>Caution should be exercised before blocking users who may be acting in good faith.</i></dd>
<dd>...</dd>
<dd><i>Blocks may be damaging when consensus proves elusive. Examples include:</i>
<ul>
<li><i>blocks of logged-in users with a substantial history of valid contributions, regardless of the reason for the block</i></li>
<li><i>blocks that, while possibly wise, lack policy basis.</i></li>
<li><i>short term or cool-down blocks, e.g. if a user is angry about something controversial, blocking that user will rarely cool him or her down</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Obviously you ignored all that.</dd>
</dl>
<p>You are claiming a justification that does not exist and, meanwhile, you ignored all the rest of WP:BLOCK. You used block as means of punishment, you took no cautions but acted on impulse (I deduce), you blocked an active user with a substantial history of valid contributions, you blocked without any policy basis, you tried to use the block as a "cool down" block.</p>
<p>You broke all the rules.</p>
<p>My appeal is more than justified. And it is not just for my name but specially for the good working of Wikipedia that I am appealing.</p>
<p>Besides I insist that you recuse yourself or get recused otherwise on intervening in cases affecting my person or the controversial article (where I won't be anymore anyhow but you may cause more damage than good), as you have clearly shown strong bias and misuse of policy. --<a href="../../../s/u/g/User%7ESugaar_6002.html" title="User:Sugaar">Sugaar</a> 07:12, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also: I don't see where the RfC fits in. The right place to appeal a wrong block is ANI, as per <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBLOCK_89b0.html" title="WP:BLOCK">WP:BLOCK</a>. RfC is for articles, users' editing or civility behaviour (maybe Thulean or you, Shell, should had started with that) and policies and conventions. Not for appealing a block or, it seems to me, recusing an administrator.</p>
<p>I think everybody would gain if you would recuse yourself voluntarily. And I have no questions about the validity of my appeal as such and, the more policy I read, the more convinced I am that the block was absolutely wrong.</p>
<p>Additionally, I have no interest in persecuting any direct confrontation with you, Shell, and, definitively, I won't be disturbing the peace of your campaign for ArbCom or your user page. Personally, I have no problem if you and I don't talk to each other for a while. But I can't trust you after this. I don't know how you expect me to trust an administrator who instead of appliying the policy and guidelines applies martial law, that uses wrong (I'd say "false", but maybe it's too harsh) justificactions for her actions, that has clear prejudice against one side of a very complex and difficult conflict, that assumes that if I did wrong once I will always do the same without any comprobation. No: I've seen other admis recussing themselves on much weaker grounds but you insist in staying in charge and admit no error.</p>
<p>I don't know what you expect from me. I strongly believe in Wikipedia's principles, independently on wether I may agree or disagree, be aware or not of some particular aspect, and I am each day more convinced that you have broken all them with this totally unjustified block.</p>
<p>I understand that you can commit errors. We all do. But I also think you should meditate on this and accept what is your part of fault. That's actually much more honest and respectable than just castling on your unjustifed position. --<a href="../../../s/u/g/User%7ESugaar_6002.html" title="User:Sugaar">Sugaar</a> 08:43, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sugaar, your complaint here is bordering on stalking Shell. Please give it up and move on. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 10:02, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't mean to stalk anyone. I just mean justice done. If the common user must abide to policy, much more administrators.</dd>
<dd>I have tried to avoid direct discussion with Shell because at this moment doesn't really seem helpful. I have unwatched her talk page and any other case related pages apart of this one.</dd>
<dd>But I am right and you are not applying policy as you are suppossed to be done.</dd>
<dd>I insist you do your work and stop protecting each other: study my appeal, determine if the block was right and say why. I have put forward many reasons so far why this block was totally wrong.</dd>
<dd>As I said, we all commit errors but we must be able to admit it and fix them. It is my right and my duty as wikipedian to appeal an unjust block. I must not renounce to it and you should not abide by other reasons than policy: that's why you have been named administrator, not to protect each other but to protect Wikipedia and good willed wikipedians as I believe I am.</dd>
<dd>I am astonished that no administrator here has said: you have a point Sugaar, policy was violated in your case and your appeal is at least in this or that way correct.</dd>
<dd>I am also disappointed because Shell, on whose good will and seriousness as administrator I once believed in, doesn't seem to be able to admit her error. I'm not calling for the head of anyone, just for justice and due prudence.</dd>
<dd>And personally I have felt stalked myself by Thulean and this attitude protected by Shell and other administrators somehwat. I am insomniac, I am smoking double than normal and I am quite worried at some "irregular" trends inside Wikipedia only now I am realizing.</dd>
<dd>I have a great trust in Wikipedia as such and, if I dropped the case I would be betraying it and Wikipedia itself. It is a very good case but I am still waiting for any of you to step forward and admit even a small part of the great deal of reason I do have. That also worries me, sincerely. You have a major responsability as administrators: you are the custodians of the integrity of Wikipedia (and its policies and spirit). I want to think you will be at the height of the enormous trust that Wikipedia has deposited on you.</dd>
<dd>And this is the place where I am suppossed to appeal my unjust block. I still have to see my appeal rejected with any good reason. Just calls for dropping the case, for giving up without any grounds. ::I am very worried at Wikipedia's system of justice. --<a href="../../../s/u/g/User%7ESugaar_6002.html" title="User:Sugaar">Sugaar</a> 10:37, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>I'd like to say few things. Of course I'm hugely biased but hear me out. First of all, Sugaar called me Nazi many times, among other PA's. I warned him unofficially and then officially and then reported him and he got a warn. After all this he continued and was even warned by the meditator. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AWhite_people%2FMediation&amp;diff=86521103&amp;oldid=86518346" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AWhite_people%2FMediation&amp;diff=86521103&amp;oldid=86518346" rel="nofollow">[117]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And even after all this Sugaar went to Shell Kinney's page and even managed to continue his PA's while appealing. See <a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7EShell_Kinney_fbce.html#You_are_not_being_just" title="User talk:Shell Kinney">User_talk:Shell_Kinney#You_are_not_being_just</a></p>
<p>An example:</p>
<p>"But that page has been under consistent attack by (mostly anonymous) vandals of clearly nazi/racist ideology. Thulean and Dark Thicondrias have been the only ones in that spectrum to do it with a username."</p>
<p>I've also made a response there, at the bottom of that section, trying one last time to tell how I feel. But afterall this he likened me to a jewish skinhead. So I believe the block was just. Shell Kinney has been very patient with him despite continuous accusations from Sugaar:</p>
<p>1) He claimed Kinney refused meditation. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AShell_Kinney&amp;diff=87156667&amp;oldid=87149018" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AShell_Kinney&amp;diff=87156667&amp;oldid=87149018" rel="nofollow">[118]</a></p>
<p>2) His answer when told that he was wrong: "You are right: you accepted the mediation request but I misread you because of your patronizing tone and threatening questioning of my terminology." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AShell_Kinney&amp;diff=87166685&amp;oldid=87156667" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AShell_Kinney&amp;diff=87166685&amp;oldid=87156667" rel="nofollow">[119]</a></p>
<p>3) His meditation was rejected and he moved it to ANI. But he accused Kinney of misleading him again. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AShell_Kinney&amp;diff=87825422&amp;oldid=87824011" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AShell_Kinney&amp;diff=87825422&amp;oldid=87824011" rel="nofollow">[120]</a> which was wrong: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AShell_Kinney&amp;diff=87875611&amp;oldid=87826796" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AShell_Kinney&amp;diff=87875611&amp;oldid=87826796" rel="nofollow">[121]</a></p>
<p>4) After ANI, he accused Kinney of not mentioning the correct policy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AShell_Kinney&amp;diff=87824011&amp;oldid=87803247" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AShell_Kinney&amp;diff=87824011&amp;oldid=87803247" rel="nofollow">[122]</a> which was also wrong <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AShell_Kinney&amp;diff=87826796&amp;oldid=87825422" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AShell_Kinney&amp;diff=87826796&amp;oldid=87825422" rel="nofollow">[123]</a></p>
<p>He also directed PA's to Kinney, one of which was pointed out by another administrator:</p>
<p>""we can hardly struggle against such one-sided admins as you, really." ... ...That would also qualify as a personal attack, per WP:NPA. So far as I can see, that's all Shell has been trying to tell you.

And besides "For instance, I have been warned for descibing one POV-pushing editor's ideology as "nazi" and "racist", which is blatantly true", he managed to say this:</p>
<p>"This is just allowing certain twisted people to gag others."</p>
<p>And he said this AFTER his block.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3ANo_personal_attacks&amp;diff=88572281&amp;oldid=88336682" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3ANo_personal_attacks&amp;diff=88572281&amp;oldid=88336682" rel="nofollow">[126]</a> Amazing...</p>
<p>And his refusal to apply wiki policy of "commenting on debate, not on editors" seems NOT only towards me:</p>
<p>"If not in the ANI, where admins seem to behave like a wolfpack..."</p>

<dd>What Thulean may say does not hurt me. What hurts is that you and the other admins accept his activity as valid. That was my private comment to another user that has been also witch-hunted by Thulean and you (though he's much more stubborn in ignoring NPA) and was only intended that way. Not for you to read, not to cause harm to anyone, just to express my feelings at all this.</dd>
<dd>I really want some other administrator to step in, anyone cannot be less neutral than you. If I would not want other admins to take note and act, I would not be appealing at ANI but probably just quitting Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>But I want that other administrator(s) to take a look at this appeal first and resolve clearly on it. Nobody has done that yet.</dd>
<dd>In any case, if you or Thulean think that's a fault, it should be a separate case, it can't afect my appeal because it is not cause of that block but a comment on how unjust it is and how I feel treated here by the admins who are suppossed to review the case. But it has no relevance to the case as such. It's only loosely connected.</dd>
<dd>If you are such a good and fair administrator as you and others seem to believe, you should accept my part of reason, what this appeal is about. And therefore you should remove a block that is so clearly against policy.</dd>
<dd>You cannot pretend that I have not done my best to correct my error on ideology as cause of PA. It is clear that I have, but you are ignoring it. You cannot ignore that since the first warn was made and clarified I have not made any personal attacks against Thulean or anyone and that what you are taking as such are just totally decontextualized irony (and anyhow an isolated case).</dd>
<dd>That's the problem: you tag someone as "troublemaker" and he/she seems to have to carry that mark forever and ever no matter how hard one tries. Now by applying unjust emergency measures against me you have tagged me as "convicted criminal", no matter that you are judge, jury and part and I never had any sort of trial. What I want is that trial, even if <i>a posteriori</i>.</dd>
<dd>I can't renounce to that because that would be betraying the values of Wikipedia and as member of this community I feel strongly about defending its values. You should too and therefore you should not have abused of your power nor violated policy. And, as you actually did, the less you could do is admit your errors and revert your wrongdoing.</dd>
<dd>I have read twice or thrice RFC by now and nowhere it says that administrators' actions are to be dealt with that way. We both must abide to policy and hence I stand that here is where this appeal belongs. --<a href="../../../s/u/g/User%7ESugaar_6002.html" title="User:Sugaar">Sugaar</a> 19:28, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Obviously I wasn't placing anyone in danger (and I deny it was any personal attack). But that's the only case that is admitted by the policy. Please, Shell or whichever one is in charge. Admit the error and undo the block, else I will have to go to ArbCom, what for me is a waste of energies but surely that's also something that nobody here wants. I don't know how ArbCom would in practice rule this, but every single piece of policy supports my case (and by now you should know I'm not leaving this abuse standing). So let's not make it more difficult, Shell, and please let's fix it in voluntary good-will terms: you delete the block, you recuse yourself from any further case involving me and the White people article. I decline to intervene in that article anymore (I have already done it). Let's close the wound but let's do it well. Else, unless some other admin intervenes here and accepts my appeal in its due terms, this will have to go to ArbCom and it is a very clear case of abuse of policy and sysop powers. --<a href="../../../s/u/g/User%7ESugaar_6002.html" title="User:Sugaar">Sugaar</a> 06:14, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It was no <i>persistent personal attacks</i>. I had stopped that (ideological identification) after the ONLY WARN and Thulean knows it well, as all the late part of <a href="../../../w/h/i/Talk%7EWhite_people_c468.html" title="Talk:White people">Talk:White people</a> and the Talk:White people/Medietion pages show clearly. Besides it was no personal attack but just contextualized irony and that's why I wrote "stop whinning" under your totally unjustified complaint.</p>
<p>I am not wikilawyering (that's Thulean, who likes to jump to the throats of people who dispute his POV). I am extremely concerned, every day more, about possible abuse of policy by Wikipedia administrators, as happened in this very clear case.</p>

<p>SlimVirgin is harassing me.

I do not believe that my comments violate BLP or any other policy. It is proper for me to ask editor Cberlet whether his edits violate an arbcom ruling, as I think they may. I especially object to SlimVirgin trying to keep the whole matter secret rather than allowing the community to observe and make their opinions known. --<a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENathanDW_d5ae.html" title="User:NathanDW">NathanDW</a> 01:58, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>However, it is worth stating that the <i>approach</i> taken here was sub-optimal. In almost no instance is blanking text without an edit summary going to accomplish anything, the page protection(s) was/were probably uncalled for, and the talk-page warning was a little Draconian. No point using a steamhammer to crack cashews, really. The body of NathanDW's complaint reads as more about how it was handled than any objections to the idea of having negative statements well sourced.<br />

<dd>There's been a lot of nonsense on that talk page for a long time, conducted by various editors, including LaRouchies. It was mentioned during an ArbCom case (I believe it was Nobs01), and it was decided that material not directly related to the article could be removed. Editors need to understand that they can't leave snide comments for the subject of the article on the talk page; if they want to speak to him about his real-life persona, they should contact him off-wiki, where he'd be able to ignore them more easily than when they're pestering him on the article talk page. Also, it's incorrect that I left no edit summaries; the summaries were "archiving," "blp issues," and "see your talk page" to NathanDW, followed by an explanation there. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 04:12, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have no beef with the <i>results</i> and agree with your stand regarding using using the page to communicate in "real-life." However:
<ul>
<li>Semi and full protection should be used sparingly. Here dealing with the editors directly would have been preferable to the slightly brute-force approach. Looking over the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Chip_Berlet&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Chip_Berlet&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">history</a> of the talk page, there does appear to have been a fair bit of frippary, but not to protection-requiring levels.</li>
<li>Atempting to "tidy up" discussion without transparancy usually only ends up in having it spill out elsewhere. <i>Replacing</i> the material with an expository paragraph reminding users of their "living person" obligations would have had a better chance to succeed in the longer run.</li>
<li>I was referring specifically to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Chip_Berlet&amp;diff=88853501&amp;oldid=88851031" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Chip_Berlet&amp;diff=88853501&amp;oldid=88851031" rel="nofollow">this</a> edit when I spoke of not using edit summaries. Further, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Chip_Berlet&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=88853501" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Chip_Berlet&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=88853501" rel="nofollow">the "archiving"</a> edit was also a bit non-standard as there already existed two "page move" style archives.</li>

<p>Excuse me, maybe I'm a bit slow. I suggested to Cberlet that his edits to the article may have violated an ArbCom decision. I agreed with an earlier editor who said that his decision to change the word "liberal" to "progressive" was POV. And, I pointed out to Cberlet that statements he had just made on the talk page were contradicted by his own real life published statements. Can someone please explain how any of this violates WP:BLP? It seems to me to be normal talk page activity. --<a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENathanDW_d5ae.html" title="User:NathanDW">NathanDW</a> 02:07, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>You mean other than your unsourced and borderline libelous claims regarding what Berlet is supposed to have called "prominent conservatives", nope, can't see a violation of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> here. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 02:12, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Other than harassing the real person on the talkpage of the <i>bio</i>, not a thing. The talkpage is for discussing the article. If you think pestering its subject about his real life is "normal talk-page activity", perhaps you missed the post from SlimVirgin above? It makes it very clear what bio talkpages are <i>not</i> for, so let me quote it for you over again: "Editors need to understand that they can't leave snide comments for the subject of the article on the talk page; if they want to speak to him about his real-life persona, they should contact him off-wiki." It's quite simple, really: don't "suggest to Cberlet" and don't "point out to Cberlet". You're doing it <i>in the wrong place.</i> <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 03:06, 22 November 2006 (UTC).</li>

<dd>Pointless sarcasm aside, there are (at least) three issues here. Going in reverse chronological order:
<ol>
<li>How it was handled it (per above),</li>
<li>How to handle editor/article duality in cases like this, and</li>
<li>How these talk page edits relate to the living person's guideline.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>It's best to pretend the editor is not the article subject as #2 can get messy quickly. So instead of saying <i>"and <b>you</b> never tire of calling him a fascist"</i> say <i>"and <b>Berlet</b> never tires of calling him a fascist."</i> This would help to make it more clear what's normal talk page interaction and what's out of bounds. This approach also makes it a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">sourcing</a> issue rather than a <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">civility</a> issue. Which leads nicely to #3... <u>Provide citations for these claims and there is no problem here.</u> I'd prefer to avoiding re-hashing #1 above, but NathanDW is (clumsily) addressing a valid point, that this guideline should not be used to stifle debate, and that it's neither required nor productive to "vanish-ify" discussions of this sort.</dd>

<p>I'd like to ask Physicq210, ArmadilloFromHell, Ryulong, and so on a question. I have been contributing towards cleaning up some areas where Wikipedia talkspace and wikispace is being misused, as opposed to articlespace. I'm labeled as "overciting" policy when a user removes a speedy delete tag I placed — something classified as vandalism. The user responds incivilly by stating I don't know what I'm doing, then removes the entire section from his talk page — and shows no sign of putting it anywhere else. Something that my brother, on his anonymous IP account, was blocked for 24 hours for. I tell him he's not supposed to do that, and all of a sudden, you gentlemen here are talking about blocking my account? And as a "disruptor" or a "sockpuppet," moreover -- or, worse yet, a "policy wonk"?

The way things should be under an administrator's subjective viewpoint? The reason policies exist is so that people have metrics by which they know whether they're going to get punished or not. If any behavior a particular admin doesn't like can be slapped with a "block due to disruption" label, then why do policy pages exist here at all? — <a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWhedonette_62db.html" title="User:Whedonette">Whedonette</a> <small>(<a href="../../../w/h/e/User_talk%7EWhedonette_ff0b.html" title="User talk:Whedonette">ping</a>)</small> 21:04, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>For all your wikilawyering, you seem to misunderstand a few key points. First of all, it's not the action that constitutes vandalism, it's the intent behind the action, y'know, in a Kantian sort of way. Secondly, the "removing warnings is bad" thing really has no significant backing/consensus at the moment, so it's generally discouraged to bug people about that. Also, you should know that userspace is generally exempt from most of the rules governing encyclopedic content. Hope that clears up a few things for you, and I hope you stop harassing people about the contents of their userspace and actually build an encyclopedia. (By the way, this is addressed to Whedonette, not Cbrown.) --<a href="../../../m/r/2E/User%7EMr._Lefty_bcf9.html" title="User:Mr. Lefty"><b>Mr. Lefty</b></a> <small>(<a href="../../../m/r/2E/User_talk%7EMr._Lefty_44c9.html" title="User talk:Mr. Lefty">talk</a>)</small> 21:00, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

If you choose to block me on a permanent basis, I would simply respectfully ask that, at the time of your blocking, you also advise me as to the appeal procedure for such a decision, as I don't feel it's warranted given my behavior and intentions.

<dd>Per Elaragirl: run CheckUser, do. Like there's ever been a newbie who Wikilawyered like this. A block is not merited but a reminder to the editor to quit harassing people, let people who know more about policy take care of that, and to actually write some articles would not go amiss. Just my 2 cents.

<p>I will make a respectful offer to any administrator who's currently dealing with this: if it will help everyone concerned with the issue instead be at peace with it, block me for a day, a week, a month; I merely ask that you not ban me permanently. <i>That</i>, I would respectfully fight. When I come back, I will try to do some articlespace edits to somehow cement my reputation in better form in case this ever happens once again. I honestly <b>don't</b> admit to any guilt. The phrases thrown at me here are very incivil ("wikilawyering", "troll", "disruption", etc.) and have rushed, with no proof, to poor assumptions of me — I find the irony darkly humorous that I am being accused of assuming bad faith and being incivil in a manner that in and of itself assumes bad faith and is incivil. And wikilawyering is a rather humorous way of saying, "Damn it, Jim, she's citing policy at us! How devious!" But, practically, at this point, what can I do? Obviously, the tide of opinion feels differently than I do, and I can hardly change all of these editors' opinions. If it will make peace to accept a punishment, fine, then let's do that. At this point, I'm just amazed that this has exploded so quickly, and so universally against me. It makes no sense for this to be a battle I (figuratively) die for, so do what you like; I concede to whatever you like, short of permaban, that will just end this "SHE SUCKS!" montage. — <a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWhedonette_62db.html" title="User:Whedonette">Whedonette</a> <small>(<a href="../../../w/h/e/User_talk%7EWhedonette_ff0b.html" title="User talk:Whedonette">ping</a>)</small> 04:12, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Though <a href="../../../b/r/i/British.html" title="British">British</a> is the only page at which the adjective is explained, it is surely appropriate that we point links to the nation to which the adjective refers (see, e.g., our general treatment of <a href="../../../a/m/e/American.html" title="American">American</a> qua adjective of nationality, viz., the piping [[United States|American]]); many of Jeff's edits appear to be of the former variety, such that they are probably appropriate <a href="../../../d/a/b/WP%7EDAB_f303.html" title="WP:DAB">disambiguations</a> (although I share in pschemp's assessment that some changes have been inexact/confusing and ought perhaps to be reverted). Similarly, whilst Jeff might perhaps have been a bit a more decorous in phrasing his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Gcollinsii&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=89584929" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Gcollinsii&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=89584929" rel="nofollow"><i>don't link to Britain</i> boilerplate</a>—the tone in its prescriptivism is perhaps a bit high-handed (and the substantive submission is not completely accurate; there are instances in which one properly links to a dab page generally and to <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a> in specific)—he doesn't seem to have been disruptive or incivil here; indeed, concomitant to his boilerplate has been a welcome to several new users, and, in general, though terse, his messages have not in the least, been, to my estimation, <i>nasty</i> (apologies if I've overlooked something a bit more untoward). Perhaps this issue has been addressed to Jeff on the talk pages of other users to whom he has written, but it surely hasn't been mentioned on his talk page, and I wonder whether this issue, to the extent that there's anything about which the community ought to be concerned (I don't know that there is), ought first to have been addressed to the user in question. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 04:25, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><a href="../../../b/r/i/British.html" title="British">British</a> was the colloboration of month during the September disambiguation project, see <a href="../../../d/p/l/WP%7EDPL_c093.html" title="WP:DPL">WP:DPL</a>, where over 3000 links were disambiguated. There were multiple editors, including <a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERussBlau_27b9.html" title="User:RussBlau">User:RussBlau</a> (through his dab username <a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERussBot_6f95.html" title="User:RussBot">User:RussBot</a>) and others who all worked over weeks to disambiguate the term, as well as other links. In fact, the country terms are one of the links that come up the quickest, and a set of users have been set up to disambiguated them before they become a problem; see <a href="../../../d/p/m/WP%7EDPM_c91c.html" title="WP:DPM">WP:DPM</a>, and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Disambiguation_Adopting_disambiguation_pages_db11.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Disambiguation/Adopting disambiguation pages">Wikipedia:WikiProject Disambiguation/Adopting disambiguation pages</a>. I am not the only one who is working on this project. As for the ambiguity, when the term is ambiguity of a term is being discussed, I link straight to <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="British (disambiguation)">British (disambiguation)</a>, which makes it clear that the term should not be disambiguated. Note from <a href="../../../d/p/l/WP%7EDPL_c093.html" title="WP:DPL">WP:DPL</a>, "<i>Ideally, Wikipedia articles should not link to disambiguation pages (with rare exceptions where the ambiguity of a term is being discussed); instead links should go directly to the appropriate article</i>".</dd>
<dd>Now in regards to my messages, they are not uncivil at all, but informative, and the vast majority of people thank me for informing them; they are just unaware that linking to disambiguation pages is not preffered, and in this way the tireless work of the people disambiguating is lessened.

<dd>That's nice.

<dd>As I already mentioned, I do not watch other people's talk pages, as is standard practice for Wikipedians (those that expect a response on the talk page they wrote to, state so on their own talk page), and given that I do not know of any responses, thus I am not ignoring them. -- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff3000_72a5.html" title="User:Jeff3000">Jeff3000</a> 05:00, 23 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Your claim that that is standard practice is not true first, and second, you don't know of any responses because you haven't been paying attention at all obviously. IF you leave a message for someone, it is your responsibility to answer them, plain and simple. And *most* people answer on the same talkpage the message was left. You attitude here that you aren't responsible to responding to others is terrible.

<p>I completely disagree with you. Look at your talk page, you have a note that mentions that you will watch other talk pages; if it was standard practice, you wouldn't need such a note. Regardless, I've stated my opinion about my actions, and unless others have any comments or suggestions, there's not much more to say. I would also like to note, that you could have asked me to change my message (which I believe is not uncivil in any way) or asked me to respond to some message on some talk page, but instead you came straight here, without even informing me. Instead <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> had to inform me of this thread. -- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff3000_72a5.html" title="User:Jeff3000">Jeff3000</a> 05:08, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>IF you had been communicative and paid attention to the responses to the messages you left, you would already have been aware of this. Ignoring responses to messages you leave is not acceptable. You already ignored responses on others' talk pages so then why would I think you wouldn't ignore one on your own talk. Im sorry, but if you leave messages, it is your responsibility to respond to answers you get. Burying your head in the sand deserves a post here. Besides, I have every right to ask other people to look at a situation. Posting on your talk page does not accomplish that. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 05:13, 23 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Still disagree with you. Can you find a policy page that states that one must watch a talk page one posts on? Regardless, I went through all the talk pages I posted on. The vast majority had nothing posted on them. Two of them had thank you notices <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMrsPlum&amp;diff=88722702&amp;oldid=88722317" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMrsPlum&amp;diff=88722702&amp;oldid=88722317" rel="nofollow">[141]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AEdchilvers&amp;diff=88793016&amp;oldid=88720138" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AEdchilvers&amp;diff=88793016&amp;oldid=88720138" rel="nofollow">[142]</a> and one, which I assume is the one you are talking about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Kylu&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=88722968" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Kylu&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=88722968" rel="nofollow">[143]</a> where she states 1) would have been nice to know where she did not disambiguate, and 2) disagrees with the dabbing. True, I could give the diff, but most people are thankful just for the tip, and the few that have wanted the diff have asked me on my talk page. As for the second point, the standard practice is for disambiguation of these country terms is to disambiguate to the country of origin, unless there are specific reasons not to. In the article in question, the ambiguity of a term is not being discussed. -- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff3000_72a5.html" title="User:Jeff3000">Jeff3000</a> 05:30, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Jeff3000, you can add me to your list of those who found your message to be mildly insulting. I was going to post a pithy retort on your talk page, but decided it wasn't a good idea to respond at all since it could only leave me looking bad.</dd>

<dd>Putting aside the contents of Jeff's boilerplate message, I do think that disambiguating links to <a href="../../../b/r/i/British.html" title="British">British</a> is consistent with Wikipedia policy and ought not to be discouraged. There are exceptions but they are relatively rare. And I think it is usually a good thing to provide some form of notice to the editor who originally created the link, since they might want to see what has been done and might even suggest a more appropriate target for the link. (Or they might not, in which case they can just ignore the message.) I offer to Jeff my own boilerplate text (which I'm not actually actively using) at {{<a href="../../../d/a/b/Template%7EDablink_notice_1_2e0f.html" title="Template:Dablink notice 1">dablink notice 1</a>}} for his consideration, although it was designed for a slightly different context. --<a href="../../../r/27/n/User%7ER%27n%27B_f6a5.html" title="User:R'n'B">Russ</a> <a href="../../../r/27/n/User_talk%7ER%27n%27B_ad9a.html" title="User talk:R'n'B">(talk)</a> 12:01, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just a quick note on this - British and United Kingdom are different things. For example, a company may be British but is subject to <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scots_Law_dec1.html" title="Scots Law">Scots Law</a> - there are more but too many to go in to. Surely it would be better to rewrite British so as not to be a disambig page? British needs adequately describing and should not be simply a "click on" page. <a href="../../../r/e/g/User%7ERegan123_9441.html" title="User:Regan123">Regan123</a> 21:51, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>To a certain extent I disagree. I think this is an example of an occurence where we need more than a disambiguation page, but where a full article would be repeating detail from elsewhere and not reflecting the fact that the majority of links to the page will be intending to go to, say, the United Kingdom, rather than to article about British. I think the current halfway house works best. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 22:24, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm noticing a disturbing trend on new pages patrol. I've seen at least a half-dozen new accounts create a plausible title, leave an edit summary stating "Created article with..." and the only "content" was those godforsaken, idiotic echoes of the title or unrelated nonsense.

<p><a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Mendoza_e2ba.html" title="Mike Mendoza">Mike Mendoza</a> was for some time a mess, with large amounts of unsourced text based on stuff heard on the radio. At some point the real Mike Mendoza, who is now editing from User:Mike mendoza (identity confirmed) started removing material. After some back-and-forth, during which I got involved, the article now contains only sourced information - or at least, none of the unsourced information is under dispute. Unfortunately, Mike mendoza is continuing to remove the following paragraph.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mendoza is <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish.html" title="Jewish">Jewish</a> and has co-founded a <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>-based Jewish radio station, Shalom FM, in order to provide, he says, "some balanced reporting about the community and <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>."<a href="https://www.jta.org/page_view_story.asp?strwebhead=It%92s+the+Jewish+hour%2C+chap&amp;intcategoryid=2&amp;SearchOptimize=Jewish+News" class="external autonumber" title="https://www.jta.org/page_view_story.asp?strwebhead=It%92s+the+Jewish+hour%2C+chap&amp;intcategoryid=2&amp;SearchOptimize=Jewish+News" rel="nofollow">[145]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The source seems legitimate and we haven't been given any reason to believe the contrary. User:Mike mendoza's only justification, expressed solely via edit summaries, is <i>"i am no longer connected in any way with shalom"</i> - which we don't say he is, but it seems undisputed that he founded it, and for a notable DJ that's a relevant fact. Despite repeated requests he's never communicated via <a href="../../../m/i/k/Talk%7EMike_Mendoza_4635.html" title="Talk:Mike Mendoza">Talk:Mike Mendoza</a> or <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_mendoza_8bc0.html" title="User talk:Mike mendoza">User talk:Mike mendoza</a>.</p>
<p>I'm asking someone to warn him that he may be blocked if he continues, then follow through if necessary - not as punishment, but in the hope that being unable to edit will force him to communicate. I can't do either as I've been active editing the article. The only other route I can see to stop the edit warring, apart from the unacceptable one of continuing to revert until he gets bored, is to suggest mediation - which he will almost certainly ignore - and then go to Arbcom, which would be a massive waste of their time, in my view. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 13:25, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>He appears to take offense to the implication he's still connected to the station.

<dd>Do we have any reliable sources that say he has no connection, or that say that he says he has no connection? If not, this "fact" has to go.

<dd>It's not an anonymous user, however. I'm assuming that when Sam Blanning states that he has confirmed the identity of this user, we can take that statement at face value. (Sam has been around here for a while, and is both technically competent and <i>not</i> prone to fits of gullibility.)</dd>
<dd>I see no reason not to add "Mike Mendoza is no longer associated with Shalom FM" (per Mgm) and slap a {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECiteneeded_d196.html" title="Template:Citeneeded">citeneeded</a>}} tag on it so that everything is kosher. This really doesn't seem to be a particularly controversial point, and I admit to having trouble seeing why the individual would want to <i>lie</i> about this. I'm <i>assuming</i> – and if there's more backstory than is immediately visible, please fill us in – that he's busy full time with Talksport, and just doesn't do the Shalom FM stuff anymore. (I note that our source supporting Mike's link to Shalom FM is almost three years old, which is an eternity in the entertainment industry.)</dd>
<dd>In other words, I see no reason why we shouldn't let individuals update uncontroversial biographical and career information in their articles. I <i>also</i> agree with Sam's point that blocks may be necessary to encourage <i>discussion</i>; the correct way to deal with Mike's change of jobs isn't to delete the reference to Shalom FM, but to note that his affiliations have changed. Per WP:AUTO, individuals about whom Wikipedia has written are strongly encouraged to use the talk pages when they encounter conflict. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 14:33, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is indeed no reliable source, so far as I know, that would show that Mendoza has left Shalom - in fact, he's still listed on their website <a href="http://jewishpeople.net/presenters.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://jewishpeople.net/presenters.html" rel="nofollow">[146]</a>. We could say he left anyway and leave it unsourced, but a) that's sloppy article writing and b) as long as he's still listed on Shalom FM's website anyone would be within their rights to challenge the sentence.</p>
<p>And yes - Mendoza confirmed his identity to me and to the Unblock mailing list, which led to him being unblocked by <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetsnipe_10c5.html" title="User:Netsnipe">Netsnipe</a> before I did. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 17:37, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This might be solved by changing "has co-founded" to just "co-founded".

<p>I just received an email from <a href="../../../i/w/a/User%7EIwazaki_0652.html" title="User:Iwazaki">User:Iwazaki</a> asking me to delete his sandbox (here). This user, while not being the most diplomatic person on the planet, has in my opinion calmed down since his first altercations with Shell and myself. He <i>seems</i> to have turned the page, and I can understand why he wants to delete his sandbox and its history (not being an expert in MediaWiki syntax, he used it to prepare a retort to one of his "opponents"). Would anyone care to oblige? Thanks. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYandman_8146.html" title="User talk:Yandman"><font color="red"><b>yandman</b></font></a> 21:37, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've done so, but in the future {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-userreq_2a03.html" title="Template:Db-userreq">Db-userreq</a>}} should suffice.

<dd>I'd thought about db-self, but I think it's only for articles. I didn't know about userreq, though. We live and learn. Thanks for the quick reply. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYandman_8146.html" title="User talk:Yandman"><font color="red"><b>yandman</b></font></a></dd>
