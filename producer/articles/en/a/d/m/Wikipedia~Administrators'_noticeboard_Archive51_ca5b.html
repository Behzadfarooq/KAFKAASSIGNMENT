<p>Ever come across those users who either edit war or are combative because you're trying to remove information they think deserves to be in their favorite article? Although they <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">act in good faith</a> they feel attacked, and being backed into a corner with 4 editors reverting you and not explaining why you contribution can't be there doesn't feel good.</p>
<p>This is not to be used between experienced editors of Wikipedia. It to EXPLAIN.</p>
<p>I recently used this on an edit warring IP user and he immediately stopped and I thought "Hey, other people could use this!"</p>
<p>This can be used on</p>
<ol>
<li>The top of an article's talk page</li>
<li>In a subtopic in a talk page</li>
<li>The user's talkpage</li>
</ol>
<p>which makes it very versatile.</p>

<dd>I mean, I too have the tendency to say "Hammertime" everytime I get to a stop sign... okay, nobody else? Just me... okay. But I don't understand why the template is called {{stophammertime}}. It doesn't say that in the message and the template is not even comedic. It's a great template, but the name doesn't really fit the style of it. <a href="../../../j/o/t/User%7EJoturner_23fb.html" title="User:Joturner">joturn</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../j/o/t/User%7EJoturner_23fb.html" title="User:Joturner">r</a> 22:55, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>I would guess that once an IP block is set then to prevent anyone from that IP from getting around the IP block by simply creating an account, the second option allows an admin to prevent account creation from the blocked IP to ensure that the block stays enforced. Thereby any accounts that were created from the blocked IP prior to the IP's blockage are not themselves automatically blocked. <i>(<a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetscott_c779.html" title="User talk:Netscott">→</a><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott"><span class="pBody" style="border: 0; color: gray; padding: 0; font-size: 100%;">Netscott</span></a>)</i> 13:06, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Well, I don't know about updating, but certainly discussing it would be a good idea. Or perhaps we should discuss it here first because there would be more admin feedback. For instance, permablocks would no longer be taboo, and are best for vandalism-only IP addresses, but we should not apply a "prevent account creation" on an IP permablock. AOL IPs can probably be treated like any other IP address, but should only block anonymous users only. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 13:54, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Much of WP:BP merely discusses the procedure and consequences of blocking, the same is true for the Special:Blockip page. The first step is to help everyone understand how many options we have from a technical standpoint and how they will affect users.

<li>AFAIK, autoblocks continue to work as usual, that is they block everyone on the IP. However, because of the new block precedence feature, an autoblock affecting an IP can be overridden by a block specifically on that IP. For example, if that block is set to "block anonymous users only" then registered editors can still edit, even though the autoblock would have blocked them, because the IP block takes precedence. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 16:02, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I've updated the wording of <a href="../../../b/p/_/WP%7EBP_c8aa.html" title="WP:BP">WP:BP</a> to explain the new options. I also moved around the paragraph about administrators with known shared IP addresses requesting notification before blocks on those shared IP addresses, and changed the wording to suggest that blocking anonymous users only is appropriate in this context (I think that's compatible with existing policy and practice). However, there needs to be discussion on other circumstances in which the enabling or disabling of these options is recommended, for example, should it be recommended that "block anonymous users only" be applied to all blocks of AOL IPs? --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 15:52, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Absolutely. This user is not in any way malicious. She is doing her best to sort out a walled garden which needs some long and patient work. I am already in dialogue with her over various things, and if people had left it to me, or employed tact, we would not have this problem. As it is we have one person whose faith in WP has been dented. She has not "left the building", which is good. But now would be a good time to stop this discussion and archive it out. There's no problem with taking what is perceived as a heavy-handed action to an RfA (it's exactly the sort of thing whihc does and should get discussed there), and above all we need to remember that Ste4k has only been with the project for under a month, so we have to cut some slack while she learns the ropes.

<dd>AFAIK, autoblocks continue to operate normally, that is, they block all anonymous and registered users on that IP. However because of the new block precedence feature, it is possible to set an IP block with different options (such as allowing registered editors).</dd>
<dd>So say that a registered user X gets blocked, and an autoblock goes onto their shared IP. This would block user Y who is innocently using the same IP. But if an admin came along and applied a block to the IP, with the option "block anonymous users only", then the IP would remain blocked (preventing X from evading the block) but Y would still be able to edit. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 16:02, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The changes to the ways blocking works, in addition to the "block anons only" and "prevent account creation" options, also gave blocks unique identifiers (to prevent more than one block on the same target) and implemented a precedence system, in descending order:
<ul>
<li>Username blocks</li>
<li>IP blocks</li>
<li>Range blocks</li>
<li>Autoblocks</li>

<li>Oh please. It's important to understand how the new block works, and I'm not sure I do. If you blocked a range of AOL IPs, but allow registration, you would prevent anonymous edits, but all AOLers could edit by creating accounts. Also, because of the block hierarchy, if a named user who was on AOL was blocked, the IP block would override the autoblock, so any other registered user using AOL would never be autoblocked again. Right? So what is more valuable, allowing AOLers to edit while not logged in or never again having a registered contibutor be autoblocked? (Since new AOlers could always register) <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 21:08, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The thing is, the 172.xx.xx.xx ranges behave like perfectly normal static IPs, there's no reason I can think of to block anon editing from this range, otherwise what's the point of even having <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Main_Page" class="external text" title="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">this</a>?--172.162.162.37 21:16, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>OK, so leave that range out of it. I doubt anyone would go through and tag every single AOL IP address tonight, anyway. However, as vandalism incidents occur, the question is how long to block. The old reason of 15 minutes to prevent autoblocks of registered users no longer applies. So if &gt;15 minutes is ok, how far do you go? The point is that if a registered user editing through AOL is blocked, it will still trigger autoblocks. But if we block an IP range for vandalism, registered users on that range will still be able to edit, and newbies will even be able to register. Sounds pretty good, but I may yet be missing something. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 21:23, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Strong support on blocking AOL proxy ip#s which have produced significant vandalism. We have long had a very large problem with vandals taking advantage of AOL rotating proxies. This has been one of Wikipedia's most harmful vulnerabilities to long term repeat vandals.

<dd>Blocking the username will stop account creation automatically, regardless of the check settings, as I understand it; this is something that has been the case for ages and has not been changed. Likewise, trying to create a new account from an IP used by someone who has been {{unsernameblock}} will trigger an autoblock, which continues to function like any old block, preventing account creation. So, stopping users from creating accounts is as easy as blocking one of them, and if they're smart enough to evade the autoblock, having a checkuser pull the IP and set a "no account creation" block on it. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <font color="#7B68EE">(<small><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">Talk</font></a> • <font color="#7B68EE">Connect</font></small>)</font></span> 09:34, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

He tries to start arguments about the validity of the theory with the goal of trying to prove it wrong. Repeated attempts to show him that Wikipedia isn't about proving a theory wrong or right (since that's original research), but rather about mirroring outside scholarship have failed. The admin <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetros471_bbc1.html" title="User:Petros471">User:Petros471</a> blocked him before, but after the block was released WIN is up to the same old thing.

He blatantly says that no references are required, and admits that he's trying to argue whether the theory is right or wrong.

<p>So it appears that at somepoint for a couple of days towards the end of May, Category:Wikipedia indefinitely blocked users with a significant edit history was plugged into the {{<a href="../../../i/n/d/Template%7EIndefblockeduser_10ad.html" title="Template:Indefblockeduser">indefblockeduser</a>}} template. Problem being, anyone indefblocked and tagged as such ended up in the category whether or not they had a significant edit history. I've started to go through all the pages in the category alphabetically, and most of the names do not belong (I just got through the letter <i>E</i>, with only ten pages of about ninety checked belonging in the cat). I could use any available assistance in digging through and checking the pages/users in the cat. --Jeffrey O.

<p>I've had to perform an extremely high frequency of edits on my monobook.js file over the past couple of weeks, pulling out modules, putting them in, trying to track down an error that had been screwing up part of my interface. As a result, I'm a bit concerned that my edit count may have been artificially inflated by the multitude of edits associated with same — and although I don't mind a high edit count, I'd rather not cheat my way into it. <b>:-)</b> (An unusual situation, given that when you're tinkering with monobook.js, you can't really "use preview.)</p>
<p>Am I correct in saying that if I wanted to "resolve" this problem, I could locally save a copy of the file the way it currently is, and then tag it with a {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-owner_e6e9.html" title="Template:Db-owner">db-owner</a>}}, meaning that once the file was zapped, the edits I've made to that file wouldn't count?

<p>I've had to perform an extremely high frequency of edits on my monobook.js file over the past couple of weeks, pulling out modules, putting them in, trying to track down an error that had been screwing up part of my interface. As a result, I'm a bit concerned that my edit count may have been artificially inflated by the multitude of edits associated with same — and although I don't mind a high edit count, I'd rather not cheat my way into it. <b>:-)</b> (An unusual situation, given that when you're tinkering with monobook.js, you can't really "use preview.)</p>
<p>Am I correct in saying that if I wanted to "resolve" this problem, I could locally save a copy of the file the way it currently is, and then tag it with a {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-owner_e6e9.html" title="Template:Db-owner">db-owner</a>}}, meaning that once the file was zapped, the edits I've made to that file wouldn't count?

<dd>HRE, I think Deco is having a joke at your expense on account of your English. You said "I must incline...". But "incline" means to raise something at an angle, like a ramp. I guess one use of inclined ramps is to allow animals to climb to elevated positions. A series of irrelevant noise followed about ramps and animals. Presumably you meant to say "I must confess..." or "I must admit..." or something similar. I think perhaps having a joke at your expense was in poor taste under the circumstances, especially considering that you'd just registered your offense at the first whimsical reply. -<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_sig_226e.html" title="User:Lethe/sig">lethe</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_sig_fced.html" title="User talk:Lethe/sig">talk</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" rel="nofollow">+</a></sup> 10:19, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am certainly not having a joke at anyone's expense. Maybe I just don't understand the situation. Surely he was joking when he said he died in a car accident and his account was stolen?

<dd>Check his user page. Apparently his account was indeed stolen, and the person who stole it used it to indicate (falsely, as you may have surmised) that he had passed away.

More administrators need to be checking on image copyrights and trying to keep the namespace clean.

<dd>41% of images as fair use is a lot lot higher than most other estimates, which tend to give the figure as less than 10%.

<dd>41% is reasonably consistent with the check of 1800 recent uploads I did back in March: I found just over 50% of new uploads had a fair-use variant license tag.

<dd>I suggest that the Coats of Arms are the easier problem to solve. Sort them into ones in which the design is public domain and ones in which it is not. All of the ones that have PD designs can be drawn by Wikipedians and thereby be as maximally freely-reusable within the constraints that local governments put upon their use. People don't upload unfree Coats of Arms when there is a free one available.

<dd>There is reason to believe that they could be recreated as legitimate encyclopedia articles. I provided one example, Paris Flood, and there are undoubtedly others like that. Less obvious are articles about persons, which is one of the common uses for protecting a deleted page. There are always many people with the same name, some of whom could warrant an article, or the original person could become notable. There are more than a thousand protected-deleted pages, and the default on Wikipedia must be for it to be editable, not protected. If there is no reason to think that an article will be wrongly recreated, then it should be unprotected. Even if there is some minor reason to think that it will be wrongly recreated, it should be unprotected for the same principle by which we don't just protect every page that has more than average vandalism. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 06:30, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you for the response. It was I who listed it for semi-protection. A few hours protection will make absolutely no difference, you might as well unblock it now. The problem is with a proxy spammer over several weeks. The article is low-traffic, with few regular editors, and all the edits within the last month have been the spam, or (mainly my) reverts. I was hoping protection would serve to foil the spammer's plans, but it might as well serve as a proxy honeytrap for now.

Once that's done, we'd love a bot to fix all the exiting ones, where users have been using [[Image:Example.jpg|200px]] inside the field, as the fix would cause duplicate pictures.

Chadbryant claims this user is a vandal who has harrassed him and admins have therefore approved this link. There are procedures for dealing with vandals, and this is not one of them.

<dd>This may be one stepped removed from actually posting the content of the link on Wikipedia but that argument is sophistry and it may be that this incident invites a clarification of the policy section posted above—something to the effect of: "Note that edits which have the <i>effect</i> of releasing personal information, such as posting a link to an external source where personal information is contained, with the intent of disseminating that information, will be treated the same as if the content was directly posted on Wikipedia." Though it should be clear by context, I endorse Tyrenius' actions, and would be interested in seeing substantiation that the "link...has been approved/endorsed by other more experienced admins."--<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 04:34, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I think that the link should be removed, as well. In my opinion, personal information should only be released when necessary to prevent harm, such as serious vandalism. The intent of the page linked to appears to be to embarrass the subject. There are enough admins that you can find a couple who will endorse almost any position (although not the same admins for every issue), but I doubt that there is a consensus among them that the link is fine. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 04:59, 15 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The issue, however, seemed to be that no one was reading the entire discussion, so a civility request would have been easily missed. If people had read the whole discussion, they would have seen her withdrawl of the nomination. They also would have seen that the article had dramatically changed since its nomiation. I don't think the discussion was still in dispute, I think the consensus was not in doubt based on the updates to the article. After the article was changed and updated (around 00:00 13 Jul) 1 delete vote was added, a couple of deletes were changed to keeps, and 13 keeps were added. And yes, I probably shouldn't have closed the discussion since I was involved, but it had barreled into a forum of sarcasm, finger-pointing, and personal attacks that probably wouldn't have been solved with a civility note. And fortunately, aside from one apparent troll, I haven't gotten heat over this. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 17:03, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I noticed the points you have made, and this is doubtless why no one is creating a fuss. However, I suggest in a future similar situation to make all those points in the discussion, particularly drawing attention to <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">NPA</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">CIVIL</a>. If things are getting particularly nasty, then ask for admin assistance, and abusers will get warned and, if they persist, blocked. However, people on <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAfD_60e1.html" title="WP:AfD">AfD</a> sometimes get carried away and then respond positively once inappropriate behaviour is pointed out. Try putting the civility request in bold, or at the top (which everyone presumably looks at) or repeating it each time there is a problem. Also re. change in article, try inserting a space, then an announcement in bold that the article has been rewritten and earlier comments apply to the initial version. Anyway, you are acting in the interests of the project. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 01:04, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>For those who don't know, an index of previous public checkuser requests are kept at <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFCU_Case_d313.html" title="WP:RFCU/Case">Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case</a>; each case has its own subpage, and all are indexed there. All requests, including those that were denied and/or came up unrelated are included. (<b>Let me be clear:</b> Having your name on that page <i>does not equal being a sockpuppeteer</i>. We include <b>all</b> requests, even those made in bad faith, so there is a permanent archive that a request was made.)</p>
<p>Now, for the public service announcement: The checkuser index is only complete insomuch as we know about requests. If requests are not made, or results are not reported, on RfCU, then they are not recorded there. Often, someone will make a request directly to a checkuser, or will post something here or at RfAr that results in a check, with the results being delivered in the same place. Unfortunately, those often fail to make thier way to RfCU, and as such, aren't indexed.</p>
<p>In the interests of maintaining as complete an index as possible, a report page has now been created for posting such results. Anyone who sees a checkuser result posted somewhere <i>on Wikipedia</i> <b>other</b> than RfCU should copy it to the "reports by non-checkusers" section of <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_checkuser_Case_Unsorted_results_486a.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Unsorted results">Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Unsorted results</a> with a diff of the original posting (so we can confirm authenticity). The checkuser clerks will then see that it is indexed.</p>

<p>It is irresponsible to ignore a request for protection from a 14 year old who has received an inappropriate message. It is not usual for blatant requests for meetings to to be posted on wikipedia. 24.192.44.141 could see that <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarrmann_9858.html" title="User:Karrmann">Karrmann</a> was 14 as it states it on his user page, where the message was also posted, not on the talk page. At the bottom of the message was the request <i>"Please delete after you read this."</i> The user did say, "I know where you live", to be precise: <i>"I live near you (Detroit area)"</i>. It is no wonder that Karrmann is frightened. The user who posted this message either has untoward intentions or is incredibly naive. Whichever way round, such a message is inappropriate, and would be interpreted with great suspicion by most people. It would certainly not look good if it got wider publicity (which is not unlikely with wiki watching sites) and could be very damaging for wikipedia. I suggest the block is reinstated and also the abuse report. This has to be taken seriously. The euphemism mention does not help, and, if Karrmann's (understandable) fears that he has been contacted by a predator are true, it is hardly likely that a predator would announce his intentions blatantly. The edit summary for this invitation to meet is <i>"Vandal hunting"</i>. It is also the user's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/24.192.44.141" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/24.192.44.141" rel="nofollow">only edit</a>. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 02:47, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm starting to think I'm alone in seeing the concern over this as a rather panicky overreaction. For the record, I'll state that I'm uninvolved in this situation, other than as an observer &amp; commentator. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">Alex Bakharev</a> has already acted immediately to block the user until the situation could be investigated. After he gathered the facts, he unblocked the user, even before I finished inquiring about the block. The user said nothing other than that they lived in the same metro area (them and about 1 million other people) and that his car, pictured on <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarrmann_9858.html" title="User:Karrmann">Karrmann</a>'s userpage, was available if Karrman wanted to see it. On that page, Karrman states once that his age is 14, and several times that he drives one car or another. At the least, Karrman's talkpage gave mutiple messages about his age. However, without there having been a specifically inappropriate message, I'm not sure how much the age matters. The comment could be interpreted badly, but I really see this as a classic example of the need to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> not only in article edits.</dd>
<dd>The discussion of this issue has bounced from <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a> to <a href="../../../a/r/_/WP%7EAR_447c.html" title="WP:AR">WP:AR</a> to <a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlex_Bakharev_c750.html" title="User talk:Alex Bakharev">Alex Bakharev</a> with a sidetrip into <a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.192.44.141.html" title="User talk:24.192.44.141">User talk:24.192.44.141</a>. We are building a fear-fueled <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_wall.html" title="Chinese wall">Chinese wall</a> between adults &amp; youth, both here in the project &amp; in society as a whole. Growing up, I knew nearly every adult in my neighborhood, spent time with some of them, even visited their houses unescorted. I emerged unscarred &amp; unmolested. Karrman &amp; Alex Bakharev both exercised extreme caution in this situation. However, the situation has been considered in several fora, investigated by the blocking admin, and resolved. Where is the remaining issue? And why isn't it an issue of <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">dispute resolution</a>, if there is some dispute with respect to this action, rather than (another) discussion in Jimbo Wales' talk page? --<a href="../../../s/s/b/User%7ESsbohio_59da.html" title="User:Ssbohio">Ssbohio</a> 14:26, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The first thing Karrmann says on <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarrmann_9858.html" title="User:Karrmann">his user page</a> extremely prominently is that he is 14. It is at best a bad lapse of judgement for an adult to contact a 14 year old in this way and to suggest meeting. At the very least he should have asked Karrmann to let his parents know. Instead the user ends the message <i>"Please delete after you read this."</i> It is the first and only edit from that IP address, and the user has not come forward to offer a public explanation to reassure us or Karrmann. Karrmann has obviously been badly frightened by this, and it is a duty of care towards him to show that we are taking this seriously. I don't think this is something that admins were chosen to deal with and it at least needs to be known about at a higher level of the Foundation. This is not building a fear-fuelled wall between adults and youth. That already exists in society when an adult stranger suggests meeting a youth in this way, and also wishing to hide evidence of that suggestion. The fact is that Karrmann is seeking the help of adults he trusts, in order to protect him and make him feel safe over one he doesn't. He is entitled to know that he can do this, and it will be taken seriously, not trivialised as "a rather panicky overreaction".

<dd>Agreed. There is seriously something untoward here. No one with good intentions would instruct you to delete a message afterwards like that. They might suggest you can delete it if you so choose, but not impress its neeed for deletion. It certainly doesn't sit well with me, though a block at this point might be pointless. With dynamic IPs they could have had 3 different IPs since then.

<dd>I strongly object to lifting the community ban of Jerry Jones/JJstroker/CongressRecords/etc. This user was legitimately blocked due to serious, repeated violations of core Wikipedia policies. Most seriously, he plagiarized material over and over again, and then refused to acknowledge the behavior when confronted with the evidence. Similarly, his image uploads have been problematic, as shown by the numerous warnings on his talk pages. Furthermore, he has been a very one-sided POV pusher, even posting on <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stormfront.org.html" title="Stormfront.org">Stormfront.org</a> asking how to justify his edits here. Lastly, he has used a string of sockpuppets to evade his ban. Bauder has given no particular reason to unblock him. If he can share in detail this user's admission of guilt and promises to refrain from all of these inappropriate behaviors then it might be different. But a sneaky, plagiarizing, neo-nazi editor is not someone for whom we should be bending our rules.

If this user really has reformed, he will have to prove it, and, furthermore, prove it for a long time. There should also be a strict understanding that any blatant violations will cause this user to revert immediately to current status. Editing should also be strictly limited initially, probably by exclusion from certain articles and/or limits on number of edits per day, so they can be properly monitored. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 04:31, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am not 100 percent certain about the correspondence between the committee and Mr. Bauder, but if there are any remaining questions I will be more then happy to address them openly and honestly. If it is possible I would like to be integrated back into the wikipedia community. I promise to comply with any conditions set upon me. I can honestly say that I have seen the errors of my ways and it is my personal guarantee that if allowed back to the project that I will refrain from any behavior that can be deemed inappropriate. I can objectively see how some of my past behavior constituted a critical lapse of judgment on my part and for that I apologize. I just want to put all of these issues behind us and work together to build a quality encyclopedia.</p>

<dd>I was definitely wrong when I made controversial edits without seeking a consensus first on the discussion pages. I should have definitely asked for a third opinion if I entered an edit war as wikipedia policy instructs people to do. I think this really applies to my edits concerning use of the term racist and far right. Reviewing these edits now I can certainly understand how I presented a questionable image of someone with an agenda. The reason I didn’t remove use of the term “far left” for articles was because it simply wasn’t necessary and the term is not nearly used to the same extent as far right. I still believe that I am not as bad of a guy as I was made out to be, and I feel my edits can be justified if looked at objectively in the proper context. I believe the biggest mistake that I made was the copyright violation for 1924 immigration act article. At the time I didn’t really understand proper referencing and copyright laws in relation to wikipedia, but as you have brought that to my attention it is hard for believe that I was able to do such a thing. Repeating such mistake to me now is just morally out of the question. I am pleased to say that I have learned how to properly reference material. As for copyright violations with regard to photos, I believe that was a little blown up out of proportion. On my Jerry Jones account I uploaded around 500 photos and the vast majority of them were properly uploaded with the correct copyright tags. But given that copyright laws are sticky things, even the most experienced editor can run into problems and be asked to verify the copyrights of certain photos. Pinkville told me that the time to be 100 percent sure for copyrights is before and not after. I thought about that a lot and I believe that he is right. If there are some photos where I am nearly over 90 percent sure that the image is free use that is not ok I need to be 100 percent sure. So I will not go and add copyright material and if I chose to reference something I will be sure to do it correctly and rewrite the material. I will also not go and remove use of the term “far right” or “racist” especially without seeking a consensus first on the talk page and strictly comply with the decision reached there. But I do not plan to make such edits anymore.</dd>

<p>I created this name thesettingsun recently because I didn’t think that I would be allowed back to wikipedia. I was reading an article and I noticed that an image was removed and wanted to help by adding the picture back to the article that had a copyright problem because I knew that the copyright was fine and wanted to help the editor who originally added it. I apologize for creating it but I didn’t intend to use it further I just wanted to help and follow the decision of the committee. I can’t edit in the shadows and I just want to come out if that is ok. If you can monitor me I will be sure to be on my best behavior. I apologize for creating the name.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time.</p>

<p>Please help fix these articles, most contain untrue, embarrassing, and insensitive content left from the template that was used to create them, in the race to be the millionth page creator. Most of the articles are decades before the content, and most say that a leader of a non-existent political party at the time those articles cover, is a person who in fact is recently deceased. If its not fixed it is likely to become a national scandal in New Zealand, and flow over to wikipedia internationally. I have tried many times to bring this to the wiki community in New Zealand, but only a few pages have been fixed as a token gesture, eg <a href="../../../1/9/2/1925_in_New_Zealand_5f19.html" title="1925 in New Zealand">1925_in_New_Zealand</a>.

<dd>I'd say no. Not enough vandalism for semi protection or full protection. There are some days with 0 edits and even the worse days only have 4-5 pieces of vandalism. And your idea for blocking the IPs who hit the article alot isn't something we should do with IPs unless we know for certain that they are static. The IPs you listed are either from vastly different ranges or they've only contributed 2-3 edits, so a warning for vandalism is barely warranted much less a block of any sort. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">(meow)</a></sup> 05:49, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would like to make a policy inquiry. A fellow editor has, without my consent, moved two personal essays from the Wikipedia namespace to my userspace. I have reverted the move, and asked the editor to, if he wishes the move to proceed, initiate a Miscellany for Deletion discussion, casting his initial starting vote as "userify." This seems to be a course of action supported by <a href="../../../m/m/_/WP%7EMM_1706.html#Cross-namespace_moves" title="WP:MM">WP:MM#Cross-namespace moves</a>.</p>
<p>However, I am wondering if any criteria, policy, or guideline exist as to when an essay belongs in Wikipedia namespace and when it should be userfied. Is this something that just arises out of whatever consensus arises from a <a href="../../../m/i/s/Wikipedia%7EMiscellany_for_deletion_06ab.html" title="Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion">Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion</a> process, or are there criteria one can refer to in such a dispute — much as those policies people would refer to when debating a <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion</a> process? — <a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a> <span class="plainlinks">(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:WCityMike&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:WCityMike&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">talk</a></span> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WCityMike_e8da.html" title="Special:Contributions/WCityMike">contribs</a>) 02:33, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>As I pointed out on <a href="../../../w/c/i/User_talk%7EWCityMike_fb24.html#Personal_essay_userfication" title="User talk:WCityMike">WCityMike's talk page</a>, the Admin noticeboard isn't the forum for adjudicating policy matters.

<li>From my response on Leflyman's talk page: "I understand that administrators aren't the arbiters of policy, but as the wikimop and bucket puts them in a position to enforce them every day, my experience is that they're often more familiar with it, and, indeed, being familiar with policy is often an element tested at requests for adminship.

<li>It's unlikely to be amenable to a policy anyway, and a policy might well be rejected as instruction creep. The bar to inclusion of WP:essays is quite low and they tend to get deleted only if they openly advocate behaviour which is contrary to policy. I don't think these ones do. It's always best when they attract multiple editors to polish them into something resembling a useful example to cite - I started <a href="../../../h/o/l/WP%7EHOLE_7127.html" title="WP:HOLE">WP:HOLE</a> and it was Edited Mercilessly [tm] into quite a useful document detailing how, in the end, we can't be expected to realise how interesting, significant and relevant a subject is unless the author makes at least some attempt to tell us; it's not really fair to castigate people for not wanting to keep an article based on evidence which is not presented in the article. The proof here is that I'm not the only one to have cited it in debate. <a href="../../../n/c/r/WP%7ENCR_b989.html" title="WP:NCR">WP:NCR</a> is another bit of nonsense with a serious underlying theme which goes directly to policy. My suggestion, then, would be to fix the essays rather than try to nuke them. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTPOLICY_e72f.html" title="WP:NOTPOLICY">WP:NOTPOLICY</a> certainly falls under the umbrella of fair comment, and reminds us that we should always go back to policy not precedent. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 09:48, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I feel this <b>is</b> a policy discussion that's of note beyond administrator's noticeboard, and thus not appropriate here (and thus should be moved to the Pump). Citing essays, in my view, is a policy run-around. If there's a clarification that needs to be made, then it should be to the appropriate policy/guideline <i>itself</i>, not in a new parallel "unofficial" realm of essay-creep.--<font face="Verdana,San-Serif" size="-2"><strong><a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">Leflyman</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/f/User_talk%7ELeflyman_3737.html" title="User talk:Leflyman">Talk</a></sup></strong></font> 14:28, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>As I've said in the parallel discussion we're having on our talk pages, I simply don't think your opinion is the view held by the consensus. I think a RfC is probably the best methodology you could use to clarify the policy in question. Essays can be the equivalent of useful "legal briefs," nonbinding interpretations of how Wikipedia policy governs a particular situation. I don't feel what you're suggesting is practical — imagine if our government had to write or refine policy to explicitly state every point proven in a legal brief in court proceedings. It'd be a madhouse.

<li>I'm making an analogy, comparing the relationship between essays and Wikipedia policies to the relationship between legal briefs and government regulations, so I'm not quite clear where your response is coming from. I'm already familiar with what wikilawyering is, but rereading its definition again on the linked-to page, I see no support in that link for calling such an analogy wikilawyering. Furthermore, the section regarding Wikipedia not being an experiment in rule making seems to address instruction creep, not letting procedural errors invalidate posts, and keeping to the spirit of policies — none of which seem to apply to the discussion at hand, either. — <a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a> <span class="plainlinks">(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:WCityMike&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:WCityMike&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">talk</a></span> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WCityMike_e8da.html" title="Special:Contributions/WCityMike">contribs</a>) 15:47, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Generally, an essay in the Wikipedia namespace are attempts to express a particular viewpoint within the community, and are open for editing, whereas essays in userspace more clearly belong to a particular user and are generally not edited by other users. So no, there's nothing wrong with it being in the Wikipedia namespace, you put it in your userspace if you don't want it to be edited. You should also consider moving it to Meta unless it specifically relates to the English Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 10:38, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

I firmly protest the user POV being pushed by both Panairjdde and Centrx above. This is against the guidelines provided, and everyone has a problem with Panairjdde who obviously has a conflict of interest as an Italian. This needs a neutral POV .The dicussion page is civil, and none of it is gossip, but news from various sources. Terming other's comments as gossip on the other hand is more direct than tangential.
