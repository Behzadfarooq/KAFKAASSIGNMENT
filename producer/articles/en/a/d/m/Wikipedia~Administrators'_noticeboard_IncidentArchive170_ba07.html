<dd>Actually, I think this page was indeed the most appropriate place to report this. I don't think this was a request for protection, but rather a notice that severe image vandalism (via templates, I'm sure) had hit Today's Featured Article. This page receives far more attention than the <a href="../../../r/f/p/WP%7ERFP_c43d.html" title="WP:RFP">WP:RFP</a> page and was, in my opinion, the best location to quickly alert a watchful admin. -- <b><a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETariqabjotu_f37f.html" title="User:Tariqabjotu"><font color="black">tariq</font><font color="gray">abjotu</font></a></b> 04:25, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive170_ba07.html" title="Edit section: Wizard (fantasy)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Wizard (fantasy)</span></h2>
<p>I think this can be fixed only with admin authority.</p>
<p>This article (redirect) was nominated for deletion on November 23 2006: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Wizard_%28fantasy%29_e1a9.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Wizard (fantasy)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Wizard (fantasy)</a>. The result was keep, and the chief reason was that the edit history had to be preserved.</p>
<p>The Wikipedian who proposed the delete has now moved the article to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_wizards_in_fantasy.html" title="List of wizards in fantasy">List of wizards in fantasy</a> (and redirected it to a new article), and then created a brand-new <a href="../../../w/i/z/Wizard_%28fantasy%29.html" title="Wizard (fantasy)">Wizard (fantasy)</a> redirect, which is naturally lacking the history. This seems to me to violate the spirit of the deletion request. I asked if there was a reason why the edit history was thus being cut off, and the Wikipedian has not responded, despite being on Wikipedia. (Edited <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magician.html" title="Magician">Magician</a>.)</p>
<p>(This has occured in the midst of -- spirited discussions about the place it should be redirected it, after equally spirited discussions about its content had led to the creation of <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magicians_in_fantasy.html" title="Magicians in fantasy">Magicians in fantasy</a>.) <a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldfritha_cc31.html" title="User:Goldfritha">Goldfritha</a> 01:29, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The previous discussion is at <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_wizards_in_fantasy_4f0d.html" title="Talk:List of wizards in fantasy">Talk:List_of_wizards_in_fantasy</a> (long). The <b>major</b> edit history for what used to be <a href="../../../w/i/z/Wizard_%28fantasy%29.html" title="Wizard (fantasy)">Wizard (fantasy)</a> now resides at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_wizards_in_fantasy&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_wizards_in_fantasy&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">the history for List of wizards in fantasy</a>. Look <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_wizards_in_fantasy&amp;oldid=76244" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_wizards_in_fantasy&amp;oldid=76244" rel="nofollow">here</a> for the first version of the 'Wizard (fantasy)' article. The edit history is still there, but becoming increasingly hard to trace through all these splits, merges, redirects and moves. I might use this as a case study for how to trace the edit history of a sample piece of text through numerous moves and redirects. As for how to resolve this, I have suggested before that the editors involved sit down and plan the final article structure they are aiming at, rather than stumbling blindly along, arguing as they go. Otherwise they are destined to end up on <a href="../../../l/a/m/WP%7ELAME_0afb.html" title="WP:LAME">WP:LAME</a>. The sad thing is, there is some good content there, if they could just concentrate on editing it. Sorry to sound so negative. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 03:56, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why use it as a case history? Why not just take "Wizard (fantasy)"'s history and put it back at "Wizard (fantasy)"? No reason was given for splitting the article and its history up, even after I asked.</dd>
<dd>That was all that would be suitable for administrator intervention. The discussion of what is the final structure is ongoing.<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldfritha_cc31.html" title="User:Goldfritha">Goldfritha</a> 04:10, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think you are referring to the point where text was cut and pasted from <a href="../../../w/i/z/Wizard_%28fantasy%29.html" title="Wizard (fantasy)">Wizard (fantasy)</a> to several other locations. You probably want to read <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_fix_cut_and_paste_moves_8038.html" title="Wikipedia:How to fix cut and paste moves">Wikipedia:How to fix cut and paste moves</a>. I think this is a complicated case though, too complicated I fear for a simple history merge to fix. You might just have to let this one go. If there is a 'history merge specialist' admin around, I'd second your call for them to have a look into the histories, just to see if they can untangle anything. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 04:17, 3 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, Carcharoth, I am referring the event that just happened: namely, the moving of "Wizard (fantasy)" to "List of wizards in fantasy" and the creation of a new "Wizard (fantasy)". What is so complicated about that? Remove the new "Wizard (fantasy)" and move the old one back. <a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldfritha_cc31.html" title="User:Goldfritha">Goldfritha</a> 04:25, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Nixer has a milelong blocklog and is <i>not</i> a user in good standing. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Axis_powers_of_World_War_II&amp;diff=97318760&amp;oldid=97318505" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Axis_powers_of_World_War_II&amp;diff=97318760&amp;oldid=97318505" rel="nofollow">Here</a> he is seen changing his signature because he accidently logged on as Nixer instead of Planemo. This was after a series of account changes by him that morning. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAxis_powers_of_World_War_II&amp;diff=97834407&amp;oldid=97672318" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAxis_powers_of_World_War_II&amp;diff=97834407&amp;oldid=97672318" rel="nofollow">here</a> CaesarRosso is seen removing my question about this strange change of signature. He has been invited to talk about his proposed reorganization of the article which is currently against concensus and from previous edit warring we know that such edits must be discussed first. Nixer knows all this already though as he has participated in the development of the article during that period. he is using his socks in bad faith. Also note that <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a> had previously blocked him for sockpuppetry in December and that the account Planemo has been used on the same articles that triggered that block but this was not discovered at the time so the block was reverted by another admin. Nixers history of abuse is mile long and this needs to end now. No more temporary blocks that he can just evade using sockpuppets. The Planemo account has been used to evade Nixer's previous blocks and it went undiscovered until I caught him in the act when he changed the signature on the talk page. I'll refrain from reverting him until this is settled by the community. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 08:08, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The user "Can't sleep, clown will eat me" removed my POV tag on the <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> article and they when I asked him why on his talk page he ignored me, erased my comment and added the following comment: "troll elsewhere, please" Is there an administrator I can talk to. This is the comment I left on his page "The Jesus article has been taken over by religious Christians who refuse to let any information on the page that might contradict what the gospels says. The previous edit included sourced statements from various non-Christian sources on Jesus from ancient times. This article should therefore have a POV tag or the edit should be restored. This is supposed to be an encyclopedic article base on facts not beliefs. Why was the POV tag removed?" <a href="../../../z/o/n/User%7EZonaras_24d0.html" title="User:Zonaras">Zonaras</a> 13:36, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>65.0.104.154 is on a personal crusade to rid wikipedia of external links, as seen in his contrbution history [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/65.0.104.154" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/65.0.104.154" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>]. I tried reporting him twice for vandalism, the first time was more of a content dispute. This second time, they said to come to this board instead. (Result of first report as noted on my <a href="../../../n/a/r/User_talk%7ENardman1_f0dc.html" title="User talk:Nardman1">talk page</a>). In particular, this dispute refers to something started on 30 December, when I reverted some of his edits and told him he was ignoring the consensus on the talk page. (see our exchange on [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_cocktails&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_cocktails&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>] 30 December in our edit comments). I reported him to the talk page of the article and added a Keep vote to the ongoing vote on that page. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AList_of_cocktails&amp;diff=97453890&amp;oldid=97386641" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AList_of_cocktails&amp;diff=97453890&amp;oldid=97386641" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>] If you scroll through the subsequent edits to that page, he changed my vote (forged a comment by me) [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:List_of_cocktails&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97797701" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:List_of_cocktails&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97797701" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>] and then took it upon himself to decide the consensus was delete [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:List_of_cocktails&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=97839403" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:List_of_cocktails&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=97839403" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>] even though he's not in the Cocktails project. I don't see how that's NOT vandalism, but I bring the issue here in order to try to get some satisfaction. He's been warned for messing with external links previously on his talk page [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:65.0.104.154" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:65.0.104.154" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>] as as he notes on my talk page he changes ips. I propose a permanent ban and then ban of any IPs used in the future. <a href="../../../n/a/r/User%7ENardman1_ed82.html" title="User:Nardman1">Nardman1</a> 19:57, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have blocked for a week for blatant vandalism.

<dd>The vandalism is unacceptable, but the user's contributions in terms of removing spam links are unassailable. He has done a great service in removing AdSense-driven and other useless and unencyclopedic links from the encyclopedia. I don't see what use a Webcomic strip has being in an external link to a cocktail anyway - is it adding encyclopedic information per <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>?

<dd>Zoe, did you even look at the links you rolled back? <s>Half</s> Every single one of them was horrible, horrible spam junk. I propose that this user's block be significantly shortened - we have failed to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> here. The accusation of "forged a comment by me" is nonsense - I don't think he understands our Talk page conventions. The vast majority of his contributions are extremely good grunt work. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 22:55, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>I have reduced the block to 24 hours, with credit for time already served. I find that a one-week block is extremely excessive in this case, given that zero warnings were issued and the dispute stems from a good-faith effort to clean up the encyclopedia. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 02:55, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Hello. Note: I am the person who originally posted the link most contested by this user at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_cocktails.html" title="List of cocktails">List of cocktails</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a>, there are a few things here that I think you should be aware of about this person.</p>
<ol>
<li>You said "I don't think he understands our Talk page conventions." However, the user <a href="../../../n/a/r/User_talk%7ENardman1_f0dc.html#AIV" title="User talk:Nardman1">states</a> "I've been removing spam links from wikipedia for years,". It seems logical that given the length of time the user has been performing such edits, s/he would have become familiar with Talk page conventions. Surely he has been around long enough to know that he should not publicly misrepresent another user as he/she did to <a href="../../../n/a/r/User%7ENardman1_ed82.html" title="User:Nardman1">User:Nardman1</a>.</li>
<li>The user has a "hit and run" style of editing that is extremely frustrating. An example outside of the cocktails space is found at <a href="../../../k/i/m/Kimbo_Slice_2aa6.html" title="Kimbo Slice">Kimbo Slice</a>, where the user reverted repeatedly (with more and more heated edit summaries), rather than engaging in dialog. Attempts to draw the user into any kind of dialog fail. It is only after discussions with an administrator that the user speaks up, though with the clear understanding that s/he does not care to engage in conversation. See talk pages at <a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html#External_links_question" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/r/User_talk%7ENardman1_f0dc.html" title="User talk:Nardman1">Nardman1</a> and the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_cocktails_1544.html#External_Links" title="Talk:List of cocktails">List of cocktails</a>. <i>I</i> was the one who originally posted the original dissenting vote on behalf of the user in that straw poll, just to be sure that his/her concerns were expressed (since s/he seems too shy or too stubborn to discuss anything unless it's in defense of his/her actions).</li>
<li>You also said that "the user's contributions in terms of removing spam links are unassailable", but I shall attempt to do just that:
<ol>
<li>The primary link in question is "<a href="http://www.1001cocktails.com/recipes/" class="external text" title="http://www.1001cocktails.com/recipes/" rel="nofollow">1001cocktails</a> - Comprehensive mixed drinks recipe database with ratings". The user incorrectly and without basis accuses me of being affiliated with this site because I support its inclusion. Therefore, any comments concerning its value are obviously highly suspect and are therefore disregarded out of hand. I am not, and never have been affiliated in any way with the site except as a casual Web browser who found the site through Google searching. The reasons I am Google searching cocktails is because I have nearly single-handedly undertaken a massive cleanup and improvement campaign (with <a href="../../../n/a/r/User%7ENardman1_ed82.html" title="User:Nardman1">User:Nardman1</a>'s recent assistance and other people on a more article-by-article basis), involving nearly 1,000 edits in December alone. Trying to dig up useful, encyclopedic information, along with attempting to determine which drinks are legitimate and which are cruft or entirely make believe, I visit a lot of sites. The one site I visit nearly daily, is <a href="http://www.1001cocktails.com/recipes/" class="external text" title="http://www.1001cocktails.com/recipes/" rel="nofollow">1001cocktails</a>. Their ratings system helps me quickly identify the relative popularity and notability of the drinks. The recipes are written in a generally non-biased preference for brand names of ingredients. There is little 3rd-party advertising, no pop-ups, and minimal if any distracting animation on the pages. Yes, the site does sell bar supplies, but it also offers daily news and a discussion board (both in French, which I do not speak, so I cannot vouch for the quality of the information). The user claims this is strictly a spam site, but that is completely inaccurate, since they did not "spam" Wikipedia and do not send unsolicited commercial e-mails (there is no registration required to access the drink recipes). I am not proposing inclusion of this site on every page, but in the external links section on each of the related list pages (<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_cocktails.html" title="List of cocktails">List of cocktails</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/x/Mixed_drink_shooters_and_drink_shots.html" title="Mixed drink shooters and drink shots">Mixed drink shooters and drink shots</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer_mix.html" title="Beer mix">Beer mix</a>, Wine mix, <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flaming_beverages.html" title="Flaming beverages">Flaming beverages</a>, and <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-alcoholic_mixed_drinks.html" title="Non-alcoholic mixed drinks">Non-alcoholic mixed drinks</a>), I think it is a very good option to include. These are pages that people visit to find lots of drinks. We <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">do not want</a> Wikipedia to become an all-inclusive list of every cocktail known to man, so why not point people to a good list of over 2,000 recipes with ratings.</li>
<li>The user removes links that are used as sources for statements. In several cases, the sites used as sources for the statements are weak, but simply removing the source without locating a new one or adding a {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>)) tag is potentially more harmful than leaving the link to a weak source, or more onerous to the user, is a site with Google Ads on it.
<ol>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carbomb_%28beer_mix%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97441293" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carbomb_%28beer_mix%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97441293" rel="nofollow">[29]</a> - The statements that were sourced with the links sound far-fetched without any citation. The sources are weak, but it does show that the statements were not made up from thin air.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amaretto&amp;diff=97442827&amp;oldid=97081027" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amaretto&amp;diff=97442827&amp;oldid=97081027" rel="nofollow">[30]</a> - Removal of several of these links resulted in the article becoming completely non-sourced legends. S/he opted to defend the removal with "the only links removed were all ad driven spam links or links to pages with ZERO content on them related to the article"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amaretto&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97445329" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amaretto&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97445329" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>. This was not true, because I visited the sites in question and easily found links directly to the source information <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amaretto&amp;oldid=98079807" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amaretto&amp;oldid=98079807" rel="nofollow">[32]</a> used in the article. Doing a little research is far better than arbitrarily deleting a link that serves as the basis for an entire section of the article. As a side note, I was very concerned that my work in locating those links would be reverted by the user, which, I feel is part of the user's intention.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mimosa_%28cocktail%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97441571" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mimosa_%28cocktail%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97441571" rel="nofollow">[33]</a> - a valid reference to a pop culture use of the topic, and easily found at <a href="http://www.ohnorobot.com/index.pl?comic=636&amp;s=mimosa&amp;search=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ohnorobot.com/index.pl?comic=636&amp;s=mimosa&amp;search=Search" rel="nofollow">[34]</a>, despite stating "no reference on that site", which implies s/he attempted to do so.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The user also regularly deletes links to very valid and on-topic information. The only reason the links appear to be removed is that the site in question uses Google AdSense ads, which the user seems to find highly offensive. I do not believe that <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> or any other policy explicitly forbids linking to sites using Google Ads, but this user appears determined to remove such sites from the Wikipedia.
<ol>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Back_pain&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97684640" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Back_pain&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97684640" rel="nofollow">[35]</a> - Removal of a seemingly very informative and scientific article on the topic of back pain (the article from which it was linked). While I can't vouch for the medical or scientific accuracy of the article, that is not the reason for which it was deleted: "remove ad driven spam link". There is nothing spammy about the news article. There are ads surrounding the news article, but the article appears legit.</li>
<li><a href="http://hot-science.com/1206/01/19.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://hot-science.com/1206/01/19.htm" rel="nofollow">[36]</a> - Same situation as the previous. The article appears very newsworthy, but was "removed spam link to ad driven MFA site (Made For Adsense)" regardless of the quality of the article. It is this blind fixation on ignoring content and focusing on delivery that includes ads as the sole reason for removal that is so frustrating.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Algae&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97684886" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Algae&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97684886" rel="nofollow">[37]</a> - Another link to a perfectly good article was removed. The dead link should have been removed, and that was a good edit.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thermal_conductivity&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97684922" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thermal_conductivity&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97684922" rel="nofollow">[38]</a> - And another good article removed.</li>

<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hypertension&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97685393" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hypertension&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97685393" rel="nofollow">[40]</a> - Removal of a fully-referenced Google Answers site directly related to the article in question, as well as removal of the same source of directly-related, informative articles listed above. Reason for deletion: "removed link to a non-medical forum, and spam link to ad driven MFA site (Made For Adsense)". Google Answers is not a "forum", but a place where people respond to direct questions, usually with well documented justification behind their answers (as was this case). The article on that <i>oh-so-offensive</i> MFA site was very informative, too, which s/he should have noticed if s/he had not been blinded by the inclusion of Ad Sense links.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atomic_clock&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97685445" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atomic_clock&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97685445" rel="nofollow">[41]</a> - And again.</li>

This one is iffy. The site provides "Latest Roth IRA News, Glossary, Articles, Discussion" in a blog format. The articles generally vary like any blog between insightful and informative to silly quizzes. However, the given reason of "rm spam link" seems a little harsh, since the site actually provides useful information mixed with fluff. The reason I would agree with the user is because the site does not really appear notable or one of the "best in its class", but until a better link can be found, the information seems better than nothing. Why not mention it on the talk page so that others can keep an eye out for a better link with which to replace it.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christina_Milian&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97972117" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christina_Milian&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97972117" rel="nofollow">[43]</a> - Reason: "removed ad driven spamlink, unofficial links claiming to be official". It <i>is</i> a fansite (and was so-labeled in the link and on the site itself), and probably should be removed, but why the part about it claiming to be official when nothing did? Misleading edit summaries are very annoying, and appear to be used to suppress any dissenting opinions (as s/he has repeatedly tried with the 1001cocktails link).</li>

I'm sure more examples could be found, but this should be plenty to show how much disruption the user caused in only about a week. To be fair, I have only pointed out the edits that were poor decisions in my opinion. The user made several other edits that were quite good. It's just that there can never be any disagreement concerning his/her decisions.</li>

<li>Finally, while it certainly isn't required for contributors or editors to register an account, it would seem that someone who has been around Wikipedia "for years", doing as much supposedly beneficial work for improving Wikipedia, would wish to have an account so that s/he can establish his/her edit history and stand behind his/her actions. Instead, the user has already changed from one anonymous IP (<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.155.70.148.html" title="User talk:68.155.70.148">68.155.70.148</a>) to another (<a href="../../../6/5/2E/User_talk%7E65.0.104.154.html" title="User talk:65.0.104.154">65.0.104.154</a>), making analysis of edit histories much more difficult. And there is no way to tell if there were other anonymous IPs before that. Since the earliest contribution for the prior address only goes back to August, and since the user claims to have been editing "for years", it is logical to assume that there have been other addresses. I'm sure that this is a frustration that administrators have to deal with all the time, because it makes it very difficult to tell if a user is truly familiar with Wiki policies or not, and thus how far and how fast to escalate actions. Given the user's own admission of editing "for years", I would say that the user <i>should</i> be aware of policies and procedures, though s/he appears to take little concern for them until earning the ire of an admin. The speed at which the user locates complaints to admins, and then quickly defends him/herself, is another sign that the user <i>is</i> fully aware of proper procedures, but chooses to ignore them until s/he has to be troubled with them.</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, this user <i>does</i> do a lot of good by cleaning up articles that nobody else seems inclined to deal with. S/he has a unique view on what is and is not acceptable for linking to from Wikipedia, and rabidly enforces that opinion through slow-motion edit wars, name calling and derogatory edit summary comments, and intimidation. The user does not enter into dialog, preferring to engage in one-way conversation only when necessary to defend him/herself, resorting to impersonation and defacement of other users to achieve his/her goals. Sometimes the user's acts of removing "spam links" leaves articles without sources, without any indication that the statement should be sourced, and never (in the edit history available) seeks to replace poor sources with better ones. Remove and revert appear to be the motto of this user. Even assuming good faith, it is pretty difficult to remain convinced that the user is acting without knowledge of proper procedure given his/her stated length of time editing at Wikipedia and solid grip on how to identify and defend him/herself against any administrative actions. --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillscrlt_a1d7.html" title="User:Willscrlt">Willscrlt</a> 05:40, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Note: 70.149.186.6 appears to be the same user with a different IP address (to circumvent the block?).

<dd>The fact is this unregistered user seems to feel that his point of view is so strong that he has the right to made reverts on details where the community already reached a consensus in the Talk Page, or things he simply doesn't like, without discussing them with other users. His agenda is to delete the same specific information in several articles, as an unregistered contributor. Some of the articles where he's acting have set a good example of dispute resolution and etiquette, and it would be a shame to see them protected just because of this. I really still hope he rethinks his unpleasant behaviour and becomes an active user of the Talk Pages where he could say why he would change some contents. I'm sure he would be considered since he seems to have a strong opinion. By now, he's an obstacle. --<a href="../../../r/a/v/User%7ERavenloft_aa4f.html" title="User:Ravenloft">Ravenloft</a> 11:17, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>He/She hasn't done this in a couple of days, but looking through their edit history they seem to have something of an aversion to actually using talk pages. I don't know if I'd call this vandalism exactly, but it is edit warring with a strong <a href="../../../t/e/_/WP%7ETE_1869.html" title="WP:TE">WP:TE</a> flavor.

<p>I've been dealing with a user who uses a variety of IPs from Georgia (USA) to introduce subtle misinformation into articles. The vandalism is usually pretty clear to someone who knows how to spot it- the user will change a relatively minor but crucial detail in an article, such as a member of the voicecast. From then, he/she proceeds to the voicecast member's article and changes it accordingly. Eventually, the user runs the gamut of related articles and it leads to a headache. Here are a few IPs I've had to deal with (in chronological order, top to bottom):</p>

<p>A couple other editors pointed out to me earlier that <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScifiintel_126b.html" title="User:Scifiintel">Scifiintel</a> has been mass-spamming the talk pages of all the users in <a href="../../../c/h/r/Category%7EChristian_Wikipedians_8817.html" title="Category:Christian Wikipedians">Category:Christian Wikipedians</a> today, asking that they edit <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> "to make it an accurate...presentation of Him" and "keep it focused on Him", since the article is apparently the first Google hit when searching for "Jesus". More disturbingly, his motivation for doing this is that the article could be the first impression some readers get of Jesus (rather than it being from "a Christian or the Bible" ), which sounds really fishy to me - as if he were trying to use the article to proselytize readers. This might need to be looked into for possible <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>, as well, given that he's warning the users about 3RR and NPOV.

<p><a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPastorwayne_2dac.html" title="User:Pastorwayne">Pastorwayne</a> has been creating categories at an incredible rate.

<p>At this point, Pastorwayne's activities are becoming extremely disruptive.

<p>I would like to suggest that the administrators either do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bar Pastorwayne from category creation.</li>
<li>Require Pastorwayne to have other people review his proposed categories before they are created.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a>, an administrator, had attempted to discuss this rampant category creation with Pastorwayne before 22 December 2006.

<p>I sincerely regret having to do this. However, Pastorwayne seems to be out of control. I can ask other people to comment if necessary.</p>

<dd>Yes I agree. I think that having too many unnecessary (and some inflammatory) cats goes against the purpose of a "category", which is to have a few denominations which are used to classify groups of articles. At the rate at which Pastorwayne is going, every article will have a category of it's own, which makes the whole process of categorization meaningless.<a href="../../../r/u/m/User%7ERumpelstiltskin223_6de5.html" title="User:Rumpelstiltskin223">Rumpelstiltskin223</a> 22:30, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I too agree. PW is creating an untold amount of over-categorisation and clearly fails to understand how much chaos he is causing.

<dd>There are plenty of CfD's going on at any given time without us worrying about one user's overwhelming number of "products".

<dd>Unfortunately, the extended discussion on Pastorwayne's talk page demonstrates that he has been unwilling to voluntarily commit to any reconciliatory actions. <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> made repeated requests for Pastorwayne to discuss his categories with other people or to cease his category creation activities voluntarily.

<p>Because of the nature of the CFD process, this user creates a lot of cleanup work for others. A little investment of time on his part results in a lot of time wasted for others. I hope that jc37's intervention helps Pastorwayne finally "get it", but if not, <i>something</i> has to be done, and Dr. Submillimeter's suggestions sound good. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">lk</span></a> — 02:16, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

Pastorwayne made a number of edits to <a href="../../../b/e/v/Beverly_Waugh_6585.html" title="Beverly Waugh">Beverly Waugh</a> on 3 January 2007, including the creation of a link to Category:Christian editors.

This looks like Pastorwayne is creating categories again using a method described in <a href="../../../c/a/t/WP%7ECAT_61dd.html" title="WP:CAT">WP:CAT</a> whereby a category can be created by first adding it as a red link to an article before creating the category page itself.

<dd>According to <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProveIt_5236.html" title="User:ProveIt">ProveIt</a>, Pastorwayne added red link categories like this to multiple articles on 3 January 2007.

<p>A couple thoughts.</p>
<p>First, I'd like to suggest that attacks on CfD to Pastorwayne stop ("Looks like another Pastorwayne category..."). If the user is misunderstanding Wikipedian policy (and in my estimation, he apparently doesn't understand at least <i>some</i> of it...), then such comments are an obvious contravention of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. I know it can be frustrating, but <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a> are not helpful, and doing so doesn't set a good example of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikilove_b832.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikilove">Wiki-Love</a>&#160;: ) - Teach, don't throw stones.</p>
<p>Second, that said, I think that Pastorwayne flagrantly has ignored repeated requests to curb his actions until he has learned more about the policies and guidelines of categorisation on Wikipedia. I've left a note on his talk page, with a warning to stop his current actions (creating categories) at least until he shows the community that he more fully understands Wikipedia's category policies and guidelines. Else he should be blocked for continued disruption, per <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisruptive_editing_02a2.html" title="Wikipedia:Disruptive editing">Wikipedia:Disruptive editing</a>.</p>
<p>I welcome anyone else's insight into this. - <a href="../../../j/c/3/User%7EJc37_cfd0.html" title="User:Jc37">jc37</a> 18:28, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It looks like you've directed him toward the appropriate places to discuss proposed categories, and warned him he'll be blocked if he doesn't use those routes. I can't imagine what else you ought to do. Now we wait to see what he does when following those routes results in being told that one of his proposals is not a good idea. I'm not optimistic about the upcoming week or so, but in any case I will refrain from mentioning his username in CfD's from here on out unless I'm responding to him directly. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">lk</span></a> — 23:36, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A number of users have been continually reverting legitimate edits to <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambridge_Union_Society_8acb.html" title="Cambridge Union Society">Cambridge Union Society</a> to make the role of the president seem more important than it actually is.

<p>If it helps, I can also confirm observations of above activity. Several different independent editors have been working hard to address the issue but the 'users' above refuse to follow any civil discussion or justify any of their hostile edits with direct references to demonstrate their validity. According the the history, users Mj297, Beckhamaddress, WallStreet, Morgancus, Roaccutane1, and several IPs which come from the same ISP pool have at one point or another engagued in the above activity.</p>
<p>--<a href="../../../n/h/a/User%7ENhartman_5820.html" title="User:Nhartman">Nhartman</a> 13:52, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Just another update... I looks like some admins have now tried also reverting the hostile changes but they just keep getting put back within a matter of minutes. Also, yesterday as part of our attempt to deal with this issue I posted a very long but detailed post on the article's discussion page explaining with detailed quotes and analysis from official texts why the above described edits are false and have the effect of aggrandising one's position over what it actually is. That discussion was just quickly deleted from the board by Beckhamaddress (I suppose becuase Beckhamaddress and suspected sockpuppets didn't want people to see that information). An administrator subseqently reverted the deletion...</p>
<p>--<a href="../../../n/h/a/User%7ENhartman_5820.html" title="User:Nhartman">Nhartman</a> 15:51, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Perhaps it's been resolved... The above noted user (with many strongly suspected sockpuppets, including a new one today) seems to have backed off, or at least he's posted on the talk page that he will, after being confronted with essentially irrefutable evidence that their edits were factually incorrect and misleading. The text that is there, and the one that Beckhamaddress says he won't mess with now, is the one that the other editors were trying to preserve. I guess we'll take that as an unofficial admission of guilt in regards to the above described mess and agreement for the hostile activities on his part to stop. Assuming the Beckhamaddress and assocated other user suspected sockpuppets hold to that word then the problem should be resolved (fingers crossed).</p>

<p>This sort of thing is why I wish watching an article would give you the option of automatically watching all of its included images. Half the time the only person watching an image is its uploader, who may very well have no clue what they're doing or be inactive. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> <small><a href="../../../t/j/s/User_talk%7ETjstrf_3ddb.html" title="User talk:Tjstrf">talk</a></small> 20:10, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>What you aren't telling us is that the template contained a justification for fair use of these images that tended out not to be valid, which is why it was deleted. Thus, the images now no longer do have a justification, and are subject to being deleted. Orphanbot is just doing its job. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 20:14, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The point is that most of the images are valid- either because they are in the public domain, or ineligible for copyright. I would agree that some may be ineligible and should be deleted. However, a bot cannot determine this- it just removes all of them for deletion from all the articles- and will cause a lot of work for people to go through the images and then re-add them back when the bot has made a mistake. <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> 20:26, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The problem is that the folks at TFD didn't announce this to WP:HV whenever this TFD took place. We only watch our own uploads and nobody has thousands of alien images on a watchlist. Furthermore the untagging happend on <s>December 23, which means that our editors weren't very active.</s> Dec. 12 and 30 where our editors weren't very active. In fact, the number of highly active participants on WP:HV is very low and it looks like several are on vacation or studying for exams. Consequently it went unnoticed when one bot removed the tags without replacing them with a warning or anything else. A second bot (Orphanbot) then takes up where the first left off and tags and later removes images. I only realized this was going on because I suddenly noticed images disappearing from a list of coats arms of a German Bundesland. My entire day has been completely wasted trying to get hundreds of legitimate images away from Orphanbot before it trashed them, but examining copyright issues racing against a robot is not exactly perfect work conditions. A message I posted to the bot's owner didn't seem to have any effect, so the bot kept eating away. From any image beginning with "D" and on, I simply tried to stay ahead of the thing trying to stop it from trashing more legitimate material. Then I could spend more time removing Orphanbot's work from a lot of legitimate images it already had trashed and which I'd failed to stop it from tagging in the first place. If you don't believe me, feel free to go through my edit log for today. The images you'll find there are PD but were on Orphanbot's shopping list. Two or three weren't but qualified for fair use since we have articles about them. Most of the images had no source, but this is not required since they are exempt from any possible copyright issues according to the laws of their relevant countries (see the license templates I've added to the images and the corresponding Wikipedias). <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValentinian_be8b.html" title="User:Valentinian">Valentinian</a> <sup><a href="../../../v/a/l/User_talk%7EValentinian_fb3b.html" title="User talk:Valentinian">(talk)</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Valentinian_3b01.html" title="Special:Contributions/Valentinian">(contribs)</a></sup> 21:58, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It doesn't kill them as such, no, but try to examine many hundreds of images given a deadline of exactly two days (according to the bot, the images it removed today will be deleted on Friday this week.

<p>Just to anyone watching this issue, I thought I'd clear up what actually happened. I closed the <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplates_for_deletion_Log_2006_December_3_a1ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Templates for deletion/Log/2006 December 3">TfD</a>, and over a couple of days in the middle of December I set MartinBotIII to work removing the instances of the template from all pages per the TfD. At this stage, I didn't want to put some repleacement tag on because, for one, an AWB bot can't determine copyright, and a "no copyright" tag would have been inappropriate as some (many?) of the image pages had proper tags with the confusing coatofarms. I recognise that I should have contacted <a href="../../../h/v/_/WP%7EHV_16b5.html" title="WP:HV">WP:HV</a> at the time, though regreat that I knew not of their existance, and (in all honesty) am surprised that non of the members noticed the TfD or MartinBotIII's removal of the tags on their uploaded images. Anyway, moving on, once MartinBotIII had finished (about 3 days, Dec 12 - 15th ish), I left a message with Carnildo (OrphanBot's owner) to ask him if he could set the bot up to go through the MartinBotIII's contribs, and use its mechanisms to determine if an appropriate tag was present. It would appear by the recent flood of messages on the issue that OrphanBot started work recently, and this has clearly been a shock to those ignorant of the debate. The fact remains though, that as Cyde states, many images tagged with coatofarms had no suitable copyright, and must go (eventually). The notes on the TfD itself highlight an interesting copyright issue, which may mean that some of the images being tagged PD now are actually more recent interpretations, and so may not fall under PD (this is where a source would be important, which many of the images lack, apparantely). That's the background to the issue, and what I did/felt/have seen&#160;:) <strong><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_980f.html" title="User:Martinp23">Mart</a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartinp23_2732.html" title="User talk:Martinp23"><font color="red">inp23</font></a></strong> 22:24, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We have had that debate as well, but WP:HV (and the Wikipedias in question) have come to the opposite conclusion on the last one, <i>provided</i> that a national law states something out of the ordinary. Take e.g. the copyright law of Estonia which states that a government coat of arms can carry no copyright. In that case, we are in good faith when we follow this law, nomatter who created the actual image. Otherwise, we'd be second-guessing about national laws or even undermining them. When I look at the selection of images present on the German Wikipedia, known for its interests in copyright law, and on Wikipedias of other nations with similar laws, it looks like a pattern. In a number of specific cases, a law exempts official (not private) insignia from copyright. I don't see this as any different than when an employee of the U.S. federal government can't claim personal copyright to material he / she produces while performing official duties. I must admit to be getting quite fond of the Estonian law - which I discovered earlier today, it is very clear; ""§ 5. Results of intellectual activities to which this [copyright] Act does not apply: ... official symbols of the state and insignia of organisations (flags, coats of arms, orders, medals, badges, etc.) and banknotes". I can only interpret this as: "yes the government of Estonia recognizes that an individual did create this image but it is not in the national interest [for whatever reason] to allow him / her any personal copyrights, so authors can't claim any for a very limited list of potential images, e.g. national insignia and images of official medals. When it comes to West European law, this is - alas - not the normal situation, and you have a point about some of those images. The only problem was that today's images were a giant mess from at least three groups.</dd>
<dd>Btw, Martin. I don't believe that your purpose with Martinbot was to trash or disrupt WP:HV. Of course not, but a lot of things went wrong here. None were catastrophic by themselves, but the combination was ... pretty unfortunate. 1) WP:HV was pretty inactive in December and failed to notice both the TFD and the retagging. I guess people were resting after a lot of article tagging. 2) you didn't notice we existed either and so we weren't contacted (now you know where we are).&#160;:) 3) Orphanbot's owner didn't notice that today's list of images was exceptionally long. Playing the blame game doesn't help anybody in this situation. A lot of good PD images were saved today, let's not forget that. Let's focus on seeking through the rubble and find the rest that fall into the same category. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValentinian_be8b.html" title="User:Valentinian">Valentinian</a> <sup><a href="../../../v/a/l/User_talk%7EValentinian_fb3b.html" title="User talk:Valentinian">(talk)</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Valentinian_3b01.html" title="Special:Contributions/Valentinian">(contribs)</a></sup> 23:43, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I know this is something I should probably handle myself, but it's the first time I've considered actually warning somebody, so I'd like advice and a second opinion on the correct next step.</p>
<p>User:72.159.146.131 recently dropped some trash in <a href="../../../z/z/y/Zzyzx%2C_California_0da1.html" title="Zzyzx, California">Zzyzx, California</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zzyzx%2C_California&amp;diff=98208112&amp;oldid=97842242" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zzyzx%2C_California&amp;diff=98208112&amp;oldid=97842242" rel="nofollow">diff</a>). I've reverted it, but looking at <a href="../../../7/2/2E/User_talk%7E72.159.146.131.html" title="User talk:72.159.146.131">User talk:72.159.146.131</a> it appears that this is only one of a number of similar abuses over the last few months, and the user's contrib log seems to indicate few if any productive edits.</p>
<p>My inclination is to add {{test3ip}}, but given that the abuses are scattered over a few months I'm unsure.</p>
<p>Comments?</p>

<dd>&lt;.&lt; Not sure I'm the one that should be giving advice here, but I'd go with a Test2IP. For all I know, it's a rapidly changing IP (Doesn't appear to be, though)... next thing is, the huge gap in edits, which usually calls for the warning level to be lowered (Typically, from what I know, below a three). A Test2ip would be my call. <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBold_3536.html" title="WP:Bold">But be bold, Wikipedia isn't always right!</a> <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELogical2u_96f0.html" title="User:Logical2u">User:Logical2u</a><sub><a href="../../../l/o/g/User_talk%7ELogical2u_14f2.html" title="User talk:Logical2u">Talk</a></sub> 21:08, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

This was followed by the creation of <a href="../../../i/t/i/User%7EItihaas_a663.html" title="User:Itihaas">User:Itihaas</a> who continued to disrupt. This account was also indef-blocked by me.

<p>The user Roadline has spammed my talk and user page, twice with threatening messages. He is pretending to be an administrator when he clearly is not and has copied the default vandalism warning message from another source within wikipedia. I have attempted to contact the user to ask him to stop, but his response was another threatening message in my talk page. The user has contributed nothing to wikipedia except these threatening messages on my talk and user page as shown by his history and I request some assistance here, please. I was prepared to deal with it after the first attack, but enough is enough, right.

It COULD happen, never say never, but I think we need to make sure the world knows that we do our best to try to keep editing open for good faith users everywhere, even to the point of putting up with a lot of random crap from bad ISPs to try to help their poor customers.--<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> 03:57, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</b></p>

<dd>An indefinate softblock is probably best - one IP for an entire country should be treated similarly to an open proxy, I think (but soft, not hard, as it's not the resident's fault).

<dd>I agree with Tango above, as the vandalism isn't going to go away once the block expires anyawy. It definately needs to be soft (account creation allowed) in any case - the usual advice of registering an account elsewhere and logging in on the blocked IP is impossible, it seems. Probably best if we sort this out quickly. <strong><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_980f.html" title="User:Martinp23">Mart</a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartinp23_2732.html" title="User talk:Martinp23"><font color="red">inp23</font></a></strong> 13:23, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just want to point out that at the time the address was blocked, I had no idea that I was blocking an entire country. It was not even marked as a shared IP. Although there was a comment on the discussion page, the IP was not marked as shared and I did not read that comment to mean that this was the <i>only</i> ISP serving Qatar. Frankly, I am stunned that an entire country can get by with only one IP address, though I understand about proxies and the like. I would like to say that I will never do this again in the future but in all honesty, it is entirely possible that I will make similar mistakes in the future. Such is not my intention and I would never have blocked this address had I known it was shared (let alone that it was an entire nation). --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 20:06, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is a pity, as the story is now being reported incorrectly in Qatar. We had been blocked a number of times, for periods of days, and had complained about this on the user talk page. All of this is verifiable from the block logs and archive of the talk page, and from the block logs of previous IP addresses used by the Qtel proxy (yes, it does change). The reply from admins was that they *realised* the effect, but life is tough sometimes. It seems obvious that the slashdot front page was the only reason that blocking of qatar has finally come to an end -- 82.148.97.69 09:08, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I posted the first message on this thread with the intent of mitigating the effects of the block (it was lifted almost immediately). If this or any other ISP chooses this technical solution, we will have to find a way to accomodate those users who are affected while at the same time keeping an eye on vandalism. As far as Wikipedia is concerned there is no difference between this ISP and others who use a proxy server (like AOL, see <a href="../../../a/o/l/Wikipedia%7EAOL_2a45.html" title="Wikipedia:AOL">Wikipedia:AOL</a>).

<dd>I think this section is just going to get more and more bloated. First it was just the UK parliament and the US Congress, because blocking them created a media frenzy and affects the legal situation, a far bigger problem than this minor Qatar mention. Then Canada was added, probably because someone wanted to prove Canada was equally important. Then the toolserver was added because it houses Anti-Vandal Bot and was erroneously blocked (and the page was never fixed, I "<i>must</i> notify" the Communications Committee immediately if I block the toolserver? No, that would be an entirely internal matter, no press would notice it, and it would either be an emergency or an error anyway). If the list is used in this manner it becomes meaningless, and the longer the list the less each item will be noticed. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 09:54, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just my personal, mildly informed opinion: TV schedules don't seem to be the kind of thing that are copyrightable. Additionally, they do seem encyclopedic to me. You can get a great insight into what society was like decades ago by looking at the kind of things they could watch on television in a single night. Beyond knowing merely which shows were popular from a given time period, it's important to know when they were shown and in what order. Also, it's very interesting (at least to me) to see how prime time viewing has shifted over time in content, duration, and time of night. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 20:17, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, I do believe TV schedules can be encyclopedic. Of course, they have to be discussed and synthesized (not necessarily just presented at face value). But there's definitely interesting and encyclopedic material to be mined from them, and best of all, there are already journal articles that do exactly this, and can be cited. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 20:24, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Just to clarify: I think these are worth including as lists in Wikipedia, for the reasons Cyde Weys gives above, and if there are no copyright problems, I'd like to see them kept. The problem is that there is a plausible argument that they might be considered to be copyrighted works. A TV schedule is most certainly a "form or manner in which ideas or information have been manifested". But does it count as an artistic work from the viewpoint of U.S. copyright law? I don't know.
<p>My point is that, unless we have evidence that these schedules are GFDL-compatible, we shouldn't have them in Wikipedia, rather than simply assuming that they are OK because no-one knows what their status is. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 20:24, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My understanding is that while arrangements of information is copyrightable the information itself is not. Is that not how Wikipedia works by taking information from copyrighted source, arranging it in a creative original way and citing the source? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 20:32, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem is that, in this case, the schedule itself is the arrangement of information; as you say, arranging the programs in a creative original way. Just listing which programs were in the schedule for that year is like noting the key signature of a piece of music, an uncopyrightable fact. However, if you were to print a factual list of the sequence of notes in a piece of music, that would be copyrightable. The problem is if you were to regard the schedule itself, in its totality, as a creative work, like a DJ set.
<p>As I say, in other countries, TV broadcasters most certainly have asserted copyright in their schedules. The question is whether this is the case in the U.S. There must be a precedent somewhere for this. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 20:35, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm inclined to agree with the above that the schedules themselves probably aren't copyrightable. Once the shows have aired, listing what was on becomes a simple matter of historical fact lacking the apparent creativity necessary for copyright.

According to the article on <a href="../../../f/e/i/Feist_v._Rural_4040.html" title="Feist v. Rural">Feist v.

<dd>Television schedules in the U.S. are not copyrightable, and, in fact, are frequently used in television encyclopedias such as Alex McNeil's <i>Total Television</i> and the competing publications. In fact, McNeil has an entire 50 page section dedicated to <i>nothing but</i> television schedules without a single appearance of a copyright notice. This is the first time I'm hearing of this. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirsfron_bff1.html" title="User:Firsfron"><font color="#0000FF">Firsfron of Ronchester</font></a> 20:55, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have been working on the daytime TV articles, and I do not see how you can copyright a simple listing of facts. They can be verified by looking into old TV Guides or newspaper TV listings. If the form in which the facts are presented can be copyrighted I see no violation by any of the articles in this category. The form is unique to the articles. In my opinion, they should be kept. The programs themselves are creative works that are copyrighted, but I don't see the problem with saying what time they aired. <a href="../../../a/t/t/User%7EAttmay_3907.html" title="User:Attmay">Attmay</a> 20:55, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Also, transformative use may come into play here. If we were to accept there is copyright in the mere arrangement of television schedules, then this could prevent another network using the same schedule (not that it could, because it wouldn't have the rights to the same programs!)&#160;: but we aren't running the programs in such a way.

<dd>Television schedules serve a useful research purpose for authors of historical fiction. A writer who sets a childhood tale in the 1950s, for example, would want to know what network <i><a href="../../../h/o/w/Howdy_Doody_90d8.html" title="Howdy Doody">Howdy Doody</a></i> aired on, what day or days of the week it was available, and what hour it was broadcast. This adds to the story's realism and could affect plot elements. <font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charg</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><span style="color:#0c0">e!</span></a></i></sup></font> 23:08, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>These are not copyrightable. What's confused some people is that the television schedules were "created" by someone, but just because your decisions can be expressed as written data doesn't mean that you've created copyrightable written expression. The schedule is more akin to a set of instructions, or a recipe: "air program B after program A at these times." This is not eligible for copyright.</p>
<p>There's also the fact that the relevant "work" to be judged would not be a night's schedule as a whole, but instead a single network's schedule. These only include around 3 - 5 elements, a very short "phrase" consisting of a few television series titles as "words" that is simply too insubstantial to qualify for copyright protection. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 03:12, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Perhaps this will help: <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ34.html" class="external text" title="http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ34.html" rel="nofollow">www.copyright.gov's circular 34</a> specifically states that "titles of works" are "not subject to copyright"; accordingly the names of the television shows are not copyrightable (they can be trademarks, but that's a different issue.) Furthermore, from the same source, "mere listings of ingredients, as in recipes, labels, or formulas" are not subject to copyright. Since a television schedule is a "listing of ingredients" in a network's daily broadcast, the collection of titles is <i>also</i> not copyrightable. I'm not a lawyer, and of course copyright law is subject to interpretation by the courts, but this seems extremely clear-cut. --Heath 66.32.117.111 03:48, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>What happens in other countries is also irrelevant, some other countries allow facts to be copyrighted. The US does not. <a href="../../../v/x/p/User%7EVxP_9dfc.html" title="User:VxP">VxP</a> 21:04, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Does "television schedule" refer to the grid that appears in the newspaper or <i>TV Guide</i>? Or to a particular network or TV station's schedule? If the latter, I would argue that they probably are copyrightable under US law. The relevant Supreme Court case (<i>Feist</i>) had to do with telephone books. The Court held that white pages are not copyrightable because of a lack of originality; they are merely an alphabetical list of facts. But it turns out that yellow pages can be copyrighted because the selection and arrangement of the "facts" in them meet the minimal threshhold of originality.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>As someone who has worked in the TV business, I can say with some certainty that an incredible amount of thought and sometimes even creativity goes into planning a TV schedule. Why did ABC move <i>Gray's Anatomy</i> from Sunday nights to Thursdays? Wasn't the show doing well on Sundays? Was it losing its lead-in audience? How will it compete against NBC's comedies and CBS's <i>CSI</i>? Executives get hired and fired over these decisions. I'd say that this process involves originality. (And it differs from a recipe because the order in which ingredients are listed generally doesn't matter.)</dd>
<dd>On the other hand, a simple list of shows on NBC or a local station would not be copyrightable (this is analogous to a recipe). And I would agree that a TV guide is not copyrightable (although that may depend on the extent to which information like show synopses is added). My cursory look at the category in question indicates that we are talking about simple grids, so I think it is not a copyvio. (And either way, there's probably a "fair use" argument to be made.)--<a href="../../../v/b/d/User%7EVbd_89b7.html" title="User:Vbd">Vbd</a> 14:32, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As it turns out, Fluffbrain had, since the end of November, also been creating sockpuppets to edit and edit-war for her on various articles she was interested in.

Two days later he decided to post a rambling attack on Angela and Jimbo which I thought was over the line and certainly misposted on the EL Talk page, and reverted it, <a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossBuckle_Swami_963e.html#Your_note" title="User talk:JossBuckle Swami">explaining it on his Talk page</a>.

<dd>Yes, I did. However, the AfDs are still <i>incomplete</i> without a proper rationale.

<dd>Looking at Iamunknown's talk page and some of the other afds in this list, it was originally part of an omnibus nomination list of fictional actors...and the original nominator either didn't link them all correctly to the one discussion or Iamunknown didn't notice.

<dd>I'm not sure what you mean when you say you don't qualify for AIV; anyone can post to AIV as long as the steps at the top of the page have been followed. If they haven't been followed, then the vandal shouldn't be blocked. That's true no matter where you post about it. Moreschi has given the user a {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest3_288f.html" title="Template:Test3">test3</a>}} and they appear to have stopped, so if they start up again, give them a {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest4_bd45.html" title="Template:Test4">test4</a>}}; if they continue after that, follow the instructions on <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> to list them and it will be taken care of.
