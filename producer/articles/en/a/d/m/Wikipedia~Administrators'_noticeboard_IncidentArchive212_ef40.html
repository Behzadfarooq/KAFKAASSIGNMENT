<p>Please help.</p>
<p>I am new to Wikipedia/WikiMedia. In the process of trying to make copy a Wikipedia HelpPage for my own Wiki I realized had I accidentally made the edits to Wikipedia itself. The edits involve two redirects, all focused around the page</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Contents/Editing_Wikipedia" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Contents/Editing_Wikipedia" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Contents/Editing_Wikipedia</a></p>
<p>however, when i tried to revert/undo my accidental changes by doing another revert, it seems that all the history has gone. I think becuase of some cyclic redirects.</p>
<p>Could someone please fix these changes before too many people get upset! Sorry! Mr-morfik 22:13, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This user has repeatedly uploaded copyrighted images to WP, either leaving them unsourced or tagging them with obviously invalid fair use claims. Despite the numerous messages left on his talk page, he continues to do so. He has already received his final warning for page vandalism too. Thought I should probably bring this here for admin attention, rather than at <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>, as it's not really a case of "simple vandalism".

<dd>I have blocked this user indefinitely for disruption, per my comments in the last thread about this person. He continues to upload photos with no copyright status or incorrect copyright status, and vandalize, and has been warned numerous times about this despite somehow never being blocked.

<dd>The complaint that you're abusing admin rights seems to come from the misunderstanding that being an admin means you get to dictate the result of content disputes. However, the main thrust of the complaint is not that you abused your admin tools, but you abused the editor tools, and thus shouldn't be an admin anymore. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">moo!</a></small> 14:40, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>And that complaint seems to be unfounded; you've only edited the article twice, and most of the unsourced information was not <i>added</i> by you. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">moo!</a></small> 14:44, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Tell him to file a user conduct rfc if he really believes what he's saying (after all, abuse of admin power is a serious allegation).

<dd>Of late, this appears to be the first thing that people shout - "ADMIN ABUSE!!!!" - whenever they don't understand what has happened, don't like a consensus, don't like a contribution, don't like a contributor, etc. If just 1% of these types of accusations were real, we'd be in trouble. But not even 1% are (more like 0.0001%) and the noise-to-signal ratio means we'd have trouble spotting an admin gone really rouge even if it did happen. I've lost count of how many times I've been accused of it - several before I got the mop and one about 15 minutes after I got it ... downhill from there. Worth your while to ignore this one, Donald, really. <b>〈<a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_ab65.html" title="User:Redvers"><font color="red">RED</font></a><a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedvers_29e5.html" title="User talk:Redvers"><font color="red">VEЯS</font></a>〉</b> 14:53, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>I noticed that an editor (<a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandomfrenchie_e5d2.html" title="User:Randomfrenchie">User:Randomfrenchie</a>) uploaded an image (<a href="../../../s/c/h/Image%7ESchool_804.gif_4ab3.html" title="Image:School 804.gif">Image:School 804.gif</a>), claiming that the image is in the public domain.

(No, I can't prove it.) I have talked to this person in real life, and my conversation with him showed that he probably would have lied about an image's copyright status.

<dd>Was just trying to provide some background for any interested. And you had asked on his userpage for a discussion that said his userbox could stay.

<dd>I think I do, though. If the content is unacceptable in the open, then it's unacceptable when it's "hidden" behind pipes, too.

<dd>No, as above. If there's a consensus that says supporting Hezbollah against Israeli "massacres" is okay (and that <i>is</i> what the current version says, although covertly), then fine -- but in that case, I fail to see why the "Hezbollah = Murder" userbox is any worse. Personally, I don't care for either side in the conflict, but I don't think we should allow one of these messages and not the other -- that would appear to be taking sides. If stating a political view in terms of "X is murdering people" is okay, both boxes are okay. If not, both are not. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 10:28, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Personally, i've never supported any of the versions myself (see current and archived Embargo's user page).

Otherwise, i'll be supporting the immediate removal of all these userboxes which <i>smell</i> politics. -- <i><a href="../../../f/a/y/User%7EFayssalF_b498.html" title="User:FayssalF"><font size="2px" face="Verdana"><font color="DarkSlateBlue">FayssalF</font></font></a></i> - <small><a href="../../../f/a/y/User_talk%7EFayssalF_f604.html" title="User talk:FayssalF"><font style="background: gold"><sup><i>Wiki me up ®</i></sup></font></a></small> 10:48, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Laudable of you, but I think that misses the point. Politics isn't the problem; it's a smokescreen. The problem (if one exists) is couching political statements in terms of "murder" and "massacres". I think there's room for userboxes that state political views without demonizing any given political entity in that way. That said, if it's been settled, I'm not inclined to push. Neither of them offends me, particularly. Just wanted to point out that defending one of those boxes while attacking the other is a pot/kettle situation; they're more or less equivalent, for better or for worse. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 07:20, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>On Sockpuppetry- Geg seems to act similar to Apostrophe, both harass me, both edit the same pages pretty much. Harassment- Both keep rverting edits of mine for no apparent reason, and will remove my comments on their talk pages, claiming i am vandalising it.

<p>UPDATE: The section has a fair amount of trivia, and they dont even explain to me why. They just harass me while reerting the edits most of the time. <a href="../../../i/n/v/User%7EInvaderSora_275f.html" title="User:InvaderSora">Can i have some fishy crackers?</a> 03:13, 7 March 2007 (UTC),</p>

This whole thing stends from something that <a href="../../../i/n/v/User%7EInvaderSora_275f.html" title="User:InvaderSora">InvaderSora</a> starting trying to add to the article [[Kingdom Hearts II] a while ago that Apostrophe and I and a few other users such as <a href="../../../u/r/u/User%7EUrutapu_0994.html" title="User:Urutapu">User:Urutapu</a>, <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxem_Titanium_88f9.html" title="User:Axem Titanium">User:Axem Titanium</a>, and <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">User:Ryulong</a> would revert due to it being irrelevent.

<dd>Also.. "And by the way, there's nothing wrong with removing comments from talk pages." Well, yeah there is, but not when it's obviously just him being smart by trying to act like one of the "Welcome to Wikipedia" guys.

Because i changed my name. And i stopped putting it under Trivia with other notable trivia things. Just because you and your little group dont like it doesnt mean it is irrelivent. <a href="../../../i/n/v/User%7EInvaderSora_275f.html" title="User:InvaderSora">Can i have some fishy crackers?</a> 03:19, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Anyway, this sounds like a content dispute. InvaderSora, have you tried using the article talk page? This isn't a matter for the admin noticeboard, no matter how much you think they should be blocked. <a href="../../../j/u/j/User%7EJuJube_a9d8.html" title="User:JuJube">JuJube</a> 03:23, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>About the trivia, most Wikipedia guidelines like <a href="../../../t/r/i/WP%7ETRIV_4692.html" title="WP:TRIV">WP:TRIV</a> discourage the use of trivia sections in articles, especially for something this unnotable. But yes, this is definitely a content dispute, and as far as I can tell he hasn't tried using the article's talk page. <a href="../../../g/e/g/User%7EGeg_04e0.html" title="User:Geg">The Splendiferous Gegiford</a> 03:28, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For one, you're not an admin, so i'm sorry, but i'll have to ask you to stay out of it. Two, regardless of editing, he has been harassing me, and that's worth a block. Also, Apostrophe seems to often wikistalk me. Proof? He's reverted my edits at pages hes never edited before. The Trivia has more notable stuff to back it up. And i dont use the talk page, because nobody is going to care. Why should i be discussing it ont he talk page if you already remove my comments from talk pages for no reason? <a href="../../../i/n/v/User%7EInvaderSora_275f.html" title="User:InvaderSora">Can i have some fishy crackers?</a> 03:33, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Again, diffs or it didn't happen. User talk pages are different from article talk pages. <a href="../../../j/u/j/User%7EJuJube_a9d8.html" title="User:JuJube">JuJube</a> 03:35, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yet the behavior will likely be the same. See Apostrophe and Geg's talk pages for the diffs. <a href="../../../i/n/v/User%7EInvaderSora_275f.html" title="User:InvaderSora">Can i have some fishy crackers?</a> 03:39, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Again, I wasn't harrassing you until that one time when you kept provoking me. Simply reverting your bad edits isn't "harrassment". And yeah, I did check your contributions to see what other articles you may have edited with that stuff, but "Wikistalking" is defined as "following a contributor around the wiki, editing the same articles as the target, with the intent of causing annoyance or distress to another contributor." I never had the intention of causing annoyance or distress to you, despite the amount you're causing me.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>And like I said, I removed your comments from my talk page because of your sarcastic attitude about it. If you had left a normal message I would have complied. <a href="../../../g/e/g/User%7EGeg_04e0.html" title="User:Geg">The Splendiferous Gegiford</a> 03:53, 7 March 2007 (UTC</dd>

<p>I was NOT being sarcastic. If you think the edits are bad, then IMPROVE THEM! Apostrophe is wikistalking me, though. <a href="../../../i/n/v/User%7EInvaderSora_275f.html" title="User:InvaderSora">Can i have some fishy crackers?</a> 04:19, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

This is true and is to be discouraged, but understand that this behavior was provoked through quantitatively worse behaviour on your part. As stated to you previously, administrator intervention is not meant as a punishment, but as an attempt to control or correct undesired behaviour.

In fact, the entire site seems to be his professional genealogy site, replete with a user page advertising his fee rates. I've offered to him the option to find citations for HOW Huckabee's family history has influenced his professional career, policies, positions on issues, etc., but his is getting hostile. I cannot find a way to make him grasp that using a wiki as a source for a wiki is bad, that his wiki is OR, and probably spamming, and so on.

<dd>The above editor is very confused about what is and is not allowed on talk pages. The issue of a Wikipedian doing source-based research has come up on <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> many times. The answer has always been that Wikipedians are free to do research and post a link to the Talk page, if another Editor wants to add that link to the article they may. The prohibition involves Wikipedians adding their *own* OR to an article page. It does not involve Talk pages whatsoever. <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 22:46, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

His hyperbolic argument should be taken with a fairly large grain of salt. I have never, not once, tried to add this link *to* the article page. I posted a request on the Talk page, to see if someone would add the link. That is the approved, accepted, behaviour as you can find in the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> archives. The issue has come up many times. <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 22:49, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>the "wiki" you link to seems to operate as your own private website - all of the edits are by you, everything is by you. The material seems to represent a novel synthesis and as noted, you even say that it's "speculation" at one stage in the process - so no, it should not be added. --<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFredrick_day_9590.html" title="User:Fredrick day">Fredrick day</a> 22:51, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks a lot for the info. I will contact the abuse department soon to inform them of his disruption of wikipedia. I am sure I know his name too, but have not revealed it yet on wikipedia.

<p>On March 4th and 5th, <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwern_2189.html" title="User:Gwern">User:Gwern</a> appears to have created hundreds of non-functional redirects. I found them because they today flooded the Short pages list <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZorglbot_Shortpages_c7f0.html" title="User:Zorglbot/Shortpages">(Parsed version)</a>. The short pages software did not recognize them as proper redirects, so they all dropped onto the list. Several issues that I see:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do we even want to keep several hundred different capitalizations of "A Long Time Ago, In A Galaxy Far, far Away..." redirects. A couple of others were done as well.</li>
<li>They are non-functional. Some just need a space before the first "[", others need whatever is there (before the first "[")converted to a true space. If they are to be kept, it is a non-trivial fix-it job to clean them up and make them functional.</li>
<li>Does Gwern have permission to run a bot like this? And in his own main user account?</li>
</ol>
<p>Anyway, I'm putting this here because if the answer to #1 is no, we need more admins than me deleting these things. After fixing a couple of dozen of the non-functional ones myself, and realizing that there are hundreds more to fix, I decided I needed help of some sort.</p>
<p>And I'm *not* looking for a block of <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwern_2189.html" title="User:Gwern">User:Gwern</a> at this point. His "bot" has not been running for a couple of days. He may need a warning, especially if the bot is unauthorized, though there is already discussion on his talk from people generally concerned over the flood. But there is at the moment no immenent reason to block him. - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasAndroid_b0eb.html" title="User:TexasAndroid">TexasAndroid</a> 15:20, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Correct me if I'm wrong, but if there is only one article named "A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away" and there aren't 50 different variations with different capitalization, the go/search box will work, no matter what you type, right? For example, we have <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia_Tech_Hokies_b806.html" title="Virginia Tech Hokies">Virginia Tech Hokies</a>. If I type "VIRGINIA TECH HOKIES", "vIrGinIA tECH HoKIES", or any other capitalization into the box, all of those send me to <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia_Tech_Hokies_b806.html" title="Virginia Tech Hokies">Virginia Tech Hokies</a>. So having redirects from all of these alternate capitalizations is useless. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 15:27, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>His concern seems to be that linking isn't as smart as the go box, but, well... users should check when adding links. Maybe something on submit that will check any new redlinks for "go box results" for that text and suggest them would be useful. --<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERandom832_8f73.html" title="User talk:Random832">Random832</a> 16:21, 7 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, redirects from every conceivable alternate capitalization is a maintenance nightmare. The risk of someone accidentally leaving a redlink to an incorrect capitalization is less than the risk of these alternate capitalizations being vandalized becaus nobody is paying attention to them. Unless it's a prominent alternate capitalization (2006-07 NCAA Division I Men's basketball season vs the correct <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006-07_NCAA_Division_I_men%27s_basketball_season_7f9a.html" title="2006-07 NCAA Division I men's basketball season">2006-07 NCAA Division I men's basketball season</a>), I don't think there's a reason to have them there. And even if it is prominent ... there's no real need for it - anyone adding the link will see it is a redlink and fix it. If they don't, someone else will. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 16:30, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I noticed these due to a large number of them appearing at the top of <a href="../../../u/n/c/Special%7EUncategorizedpages_5680.html" title="Special:Uncategorizedpages">Special:Uncategorizedpages</a>. As he seems to have stopped, I don't think any immediate admin action is required, but in short yes, these are/were:</p>
<ul>
<li>broken, due to a missing space,</li>
<li>unnecessary, for the reasons discussed above,</li>
<li>liable to create ridiculous bloat if done for any significant proportion of all articles (increasing the number of pages in the main space by a significant multiple -- probably something on the order of 10 million redirects, depending on the distribution of length in words of article names),</li>
<li>made with an unapproved bot (see <a href="../../../b/r/f/WP%7EBRFA_d541.html" title="WP:BRFA">WP:BRFA</a>, not to say the lack of an explicit consensus <i>anywhere</i> to do this),</li>
<li>inappropriately made from his main account,</li>
<li>done at "bot-like speed", which an account not flagged as a bot really shouldn't ever do, even <i>if</i> approved to do the particular task.</li>
</ul>
<p>(See <a href="../../../b/o/t/WP%7EBOT_8b0e.html" title="WP:BOT">WP:BOT</a> on those last two.) If there's general agreement to delete these, I'll be happy to help out; if that's not entirely clear at this point, one might raise it at <a href="../../../r/f/d/WP%7ERFD_9e02.html" title="WP:RFD">WP:RFD</a>. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 17:10, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ok. Thinking more about how to handle this. The following are suggestions:
<ol>
<li>We begin to clean out (delete) the bulk of these redirects that were bot-created on the 4th and 5th. At current they are an unapproved, non-functional, bot-created mess, clogging up at least a couple of important tracking pages.</li>
<li>Gwern is asked to first get consensous of the very idea of this type of massive redirect. Not sure where he should be directed to for such a discussion, but it's definitely not appropriate for AN/I. (Note that I FYIed him on this debate, so I'm hoping he'll drop in here at some point. He appears to mostly edit in the evening, US time.)</li>
<li>Direct Gwern to the bot approval process, and asked to follow it before he launches the bot again. He *really* should not be testing a bot in his user-space without any sort of authorization.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Note that in all of this I am totally WP:AGF about Gwern. I have no reason at all to think this was anything other than good intentioned. But it really, really needs to go through several more steps before anything like this is repeated. - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasAndroid_b0eb.html" title="User:TexasAndroid">TexasAndroid</a> 17:32, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>My preference would be 1. 'agree to give up on the whole idea', and 2. delete the existing instances. But he might want to press ahead with it, and if so, then as you say, he should take some sort of soundings about this (I can only think of <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia_talk%7ERedirect_489e.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Redirect">Wikipedia talk:Redirect</a> and <a href="../../../r/f/d/WT%7ERFD_ae47.html" title="WT:RFD">WT:RFD</a>, but I'm open to suggestions on a better location), and if that's at all favourable to the idea, go ahead with a bot approval request. Clearing them out before he's had a chance to chime in here might look a <i>bit</i> hasty, if he's determined to go ahead with the idea (heaven forfend), whereas if he has no objection, all'll be well. It should be said that some sort of unapproved 'testing' in the mainspace is more or less custom and practice, but <i>not</i> dozens or hundreds of such edits, at full-bot-speed, and only if closely manually supervised. (Making the same mistake twice in a row isn't a good sign of appropriate "testing", much less 30 times in a minute.) <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 17:54, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Applying the "glass is half full" take on this, one might discern a temporal progression from "personal attack" to "subtle criticism".

Evrik, I am trying to work with you on WP:AWARDS, such as that Service awards thing, but your endless sniping is making it difficult. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDev920_f8f8.html" title="User:Dev920">Dev920</a> (Have a nice day!) 20:32, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I stopped editing for a long time because of the way people treat each other here. I am angered by Dev920's blatant abuse of the system (who the f--- files three notices at the ANI in a week?), and her power grab. Evrik worked long and fairly to make sure that the system was working and repeatedly asked for everyone's help. After the dust settles, I am contemplating leaving Wikipedia for good because of Dev920.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This should have been mediated long before it was brought to the administrators. I've now been mentioned three times at the ANI this week by Dev920 - and I don't think it's fair. --South Philly 13:59, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Maybe if Southphilly would stop being so abusive I wouldn't have to keep coming here. Note that this is brought up every single day at the same time - when southphilly starts editing. I am genuinely confused about southphilly's accusation that I am grabbing power: what fucking power? How is contributing to a wikiproject controlling it? Seriously, what the hell is he talking about? I haven't removed anyone's messages, I haven't, significantly, started a revert war with anyone because I want my own way, I have no idea why southphilly insists on posting such accusations about me here, on the project page and now on Alai's page. It's insane. Southphilly posted a personal attack against me on WT:AWARDS claiming I had ousted evrik from the project and had "taken over" <i>when evrik is still posting on the page</i>. Given my only experience with South philly has been to observe his endless attempts to get his own way against all reason and opposition, I can only think when he leaves Wikipedia will be better for it. I am going to get on with my work now, and I hope Southphilly will see the sense of quitting before he makes himself looks even more irrational. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDev920_f8f8.html" title="User:Dev920">Dev920</a> (Have a nice day!) 14:56, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Putting the ethical issue aside this picture has no relable basis of fact. No one can confirm that this is Essjay.

<li>I dunno, I glanced at the article before and it basically said about the picture, "I don't know, this was posted to the user page so maybe it's him but maybe it's some random other <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">living person</a> we're now associating with this event."

<li>Feelings are running high in the community regarding essjay at them moment - but we're not here to serve ourselves - we're here to serve 'those out there'. The issue has gained wide publicity - today I read a report of the issue on the BBC - this exposure is going to generate traffic. Stepping back from my opinions as a wikipedian (And I'm conflicted as the next man on this - great wikipedian but possibly damaging etc. etc.) the press it's generated and the way the community deals with such things is good for us and our profile - it was a good and brave call putting it on the front page at this time and I welcome it. Upsetting for essjay? undoubtedly.

<li>Oh, stupid navel-gazing! Endorse removal of both the picture and the DYK. I'm all for the "persecution" (which I would call examination) of the matters behind Essjay and ramifications to Essjay of his mendacity, but this is an internal matter, and we are not an issue for DYK. Heck, a lot of the "did you knows" lately have been "did you care?" In this case, the photo is of a person who may not be Essjay, and all of this folderol is self-reference. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:12, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>It is a threat of physical attack, but it's made to a -bot. Then again, we block for the threat of attack, not the likelihood of its fulfillment.

<li>Sorry. I was apparently mistiming my drugs. You're right. It is a threat of attack, so yes, it is a block offense, if we can catch the IP at work. I see that the user has gotten a "this is your last warning" warning, so a block at the next hint of trouble. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 15:14, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

This has basically been his only activity on Wikipedia for over half a year. After comments on <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Macedonia_6cbf.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Macedonia">this RfC</a>, I felt justified in deleting his page (twice, after another attempt by him) and telling him that henceforth no political content whatsoever would be tolerated there (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Macedonia&amp;diff=110865791&amp;oldid=108570088" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Macedonia&amp;diff=110865791&amp;oldid=108570088" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>). There was also an attempt to get him to change his username, which however was rejected at <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_N_c90f.html" title="WP:RFC/N">WP:RFC/N</a>. He now put up this: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Macedonia&amp;oldid=113423690" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Macedonia&amp;oldid=113423690" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>. Note again his political jibe at <i>"Greek fabricators who continue to spread anti-Macedonian and facist propaganda"</i>, and his wording about the RFC/N <i>"keeping the name of my userpage MACEDONIA"</i> - that seems to show that the userpage, rather than anything else he does on Wikipedia, is really the only thing he cares about.</p>
<p>Unless there are objections here, I'll delete that page again, and I'm considering a block warning and/or page protection if he tries this once more. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 09:38, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I disagree. The present contents are a personal attack at the least (the thing about the "Greek fabricators" and their "fascist propaganda" is directed at fellow Wikipedians, not some abstract Greek opponents elsewhere). And enforcing <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSER_5ae6.html" title="WP:USER">WP:USER</a> isn't censorship. We've deleted pages and (I think) even blocked users for doing much more harmless things with their pages - various cases of kids using theirs as a chatroom come to mind. This user's pages, for well over a year now, have <i>always</i> been breaches of the no-soapboxing rules of WP:USER. And he's been playing cat-and-mouse with the community over it during all this time - always seemingly acquiescing to enforced removals of offensive content whenever people had lost their patience with him, and then sneakily letting the page grow again with new rants. As I told him last time, I'm sick and tired arguing with him just how much political content is acceptable, when I know he's going to dodge it in a week again. That's why I thought we should set him an easy-to-remember and unambiguous limit this time: zero political content. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 13:56, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can see your point. I don't tend to be politically correct and I have a rather lenient attitude towards users who express their animosity towards a specific entity as long as they don't start making personal attacks or other kind of disruptive behavior. However, I checked the deleted versions of his user page and it does seem like this user's been using his userpage as a provocative soapbox only. I have a long experience of warmongering users from the Balkans and a firm response is often the best remedy. So yeah, go ahead and give him a last warning.--<strong><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_60c3.html" title="User:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">Hús</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_Esperanza_ea94.html" title="User:Husond/Esperanza"><font color="green">ö</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User_talk%7EHusond_a306.html" title="User talk:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">nd</font></a></strong> 14:24, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've just fully protected this - the article had at least 5 users edit warring (all within the last hour) and try as I did to begin to warn them; it seemed more just kept jumping in. So, I've sent them all to the talk page (discussions on <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/The_Wrong_Version" class="extiw" title="m:The_Wrong_Version">m:The Wrong Version</a> have already started). Thoughts? <b><a href="../../../g/l/e/User_talk%7EGlen_S_ecf5.html" title="User talk:Glen S">Glen</a></b> 10:20, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>My thoughts are that it should be a sub-stub. It's a <i>news release</i> rather than an article to talk about this controversy, as it's still underway. I hate it when people try to write an "article" on something that has just begun to happen. When they do, they become a secondary source -- journalists -- instead of a tertiary source -- encyclopedists. If a person is <i>reporting,</i> then she or he is not writing an encyclopedia article. This is in addition to the fact that "the controversy" can't be written about until it has a defined shape, with cause, event, and effect. The "effect" bit is still nebulous. Wikipedia is not CNN (or the Drudge Report or Skippy the Bush Kangaroo). <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:04, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I tend to agree with <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">User:Geogre</a>. I've been editing fairly heavily on the article mostly in an effort to keep the thing half-way decent and inline with policy. I tried to hold off on editing it but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Essjay_controversy&amp;diff=112721941&amp;oldid=112720939" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Essjay_controversy&amp;diff=112721941&amp;oldid=112720939" rel="nofollow">found</a> that it was glaringly out of step in terms of policy and since my first edits I've made efforts to combat that. <i>(<a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetscott_c779.html" title="User talk:Netscott"><span title="Leave me a message.">→</span></a><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott"><span style="background: white; color: grey" title="Go to my userpage.">Netscott</span></a>)</i> 13:11, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>As usual I agree with The Geogre. In a year or so we may have a clear idea of the historical import of this, if there is any, but right now we really don't. A stub with a link to Wikinews (which <i>is</i> for news, unlike Wikipedia which is not) would be fine. How can we record what the considered view of the world is, when the world has barely begun to consider the thing? All we get is a series of gut reactions, and often very poorly informed ones at that. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 17:48, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>This article represents a unfortunate <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catch_22.html" title="Catch 22">Catch 22</a> situation. Having an article is overfocusing on current news, self-referential and seems to overtrumpet the importannce of Wikipedia. But deleting the article (or most of its content) looks like a cover-up and gives some the impression that we wish to hide the controversy that surrounded Essjay's retirement to save embarassment. Hopefully once the dust has settled we'll be in a better position to decide how an encyclopedia should cover this controversy if at all... <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WjB</b></a><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe"><i>scribe</i></a></span> 17:59, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I disagree with Geogre. Or, rather, our current practice strongly disagrees with Geogre, so strongly that what I think isn't that relevant. Look at the <a href="../../../index.html" title="Main Page">Main Page</a>, the page most users see as representing the Wikipedia. See the <b>In the news</b> section? It's rather prominent. Everything on it is "something that has just begun to happen", or was when it was added. The only difference is that they aren't embarassments to us.

<li>Um ... I don't think that we have had much success in covering this situation up. In fact, I think it has long since taken on a completely disproportionate importance. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 18:20, 8 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Could it partially be a reaction to how people are treating it in comparison to other similarly-referenced events, though? Certainly, the community's closeness to the subject lends extra detail, but when people keep reacting that we don't need this article, or that it should disappear, when there's no significant reason beyond the IDONTLIKEIT situation, it's merely asking for more detail and more attention, is it not? --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 18:24, 8 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>How disproportionate it is not clear. We're the <a href="http://alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=Wikipedia.org" class="external text" title="http://alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=Wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">#11 web site in the world</a>, and we had a scandal with one of our most highly trusted users: <a href="../../../b/u/r/Wikipedia%7EBureaucrats_5503.html" title="Wikipedia:Bureaucrats">Bureaucrat</a> (22 of them), <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_Committee_a514.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee">Arbitrator</a> (15 of them), and <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/CheckUser_Policy" class="extiw" title="m:CheckUser_Policy">CheckUser</a> (13 of them), all at once. Is it really that disproportionate? The #13 web site is Microsoft.com, the #14 is EBay - if one of their top dozen people was forced to resign under a scandal, do you think it would substantially less coverage? In any case, the point of I'm saying is that the proposal to "sub-stub" the article is clearly wrong. Even if the coverage the media gave it is disproportionate, and that is not clear, they did give it substantial coverage, and it is not up to us to second-guess them. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 18:44, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Anyone who cares</b> about the reliability and trustworthiness of WP would want to see the details of this particular dispute, for it bears upon the credibility of everything we have been doing. It is not a minor incident in the development of WP--it is by now universally known to anyone who knows about WP at all, and there is no point trying to pretend otherwise.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Within WP, Essjay is (was) a public figure. When he chose to give interviews to a reporter for an internationally known magazine he became a public figure in the most direct way.</dd>
<dd>Why we would conceal the details--obviously, because we are ashamed of them. And well we should be; but the only way to restore our reputation is to admit the details of our failings. Consider other cases of attempts to hide information that ought to be public--first of all, within the last six years--and more generally. Those associated with Enron or its accountants have good reason to wish the details private, but everyone else as even better reason to keep them public. some political figures are aware of how they will look to history, and thus have good reason to keep their documents from public view. I doubt they will get away with it. Nixon too tried to conceal the documentation.</dd>
<dd>We are not quite as important as those people in a world-wide sense--but within our own part of the world we are. I try to persuade other librarians to use WP--it will now be much more difficult. I try to persuade faculty whom I know to contribute--it will now be very much harder--they now have good reason to prefer one of he competitive projects.</dd>

<dd>Here's my take. The IPs belong to the T-Mobile Croatia network. Both Tar-Elenion and AfrikaPaprika edited Croatia-related articles. It's not at all out of the question (disregarding edits for the moment) that they are two independent editors both from Croatia using the same ISP editing articles about their home country. However, it's entirely possible that they are not. So, Pax, if you can properly apply the duck test and <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Bbatsell_1cb2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Bbatsell">e-mail me</a> the proof that you have that these two editors are one and the same, and I will block if I find it sufficient (and will forward the information to all administrators or editors in good standing requesting it (<a href="../../../b/e/a/WP%7EBEANS_2a59.html" title="WP:BEANS">WP:BEANS</a> and all that jazz)).

If I e-mail you all proofs in one package and you block Tar, I fear the same reaction and regardless of the fact that I'm pretty much convinced that Tar-Elenion <b>is</b> Afrika paprika himself (who sent Jesus Christ to f**k my mother and vandalized my user page for 18 times adding insulting homosexual crimes including a war criminal), I <i>still</i> think that it would be somewhat <i>unjust</i>. --<a href="../../../p/a/x/User%7EPaxEquilibrium_609b.html" title="User:PaxEquilibrium">PaxEquilibrium</a> 21:36, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well that would explain it, thing is I am not this AfrikaPaprika. Checkuser confirmed so. I am asking you <b>what "proof" do you have I am this person</b>? Besides blatant accusations and your supposed <i>conviction</i> (suspcion really) of me being this person, what else is there? Are similarities in IP's and interest in the <i>same field</i> (rather wide field of interest - Croatia-related articles) enough? Especially when you are accusing the wrong person.

<dd>Yes, that is quite interesting, isn't it? At the same moment when Pax is making the accusation at <a href="../../../t/a/r/User_talk%7ETariqabjotu_9a9a.html" title="User talk:Tariqabjotu">User talk:Tariqabjotu</a> this person "GreaterCroatia" comes and refers to me as this "AfrikaPaprika". I find this to be too great coincedance and that "GreaterCroatia" is in fact Pax sockpuppet, you know so that he can have an alibi and say "aha, see someone referred to him as AfrikaPaprika". I can think of no other reason.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also another interesting bit I found after quick search on <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">Google</a> is that Pax also accused <a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKubura_32cd.html" title="User:Kubura">Kubura</a> (<a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_checkuser_Case_Kubura_6a49.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Kubura">Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Kubura</a>) being a sockpuppet of this "AfrikaPaprika" on the same ground as he is accusing me here as well - Kubura is also a member from Croatia and also often edits Croatia-related articles.

<p>I found an OTRS complaint form the author of a Rush tribute book, stating that the tour dates listed in some articles on Rush tours were a copyright violation and impeded his ability to sell an updated version.</p>
<p>Although I am not really convinced that you can copyright a list of dates which is available on the back of every tour shirt sold, about half the articles had no content other than a fair use image of an album cover (copyvio; can only be used in the article on the <i>album</i>) and an infobox; those that had dates lists were unformatted and unreferenced, in short there did not seem to be anythign there actually worth having. I removed them from {{<a href="../../../r/u/s/Template%7ERush_9c9a.html" title="Template:Rush">Rush</a>}}.

<dd>Vaguely rings a bell somewhere about disputes around one (or more) of these lists (not copyvio) but I could be mistaken. Not sure about the copyrighting of lists as generally you can't copyright factual information, though things like telephone directories do claim copyright. It would seem unlikely the author of a tribute book might have ownership of such copyright anyway. From your description though, sounds like they were adding little encyclopedic value and probably fail <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not an indiscriminate collection of information</a> --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 22:43, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One can copyright the specific layout of a given set of factual information, so long as the layout has some artistic or creative function beyond simply dumping the information, but not the information itself. (That's why you often see more than one phone directory in an area, just with different titles and designs.) Therefore, a scanned image of the book cover or page would be a copyvio, but simply putting the same information here as there is not. Still, seems to fail <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, as stated above.

<dd>User calls me by a derogatory version of my name real name Alexander — <i>Sashok</i> from the Russian nickname Sasha. Now although it is disputable that Sashok is actually an insult and there are cases when it cannot be e.g. a grandfather calling his grandson. However when a rival person, and in wikipedia we do assume that we are equal in age...at least formally, calling another person with that name, who is not a close friend <b>is</b> insulting and I find it so, and in the context that he is using it (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Soviet_partisans&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=113681982" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Soviet_partisans&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=113681982" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ukrained&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109041731" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ukrained&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109041731" rel="nofollow">[40]</a>). Furthermore this is not the first time he has done so.

<p>Now, I must say that I am on the record opposing the blocks for mere PA, especially an occasional one. But blocks for <i>disruption</i> is something else and sometimes habitual trolling becomes a disruption. I don't care whether the fellows get blocked, actually. But I am providing my own observations since I was asked. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 00:49, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A little something to add. I would not support any sort of a lengthy block of a user Ukrained. Whatever problems that he has with me, I am very thick-skinned and usually ignore his whining, something that <a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKuban_kazak_c2e3.html" title="User:Kuban kazak">Kuban kazak</a> chose not to ignore (a position to which he is also entitled.) I must say that Ukrained's article edits are usually more reasonable than his talk page entries which are mostly either offensive or horrific. If there is any way to relay to him a message that he should stop the disruption (prior warnings did not work) that may be a better idea than a long block. As for AlexPU, I do not care a least bit. Most of his recent activity is pure trolling. Anyway, I thought I should mention it. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 01:15, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is a well-written, well considered explanation of the problem. I've had smaller run ins with AlexPU who is totally incivil, and more importantly disruptive. He constantly engages in tendentious editing at articles related to Ukraine, constantly pushes a Ukrainian nationalist POV and calls everyone who disagrees with him "anti-Ukrainian or "Soviet". When he got into an argument with me over his POV pushing, he accused me of being a part of an Irpen-led anti-Ukrainian cabal, admitted that he and a few of his pals were Ukrainian nationalists, called Irpen a "Traitor", and basically told me that if I didn't take sides against Irpen that I would become his (AlexPU's) enemy. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:TheQuandry&amp;diff=111155697&amp;oldid=111149908" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:TheQuandry&amp;diff=111155697&amp;oldid=111149908" rel="nofollow">[45]</a>. He refuses to acknowledge consensus refuses to discuss his edits and instead engages in stubborn revert wars. This is not in keeping with the spirit of Wikipedia, and in the interests of all, I thoroughly support an indefinite block, of AlexPU (who was already blocked for making the ridiculous personal attack on my talk). <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheQuandry_2564.html" title="User:TheQuandry">TheQuandry</a> 02:03, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've blocked Ukrained for 24 hours and AlexPU for 2 weeks. He has just come off of a one-week block and has resumed making personal attacks almost immediately. Given his long history of making them, I think this block's length is appropriate.

<p>Hey there,</p>
<p>I require an administrator for explaining correctly to the american <a href="../../../r/9/t/User%7ER9tgokunks_6dd1.html" title="User:R9tgokunks">User:R9tgokunks</a> that Alsace is RIGHTFULLY a part of France nowadays...

<p>I have had conflicts with this user for quite some time now, and lately I have been very patient with his non-stop personal attacks, but I have had enough. The most recent violation -- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Middle_East_Media_Research_Institute&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=113422289" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Middle_East_Media_Research_Institute&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=113422289" rel="nofollow">him calling me an "ass"</a> -- was only the last straw in a series of abusive comments and actions. On the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Hitchens_80b0.html" title="Christopher Hitchens">Christopher Hitchens</a> page, the user <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christopher_Hitchens&amp;diff=113212818&amp;oldid=113180921" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christopher_Hitchens&amp;diff=113212818&amp;oldid=113180921" rel="nofollow">removed extremely well-sourced and relevant commentary</a> with the demand that my references must be online rather than from print sources. I found this absurd and anti-intellectual, and I posted a note to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Attribution#Use_of_printed_material_rather_than_online_sources" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Attribution#Use_of_printed_material_rather_than_online_sources" rel="nofollow">the WP:RS talk page</a>] to that effect. There was unanimous agreement that such a demand was absurd. On the Hitchens talk page, Armon explained that my sources must be online because I had been "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Christopher_Hitchens&amp;diff=113214328&amp;oldid=113169533" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Christopher_Hitchens&amp;diff=113214328&amp;oldid=113169533" rel="nofollow">caught misrepresenting offline sources</a>," a charge I found absurd and in violation of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> as well as <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>. His "evidence" for the charge was an unexplained link to a discussion from weeks ago. When challenged on this point he simply <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Christopher_Hitchens&amp;diff=113228961&amp;oldid=113218299" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Christopher_Hitchens&amp;diff=113228961&amp;oldid=113218299" rel="nofollow">stated</a> that the evidence was on the page and reasserted his demand that I provide online sources. This seems to me an absurd form of <a href="../../../d/e/_/WP%7EDE_3fff.html" title="WP:DE">WP:DE</a> -- excluding sources because they are in print is ridiculous. Even if he was correct that they needed to be "fact-checked," the claim that offline sources cannot be fact-checked is ridiculous. I'm sure Armon (or anyone else) can get ahold of a library card if they think it is necessary to check if I am making up quotes. After <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Commodore_Sloat#Misrepresenting_Sources" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Commodore_Sloat#Misrepresenting_Sources" rel="nofollow">discussion on my talk page</a> -- with Armon continually accusing me in more and more hysterical terms of lying and deception -- it became clear that the so-called "lie" was a misunderstanding and a difference of opinion rather than a lie, and it also became clear that the so-called "lie" was about a tangential argument on a talk page rather than about something put into an article. I asked him to stop calling me names and I asked him to apologize for his violations of NPA and AGF; instead he continued to accuse me and then he called me an ass.</p>
<p>This is really just the tip of the iceberg. I have tried to be very patient with this user even while he has been goading me to overreact. But I have had enough of this. Actions like this are totally disruptive -- if he has real problems with an edit I make, that is fine to bring to discussion, but to raise a complete canard as a justification for deleting evidence that everyone agrees comes from a reliable source, and then to make the demand that all sources be available online, while calling me names and taunting me the whole time, is disruptive and deleterious to the project of Wikipedia.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">Commodore Sloat</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/m/User_talk%7ECommodore_Sloat_e4e8.html" title="User talk:Commodore Sloat">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Commodore_Sloat_a22a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Commodore Sloat">contribs</a>).</small></p>

While I am a colleague of csloat's and so I have my biases, I'm hopeful that all these folks can <i>focus on the issue at hand, rather than create reasons not to be civil</i>. Upon a cursory review, my view of the recent 'hot activity' between Isarig, Armon, csloat, etc. seems to be an ongoing pattern with numerous editors tag-teaming to oppose csloat on political articles where he makes his edits.</dd>
<dd>To me, it appears a number of the editors opposing sloat believe that <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> is not required - and they are in fact using bad faith to 'goad' csloat. To me, a lack of willingness to conduct oneself with self-respect is the cause of the conflict, not an argument over this edit or that edit. Csloat's edits are substantial and verifiable, in as far as I was able to determine. His conduct is at times unhelpful, but most editors who find themselves in situations like this 'slip up' and take the 'hostility bait' from time to time. That's why csloat, in response, can't risk being uncivil at all - if he takes the bait, he's only validating their attempt and nullifying any factual high ground he may occupy. Tough to stay on the 'high road' under attacks like that - in any case I hope Armon, Isarig and csloat get past this issue, provide a modicum of good faith and work to deal with article space issues constructively. -- <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanFreisling_b27b.html" title="User:RyanFreisling">User:RyanFreisling</a> <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanFreisling_aab0.html" title="User talk:RyanFreisling">@</a> 01:05, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Fortunately this time I found out about this report, so in this case, unlike others, I will be able to respond. There are two issues, one, saying "stop being an ass" is not the same as calling someone an ass -a semantic but important difference. He was attempting to twist my words into an insult on another editor, which is perfectly clear if anyone reads the post I responded to. Isarig's point that this is a case of <a href="../../../p/o/t/WP%7EPOT_65da.html" title="WP:POT">WP:POT</a>, is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Commodore_Sloat#.22Elizmr_you_are_well_aware_of_this.3B_it_is_not_helpful_to_play_dumb_about_any_of_this.22" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Commodore_Sloat#.22Elizmr_you_are_well_aware_of_this.3B_it_is_not_helpful_to_play_dumb_about_any_of_this.22" rel="nofollow">well put</a>.<br />
Secondly sloat recently received a block for a BLP violation against Hitchens on a talk page. This was subsequently overturned by another admin as having been too long ago, but there was no argument that it was in fact a BLP vio. He had also had inserted poorly sourced blogged insults about his drinking into the Hitchens article. When this was removed he repeatedly reinserted it until he came up with a new version which pov-pushed his assertion that Hitchens is an alcoholic. Aside from the fact that this version was <i>still</i> not compliant with BLP, there was also the problem of his use of offline cites to make his case. Normally offline cites are fine, but when they're used to pov-push by an editor who has just violated BLP, and who has misrepresented cites in the past, then I think it's reasonable to demand that everyone be able to assess them. I doubt some of the periodicals he cited are available in New Zealand, and as he cited google hits as evidence of the notability of the topic, there should be no problem finding online RS sources -in fact I submitted one myself. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmon_3172.html" title="User:Armon">&lt;&lt;-armon-&gt;&gt;</a> 02:19, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>On #1, I did feel it was a reasonable claim that Elizmr was pretending not to understand something obvious. It;s not relevant to Armon's objectionable behavior. I was also not twisting his words in any way - the other editor I named was one who made the claim that Armon said was only made by "partisan detractors." So my question was quite reasonable and certainly didn't merit being called an ass.
<dl>
<dd>as always, when <i>you</i> do it , it is a "reasonable claim". when others do it to you, it suddenly becomes a violation <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>, <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, and <a href="../../../d/e/_/WP%7EDE_3fff.html" title="WP:DE">WP:DE</a>.

<dd>On #2, Armon is misrepresenting the issue -- the block was overturned in part because there was no clear BLP issue. Armon's well aware of that. There is even less of an issue now that we know that Hitchens himself (the BLP in question) acknowledged the term that I used ("alcoholic"). In any case, I have agreed not to call him that myself again. But none of that is relevant to Armon's behavior described above. His claim that I am still violating BLP on the page is absurd and unsupported. 3 - Armon keeps saying that it is reasonable to demand that everyone be able to assess offline citations -- they can. I provided full citations and Armon is welcome to get a library card. If he can't find them in New Zealand, interlibrary loan is an option. Or he can just ask me to send him copies of the articles. But none of that is the issue here - the issue is his disruptive editing and his personal attacks against me and his refusal to assume good faith. Claiming that I must be making up what is written in an article if it isn't online is a gross violation of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 02:56, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>This, OTOH, is an outright misrepresentation, The block was not overturned at all - it was shortened, by a lenient adming who was misled by you into believing this was your first block and that you were not warned first. Other editors who commented on the issue found it problematic that it was administered 2 weeks after the offence - but everyone agreed that it was an egregious BLP violation when made. <a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsarig_bbf7.html" title="User:Isarig">Isarig</a> 03:22, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, that last response from sloat looks like an admission of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. He inserted an undue amount of cites claiming alcoholism into the Hitchens article in order to make the point that it OK for him to rant on about how big a drunk the guy is. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmon_3172.html" title="User:Armon">&lt;&lt;-armon-&gt;&gt;</a> 03:33, 8 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Isarig: you are wrong about why the block was overturned, and you can read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Neil#Sloat" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Neil#Sloat" rel="nofollow">the discussion between admins</a> about it yourself if you are interested. The admins can defend their own actions, but one of them points out that "it was semantics in an off the cuff talk page comment, rather than an outright slur." We now know that it wasn't even a slur since it is embraced by Hitchens himself. So no, everyone did not agree "that it was an egregious BLP violation when made" -- in fact, when it was made, not a single soul commented on it. Armon: that is a bizarre argument. I did not try to make any point about it being ok for me to rant on anything. I went and did some further research on a point that was already in the article that Isarig was removing, citing BLP violations that I thought were bogus. The fact that said research vindicated a particular choice of words is really beside the point. I have never "ranted on about how big a drunk the guy is" -- I have only made reference to his own statements that he drinks about a fifth of hard liquor a day. Anyway, this report is about Armon's behavior, not about Hitchens or about BLP, so most of this conversation is somewhat of a side show. <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 05:57, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If you examine Sloat's contribution history, you will see that he has habitually and unapologetically violated <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>. His discussion style is to be dismissive of points raised by those he disagrees with rather than to entertain them and reply in a reasonable way in an effort to come to a neutral consensus. He tends to use disparaging language when discussing the contributions of others. This style tends to cause escalation of disagreements and weakens the Wikipedia community. Sloat needs to clean up his own act before accusing others. His complaints against Armon are frivilous. <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EElizmr_0824.html" title="User:Elizmr">Elizmr</a> 13:47, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

But that is not the issue here - the issue is Armon's hounding of me based on the incorrect claim that I am lying -- a clear violation of WP:AGF and WP:NPA. What is more, these personal attacks have led to <a href="../../../d/e/_/WP%7EDE_3fff.html" title="WP:DE">disruptive editing</a>, as with Armon deleting well sourced material simply because it is not online. <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 19:47, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Respectfully, that is probably the first time you have ever apologized. There is a prayer to be said the first time something happens and I'm saying it right now for you, Sloat. And I appreciate the apology. However, I could produce many examples of your refusals to apologize, dissmissals, personal attacks, uncivil behavior, etc. Saying you are just reacting to provacation is a refusal to take responsibility for your own actions. As far as your complaints against Armon, I do not think they are accurate. You guys are having a content dispute. If you would just chill out, stop attacking, stop reacting, stop dismissing, listen to what others are saying, discuss, and come to consensus no one would have a problem with you. This is the way to diffuse the situation rather than bringing these kind of frivioulous complaints to this notice board. <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EElizmr_0824.html" title="User:Elizmr">Elizmr</a> 03:40, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>No it is not the first time I have apologized, Elizmr. You know that for a fact. I have apologized every time I have felt I crossed a line. The problem is that you want me to apologize every time I disagree with you, and I won't. Now, again, the issue here is Armon's disruptive editing and personal attacks, not the question of how often I apologize, and not some content dispute. It is about Armon removing sourced and relevant information purely because it is from the print media, and then claiming that I am a liar and an ass. <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 06:03, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The main point of contention here is whether ApocalypticDestroyer's block was merely an indefinite block or an actual community ban. As noted in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:ApocalypticDestroyer%27s" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:ApocalypticDestroyer%27s" rel="nofollow">the block log</a>, the block is labeled a ban. However, there is evidence that a full-fledged discussion to implement a community ban, mandated by <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAN_eb66.html" title="WP:BAN">WP:BAN</a> in the cases of community bans, never took place. I believe that we should clear up this ambiguous situation once and for all. --<sup><a href="../../../p/h/y/User_talk%7EPhysicq210_4b59.html" title="User talk:Physicq210"><font color="#000000">210</font></a></sup><b><a href="../../../p/h/y/User%7EPhysicq210_ccba.html" title="User:Physicq210"><font color="#0000C0" face="Comic Sans MS">physicq</font></a></b> (<i><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Physicq210_25e9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Physicq210"><font color="#0000C0">c</font></a></i>) 06:07, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think both LionheartX and Certified.Gangsta is reading too much into the language here. As I see it:
<ol>
<li>LionheartX's actions with prior accounts justify ban, but:</li>
<li>The situation isn't so bad that he shouldn't get another chance.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>In other words, unless there is consensus otherwise (although I asked Dmcdevit for his input) I'm inclined to, as I said, give LionheartX one last chance. Any further disruptive behavior on his part (and massive spamming of admins' talk pages, which he did just now, is <i>very</i> close to being disruptive) will be the last straw. I indefinitely blocked the <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolverOcelotX_fe1a.html" title="User:RevolverOcelotX">RevolverOcelotX</a> (<a href="../../../r/e/v/User_talk%7ERevolverOcelotX_7808.html" title="User talk:RevolverOcelotX">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RevolverOcelotX_518b.html" title="Special:Contributions/RevolverOcelotX">contribs</a>) account, as it is no longer needed (and the fact that it is no longer needed was used by LionheartX as a reason in arguing that he was not sockpuppeting). <i>Any</i> further justified complaints about LionheartX's behavior, including spamming, edit warring, sock puppeting, &amp;c., should draw an indefinite block on the account and a lengthy block on the underlying IP.

<dd>"<i>I'm looking through Tiger's edit contribution for gross abuse, and I'm not seeing it. He's accused at least one admin of not being neutral, which is certainly uncivil of him but I think the Giano case established that it isn't a hanging offence. He's accused Isberg (talk · contribs · logs · block user · block log) of being a sock which is uncivil, even if he's right. (He isn't, is he? If he is, I owe him an apology.). He's accused Certified.Gangsta (talk · contribs · logs · block user · block log) of harassing him and campaigning to have him banned, which is also accurate, and as far as I can see, he's done this complaining in relatively polite terms. He's used a lot of accounts over time, but no one (other than Certified Gangsta, formerly known User:Bonafide hustler) is claiming that he has been using them in parallel. So he may or may not be abusive, but he isn't a sock master. (What sort of self respecting sock puppetier loses the passwords?) I wouldn't be surprised if there's some 3RR violations and POV waring but most of his edits look reasonable, lots of wikilinking and some minor edits. Nothing that wikipedia will colapse for the lack of, but nice to have. I haven't checked every edit, especially from the long dead accounts. No doubt I've missed stuff. Just to set my mind at rest, will someone post some diffs to this gross abuse and harrasment and I will promptly and publically apologise for making this request. Sorry everyone for being difficult.

<dd>As we can all see, BenAveling clearly "<i>gave him a reason not to</i>" in that specific AN/I thread right after Dmcdevit posted that. Also note that the <a href="../../../b/p/_/WP%7EBP_c8aa.html#Bans" title="WP:BP">official policy</a> clearly states "<i>Community bans must be supported by a strong consensus and should never be enacted based on agreement between a handful of admins or users.</i>". There is clearly no strong consensus for a ban. In the other two AN/I threads above, <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">User:Shimeru</a> also objected to ban and I respectfully accept the conditions he put forth.

<dd>We are really making a poor example out of this. I am very afraid that future sockpuppets will refer to this case as a way out. As for indef. block vs. ban, it is all semantics. He evade block/ban too many times. He crossed the line, thus a block is necessary. Anyway, I kind of regret I brought up this issue cuz it seems like people are forgiving Lion because they have problems with me.

<p>Schmetterling has been edit warring at <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carla_Martin_4130.html" title="Carla Martin">Carla Martin</a> for a few weeks now. This user was blocked for violating 3RR...came back and immediately violated it again. I have evidence via email that Schmetterling is Carla Martin herself. The emails are sent from "Candy Martino", a very obvious cover name. How do I handle this? I'm an admin but this isn't something I've handled before. The email from "Candy" stated "What is my recourse-short of filing a lawsuit?". Since this lady is a lawyer, this is a real possibility. She has violated <a href="../../../n/l/t/WP%7ENLT_0807.html" title="WP:NLT">WP:NLT</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> for certain. At the moment, she is serving a 48H block for the 3RR. How do I handle this? Do I make it an indefinite block? Do I contact Jimbo? I'm hesistant to publish the email on the site because I'm against that for the most part.

<p>Since the block, he's continued to be disruptive. He keeps taunting Ockenbock (a blocked user who continues to come back to troll my user talk page). But now, recently, there's some crazy things he's saying that really scary and annoying for me: see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Metros232&amp;diff=113481840&amp;oldid=113435954" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Metros232&amp;diff=113481840&amp;oldid=113435954" rel="nofollow">this</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Metros232&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=113484090" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Metros232&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=113484090" rel="nofollow">this</a>. He's threatening to stalk me, basically, and that scares me. See also <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Hybrid_f91f.html#Thanks" title="User talk:The Hybrid">this thread</a> at The Hybrid's talk page where he explains his stalking and such.</p>
<p>And there's also just odd actions like <a href="../../../b/l/i/User_talk%7EBlindman_shady_1594.html#New_Messages" title="User talk:Blindman shady">this conversation</a> and this related <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Blindman_shady/joke&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=113583323" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Blindman_shady/joke&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=113583323" rel="nofollow">diff</a>. He's trying to run some wrestling fanboy thing on here and thinks he can control all the other fanboy actions on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Can another admin please look at this? I think I'm too involved to make a proper ruling on this, but something <b>needs</b> to be done. Thanks, <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 01:19, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've figured it out, I think. Remember, we are dealing with a young teen here, probably around 13, and a wrestling fan. Now, I believe that he is trying to start a faction within Wikipedia under the banner of the nWo. The <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_World_Order_%28professional_wrestling%29_01b7.html" title="New World Order (professional wrestling)">new World order</a>, or nWo, was a professional wrestling faction within <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Championship_Wrestling_d0d3.html" title="World Championship Wrestling">World Championship Wrestling</a> that was incredibly large, and in the storyline they had a real chance of conquering WCW. I believe that he is trying to start an nWo on Wikipedia, with him as the leader. In the nWo, the leader was almost always a world champion, and he calls himself "The Real People's Champion." I believe that his goal is to gain control over a certain area of Wikipedia, and he views Metros232 as a threat to this goal. Metros, being an admin, has the power to squash his movement before it starts with his power to block people, though of course we know that it would take some serious stuff for him to start running around handing out indef ACB blocks to people.</p>
<p>When he first got here I explained to him how things work, and he asked me many questions about how to most efficiently damage Wikipedia. I suspected him of having ulterior motives, but he was being a vandal fighter, and he does seem rather young, so I assumed good faith and answered his questions assuming that he was simply being overzealous due to his curiosity like when a young boy learns about explosions in chemistry class.</p>
<p>However, it now appears that he is trying to start a movement in Wikipedia for whatever reason. I believe that his provocation of Ockenbock is an attempt to distract both me and Metros from what he is doing. I believe that he is making preparations to start his own Wikipedia nWo, and he wants both editors and vandals (nWo Wolfpac and nWo Hollywood) to join him. He wants to understand the motives of vandals, and I believe that his motive behind this is to get them to join him, which is why he has maintained a presence on Uncyclopedia after tracking down Ockenbock. Meanwhile, he is trying to recruit actual editors over here. What he thinks he will gain by starting a Wikipedia nWo is anyone's guess, but we are dealing with a rather young person here, so logic isn't necessarily a part of this.</p>
<p>This is my theory, but since I am leaving for vacation tomorrow I won't be here to see how this thing turns out. Either way, he is violating policies knowingly and unapologetically, so something needs to happen.

<p>Close but no cigar. First of all I am older than 13. And as far as conquoring wikipedia goes it was never my intention. My goal was to reagin control of PDL. On January 3rd PDL fell into the hands of someone who was trying to destroy it all together. They manages to get their hands on all 3 of our titles. All they would have had to done was get their hands on our contracts and PDL would be finished. We decided to stop this at any cost. On the 9th of January the New World Organization was born to counter this threat. From then on there were two factions within PDL those on the Pontiac League board and the New World Organization. On February 2nd I was able to recaputure the LC Championship due to the fact that since I held the PDL Championship for over a year in one reign I can exercise a title match clause anytime I want. In order to stop them from exercising their rematch clauses we decided to rename it the NWO Championship. Every PDL member has 2 rematch clauses in their contract. I had still retained my right to rename titles and with it the rematch clauses they had would be useless. You cannot challenge for what doesn't exist. Finally on March 1st I won the Pontiac Hardcore Championship unifying it with the NWO Championship. With that title I renamed it the PDL Traditional Championship so that I could reinstate it at a later date. The next day I was able to regain control of the PDL Championship when the current holder failed to defend the title when he was supposed to so I was able to vacate it even though I lost the authority to in January he violated contract and that allowed me to vacate the title. The very next day I rematched the current PDL faction for their contracts and the PDL title because the former champion still had his rematch clauses. In the end a PDL Member won it but immediately changed sides unexpectedaly. Not even I saw it coming. Apparently he made a deal with Exxod 6. With that I was able to terminate their membership and regain control of my duelist league. Wikipedia was a way to draw attention away from what we were planning. They were keeping a cloes eye on me and I came up with the ultimate way to distract them. And shortly before this all happened I met Nightmare 81 in person. I agreed to get Ockenbock's attention to distract them even further and so that Nightmare 81 could get his data. I would also be getting something very valuable out of all of this. He needed a vandal for his project. So I looked for one and found Ockenbock by accident. So I figured why not. I needed him because he would cause so much trouble on my end that they couldn't find out what we were really planning with the New World Organization. Mutual gain on my and Nightmare 81's. I attacked Ockenbock to gain his full attention and try to completely take it away completely from Metros232. It partially worked and he attacked me. But he still kept attacking Metros. Nightmare has been searching throught all of Ockenbocks sockpuppets and put an I.A. to watch Metros232's talk page. It is completely unable to do anything but watch. My re-taking over was successful and I shall relinquish my PDL authority soon. Everything on my end is done. Now we must wait on him. It should be interesting to look at what he found out. I know I can't wait to see. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Boss_0_5fda.html" title="User:Big Boss 0">Big Boss 0</a> 21:09, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Okkar has also made personal attacks on other editors accusing them of bias and favoring Burmese opposition pro-democracy groups. This is one on Hintha: ("Here we go, everytime the likes of you get caught redhanded, you scream personal attack, yet you expect to get away with the misdeed by trying to overcloud the issue at hand with personal attack claims. It is truely amazing to see this form of mentality in Wikipedia. Not only people cheat, lie and do all kinds of misdeeds, they have the audicity to claim to be victim. No wonder there are soo many sorry stories about Burmese refugees, this is just one fine example of the propaganda tactics of opposition groups - hit first then pretend to be victim .. amazing, truly amazing!!

<dd>Here is another comment made by Okkar: ("Finally, the common sense has prevailed and triumphed over destructive mindset of opposition groups and their minions who are using this project as a political propaganda tool. It is a victory over those who seek out to degrade our country by insisting to use the old colonial name of the country as the name of the project and the axe handles who colluded with foreigners with mob mentality to remove anyone who don’t support or share their politically biased views from this project by any means necessary, even if it means they have to cheat or lied.

<dd>In both quotes, Okkar is neither assuming good faith nor is he avoiding personal attacks on other editors. This kind of behavior and language is clearly counter to Wikipedia's standards. I've not witnessed any apology by Okar for this behavior. His pattern seems to be to cease temporarily this kind of behavior then start up again later. Based on this constant bad behavior, I raise the question of whether he should be banned from editing Wikipedia. <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonBillenness_a8f0.html" title="User:SimonBillenness">SimonBillenness</a> 21:29, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There are a few problems with that reasoning.</p>

<li>Coicoi, in Romanian, does not mean testicles.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> Coaie, in slang language, means testicles and some may say also coi.</li>

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">Calling Khoikhoi coicoi is perfectly understandable for a Romanian speaker since: 1. letter K is very rare in Romanian and 2. Romanian orthography is phonetic. Hence, the most immediate and spontaneous way of writing Khoikhoi in Romanian is coicoi. It’s but a spontaneous reaction of a Romanian person transliterating the name of Khoikhoi. Nothing more than that.

<p>This is true. If I wanted to write the name Khoikhoi in Romanian, it would be written as "coicoi."</p>

<dd>I don't know if it should have any bearing on the decision, and I don't ultimately claim that it should (that is a decision for admins to take). I will however point out that the "explanation" furnished above by Anittas is ridiculous. "Coi" means "a testicle", "coaie" means "testicles", pure and simple. In my view, as I have stated before, Dpotop used it on purpose, as a derogatory manipulation of Khoikhoi's user name. I also find the theory about k being uncommon in Romanian to be absurd - it is by no means that uncommon (if one is looking for it, one will find it easily), and Dpotop wrote the rest of his message in English, which has a lot of ks (he did not have trouble finding them, apparently). "Spontaneity" is out of the question (not to get tangled up in semantics, but "kh" never turns into "c" in Romanian, and I am yet to see a person that would find spelling with a c "easier" than spelling with a k in Romanian). That is what I have to say. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 19:15, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>In a quick read, I see your point. However cross cultural slurs/insults about alternate spellings &amp; pronunciations of usernames have come up before (can't begin to find diffs, but I definitely remember it happening) Sometimes its a misunderstanding, sometimes its not.

<dd>I met <a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">User:Blnguyen</a> on the DYK page and I recall her/him as an excellent contributor. I am afraid that now s/he really committed a big mistake in blocking <a href="../../../d/p/o/User%7EDpotop_3508.html" title="User:Dpotop">User:Dpotop</a> for that “Khoikhoi = coicoi” story. As a native Romanian speaker I can say that you need a huge portion imagination to construct a case out of this Romanian transliteration. Knowing <a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">User:Blnguyen</a> as a fair person, I think that all was but a misunderstanding. As I said, you cannot possibly accuse a Romanian person of bad faith or insulting intentions when transliterating “Khoikhoi” to “coicoi”, since it’s the most obvious and spontaneous way of writing down “Khoikhoi” in a phonetic way. Besides, “coi” – meaning testicle in Romanian – is by no means used as an insulting word. A Romanian called “coi” would be rather surprised than insulted. Moreover, “coi” is a particle of many Romanian words like “Ciocoi”, Băicoi”, “Coif”, “Coir”, so that there is no concern for Romanian speakers to avoid words containing “coi”. Besides, what Dahn argues reads like weird speculations aimed at harming Dpotop. I wonder where so much hate on Dpotop comes from.

<p>Well I'm not going to undue the block without hearing from <a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">User:Blnguyen</a>, since 48 hours is not excessive for a personal attack. In context, I can see the argument that this was not meant as it was interpreted. Although I would suggest that mispelling of usernames in arguments can often be seen as dismissive and my read of the diff is sort of like that. Sort of like someone saying about me "well Deena thinks so, so whatever". It's a bit rude, and the argument seemed to be a bit heated at the time. I have alerted <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">User:Khoikhoi</a> to the existence of this discussion, since his/her feelings about the alleged insult seem relevant. To be frank: I'm not going to unblock without discussion with the two admins involved, and it may be longer than 48 hours until they respond. My apologies if this is all a misunderstanding.

Do you seriously expect others to be able to translate Romanian, Bengali, Arabic and all other languages under the sun in order to check for personal attacks? <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama%27s_Arrow_544a.html" title="User:Rama's Arrow"><font color="green"><b>Rama's arrow</b></font></a> 01:12, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Without weighing in on the matter initially under discussion here, I <i>do</i> want to weigh in on "not supposed to use any other language": it is perfectly reasonable for users to communicate with one another in languages in which they are comfortable. There are quite a few users who routinely address me in either Romanian or Spanish, because it is easier for them and generally no problem for me. I think that's more than fine. On at least two occasions, the comments in question <i>have</i> been blatant (and obscene) personal attacks, and I've reported them as such. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 01:47, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No it is not reasonable exactly becoz of such a situation - the English Wikipedia is the most diverse of its kind. What will happen if editors here, from so many different countries just start using their local languages for their interactions? I would consider it a tremendous discourtesy to those who don't speak Indian languages if Indian editors began conducting dialogue and business in Indian languages. Everybody is free to participate and all dialogues are transparent and open here - this can't be enforced w/o a generally strict usage of English only. Who will be able to keep track of the personal attacks, incivility, etc. stuff going on? As an administrator, I find the prospect terribly challenging - I've already seen 3 cases of insulting comments/insinuations being made in Bengali, Hindi and Urdu. Were it not for my background or for the presence of some other admins who do know that particular language, who's to say which version of the translation would be accurate? Would an Australian admin be able to detect the slur? English is the thread that binds us here - all practical interaction must be conducted in English and very rarely (I regard the exchange of greetings, pleasantries to be ok) should other languages be used. It is not fair to other users and certainly difficult to enforce <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>. Right now the unity given by English allows a Vietnamese-Australian admin (Blnguyen) to block a Romanian editor for a personal attack. And I'm a terrestrial of martian origin (lol) lecturing on how on the English Wikipedia, only English should be used. While it is not reasonable to expect everyone to be anglophiles, this being the English Wikipedia must compell the Romanian editors in question to not use Romanian phrases in such public discussions, at the very least. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama%27s_Arrow_544a.html" title="User:Rama's Arrow"><font color="green"><b>Rama's arrow</b></font></a> 03:05, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The policy of assume good faith works hand in hand with common sense. It is ludicrous to argue that "Coicoi" was just a "Romanian transliteration" or a "different spelling". Names are names, and since Romanian uses the Latin alphabet, there is absolutely no need for changing names, <i>particularly</i> when you get words like "coi", which are insulting. If Dpotop genuinely wrote "Coicoi" because he wanted to use Romanian spelling, whatever that may mean, then he at least should've realised, upon reading what he wrote, that Coicoi is insulting, and removed it on that grounds. <a href="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/6/6d/European_flag.svg/20px-European_flag.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" /></a><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/7/73/Flag_of_Romania.svg/20px-Flag_of_Romania.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" /></a> <b><a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonline_b297.html" title="User:Ronline">Ronline</a></b> <a href="../../../r/o/n/User_talk%7ERonline_969f.html" title="User talk:Ronline">✉</a> 13:39, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Rama's essential point -- non-english should be avoided, at the very least, because it can certainly give the impression to someone that they were being talked about, or mocked. I've had that happen to me in real life as well, and it's unsettling, particularly when you can't be sure. But I am not certain that discouraging the use of foreign languages really applies here, as "KhoiKhoi" is not english and, apparently "coicoi" is not Romanian. It's necessary to trust native Romanian speakers as to whether or not this could be interpreted as a slur. Such things are usually subtle, in all languages. Some good faith seems necessary. I do think that in the case of a personal attack block, the case just generally be very clear cut. However, I expect the user in question, whether his intention was to insult or not, will be much more careful in the future and that can only be a good thing. <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDina_fad9.html" title="User:Dina">Dina</a> 13:11, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>It does appear, from <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a>'s diffs above, that three native Romanian speakers (including at least one who does not agree with the block) say that this is clearly a slur of some kind. However, no one seems to be saying that it's a really terrible, horrible insult. So I essentially endorse the block, however it should have been handled properly. The user should have been warned, and the block time should have much shorter. <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDina_fad9.html" title="User:Dina">Dina</a> 14:05, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I firmly persist that <b>“coicoi” is no insult</b>. At worst I view it as a quite <i>tasteless jest transliteration</i>. You don't block someone for 48 hours just for that. Nevertheless <a href="../../../d/p/o/User%7EDpotop_3508.html" title="User:Dpotop">User:Dpotop</a> did break the general courtesy norm of never altering names. (You never know what can happen: in France there is a name spelled “Zabé”, while “zabe” means cock.

Admittedly <a href="../../../d/p/o/User%7EDpotop_3508.html" title="User:Dpotop">User:Dpotop</a> was quite inconsiderate altering Khoikhoi into whatever else.

<li>Frankly, I belive that what I see now as a mild fault (but fault indeed, regardless of my intentions) from my part is only now becoming a huge insult to <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">User:Khoikhoi</a> through all the fuss initiated around it by <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">User:Dahn</a> in a discussion where he used this argument (and many more) in order to deviate the discussion from its subject (<a href="../../../r/o/m/Wikipedia_talk%7ERomanian_Wikipedians%27_notice_board_db03.html#What_d.27ya_all_think.3F" title="Wikipedia talk:Romanian Wikipedians' notice board">perceived vandalism</a> by <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">User:Khoikhoi</a>, who made controversial edits on ro.wikipedia, and then pretended they were not made by him). For this whole "testicle" propaganda I do apologize to User:Khokhoi, although it was never my intention, nor of my making.</li>
<li>Coming now to the actual blocking, I do feel it was unjust on both procedure and duration. First of all, it was not an obvious personal attack. The only person accusing me was <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">User:Dahn</a>, in the middle of a heated discussion where he was opposed by everyone else (including confirmed editors). Aside from a 2-line accusation in the middle of a huge technical discussion, there was no appeal to an administrator, and, most important, <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">User:Khoikhoi</a> did not formulate any complaint (while he was editing other articles and was informed of the discussion).</li>
<li>I can only presume that <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">User:Dahn</a> demanded my block through unpublic means (mail) to admin <a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">User:Blnguyen</a>. I can easily believe this, because <a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">User:Blnguyen</a> is also the administrator that <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_3RR_dc8f.html#User:Dahn_reported_by_User:Dpotop_.28Result:24_hrs_overturned_without_notice_page_protected.29" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/3RR">overturned</a> without any obvious cause or explanation the last 3RR block of <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">User:Dahn</a> after only 2 hours.</li>
<li>So frankly, I cannot help but feel here <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cartel.html" title="Cartel">cartel</a>-like editing and administration practices (between <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">User:Dahn</a>, <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">User:Khoikhoi</a>, and <a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">User:Blnguyen</a>, to be precise) where decision-making does not obey wikipedia rules (such as 3RR) and opponents are punished at sight with the harshest punishments available regardless of their arguments, and where the least critique or inquiry is diverted through <a href="../../../r/o/m/Wikipedia_talk%7ERomanian_Wikipedians%27_notice_board_db03.html#What_d.27ya_all_think.3F" title="Wikipedia talk:Romanian Wikipedians' notice board">long diatribes</a> on irrelevant subjects.</li>

<p>Thanks for what you're doing guys. This guy has been a major pain in the ass. Can admins see registered user's IP? I can make sure he never goes on wikipedia again, or go on the internet for that matter. Lets see him go on the internet with all his ports jammed shut. I appreciate what you're doing here. Damareinu obviously knows Nobleeagle personally and seems very much like one of those reject of evolution, you know, like dodos and homo ingrown-penis-apiens.</p>
<p>Anyway, loving sentiments aside. thanks for blocking him. Happy Editing 124.168.129.14 11:40, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Our anon <a href="../../../a/p/n/APNIC_b282.html" title="APNIC">APNIC</a> friend is back for more. Their latest tactic pertaining to DiNovo is to insert "Cheri DiNovo is a coke-whore" into <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drugs_and_prostitution.html" title="Drugs and prostitution">Drugs and prostitution</a>; they also recreated Talk:Cheri DiNovo/Comments again.</p>
<p>In a particularly astonishing bit of "what could possibly happen next?", however, they've also taken up a new target: <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jonah_Goldberg_7c7e.html" title="Jonah Goldberg">Jonah Goldberg</a>, where they've repeatedly and persistently inserted the unverifiable claim that Goldberg's biological father is <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lyndon_B._Johnson_d5db.html" title="Lyndon B. Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a>...and, naturally, the inevitable assertions on the talk page that any editor who reverts their changes is an "attack queer". The claim about Jonah's paternity was also inserted into <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucianne_Goldberg_5784.html" title="Lucianne Goldberg">Lucianne Goldberg</a>, from which it <i>wasn't</i> reverted — until <i>I</i> caught it just a few minutes ago, the claim had been left in the article for <i>four full days</i>. Clearly it needs a few people to add it to their watchlists ASAP.</p>
<p>I mention this because, as some of you may recall, the whole DiNovo thing began in <i>November</i> of last year. The fact that it's <i>still</i> going on four months later is <i>not</i> an encouraging sign that any of this foolishness is going to end anytime soon.</p>
<p>I'd also be intrigued to hear any ideas about what kind of person could <i>possibly</i> be simultaneously opposed to both Cheri DiNovo and Jonah Goldberg, since about all I can come up with is "ideologically confused". <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 08:26, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>If everyone disagrees with me, that's fine with me. But, should Ms. Schiff's birthday be included on her article or not? Per <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html#Privacy_of_birthdays" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP#Privacy of birthdays</a>, would she be considered "marginally notable" so as not to include her birthday? or is she notable enough to include it? I also object to others characterizing my edits as vandalism, but have greater concerns about getting this right on her article.

<dd>I find it disparaging to suggest that a Pulitzer Prize winner is only "marginally notable". If anything the article is under-developed.

I welcome a neutral 3rd-party to help settle any dispute between Anynobody and myself. I am sure that they will find that I am very easy to work with.

There is no need for more Admins to get involved, as your perceptions about the individuals currently involved are inaccurate.

<p>Sheesh. I'm not surprised nobody uninvolved has chosen to research this, when the warring parties make it sound so *difficult*. This admin and that admin, both unnamed, and mysterious hints of warring admins (not the case at all). The salient facts are that Justanother has requested deletion, 48 hours are well past, and the dispute resolution evidence offered by Smee is utterly inadequate, see discussion on my Talk, where I told Smee: "The links at "Evidence of trying and failing to resolve the dispute" are no good, to put it brutally. Posting warning templates on JA's page certainly doesn't qualify as attempted dispute resolution. (Didn't I tell you once that it was frowned on?)

<dd>(edit conflict) I'm not one to put up with incivility, but I see nothing in those comments that requires admin intervention.

<p>Back in 2002 I took some photographs of <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tara_Subkoff_1192.html" title="Tara Subkoff">Tara Subkoff</a>'s Imitation of Christ fashion show. One of the "vignettes" in the show was of models wearing a line of underwear vacuuming topless. Professional photographs can be seen on the highly-regarded <a href="http://www.style.com/fashionshows/collections/S2003RTW/review/IMTATION" class="external text" title="http://www.style.com/fashionshows/collections/S2003RTW/review/IMTATION" rel="nofollow">Vogue Magazine's Style.com</a> and <a href="http://www.artnet.com/Magazine/people/mbarone/barone9-25-02.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.artnet.com/Magazine/people/mbarone/barone9-25-02.asp" rel="nofollow">Artnet Magazine</a>. I put my photograph on the <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tara_Subkoff_1192.html" title="Tara Subkoff">Tara Subkoff</a> page (there is no Imitation of Christ page). <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris77xyz_87e5.html" title="User:Chris77xyz">Chris77xyz</a> has some kind of issue with breasts and initially tried to add a disclaimer that they don't represent Subkoff's designs (as the links above to mainstream publications show, they do) and then tried to take them off. He is now threatening legal action, called me a "scumb bag" and "perv" and is threatening edit wars. The photographs aren't obscene, unless breasts are obscene (British editors/admins take note). These are clear cut case of violation of <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_legal_threats_370c.html" title="Wikipedia:No legal threats">Wikipedia:No_legal_threats</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">Wikipedia:No_personal_attacks</a>.

<li>Thanks - and I understand your points. The issue had been resolved, mostly, by myself and several other editors. And resolved amicably. As the initial editor involved in challenging the photographs said, "I appreciate your willingness to compromise." Then another editor came in and said they were fine. A month later, Chris came in and wrote an unsourced, uncited statement that the photos don't represent Subkoff's designs (they do) and questioned the relevance of the section (I dare say she's received more reviews for her Imitation of Christ line than her acting). Chris did not add anything to the talk page after putting the relevance tag up, but pointed to a resolved discussion in which compromise was undertaken. This is why I auto-reverted: Unsourced statements, and putting a relevance tag pointing to a discussion that had resolved an issue, and one to which Chris did not contribute. I also realize a quick reading of the page does not make this readily apparent, but I don't think my behavior was all that bad, to be honest. Chris contributed nothing to the Talk page or my own User Talk page. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidShankBone_a3a2.html" title="User:DavidShankBone">DavidShankBone</a> 16:15, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This user is someone who has cyberstalked me on various sites around the web. Suspiciously, just after I talked about my experiences with the article on the South Park episode "Make Love, Not Warcraft" in my blog, he shows up there solely to post a personal attack, as shown at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Make_Love%2C_Not_Warcraft&amp;diff=113790042&amp;oldid=112769131" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Make_Love%2C_Not_Warcraft&amp;diff=113790042&amp;oldid=112769131" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Make_Love%2C_Not_Warcraft&amp;diff=113790042&amp;oldid=112769131</a>.</p>
<p>I understand one incident is far from enough to justify any kind of block, but I wanted to establish a "paper trail". I simply want this person to leave me alone. - 66.93.144.171 20:56, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

(which, incidentally, even if true STILL would not violate <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>, because even if there were a conflict of interest or something else that might well violate some other guideline, a single RFD is in no way disruptive) --<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERandom832_8f73.html" title="User talk:Random832">Random832</a> 22:54, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't doubt that your RFD nom was sincere - on the view that deleting that abbreviation would clarify the intent of the policy. You may even be right about just having 'WP:DISRUPT' leading to less mis-linking... but 'disruption' applies to alot more than just 'disrupting to make a point', so that wouldn't be clear either. Not surprising that abbreviations for shortcuts are less than fully descriptive. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 23:05, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm having an on-going problem with this user at <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berliner_FC_Dynamo_bd94.html" title="Berliner FC Dynamo">Berliner FC Dynamo</a> and from the looks of his talk page he's been causing other folks various forms of grief as well.</p>
<p>While he has made some useful additions to the page its been an on-going struggle to keep him from turning the article into some sort of fan-page and from applying a pro-East Germany / Dynamo-themed POV on much of what he edits despite requests/warnings from multiple users. My specific concerns include:</p>
<ul>
<li>repeated use and posting of un-sourced image files</li>
<li>repeated use of out-dated or incorrect material when it has been clearly shown that there are more current/accurate materials available</li>
<li>consistent failure to respond to messages on his talk page whether in English or his native German including immediate deletion or archiving of other editors remarks, blanking or editing of other editors talk pages, tagging other editors remarks with NPOV markers</li>
<li>consistent failure to annotate edits despite repeated requests to do so</li>
<li>creation of pages that duplicate existing pages in all respects except their titles</li>
<li>on-going edits to <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berliner_FC_Dynamo_bd94.html" title="Berliner FC Dynamo">Berliner FC Dynamo</a> which are not neutral in character and reflect a clear bias, including attempts to whitewash or santitize unsavory aspects of the clubs history, repeated addition of spam links to the page, deletion of material and image captions, deletion of citations, repeatedly restoring poorly translated materials after they have been properly edited</li>
<li>on-going edits to pages about <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marylin_Monroe_3cb5.html" title="Marylin Monroe">Marylin Monroe</a> containing incorrect or unsourced material including an on-going dispute over a Latin translation that 10 minutes spent on Google would clearly resolve in other editors favour</li>

<dd>MartinBot *should* be inactive right now. This behaviur is very strange and unexpected, but seems to stem from the fact that the bots use an older version of a python library, which has clearly become incompatible with Wikipedia's use of unicode. I'll take a look at fixing the problem tomorrow evening - there may be another library we can use to make the edits unicode compliant - failing that, I'll try to find out where the problem is being caused in the library as it is now.

<dd>As the IRC part of the bot is still online, make it indef until Tawker gets back (or a toolserver admin kills the processes). I've just made a small change to the code, which may fix the problems (but may not...), so I'll do a short, controlled trial on MartinBot - feel free to revert any edits by it, and I too will be watching them like a hawk.

<dd>The bug seems to be fixed now (on my copy), but Tawker won't have this just yet until he recives the email I'm about to send him, so suggest that TakwerBot remains blocked.

I think his comments at <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_Log_2007_March_6_28ad.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review/Log/2007 March 6">Wikipedia:Deletion review/Log/2007 March 6</a> constitute disruption, as well as gross incivility. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 22:31, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not aware of the background to this case, but his comments certainly seem incivil, and the whole DRV is arguably disruptive. I'd support a short block. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 22:55, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Needs to be someone else, I'm an involved party. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 23:04, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>And I'm a newbie admin, so would prefer another set of uninvolved eyes to have a look. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 23:10, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'd prefer not to see him blocked within a couple of hours after he has filed an arbitration case, unless it's unavoidable. I'd have no problem with a strong warning, though, and follow-up if he continues. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 00:13, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>That's fair Guy; I report another editor for (a) abusing policy, and (b) being uncivil in removing my comments from an AfD (which another administrator agreed), and although the other editor was cautioned under the same ArbCom case, absolutely nothing is done. And I should get a ban!</li>
<li>This is <i>exactly</i> why I have taken this to Arbitration,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration#Iantresman" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration#Iantresman" rel="nofollow">[96]</a>, and that should be the place to decide this issue, not because you think that the consensus disagrees with my views. --<a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIantresman_3a2c.html" title="User:Iantresman">Iantresman</a> 00:23, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
