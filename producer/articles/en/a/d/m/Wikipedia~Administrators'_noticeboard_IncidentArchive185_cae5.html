<dd>Read over the situation briefly. Nothing more than an edit dispute where the editors don't know how to communicate without threatening each other. Anyway, the problem, Fd0man, is twofold here: first, it's a <i>really bad idea</i> to template people you're in a dispute with. It just makes them madder. Second, you and Illuminato did all the stuff you accused him of doing: being curt, deleting warnings, templating each other, etc. But finally, you were correct; this thread was too long, and unfortunately, it was passed over by mos admins. If you have a specific complaint about a copyright, you will need to <i>specifically</i> show it here; otherwise, <a href="../../../m/_/_/WP%7EM_4ddf.html" title="WP:M">mediation</a> is the only way to go here. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatstuart_7fbf.html" title="User:Patstuart">Patstuart</a><sup><a href="../../../p/a/t/User_talk%7EPatstuart_e8fd.html" title="User talk:Patstuart">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Patstuart_a3f0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Patstuart">edits</a></sup> 12:54, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've looked at those pages before and I'll say that Nateland isn't the best editor out there. However, while he was a bit stubborn at the beginning, he has tried to discuss problems on the article talk pages, even when no one else seems to be interested in discussions. He also has had to put up with splitting articles where it's inappropriate (Adolescent sexuality in Britain, in India, and whatnot, each with its own three-paragraph articles). Some users have also used <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> when I wonder if <a href="../../../d/u/c/WP%7EDUCK_49d3.html" title="WP:DUCK">WP:DUCK</a> should be said instead. So everyone should just calm down here, and maybe walk away from the article for a few weeks. <a href="../../../x/i/n/User%7EXiner_4ce3.html" title="User:Xiner">Xiner</a> (<a href="../../../x/i/n/User_talk%7EXiner_ca85.html" title="User talk:Xiner">talk</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Xiner_41d9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Xiner">email</a>) 00:51, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well the reason I asked for a ban is because this type of behavior has continued for over a year, with numerous blocks, an RfC and the nabbing of his socks. I have also personally interacted with this guy and I've seen the pleas, warnings and requests for improvement of others and mine own fall on deaf ears repeatedly. About yet another warning, yet another good-faith opportunity - yeah sure, we can try. I was grossly disappointed in this fellow when I learnt of his sockpuppetry, as I had thought he had improved a bit. My thinking is that this fellow has exhausted the patience of his peers, failed Wikipedia's standards and refused to edit by its policies, for over a year. I hope that I never give away to vindictive instincts, but its clear that we are not an agency to change hearts and minds, and we really don't have any obligation to this guy left anymore - especially not after one year of trying. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama%27s_Arrow_544a.html" title="User:Rama's Arrow"><font color="orange"><b>Rama's arrow (3:16)</b></font></a> 15:39, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just wanted to say that becoming a sysop is *not a big deal*.</p>
<p>I think perhaps I'll go through semi-willy-nilly and make a bunch of people who have been around for awhile sysops. I want to dispel the aura of "authority" around the position. It's merely a technical matter that the powers given to sysops are not given out to everyone.</p>
<p>I don't like that there's the apparent feeling here that being granted sysop status is a really special thing.</p>

<p>I first ran in to <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a> over a discussion regarding a delete (that we both favoured). Her curt reply of no personal attacks (when there had been no attack, or at the very best the attack was aimed at me anyway) led to the comment <b>"I have been here a lot longer than you".</b> <a href="../../../p/e/d/User_talk%7EPedro1999a_e883.html#Talk:WebAPP" title="User talk:Pedro1999a">See here</a>. Hardly following <a href="../../../p/l/e/Wikipedia%7EPlease_do_not_bite_the_newcomers_ec77.html" title="Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers">don't bite the newcomer.</a>. She then cropped up in this war, where she actually removed user page content without discussing with the user. In addition very recent apologies due to her mistakes include <a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParkerconrad_c0ab.html" title="User talk:Parkerconrad">this</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/l/User_talk%7EMillrock_75b7.html" title="User talk:Millrock">this</a>. These were as a result of her hasty actions. Further examples of her <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">uncivility</a> include <a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html#All_the_photos_you_delete_is_took_and_edited_by_me" title="User talk:Zoe">this</a> and also <a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html#Reply_to_Benchtop_freeze_dryer.jpg_2" title="User talk:Zoe">this</a>.</p>
<p><b><font color="blue">I do not want a war</font></b>, and have done my best to open a debate with Zoe, but to no avail. Her last comment to me was the curt "This conversation is at an end". She has not bothered to reply to my subsequent messages.</p>
<p>In short I feel this administrator is overstepping from <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">being bold</a> to a state of agression. She never seems to <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a> but will revert first and then baack track later. These actions make her a <b>poor</b> <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators_37b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators">administrator</a> in my opinion. I do not expect her to have her admin "status" revoked, but would ask she calms down and takes a more relaxed attitude. Her brutal reverts and comments that come <i>very close</i> to <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a> can only <b><font color="red">damage this project</font></b>, by putting off potential editors.

<dd>Looks like she tried to communicate with you but you decided to not listen.

<dd>Again, I think she explained herself and tried to end the conversaation since there was nothing more to discuss on the matter. When you start out a thread as here with quotes that indicate a possible objective you may be leaning towards, this looks more like a witch hunt than anything else. I have no doubt your contributions are generally all excellent, so I encourage you to resume those efforts.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 10:23, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am still trying unsuccessfully to work out what the serious business is. This is over, right? Sorry, but we really don't need a report on the end of every single minor spat that takes place around here: ANI is clogged up enough as it is. While it would seem to me that Zoe has not been wilfully offensive, the complaining user is being wilfully offended, which is probably worse. But what <b>incident</b> are we meant to be discussing? There doesn't seem to be one. If you really think Zoe is an outstanding danger to Wikipedia then <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a> is just down the hall, second to the left. But why is this on ANI? <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoreschi_31bb.html" title="User:Moreschi">Moreschi</a> <sup><a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Deletionism_9106.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Deletionism">Deletion!</a></sup> 10:35, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In fact, various people seem to have approached this with a staggering lack of tact. Suggesting that someone either take a prolonged wikibreak or give up their bit <b>is always going to escalate the situation and is never going to help</b>, no matter how right you are, which you aren't. Quotes like "the lunatic who runs the asylum" are not really going to help either, for obvious reasons. Moreover, continuing posts on talk page when it would seem to me like the matter is dead and buried smells to me like <a href="../../../h/a/_/WP%7EHA_a95d.html" title="WP:HA">harassment</a> in minor form. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoreschi_31bb.html" title="User:Moreschi">Moreschi</a> <sup><a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Deletionism_9106.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Deletionism">Deletion!</a></sup> 10:43, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you for your comments. You will note from the edit history I did not post the "Lunatic who runs the assylum" header, and would respectfully sugest you check this fact. I did however make the other comments.

<p>I don't see any evidence that Zoe did something wrong here. That's why people are directing you elsewhere - the idea of making an "open informal complaint" about an admin implies that the admin in question did something worthy attention on this board.

<dd>Thank you for your comments. The thrust of my argument was with regards to the initial snub at being a newbie (despite 800+ edits) and the action Zoe was involved in with regard to removing content from another users page without asking (where in the debate she was generally condemed - a debate I was not inolved in initially). After that further investigation highlighted a higher than one would expect proportion of instances were her reversions have caused deep upset, and were subsequently often undone. Althought I agree that "Being curt doesn't cut it" at all times, and that admins are busy people often with little time to supply fuller posts, my thrust here has been some remarkably fast deletions / removals that Zoe has then <b>climed down on.</b> A measured approach with more checking before arbitry deletion / removal saves everyone time in the end and makes Wikipedia a better place for people to work. Over excessive use of admin powers will make new, potentially excellent, editors either give up or go down the <a href="../../../t/i/n/WP%7ETINC_0d39.html#On_Wikipedia_and_the_Cabal" title="WP:TINC">Cabal thought process</a>.<span style="border:2px solid #FFEEAA;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedro1999a_d138.html" title="User:Pedro1999a"><b>Pedro</b></a><small>1999a</small> | <a href="../../../p/e/d/User_talk%7EPedro1999a_e883.html" title="User talk:Pedro1999a"><font style="color:#accC10;background:#FF0011;">&#160;Talk&#160;</font></a></span> 15:11, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For the record, whilst I note with respect that it says up top <b>this is not the complaints department</b>, right next to this the page has a line saying you <i>can</i> open an <i>informal</i> complaint about an admin here.

<dd>No violation of WP:USER is obvious here.

<dd>I think Zoe behaved incredibly badly in not simply explaining her concern first and asking Jeff to modify it (not to mention using administrative rollback on non-vandalism and all that jazz). To my knowledge, Jeff is a solid editor and that courtesy should have been given (as outlined in WP:USER). —bbatsell</dd>

<p><a href="../../../m/c/g/User%7EMcginnly_76e7.html" title="User:Mcginnly">User:Mcginnly</a> has been playing silly buggers with socks - at least <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJoopercoopers_40a5.html" title="User:Joopercoopers">Joopercoopers</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntischmitz_bf83.html" title="User:Antischmitz">Antischmitz</a> spotted so far. The edits were way too similar, the checkuser was the confirming bit of evidence and the silly games with manufacturing content disputes are really not suitable conduct. I've blocked the socks indefinitely and Mcginnly 31 hours to get out of whatever mood made him (an otherwise very active contributor) think this was a good idea - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 00:10, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks, David Gerard. Note that Mcginnly was using Joopercoopers for content disputes on <a href="../../../t/a/j/Taj_Mahal_9d41.html" title="Taj Mahal">Taj Mahal</a>, which is currently at <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a>. <b><a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENishkid64_5481.html" title="User:Nishkid64"><span style="background:#009;color:#7FFF00">Nish</span><span style="background:cyan;color:#009">kid</span></a><a href="../../../n/i/s/User_talk%7ENishkid64_b4d4.html" title="User talk:Nishkid64"><span style="background:orange;color:navy blue">64</span></a></b> 00:15, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Unblocked</b>. There was no evidence presented anywhere that the Jooperscoopers was used for "content disputes." All the edits were simple maintenance. Additionally, while Mcginnly <i>decided</i> to use that account for that article, of course, on the day of the decision, there will be edits from two accounts near each other in time. That's not a violation by itself. Thirdly, since this <i>is</i> a very hot topic, where, had David Gerrard investigated he would have seen, there is the ugly and unextinguishable flames of nationalism and religious intolerance at stake, any complaint deserves at least as much investigation as anyone complained about. However, none of that was the reason for the unblock.</li>
<li>The reason for the unblock is simply that David Gerrard was faced with a long time and trusted community member with a clean record and unquestioned contributions and <i>never spoke to him.</i> I.e. he didn't investigate. He used bot-like analysis and did the block instead of using the human intelligence that we need to talk to and <i>listen to</i> the contributor. This is the same bad approach that generated the last "Giano affair." Blocking is a serious matter: we owe it to the people who give us their time and expertise to <i>listen</i> to them and <i>consider</i> matters. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:37, 25 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sockpuppetry is also a serious matter. I'm conducting my own investigation and I'll keep an open mind but I can't fathom why anyone would think this is a good idea. There are several parts of WP:SOCK that may have been violated. I welcome an explanation from Mcginnly--and David. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 14:09, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Having reviewed the evidence, I doubt that I would have blocked under the circumstances. At the same time, I would have sent a sharp note to Mcginnly asking him what he was up to, and suggesting that he pick one account for <a href="../../../t/a/j/Taj_Mahal_9d41.html" title="Taj Mahal">Taj Mahal</a> and stick with it. Users are allowed to have multiple accounts, but such practice is discouraged, and the cardinal rule is never to "cross the streams." How strictly this gets interpreted varies from checkuser to checkuser. I don't like what I see, but I wouldn't have blocked right away. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 14:20, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>That's great news Mackensen - seriously - but the problem is that now McGinnly a long time serving editor of very high standard articles now for eternity is branded by David Gerard on his block log with " abusive sockpuppetry". I see nothing abusive in these edits <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Taj_Mahal&amp;diff=102439586&amp;oldid=102439293" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Taj_Mahal&amp;diff=102439586&amp;oldid=102439293" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Taj_Mahal&amp;diff=102546151&amp;oldid=102544550" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Taj_Mahal&amp;diff=102546151&amp;oldid=102544550" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Taj_Mahal&amp;diff=102656565&amp;oldid=102565912" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Taj_Mahal&amp;diff=102656565&amp;oldid=102565912" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>, can someone explain to be where is the "abuse". It is quite apparent that McGinnly was editing as a sock for what he felt were the right reason. There was obviously no malice or evil intent. He is a highly respected editor of architectural pages, that he should edit, and help protect Taj mahal fom vandals etc is exactly what I would expect him to be doing. So what exactly was the problem, and why did it have to result in a 30 hour block with no warning. I don't raise this point only because McGinnly is one of my close wiki-friends but because I think admins should thing about the stigma their hasty actions may cause when they blot some-one's hitherto immaculately clean log. I don't want to become in another major row, and McGinnly is big enough and ugly enough to defend himself, but as people (somwhere above) now use my name (even when I'm not connected) as crowd puller I might as well pitch in and use my (albeit temporary) celebrity status to give, what I see as a serious problem, some publicity! How about David Gerard admiting that was not abusive and having McGinnly's log wiped clean? <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_II_8fcc.html" title="User:Giano II">Giano</a> 16:02, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This call for wiping of block logs is a slippery slope. I realise it eventually happened to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Giano" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Giano" rel="nofollow">Giano's first account's block log</a>, but I would much prefer that notes be added retrospectively to clarify possibly inaccurate block logs. Wiping them is confusing and can obscure what has happened. At the moment, the workaround is a 1-second block to add an explanatory note to the block log. On a more general note, can we please ask for block logs (indeed any logs) to be written in calm, neutral, language. Just make it vague and link to where the discussion took place. If no discussion (eg. IRC or action taken unilaterally without consultation), then say this as well. This careful writing of a block log, and careful discussion, is paramount for established users. Otherwise the whole merry-go-round of hurt feelings and wild accusations can start up again. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 16:12, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have no objection in principle, although it would be better if another checkuser, or David himself, was willing to do so. I'd like to hear from David before moving forward.

<dd>The principle here is that administrators should interact with good-faith users, where they believe the user has violated policy, before instinctively reaching for the block button. In this instance, a talkpage inquiry or e-mail would have elicited an explanation for Mcginnly's activities and, if the explanation were not acceptable, a request could have been made that Mcginnly handle things differently. There was no reason to believe that this user would not have responded in good faith to such an inquiry and either justified or discontinued the allegedly problematic activity. It was not a situation where blocking was needed either to prevent imminent danger to the project or to gain the editor's attention.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Having myself been equipped with a block button for all of four days now, and having recently had to make the decision about whether to press it for the first time for something other than obvious repeated vandalism, reinforces to me that while it is easy to second-guess any administrative decision, at the same time we need to bear in mind how serious a thing it is to block an established contributor. Wikipedia is the encyclopedia that anyone can edit. A block means that we are saying to an editor "this is the encyclopedia that anyone can edit today—<i>except you</i>." It really sought to be a last resort. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 16:31, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It's really not a problem - We've exchanged emails and kissed and made up - DG's was a genuine mistake, mine was not informing anyone of my socks. I'd really rather the matter was dropped, not least because the whole purpose of the sock was to cushion myself against the potential problems over at the taj mahal talk page and P.N. Oak, I believe the socks will be unblocked and I can get back to work. Naturally if the POV shitstorm does hit the mcginnly account I hope I can rely on admin backup?

<dd>This is why I unblocked, though. I had been asked to contribute help with the Taj article, when the time came to improve it, so I knew the background. <i>Anyone could have</i> by simply communicating with the user. I don't mean to jump on David Gerrard's head too much here, but it's very, very, very important with established users to <i>ask them.</i> Honestly, if it takes too much time to converse with people, then you probably don't have time to be a blocking administrator. With hit and run IP's, it's one thing, but with long timers, with fellow admins, it's simply nuts. Blocking without <b>warning</b> is absolutely in violation of blocking policy. Blocking based on complaint not recorded on Wikipedia, running check users without written requests, these are also not kosher.

<dd>Don't bust up David Gerard for this. I asked for CheckUser, and he performed it. I told him what he had been using the accounts for, quoting another administrator involved in the dispute. I was contacted soon after by Mcginnly and I told him about the multiple violations of <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a>. Although he disagreed with most of them, I showed that he did indeed violate <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a>.

<dd>You're wong.

<dd>Note that I recently unblocked DeanHinnen/Dino based on a consensus reached at unblock-en-l. This had <i>nothing to do</i> with the issues above, however. He was accused of being a sockpuppet or meatpuppet of BryanFromPalistine (sp?).

<dd>I believe you were taken in. I can find no record of Bryan having a brother at all, and no Dean Hinnen born after 1949 shows up when I search. As we know Bryan to be much younger than that, this person is not likely to be his Brother. And in any case there does appear to be a meatpuppet relationship if this is a separate person as he has begun right were Bryan left off using the same words, phrases, and modes of attack. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenBurch_6e87.html" title="User:BenBurch">BenBurch</a> 01:31, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I signed up to to the unblock list and read the discussion, and Dino's requests to be unblocked, and Dean is a very real name working where he claimed he worked. They might also be brothers, like what is claimed by Dean. Dean also insinuated that he was editing to protect Wiki from possible libel suits from FR, (I took it as a vieled threat) where he claims to act as a mod. - <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairness_And_Accuracy_For_All_6573.html" title="User:Fairness And Accuracy For All">Fairness &amp; Accuracy For All</a> 02:59, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, we do know he did a lot of his "editing" from his employer's network. Must be a very liberal employer, because when I have worked for manufacturing companies in the past they were most clear that using company assets for such things was strictly <i>verboten</i>.

<dd>I was a small part of the investigation into this matter due to the discussion on the list and I support the consensus to unblock DeanHinnen/Dino and see how things go. His manner on that list and his apparent sincerity and flexibility impressed me, and I felt that an unblock was the right thing to do. Certainly I could be proven wrong, but I hope not. I am not sure that having several major participants in this matter calling for blocks is likely to be helpful at this time so I'd suggest letting go for now, and going back to substantively editing to improve our content. If there are incidents in future, please present the incident particulars in a factual neutral way and leave the advocacy out if at all possible. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 13:36, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Because, my friend, he just admitted to being Bryan. And therefore a sock. And therefore a liar. And therefore he lied his way out of his block. See above where I call him out on having claimed to be part of the FR legal team? He admitted to it. BUT, it was not DEAN who made that claim. It was Bryan. So by admitting to this he has admitted to being Bryan. I have no quarrel with him editing anything! I never did as long as he was not removing sourced information or inserting NNPOV, what I object to, and will continue to object to is him using sock puppets to evade a block, which he is DOING RIGHT NOW. I have welcomed Bryan back from blocks several times, and should he, under his main account, get himself unblocked, I will welcome him back again and work WITH him. But what he has done here is inexcusable. Not only is he evading his block, but he actually called WikiMedia Foundation on the phone and harassed poor Carolyn. And lied to the unblocking people.

<dd>No, it wasn't out of context. There are plenty of explanations that don't include lying including different recollections as well as multiple people name TJ Walker. You have no idea whether he talked to TJ Walker or not (or which TJ walker, texas ranger). This is the whole point of AGF. Dino was blocked for sockpuppetry and that block was overturned despite all BryanFromPalatine socks and edits and is no longer an issue. The relevant facts for this were that the <b>source</b> for the claim at the FR article <b>pulled the article</b>. Regardless of who may have prompted them to do so, the source is the ones that did it. This user has agreed not to edit the article.

<dd>That's no threat. Dino made libelous claims about author TJ Walker, saying he didn't write one of his articles, and that TJ Walker had even admitted this to Dino. Now TJ is suspected of plagarism or worse because of what Dino 'claims' and what he wrote in several different places on Wiki. If Dino doesn't substantiate or withdraw these claims, I will, as a fan of TJ Walker's work, be forced to notify him of the public, libelous smears against his character by Dino. I strongly suggest you unhitch your caboose from this train wreck, Beatty. - <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairness_And_Accuracy_For_All_6573.html" title="User:Fairness And Accuracy For All">Fairness &amp; Accuracy For All</a>

<dd>They already told me that they didn't consider <b>anything</b> other than sockpuppet charges. The <b>very</b> troubling charges regarding your claims of talking to author TJ Walker, and him 'admitting' that he didn't write an article attributed to him (I'm not sure if you're alleging plagarism or ghost writing, or that aliens from planet Xenu wrote the article) and your posting of these smears against TJ's charcter and professional carreer, and you coercing a Wiki employee to edit the Free Republic article based on these claims of yours <b>will</b> be investigated Dean.

<li>After some edits here and there, Rumpelstiltskin223 became completely active from 10th December (the day Hkelkar got banned).</li>
<li>Since then, Rumpelstiltskin223 has made close to 1400 edits in the mainspace. He has already shown the same pro-hindu and anti-muslim bias that hkelkar had and has already been blocked 4 times for edit-warring. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Rumpelstiltskin223" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Rumpelstiltskin223" rel="nofollow">[13]</a></li>

</li>
<li>Though Rumpelstiltskin223 hasn't uploaded many images yet, he shows the same style there too by uploading images from websites having a cc-by-sa license. His last upload is from flickr, from which Hkelkar used to upload a lot of pics.

Hkelkar/Shiva's trident was also pursuing a PhD in physics.</li>

<dd>The checkusers will note the use of proxies if they identify them as such at the time. Also, the checkuser was run over winter break, making it possible that Hkelkar was editing from another location but is now back at uni. Asking for a recheck couldn't hurt.

When he/she was blocked and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Rumpelstiltskin223&amp;diff=101316956&amp;oldid=101315720" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Rumpelstiltskin223&amp;diff=101316956&amp;oldid=101315720" rel="nofollow">asked</a> how to avoid such situations, I <a href="../../../r/u/m/User_talk%7ERumpelstiltskin223_Archive2_9001.html#Trying_to_answer_your_question" title="User talk:Rumpelstiltskin223/Archive2">sympathized</a> with him/her and took his/her question for real. I offered some advice, but he consistently refused to even look at it. Even his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:SebastianHelm#Thank_you" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:SebastianHelm#Thank_you" rel="nofollow">"thank you"</a> was mostly a complaint about other users. When I finally announced that I was giving up AGF on him/her, he/she deleted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Rumpelstiltskin223&amp;oldid=102498633#Caveats" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Rumpelstiltskin223&amp;oldid=102498633#Caveats" rel="nofollow">our last conversation</a>. It seems to me that this user is intent on having problems with other editors. Much as I believe in the good in people, I'm at the end of my wisdom with that user. I am really no fan of punitive measures, but I don't see any use for Wikipedia in further allowing this user to edit. — <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESebastianHelm_63db.html" title="User:SebastianHelm">Sebastian</a> 00:14, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What points? I edit whatever coincides with my interests. I am interested in Indian history, Indian politics, Religion and Politics in South Asia, Hindi Films and Star Trek. My edits show that I am neither pro-Hindu nor anti-Muslim, just interested in unbiased articles, many of which have biases against Hindus, others which have biases against Muslims and Christians that I am working on. If you see my edits to <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity_in_India_6403.html" title="Christianity in India">Christianity in India</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christianity_in_India&amp;diff=99700686&amp;oldid=99680169" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christianity_in_India&amp;diff=99700686&amp;oldid=99680169" rel="nofollow">[42]</a>, I have edited a very neutral section depicting the Hindu-Christian conflict, and talked about syncretic Indianization of several Christians, like <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Thomas_Christians_1aae.html" title="St. Thomas Christians">St. Thomas Christians</a> and other sects who have blended Indian culture with Christian theology. I also plan to add that Christians in South India re-enact Biblical parables using Indian dances like Kathakali. Still, I was accused of being an "anti-Christian" by that Bdebbarma user <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Tripura_Baptist_Christian_Union#TBCU.27s_credibility" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Tripura_Baptist_Christian_Union#TBCU.27s_credibility" rel="nofollow">[43]</a> because of my edits to <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tripura_Baptist_Christian_Union_70b6.html" title="Tripura Baptist Christian Union">Tripura Baptist Christian Union</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tripura_Baptist_Christian_Union&amp;diff=95042054&amp;oldid=95040059" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tripura_Baptist_Christian_Union&amp;diff=95042054&amp;oldid=95040059" rel="nofollow">[44]</a> and their involvement in Christian extremist terrorism in Tripura. I do not take such accusations seriously as they seem to be the product of a narrow mind.</dd>
<dd>I am presently engaged in re-writing <a href="../../../m/u/k/Mukti_Bahini_a788.html" title="Mukti Bahini">Mukti Bahini</a>, a predominantly Muslim outfit. I am also getting material on historical attitudes on <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamophobia.html" title="Islamophobia">Islamophobia</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Arabism_9893.html" title="Anti-Arabism">anti-Arabism</a>,articles to which I have already added information if you look at the history page. Where is this "pro-Hindu" and "anti-Muslim"/"anti-Christian" bias of which you people speak please answer me?</dd>
<dd>Whenever my edits seem to portray other religions in a negative light, well, it is not my fault that (according to Muslim editors) "partisan hacks" like <a href="../../../a/m/n/Amnesty_International_6202.html" title="Amnesty International">Amnesty International</a> and <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Bangladesh#Hinduism_in_Bangladesh" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Bangladesh#Hinduism_in_Bangladesh" rel="nofollow">[45]</a> showcase the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persecution_of_Hindus_bfaa.html" title="Persecution of Hindus">Persecution of Hindus</a> in Bangladesh at the hands of Islamic Fundamentalists.

If you don't like it then go contact the academics who wrote those articles. Attacking me on some cooked-up sockpuppetry charge will not be productive to wikipedia thaa.</dd>
<dd>I do not know how I can prove to you of my identity, since you do not know who I am and I am under no obligation to give you my personal information. I have edited many articles across many topics, and this aksi_great has conveniently cherry-picked a few that I have edited and then yell "Aha! Sockpuppet". I can do that to any two users. If you give me some time, I can manufacture such a case against other users too. If you want to do a checkuser to settle your doubts, please do so. However, do not keep bothering me with such spurious charges simply because you people want to keep your unacademic biased articles biased forever, since that will not happen, irrespective of what you do to me or anyone else. <a href="../../../r/u/m/User%7ERumpelstiltskin223_6de5.html" title="User:Rumpelstiltskin223">Rumpelstiltskin223</a> 12:00, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Rumpel is currently on a reverting spree on the article.</li>

<dd>When did I say that the articles that I have mentioned were the only articles you have edited? Hkelkar has been banned by the ArbCom, and it is my duty to not allow Hkelkar in any form to edit wikipedia for 1 year. I have tracked Hkelkar's edits for a very long time leading up to the ArbCom case. I feel that I have gathered enough proof that you are indeed Hkelkar. The similarities are too close to be co-incidences. If the administrators want I can produce more similarities. If they are not able to decide about ban-evasion, I am prepared to ask the ArbCom for intervention. - <a href="../../../a/k/s/User%7EAksi_great_bb76.html" title="User:Aksi great">Aksi_great</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/s/User_talk%7EAksi_great_f9ab.html" title="User talk:Aksi great">talk</a>) 14:47, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Then you are doing absolutely nothing. O and aksi just above " Almost every article that Rumpel has edited has been previously edited by Hkelkar/Shiva's trident". Your argument is flimsy and self contradictory. Do you not know that the BJP won a majority not too long ago in India? There are over 400 million people that subscribe to the brand of politics I assume rumpel belongs to.<b><a href="../../../b/a/k/User%7EBakasuprman_bbab.html" title="User:Bakasuprman"><font color="purple">Baka</font></a><a href="../../../b/a/k/User_talk%7EBakasuprman_b63a.html" title="User talk:Bakasuprman"><font color="red">man</font></a></b> 21:30, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>HKelkar's biggest defender ( and a part of the arbcom on Hkelkar) comes and defends this user&#160;?

A point to remember is that Hkelkar/Shiva's Trident/Pusyamitra Sunga was known to use technology to dodge checkuser in the past.

<dd>Actually, a lot of these so-called "incriminating edits" are routine vandalism patrols by me. I have been tracking anonymous edits for a while now, as they seem to be the most vandalistic statistically. It is not my fault that certain articles are troll-attractors and so will be edited contentiously by anons. <a href="../../../r/u/m/User%7ERumpelstiltskin223_6de5.html" title="User:Rumpelstiltskin223">Rumpelstiltskin223</a> 02:47, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>And yes, then it would be easier to claim that "I have edited non India, non Hindu-Muslim related articles as well " just by reverting some edits (apparently indiscriminately) assuming that anonymous authors don't have editing rights.Bakasuprman has mastered this art well by creating categories and assigning them to innumerable articles and swelling his edit count 87.74.3.128 07:57, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>"Mastered this art", I am hardly answerable to an IP troll going around with wild conspiracies. My edit couint is large mostly because of categories, but only a couple have been cfd'd like 2 out of 70 or so, proving that I create useful categorization on the pedia. What do you do 87.xx?

<p>I have submitted my evidence and I conclude that Rumpel is indeed Hkelkar. I would like to know if there is consensus among admins of the same so that Rumpel can be blocked from wikipedia. Please review the evidence and put your support or oppose below. Please feel free to ask me any questions regarding the evidence that I have provided. - <a href="../../../a/k/s/User%7EAksi_great_bb76.html" title="User:Aksi great">Aksi_great</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/s/User_talk%7EAksi_great_f9ab.html" title="User talk:Aksi great">talk</a>) 12:24, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Seconded</b> I would further like to add 1:His first 5 edits were reverts and out of his first 50 over 70% are reverts which <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;offset=20061211235434&amp;limit=50&amp;target=Rumpelstiltskin223" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;offset=20061211235434&amp;limit=50&amp;target=Rumpelstiltskin223" rel="nofollow">[101]</a> which I find strange.I checked over 75 others over and none of them had reverts at the start .This shows that Rumpelstiltskin223 is experienced in using Wikipedia before he started using this user name.new users take time to learn even computer experts.</p>
<p>2:Being an Indian he choice the name Rumpelstiltskin223 as it would avoid suspician of him being Hkelkar.It is not usual nickname or chat name used anywhere in India or by Indians .First time seeing an Indian use since I started using the net over 10 years ago.If I had not seen his edits I would never guessed he was an Indian,it is totally alien to an Indian.Hence difficult to find he is Hkelkar</p>
<p>3:His comments are fantical and he cannot stand other views broke the 3RR rule 6 times and 5 times this month and was blocked 5 times and page protected in <a href="../../../v/a/i/Vaikom_Satyagraha_b6d2.html" title="Vaikom Satyagraha">Vaikom Satyagraha</a>.Look his fantical talk in various talk pages.While I respect his views.</p>

<p><b>Comment</b>: I have an extensive knowledge of the editing pattern of Netaji, also known as Shiva's Trident, and what was later decided was his sockpuppet, HKelkar, as well as that of most prominent members of the posse that share his extremist religious ideology. When it was first claimed that Kelkar was Netaji, I disagreed; the fact that checkuser indicated I was wrong was indicative of this puppetmaster's ability to evade detection. While I disagree that the name or the choice of articles is in itself sufficiently indicative, I am drawn in particular to the accusations of anti-semitism that Haphar quotes above; that is something that was peculiar to this puppetmaster. In particular, the description of the Dalit Freedom Network as a hate site because of 'holocaust denial'., while possibly true, is surprising, as it is possibly the last thing that the average follower of Indian politics would check for, but the first thing that this particular wacko would. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 09:09, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am not sure why I should be accused of 'lying' in that I confused Dalit Voice with Dalit Freedom Network, both fairly obscure organisations with similar agendas. This response is troubling, as a new user who has never interacted with me before is unlikely to greet me with this accusation, I think - unless the user was intensely disruptive, as indeed the banned puppetmaster was.</dd>
<dd>The explanation proffered above I leave to other editors to attempt to decipher. I dont think it is very believable; that it shows the combination of aggression, random accusations and links that have characterised Pusyamitra/Netaji/Subhash/Trident/Kelkar in the past might be just a coincidence. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 16:32, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><s>I hate to say it, but I think this should be let go pending the user performing further egregious personal attacks. One of the tough things about being a responsible user on Wikipedia is accepting that people won't always react well to warnings; rather than <i>insisting</i> that people aknowledge that their behavior was in error and improve 100% immediately, it's sometimes better to let petulant responses go. (That is to say, it's not important if his behavior improves in response to your warning, only that it improves.) If he had responded to your warnings by swearing and insulting you directly, I'd block him for sure, but as it is I think it's better to let him alone and see if he repeats the personal attacks in other contexts. I don't see another really egregious personal attack since your last warning; if I missed it, then</s> of course disregard my comments. <s>I also won't object if another admin handles this differently.</s> -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 14:11, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>This dispute was never decided by the Wikipedia administrators Alex Bakharev and Mikka. This is Living Person biography dispute. I have posted this case as clear violation at the <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia%7EBiographies_of_living_persons_Noticeboard_e3c5.html" title="Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons/Noticeboard">Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons/Noticeboard</a> long time ago, as a creator of this article. This is typical living person defamation case using unreliable and mutually controversial sources: the alleged "articles" are <b>not dated</b> (worse than blog); the texts of alleged citations of the same article contradict each other; the web site has no any editorial oversight, and so on. See <a href="../../../b/o/r/Talk%7EBoris_Stomakhin_07c4.html#Article_development" title="Talk:Boris Stomakhin">Talk:Boris_Stomakhin#Article development</a>. None of the Administrators disputed these arguments. The problem is: user Vlad Fedorov makes personally offensive comments, including that he wish me to die. This left no possibility for further negotiations. I spent a lot of time (hundreds of edits) trying to find a compromise with Vlad Fedorov (administrators Alex Bakharev and Mikka did try to help a little - thanks to them!), but it is our responsibility to have a version of the article consistent with Wikipedia LP policies. If it is clearly inconsistent, there is no any room to compromise. <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 20:58, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, it was never a "long-standing guideline."

Radiant would rather work toward sheer force of will (and, for that matter, misconstrue my arguments). A typical behavior of him on Wikipedia-space pages. Ironically enough, his complaint now is the first time I can see that he's actually looked for outside input on the essay, something he should have done almost two months ago and could have avoided this entire charade. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 13:19, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Radiant, I don't understand how this is an incident requiring administrator attention ... if you're looking for feedback on your proposed guideline, it would be better placed at <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_e980.html" title="Wikipedia:Village pump">Wikipedia:Village pump</a>.

<ul>
<li>It's not my proposed guideline. I seek feedback on Jeff's unilateral declaration that it isn't a guideline. Last time this came up (where he points to) it was discussed on its talk page, the village pump as well as the admin noticeboard (so his allegation that it wasn't discussed is false) and it was pointed out that most people agree that we should avoid instruction creep. Hence it is a guideline. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 13:28, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>(edit conflict x 2) To me, the way that guidelines are created is that enough people generally agree that they're a guideline that nobody objects when a {{<a href="../../../g/u/i/Template%7EGuideline_29bd.html" title="Template:Guideline">guideline</a>}} tag is placed on the page (much the same way edits are made to articles). Whether I agree with that project page or not, I don't think that there's consensus to mark it as a guideline; even if a page has been around for a long time, that doesn't necessarily mean that it fits guideline potential (would you place {{<a href="../../../g/u/i/Template%7EGuideline_29bd.html" title="Template:Guideline">guideline</a>}} on <a href="../../../b/j/a/WP%7EBJAODN_1a71.html" title="WP:BJAODN">WP:BJAODN</a>?). I'm not going to change the tag back to {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProposed_e778.html" title="Template:Proposed">proposed</a>}}, though. (By the way, I think Radiant!s already reverted this page 3 times in 24 hours; while this falls short of <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>, I would advise everyone involved to sort out a dispute by discussion <i>before</i> the edit war rather than after it.) --<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">ais523</a> 13:30, 26 January 2007 (<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">U</a><a href="../../../a/i/s/User_talk%7EAis523_6ca0.html" title="User talk:Ais523">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ais523_df26.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ais523">C</a>)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I have no knowledge of this particular dispute. But it is my exprience that Radiant has a sometimes overly aggreesive and dogmatic attitude when attempting to force through his desired changes and when dealing with criticism that is not always conducive to consensus building, in my view. <i>If</i> Jeff's done this without first canvassing opinions on the relevent talk page, then that is a bit naughty however. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 13:30, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ah, but I'm not forcing through changes here. I'm endorsing the status quo.

<dl>
<dd>This is false. The status quo was that this was not a guideline, until you snuck in and tagged it with <i>no</i> discussion. The only people attempting to start a dialogue are the ones who oppose it.

<ul>
<li>It gets problematic when people start talking about "marking it as a guideline". What matters is whether it <i>is</i> a guideline. It's about the content, not the tag.

<li>To answer your first question, the answer would be yes if I was more than simply annoyed, but I'm not. I have no intention on spending much more, if any, time on the subject <i>here</i>.

<p>IMHO, this should be talken to the <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28policy%29_070f.html" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)">village pump</a>. As far as I can tell from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Avoid_instruction_creep&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Avoid_instruction_creep&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">edit history</a>, this seems to be a debate about whether CREEP's long-standing history on meta means that it is a guideline on en.wikipedia or whether it needs independent consensus. BDJ isn't the only person on his side of the debate, and I haven't seen any evidence that he wouldn't be amenable to dispute resolution. Without touching the irony of the position that (1) the automatic acceptance of guidelines from meta (2) means we automatically get a guideline saying don't make too many guidelines, the issue seems perfect for the village pump. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheronJ_75b8.html" title="User:TheronJ">TheronJ</a> 15:19, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
