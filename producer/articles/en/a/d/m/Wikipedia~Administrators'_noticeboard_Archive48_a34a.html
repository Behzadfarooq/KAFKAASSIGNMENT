<dd>Just for clarification, I have no prehistory with <a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHolywarrior_ee67.html" title="User:Holywarrior">User:Holywarrior</a> (Please review my <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ragib_2dc4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ragib">contributions</a>). My only "Ganging up" activity was issuing a <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> against this user, for reasons cited above (i.e. calling another user a "3rd rate liar"). Following that, I looked in the other comments in the talk page, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2006_June_22&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=60399032" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2006_June_22&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=60399032" rel="nofollow">voted here</a> in a CFD for renaming, which Holywarrior opposed (My comment there was&#160;: <i>Rename: as per Mareino</i> hardly even a comment). Holywarrior turned his actions against me (see his last 15 edits or so) and claimed I pretended not to know anything and was bullying him <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ragib&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=60490287" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ragib&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=60490287" rel="nofollow">[1]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ARagib&amp;diff=60493802&amp;oldid=60493372" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ARagib&amp;diff=60493802&amp;oldid=60493372" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Well, as I said, my only knowledge of this affair is ANB, and I don't really care to delve into the past or present disagreements this user has with others. That seems to be what Holywarrior has against me, and for this, I had the honor of making an entry in his <a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHolywarrior_ee67.html" title="User:Holywarrior">attack page</a>.</dd>

<dd>Well, I hope he cools down, and gets back to editing. His recent edits in the last week show only reverts or attacks in different pages, and a very dubious nomination of <a href="../../../c/v/u/WP%7ECVU_b199.html" title="WP:CVU">WP:CVU</a> for deletion. I hope a 48 hour break will change such behavior. Thanks. --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 21:49, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Holywarrior as a vandal, nominated by Debonshire, itself need a review.Possibility of story being the reverse is not ruled out.<a href="../../../w/m/n/User%7EWmnnzzr_0e53.html" title="User:Wmnnzzr">Wmnnzzr</a> 13:22, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have had no interaction with Holywarrior prior to this incident. I first encountered him when I saw his nomination for the deletion of the CVU page, claiming that it had spawed <a href="../../../v/a/n/User%7EVandalPatrol_9ecd.html" title="User:VandalPatrol">User:VandalPatrol</a>, who I knew nothing of. I then looked at his talk page and saw that he had refered to every warning placed there by VandalPatrol as vandalism, so naturally, I assumed that he had been comitting vandalism and was angry about it having been interfered with and therefore decided to nominate the CVU page for deletion as a means of retaliation. Then after the matter, I did some investigation and found that he had a right to be angry with VandalPatrol, as that user has had a history of trolling and harrassing him and is currently blocked indefinitely, though he is now using sockpuppets. While I disagree with some of his actions, I can better understand them now. I have personally sent Holywarrior an e-mail apologising to him for having misjudged him and letting him know that I have made an effort to have VandalPatrol's harrassement put to an end. Hopefully he will decide to come back.--<font color="green"><b>Conrad Devonshire</b></font> <sup><b><font color="purple">Talk</font></b></sup> 21:03, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

<p><a href="../../../d/e/a/Deadhead.html" title="Deadhead">Deadhead</a> documents the term "deadhead", meaning a fan of the Grateful dead. Most of what is in this article is uncited, and some editors are arguing that Usenet is a reliable source since no other source exists. I think this article needs to be around 1/3 the current length. Maybe some others with more experience of rock culture could have a look? <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 11:38, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>usenet isn't a reliable source if no other sources exist. Its a neologism, and if they can't find any primary or secondary sources using the word and have to rely on usenet, I believe that qualifies it for deletion. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 21:10, 30 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Of course the article needs to be properly sourced but <i>deadhead</i> is by no means a neologism--in fact it is very well known and has been used ubiquitously for decades to describe the fans of the Grateful Dead, who are (or were) really closer to a phenomenon, than any other fans I've heard tell of--thousands of people who essentially devoted their lives to following the band around and had an almost cultish entire culture centered on the band. In high schools in the U.S. for the last three decades, for example, cliques were often described as the preppies, the metalheads, the druggies etc. and deadheads (often for those who were hippieish but not even dedicated fans of the band. I'll see if I can drum up some reliable sources. --<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 22:35, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I find it highly inappropriate that he's allowed to continue his vile rampage simply because he's using AOL. If any other user had said the things he's said about me (i.e. accusing me of being a pedophile, having sex with my mother) they would have been permanently banned from editing here.</p>

<dd>My advice would be to close the AfD yourself, as a keep, since you're saying yourself that if the decision on the now-removed version was "delete", you'd replace it with the version <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">User:Uncle G</a> has written.

<p>I took a look at this user's userpage, as he complained about personal attacks. I was suprised to therefore see a long list of celebrities being described as "racist whore, fuckin traitor, homosexual, murdering liar", and so on. Wikipedia is not a soapbox, don't own your userpage, etc. I removed the section, but he restored it.

<dd>Clearly, this isn't encyclopedic, but I think the <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSER_5ae6.html" title="WP:USER">user page guidelines</a> need to be clarified. It says that longtime users are often given a great amount of <i>latitude</i>, but to what extent? Some users have had pages devoted strictly to showcasing images of nudity; some are okay with it and some aren't (but the user page guidelines don't really help to clarify whether it truly is okay). And it looks like the same type of situation exists here. The question of whether we should give Batman2005 <i>this</i> much latitude is not answered within the user page guidelines.</dd>

<dd>However, I would like to note several statements that implicitly attack certain types of people.

<dd>In addition, I'm quite fascinated by your question: <i>So, question - is the abuse of real people encyclopedic?</i> Wikipedians <i>are</i> real people too, aren't they? Okay, okay, I know what you're saying. But let's pretend <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_O%27Reilly_9983.html" title="Bill O'Reilly">Bill O'Reilly</a> were to become a Wikipedian. Or perhaps <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris_Bennett_fcc7.html" title="Paris Bennett">Paris Bennett</a> were to start editing Wikipedia. Then Batman's page would <i>absolutely</i> be making personal attacks against Wikipedians. So, the personal attacks against famous people in reality are equivalent to personal attacks against Wikipedians. We would not (I hope) allow something to say about an Wikipedia editor, <i>no talent, ugly, annoying voice, cocky, ugly, etc, etc.</i>, or allow any editor to call someone else a <i>fat ass windbag</i>, so why should we allow people to do the same for celebrities who may or may not be Wikipedians? Batman's user page is far from encyclopedic and serves only to create an uncomfortable environment for people (albeit famous people).

<dd>Firstly i think its ridiculous that this was listed without me being told about it, how disrespectful! Secondly, this has been brought to this very page several times in the past and several times in the past it has been established that my user page violates <b>NO</b> set wikipedia policy! None whatsoever! There is not a single personal attack towards a wikipedia user on my entire page, if Paris Bennett were to become a wikipedian and object then I would remove the offending comment about her. As is though, there is no policy violation on my page, simply put...if it offends you, then discontinue looking at it. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatman2005_c25f.html" title="User:Batman2005">Batman2005</a> 14:45, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As I implied, a userpage is not where this would be expected. I think you need to understand that the content of the encyclopedia may not be censored - but that does not mean people can say or do what they like.

<dd>The problem here isn't that its offensive, the problem is that it violates no set wikipedia policy. You highlighted an article that is a guideline, but not a policy. If certain users find my userpage offensive, as you do, then you are free to navigate away from it and spend your wikipedia time elsewhere. There is no policy about foul language on userpages, if you believe there should be one then there are ways to go about getting that policy enacted. But to require/request that I remove it is censorship at its finest, and that is specifically against wikipedia policy. I also grow very tired of people saying stuff like "I think you should understand &lt;insert something here&gt;" as if i'm too dense to read and understand wikipedia, or as if they're somehow more educated on the subject than I am. I have read all the pertinent policies, which is why i'm safe in my contention that I have violated no policy. Perhaps other users should become as familiar with said policies as I am. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatman2005_c25f.html" title="User:Batman2005">Batman2005</a> 17:49, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I have been MORE than reasonable during this discussion. I chose, on my own, to remove the offending part of the userpage, which was the reason it was brought here for discussion. I did so without needing to be convinced and did so against past consensus that my page was acceptable by all standards and violated no policy whatsoever. I will not remove the profanity as it violates no current policy on wikipedia. To contend that the policies herein shouldn't be interpreted word for word is both ludicrous and laughable. If we don't take policies word for word does that mean i'm free to interpret it however I see fit? Am i then free to levy personal attacks because i'm not interpreting that part as written? Policies are meant to be interpreted exactly how they are written, unwritten rules do not apply here nor do they carry any weight with me. If the editors en-masse want to get together and pass a policy specifically against profanity on userpages then I will follow that policy exactly as written. Until that time, I will not remove profane words from my userpage, nor should any user be expected to. If someone is offended, as I said earlier, they are free to navigate away from the page and abstain from visiting in the future. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatman2005_c25f.html" title="User:Batman2005">Batman2005</a> 17:58, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

If you want to interpret the rules to say that my userpage is offensive fine, then don't visit it in the future...problem solved. I however will interpret wikipedia policy to mean "policy" and guideline to mean "guideline." Policies are things I will follow to the letter as that's the meaning of a policy. As such, you and everyone else, has failed to show me a wikipedia policy that my userpage violates, thus...it will remain.

Kevin Federline being a douche seems pretty unrelated to wikipedia. My Frat is cooler than your gay Frat is also covered by this. Reworded you could probably keep a lot of this content, but the attitude on it has to be tuned down. Instead of Dead to me, perhaps "editors I do not communicate with". You also don't need to repeat that admins are dead to you several times. Its obvious you don't like or agree with the admins in general, so simply stating that you don't see eye to eye with them would make your stance clear without resorting incivility.

<p>"Dead to me" would be a personal attack if it said "i wish all these users would die" it does not say that. It simply says that they are dead to me, which is completely acceptable according to consensus the last time it was brought up. I name no admins by name, thus no personal attacks there either. If arguing over policies does not aid wikipedia, why did you guys start it? A bit of the pot calling the kettle black it would seem.

<dd>I personally think the current version of Batman2005's user page is acceptable - tame, even. Confessing to disliking someone isn't the same as insulting them if done tactfully, and could be useful to know in disputes. While I advise Batman2005 not to ignore users just because he dislikes them, it's pretty clear to me that this section is just a playful emulation of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Colbert_Report_3547.html" title="The Colbert Report">the Colbert Report</a>'s "Dead to Me" feature, not a hitlist, and we really have bigger fish to fry. <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeco_20f6.html" title="User:Deco">Deco</a> 23:19, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For gods sake its not attacking anyone, nor is it uncivil, in fact...one or two of the users on there told me that they are honored to be listed. If they're not sensitive about it, why are you? Would you like me to put a big giant photo of people giving high fives, or how about people laughing and shaking hands? Is that how civil you want it?

<dd>No, its not, in fact that was the topic of a very long debate one of the times it was brought here and it was clearly established that it was not defamatory. You guys can keep reaching for things to get me on, i don't know what your hard on is for getting my user page changed but its pathetic that you've spent so much time arguing over a page you likely never visited until you started commenting here. I think my "then don't look at it" approach is the best way possible. Perhaps you guys are incapable of understanding that this has been discussed numerous times here and i'll continue to go with consensus there (as it was MUCH more than two guys teaming up for no reason) and keep my page as is because it violates no wikipedia policy. Seriously, its about time you guys stopped wasting your time and mine with this ridiculous excercise and just admit that while you find it upsetting to look at, that it doesn't break any policies. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatman2005_c25f.html" title="User:Batman2005">Batman2005</a> 13:56, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Because it was two months ago on this very page, if you think i'm lying and you're not assuming good faith in my contention about it, then you can do the work and find it, you say it breaks two policies, i say it breaks none. Why does your opinion matter more? Why is your intrepretation of the rules better than mine? Are you implying that you're smarter than I am? Are you the wikipedia god? Is yours the final say in this? I must have missed that somewhere. No, you're not, right now there are two people saying it doesn't break those policies and two people saying it does. Thus...no consensus this time and i'll default back to previous consensus, if you want to see it you can do the work to find it, clearly you've got nothing better to do than wage war on my user page. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatman2005_c25f.html" title="User:Batman2005">Batman2005</a> 15:49, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No. I wasn't part of the first discussion and had no idea where to find it or when it took place. You've referenced it several times, but wikipedia is a big place, you need to provide links. Now you've just assumed bad faith by saying all that. There are also three people who don't agree with your page. See Joturners comment above near the top. You still haven't linked to the previous discussion. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 16:01, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I don't care if I assumed bad faith, you're waging your personal ethics war on my userpage. Your opinion is that it breaks the civility policy, fine, we all know that, great, super...what do you want? I'm not changing it because it offends you, I don't feel that its a violation of policy, i don't feel as though its uncivil, its not defamatory and whoever said that it was needs to read up on defamation, as opinions can't be defamation as long as they're not presented as truth...which...my god they're not! The other user you reference commented MUCH before I removed the offending material that prompted it to be brought here in the first place. You've stated your opinion and for the last 6 or 8 posts you've made you've done nothing to further it so why keep posting? If you don't have anything new to add then just be safe in the knowledge that you put your piece out there and let the process run its course. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatman2005_c25f.html" title="User:Batman2005">Batman2005</a> 16:10, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The process has run it course, 3 individuals feel its inappropriate and 2 do not. Which is a solid 60% concensus for its removal, but you'll ignore that too won't you? You've referenced a discussion as your defense and failed to provide a link for it, and replied with "find it yourself". Thats also a violation of WP:CIVIL. Tell me, can you prove Kevin Federline has never edited wikipedia? or that all of the people who's frat you refer to as "gay" have never edited wikipedia? This is your content that has been called into question and you have to defend it, which you haven't done other than repeating "No, no, no". Did you ask everyone in those two groups I mentioned whether or not they mind being on your page and referred to in that manner? <b>I don't care if I assumed bad faith</b> maybe you don't, but the community does. You don't exist in a bubble on wikipedia. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 16:19, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>IF you're going to make stuff up (like your 3-2 consensus) then you should at least use people who commented on stuff that's still in the article, the user you cited hasn't commented since I removed the section he commented on! Yet you're clearly ignoring <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeco_20f6.html" title="User:Deco">Deco</a> who said that he thinks the current version of my page is acceptable, so lets see...tally up the votes here...mine, deco and proto, that's 3. You and Ian, that's 2. SO you're right...a 3-2 consensus as of now, so it'll stay, I like how you reference a comment from somebody about something completely different, yet ignore a comment that's perfectly relevant because it doesn't fit your argument, then say that I'm ignoring things. I have more than defended my position, its not my fault that you either don't understand it, can't accept it, don't want to hear it or whatever. And telling you to find the discussion yourself is not a violation of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> you're the one who wants to see it so you can find it, i know what it says. You seem to spend most of your time here trying to lecture me as if you're somehow more qualified or better than me in some way, which I find HIGHLY offensive, you're a user just like me so don't presume to think that you can lecture me about what wikipedia is or is not. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatman2005_c25f.html" title="User:Batman2005">Batman2005</a> 16:30, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually joturner commented on your dead to me section which is still in the article, and I'm not ignoring deco. i'm ignoring you. Its your content thats being debated, and while you can defend it you can't form concensus becuase you're biased on your own content. And actually I attempted to find it and it doesn't exist in any time frame or location that you've claimed it to, so as far as I can tell, you're inventing it unless you can provide it. I've gone back to March 1, 2006 in the Incident archive and February 5th on the noticeboard. So if any discussion like this took place here, it was never archived. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 16:34, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Now you're accusing me of lying, for someone who tries to put themselves up on the wikipedia pedestal you sure break a lot of the policies you preach about. Joturner commented on the part that was deleted, if you read his comment you'll see that. Here you go, consensus from the very last time, after you accused me of lying about it beind discussed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Archive43#Personal_attacks_by_user_Batman2005_and_bad-faith_edits_by_Moe_Epsilon" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Archive43#Personal_attacks_by_user_Batman2005_and_bad-faith_edits_by_Moe_Epsilon" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> You'll notice that "The King of Kings" "Teresa Knott" "Calton" and "Petros" all supported (petros after suggesting I tone it down, which I did), while only Paul Cyr did not and one guy put a thing about free speech, there'a 4-1 consensus there that a page...which at that time was much more inflammatory was FINE. Now, i'll wait for you to apologize about calling me a liar. I'm sure you won't do that though, as you are incapable of admitting you're wrong. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatman2005_c25f.html" title="User:Batman2005">Batman2005</a> 16:42, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>did you not say 2 months ago? That was only 3 1/2 weeks ago. Oh you did "<b>Because it was two months ago on this very page</b>" <i>Joturner commented on the part that was deleted, if you read his comment you'll see that</i> and he also commented on the dead to me section, go back and read it. That entire long comment is his. He's commented on both content that was removed and content that is still there. Calton didn't support you on that. He said the content may or may not be appropriate. Petros also suggested you tone it down, so while he didn't believe you violated a policy, he also didn't feel your content was appropriate either. so that drops it down to 2 support, 2 opposed and a neutral. and Sean Black clearly disagreed with what you had on your page, so thats actually a 2 support to 3 opposed and 1 neutral tally. You had no concensus previously. adding the new count, it is now 4 support, 6 opposed 1 neutral and again a concensus for removal. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 16:52, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Did you not say you went back to March 1st and couldn't find it? Seems like you still called me a liar. You're clearly changing things around to fit what you want it to say, I will not change my page just because you are tallying the votes up so that no matter what they fit your pov. You are, like I said, engaging in your personal ethics war on this page and I think its ridiculous. I imagine you're familiar with "wikipedia is not a democracy" your simple voting method that you seem to think should be used (even though you're interpreting the votes to fit whatever you want them to say). You were proven wrong, there was a consensus the last time, you STILL cannot accept that, which is both hilarious and ridiculous. I don't, for the life of me understand, how you can say that sean black "clearly disagreed with what i had on my page" when he simply said "<i>Incorrect. There is no right to free speech on Wikipedia. If you wish to publish material espousing your political/social/economic/sexual/religous viewpoints, go elsewhere.-Sean Black</i>" There's nothing on my page about my views on any of those things. Once again you change things around to fit your pov. I think that throughout this entire process you have been both insulting and incivil, as such unless you have anything positive to offer to this discussion (which you have shown you do not) then I suggest you go edit elsewhere and stop trying to push your ethics and values on others. There is no consensus to delete as you falsely claim, i'm sorry you can't understand that. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatman2005_c25f.html" title="User:Batman2005">Batman2005</a> 17:02, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thats right, because obviously I skipped a couple of archives. Why would I search last weeks archive? or the last 4 weeks of archives, when you told me it was 2 months ago? I assumed good faith and that you would not mislead me on the time frame. I dropped in about a month ago on both archives and started going back. There was a concensus last time, it was for the removal of the material. You only changed it around to fit what you wanted to believe. Sean Black stated that that material wasn't appropriate on wikipedia and if you wanted to write those things you should take it elsewhere. You're writing those things, so they're not appropriate here. Kevin Federline being a douche is a social viewpoint. That frat being gay, is a social viewpoint. Who you want to have sex with, is a sexual viewpoint. There is a concensus to clean up the material. You choosing to ignore that, doesn't make it any less true. Your talk page speaks to your uncivil behaviour, your behaviour in this discussion also speaks to that. Your userpage is an extension of that behaviour. Telling people to go locate the evidence to support your point of view because you don't want to is uncivil. Assuming bad faith is uncivil, which you've done and indicated you don't care about. You've also broken WP:OWN by claiming that the page will not change. The concensus is there, the policies and guideline broken have been clearly spelled out for you. In spite of all your uncivil behaviour I'm going to assume good faith and leave you to clean it up appropriately.

You are NOT the wikipedia final authority as much as you would apparently like to be. You and Ian do not constitute a consensus, I'm sorry you can't understand that. You're right, I don't care about assuming bad faith with you as you've repeatedly done so with me, you called me a liar, you proceeded to lecture me on wikipedia policy as if you were the one who wrote it. You are not a better person regardless of how much you continuously try to place yourself as one. You've spent this entire conversation lecturing as if you're a parent disciplining a small child. You are uncivil and your proposal to censor my userpage based on your own interpretation of the rule is more damaging to wikipedia than anything I have ever done here. I have been supported in this in the past, yet once again you ignore that. Like I said, i suggest you go and edit elsewhere if you don't like my page, wikipedia is not run by you and you do not constitute the final say, this is an ongoing discussion and will continue to be so, as is, there is no consensus, a consensus is not simply a majority vote (were that the case my page would still remain as i have the consensus...its ok though, i know you'll disagree and change things around to fit your pov again). <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatman2005_c25f.html" title="User:Batman2005">Batman2005</a> 17:55, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>Several admins have been deleting and/or changing the <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a> redirect so it no longer redirects to <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> and instead redirects to an article such as <a href="../../../r/e/s/Research.html" title="Research">research</a>. The reason <a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde">User:Cyde</a> wishes to change the article is b/c Wikipedia should "NEVER allow a cross-namespace redirect to squat on what could be a legitimate encyclopedic page." I personally disagree with this b/c the redirect has been around for more than two years and is linked to by well over 1000 talk pages. In addition, there is no obvious article that the redirect is squatting on. That said, I am willing to go with whatever the consensus decides to do.</p>
<p>I tried to start a discussion about this at <a href="../../../o/r/i/Talk%7EOriginal_research_d9ae.html" title="Talk:Original research">Talk:Original research</a> but another admin has also deleted the article. I've reverted it yet again but have no wish to start a wheel-war over this. Since a bunch of admins are involved in this, can we get other admin opinions.

I personally agree that cross namespace redirects should be kept to a n absolute minimum and certainly not exist for a term which has a strong context outside of wikipedia like <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">Original research</a> does. Length of time of existance I can't see as relevant, we wouldn't allow OR itself to remain in an article just because it's been there a long time etc. etc. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User%7EPgk_d0c7.html" title="User:Pgk">Pgk</a> 13:58, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, changing to an appropriate redirect doesn't require an AfD. But admins keep deleting the redirect (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Undelete&amp;target=Original_research" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Undelete&amp;target=Original_research" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>) am I wrong in believing this is no justified reason for deleting the redirect without an AfD? As for changing the redirect to another redirect or an article, consensus should be gained before doing that.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlabamaboy_1073.html" title="User:Alabamaboy">Alabamaboy</a> 14:00, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm quite familiar with <a href="../../../a/s/r/WP%7EASR_31e6.html" title="WP:ASR">WP:ASR</a>. The problem is that there will now be over 1000 talk pages linking to a wrong place.

<p>The approach taken by a small set of admins in dealing with cross-namespace redirects appears to be as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Delete them and hope no admin notices enough to restore it;</li>
<li>If anyone notices, delete it again;</li>
<li>Tell the restoring admin how stupid they are, with the additional use of profanity to help make things clear;</li>
<li>If they still notice, change its target;</li>
<li>If someone changes you back, change it again;</li>
<li>Tell the editor how stupid they are, with the additional use of profanity to help make things clear;</li>
<li>Regularly cite a policy which doesn't exist (ASR is only a style guideline) in support of your various actions;</li>
<li>Iterate until RfC.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now will one of the editors in question (Cyde would be a good candidate) tell me why this is the optimal way to approach this situation? -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> - <a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">tk</a> 14:32, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This appears (partly) to be a problem looking for a solution: What shall my bot do now? There also appear to have some difficulty understanding the difference between policy and guideline. Some things which <i>should</i> be Wikipedia 101: A) Don't do controversial changes <i>en mass</i>. B) Don't insult people who complain. C) Engage in productive dialog that supports your edits.

<dd>LOL, nice attempt at slandering my motivations, but if you actually look at my actions you'll see that I've been trying to push the redirect fixes off on other people because I don't want to deal with the hassle. Ditto for everyone else, actually (I think Gurch eventually got roped into doing some).

<p>I can't really see what the problem is here.

Just fix all the internal redirects and delete the redundant main-namespace redirect.

<p>what Tony said, and use a bot. But be more laid back about these things, please! It doesn't need to be fixed by tomorrow, and there is no need to wheel-war about it! For the time being, you can {{<a href="../../../s/o/f/Template%7ESoftredirect_9efe.html" title="Template:Softredirect">softredirect</a>}} it, perhaps making it a dab page. There is no <i>need</i> for an <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a> article or redirect (nothing should link there), because the term is tautological (all research is 'original' at the time it is done, otherwise it wouldn't be research but citation, although it may of course transpire later that the same result had been found before). <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 21:24, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I strongly favour Dbachmann's approach. We should avoid redirecting common English phrases that aren't Wikipedia specific to project space, and the links to it need to be fixed, preferably in an automated manner. Meanwhile, create <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a>, and put links to <a href="../../../r/e/s/Research.html" title="Research">research</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> on it.

Personally, I don't have an issue with deleting the redirects. What I have an issue with are admins who ignore calls for consensus, initiate personal attacks when someone asks why they are doing something, and also don't follow the guidelines for deleting redirects. As admins we are supposed to follow Wikipedia guidelines and policies, not do as we wish merely b/c it is too troublesome to bother with said guidelines and policies.

<dd>As one of the older folks, I must say Splash's characterization seems most accurate. We've had these things for ages, but suddenly they must all go, go overnight, and anyone who disagrees is screamed at. That's not good practice. It's not how we "make an encyclopedia," either. It's how we pitch a fit. No one likes to have a fit pitched at him unless he has a bat in his hand. Now, cut it the heck out. Get your guideline made policy by consensus, after plenty of discussion, then get a solution in place other than "Whoopsie, it went away," and then unleash your bots. Otherwise, it's that moronic "I have 85,000,000 edits to pages I have never read" impulse that's making writing anything impossible. (Try linking to a month somewhere because you want people to read up on the month. I'll bet it'll be unlinked within a week by some helpful bot.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 17:10, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It would be very nice to get a new operator or a replacement bot, since manually archiving frequently used pages every day by the date of the last post in a discussion is rather tedious. Maybe the bot should be unblocked for at least a few days so that we can explore our options. The pages that it archives will fill up pretty fast. Finding orphaned AfD nominations with it was very helpful as well, but it looks like it hasn't been doing that for a while. I don't know how orphaned nominations are identified now, or if it is done on a systematic basis at all, so restarting that might be good, too. Whoever decides to try to make contact should probably trying emailing him, since he doesn't seem to be checking his talk page. I'd go for it, but I don't understand all of the technical aspects of bots. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 19:27, 2 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sasquatch, again I have no problem with the nomination. My only problem is with the continuous disrespect for our procedures. I clean up after him all the time. Haham hanuka has been told hundreds of times not just to drop AfD templates, cleanup templates, expand templates, POV templates and other templates. All these require some work, something he seems not to be interested in. He just continues to attack all those around him, vandalizing, lazy-dropping templates, falsely quoting consensuses, pushing POV, recreating deleted articles in AfDs, as if nobody is talking to him and nobody is out there. The Wikipedia in his mother tongue has banned him forever, I think it is time to consider the same. <a href="../../../g/i/d/User%7EGidonb_d5ad.html" title="User:Gidonb">gidonb</a> 00:03, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am involved in a content dispute at <a href="../../../a/s/s/Association_of_British_Drivers_3d1e.html" title="Association of British Drivers">Association of British Drivers</a>. This group campaigns actively against "inappropriate" (in the eyes of the speeders) enforcement of speed limits, asserts that car ownership should be more affordable, and claims that fuel taxation is too high.</p>
<p>In the section on criticisms of ABD we have the following facts, cited from reliable sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>Taxation per car in the UK is around the European average, similar to France and Italy, higher than Germany, much lower than the Netherlands or Ireland (<a href="http://www.cfit.gov.uk/factsheets/02/index.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cfit.gov.uk/factsheets/02/index.htm" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>). Comparing individual elements of motoring taxation, such as fuel duty, between countries is of questionable relevance, as different countries strike different balances between fuel duty, vehicle excise duty and road tolls.</li>
<li>The overall cost of motoring in Britain in 2003 was below the 1980 level in real terms, although the real cost of fuel was 7% higher, and bus and coach fares rose by 34% and rail fares by 36% in real terms over the same period<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>. According to the RAC Foundation the major cost of motoring is the capital and depreciation costs of the vehicle, with fuel costs and excise duty being around one third of the cost of running a small car<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup>.</li>
<li>ABD claim they are opposed to <i>inappropriate</i> automated speed limit enforcement, but this is widely seen as opposition to <i>all</i> automated speed limit enforcement, or even that they actually oppose speed limits. There is robust <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speed_Limit_79b4.html#safety" title="Speed Limit">evidence</a> that reducing speeds reduces both the incidence and the severity of collisions.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../../../d/e/f/User%7EDeFacto_97f0.html" title="User:DeFacto">User:DeFacto</a> is generally a decent chap, but insists on removing these as he asserts the link between these criticisms and the stated policy of ABD is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. I disagree, and the comments have been in there a while.</p>

<dd>Converting to PDF would be a good idea, because of the fonts; not everyone might have the same fonts you used, while they would be embedded on the PDF. --<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesarB_5f7f.html" title="User:CesarB">cesarb</a> 20:44, 3 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It uses Verdana and Times New Roman, which all computers should have. I tried to install CutePDF Writer but I'm having problems right now. Sorry =( --<a href="../../../m/b/o/User%7EMboverload_cce2.html" title="User:Mboverload">mboverload</a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Mboverload_00ae.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Mboverload"><font color="red">@</font></a> 20:49, 3 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Converted it to PDF without problem with Open Office. I suggest you to install PDFCreator, which installs a virtual printer. Then open your document, print it, and select the virtual PDF writer as printer. That would generate the PDF version. -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 21:04, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
