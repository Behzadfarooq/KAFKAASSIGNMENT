<p>Numerous incidents involving gross incivility on the IRC channel have been brought to the Arbitration Committee's attention. We consider such behavior absolutely unacceptable; to ensure that it does not continue, we have worked with the leadership of the IRC channels to appoint additional channel ops, with a specific mandate to keep Wikimedia IRC channels polite and courteous. Behavior on the IRC channel may be taken into consideration with respect to arbitration cases if it results in disruption on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> for the Arbitration Committee 01:54, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not enough. The worst offenders are themselves chanops, as demonstrated by logs submitted to the ArbCom. IMO, their removal from the channel is the very least the ArbCom needs to do for the abused community and mistreated individuals. (The fact that the chanops in question are not actually admins should make the removal all the simpler.) What I see in Fred's message, however is <b>not even a proposal to remove their chanop privileges.</b> Are you serious? <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 02:14, 16 January 2007 (UTC).

<dd>Indeed. Without some community involvement regarding who the IRC chanops are, this is unlikely to make much difference.

<p>I'm afraid, when arbcom have constantly declined to address rank and obvious incivility on-wiki, they forfeit all credibility in any attempt to extend themselves into IRC. Send out out strong signals that incivility stops on-wiki and perhaps that will filter through to IRC.

<dd>That's no different to the claim "we have article X which is clearly rubbish, so we cannot delete article Y" often raised by n00bs at AfD.

<dd>how often have they been presented with on-wiki incivility to deal with it, though?

<p>Why is the issue actually being raised here, in full public view, and not in private with the parties concerned though&#160;? There's already enough disruption on-wiki concerning IRC channels (and this channel in particular) and as nobody outwith the sysop pool (and a few selected others, I'm led to believe) can see what goes on in that channel, posting about it here is perhaps a little overly transparent. I heartily support any promotion of civility however. <span style="font-family: Verdana; color:#FF0000">--Kind Regards - <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHeligoland_92a7.html" title="User:Heligoland">Heligoland</a> <sup><a href="../../../h/e/l/User_talk%7EHeligoland_4c54.html" title="User talk:Heligoland">(Talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Heligoland_a022.html" title="Special:Contributions/Heligoland">(Contribs)</a></sup></span> 02:20, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Maybe we should work to fix incivility on-wiki too.

<p>I find a regulation of off-wiki activities by a panel with jurisdiction ONLY over this wiki somewhat disturbing. — <b><a href="../../../w/e/r/User%7EWerdna_2947.html" title="User:Werdna">Werdna</a></b> <i><a href="../../../w/e/r/User_talk%7EWerdna_0e10.html" title="User talk:Werdna">talk</a></i> 02:40, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>They aren't claiming jurisdiction, note Fred says they have been working with the IRC leadership. They are simply stating that IRC activity may be considered in on-wiki cases if it is relevant. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_wub_6388.html" title="User:The wub">the wub</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_wub_1807.html" title="User talk:The wub"><font color="green">"?!"</font></a> 02:48, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm sorry but why is this being discussed <i>now</i>? Efforts have been made in the past few weeks to put a stop to whatever negative activities are occuring in the channel. Frankly, I think most of us support the shutdown of the channel entirely, rather than creating more mess with the same parties, which is what's happening right now. —<b><a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilotguy_59e8.html" title="User:Pilotguy"><font color="#00FFFF">P</font></a><a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilotguy_59e8.html" title="User:Pilotguy">ilotguy</a> (<a href="../../../p/i/l/User_talk%7EPilotguy_51fb.html" title="User talk:Pilotguy">ptt</a>)</b> 02:43, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Whether it is shut down or not, the behavior we are trying to stop can easily continue through other means if people really want to do things subtly, but nonetheless I think that shutting the channel down is a poor move. The channel has its uses for immediate issues and things that require administrator intervention. Rooting out the behavior that would not be suitable even on-wiki is definitely a positive step in making the channel more useful so that there is less cause for disruption in the future, though. <a href="../../../c/o/w/User%7ECowman109_5ea9.html" title="User:Cowman109"><font color="DarkGreen">Cowman109</font></a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/w/User_talk%7ECowman109_260b.html" title="User talk:Cowman109">Talk</a></sup> 02:49, 16 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Possibly, but discussing administrator intervention issues there is what started all this in the first place. Sensitive foundation/WP:BIO stuff can find a new home, sometimes it's easier to shut something down and start over then trying to fix ongoing systemic problems. But maybe all it needs is an influx of new users/admins with these conversations in mind. <a href="../../../r/x/_/User%7ERx_StrangeLove_2537.html" title="User:Rx StrangeLove">RxS</a> 03:16, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>IRC comes up from time to time...buried in <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> archives. Some admins are firm believers in it, some editors (mostly non-admins) are vocal against it, and others such as myself qualify to join but decline to do so. The civility aspect dovetails with another recent hot button topic not necessarily confined to IRC. On January 5 I set off a firestorm (quite inadvertently) after I left a civility warning on another admin's talk page. If I'd anticipated how heated some reactions would be I would have handled the situation with greater circumspection, yet the admin I warned wasn't offended and two other editors awarded me barnstars. It sprouted some threads in my most recent user talk archive and the top of my current page if you're curious. <font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charge</a></i></sup></font> 03:12, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>This is not sufficient, in my view. Lest I be counted merely among the "burn it down" camp, let me delineate:
<ol>
<li><i>Additional</i> ops would be enough if there were a suggestion that there were too few. In fact, in this case, the ones with "ops" have been implicated several times in the incivility.</li>
<li><i>Additional</i> ops are also not going to answer the glaring problem that <i>at least</i> two people with "ops" are not administrators on en.wikipedia. One of these was implicated in using that IRC channel inappropriately in September of 2006 and then again in December 2006. This is not a one time problem but a serial problem with two or three people.</li>
<li>The channel still has no justification, as it is populated by non-administrators as well as being a place only a small fraction of en. administrators ever go.</li>
<li>The channel will not be <i>capable</i> of behaving properly unless the people with control of it understand what it is that they have done that is not proper. So far as I have seen or heard, they still are in the dark about how calling for someone to be "killed, slowly" is bad, and there is no hope at all for them to understand how "let's start a pool on when X will be banned" is improper.</li>
<li>The central problem remains undefined. If no one knows what "civility" means, then we're going to have more boots and blocks for someone using a wordy dird while detailed character assassination is cheered on. There is no actual guideline yet for the ops or users to employ for determining when they're acting improperly. In fact, one of the most hostile and reductive and bullying editors I've encountered is up above crying about on-wiki "civility" not being enforced. Obviously, what he means and what Fred means, and what I mean, are different things. He seems to hyperventilate about calling a he a she or a jerk an ass, while I care about trying to get people blocked so that their voices are no longer heard.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>I do think the whole thing should be disbanded, as I cannot see any room for it to <i>help</i> Wikipedia and built in ways for it to damage Wikipedia, but that would be merely philosophical if it weren't for the fact that ArbCom cannot act here and now because the people "in charge" are the people in the dock. They do not admit wrong, cannot conceive that they could be wrong, and will therefore not do anything differently, especially in the long term. If this is merely round two of a three round fight, if we have to wait for yet another horrendous case of star chamber blocks and rallying to destroy users, then that's a disgrace that proves that it's not what you do, but who you know. Incidentally, that is the charge trolls make all the time, and it's disgusting that we would make them right. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:29, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Geogre, I think it's apparent that there <i>isn't</i> a definition of civility that everyone agrees on. Your comment above, "a he a she or a jerk an ass," illustrates the problem nicely. You didn't think anything of it, and still don't, but several people regarded it as one of the meanest, nastiest things ever said by one user about another, <i>and the fact that you don't agree does not for one moment diminish the effect that it had.</i> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 03:51, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>And, on the other hand, many people see absolutely nothing wrong with spending hours talking about users who aren't present and talking about how they're all "idiots" and how they should be banned. They see nothing wrong with it still. So, if we were to balance out the two, where would we be: one person saying, of another who says frequently that she is pleased to be able to identify either way, one particular thing about gendered speech, versus three sitting about every night with an enemies list and coordinating provocations, blocks, and actions to generate a ban? You're right, Mackensen, I don't see that there is any comparison at all. One is <i>being disagreeable</i> and the other is <i>trying to interrupt Wikipedia.</i> One is where all sides may defend themselves (or take revenge, which seems to be the preferred reaction), and the other is where only like-voices can be heard as revenge. That you could be such a blushing violet and see these as anything like the same is strange to me, you are correct. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:11, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Geogre, you seem to be taking the same line that Giano is: incivility on the encyclopedia is justified by perceived off-wiki conspiracies. Let's say you're right, just for the sake of the argument: Kelly Martin and other persons are conspiring to drive you and Giano off the encyclopedia. How does that, in any way, justify you making the aforementioned statement? An eye for an eye, Geogre? If I allege an off-wiki conspiracy against me by User X, on flimsy evidence, may I start trash-talking them in public? <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 13:30, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, Mackensen, I'm trying to illustrate to you the difference between being unpleasant (me) and disliking someone (as I do) and character assassination with the intent of blocking. I am justified in calling you a worm, if I want. That's my opinion, to which I am entitled. I would probably <i>hope</i> that you would be affronted, but I would have no expectation that you'd <i>block</i> for that, as <b>no policy</b> says that anyone may be blocked for expressing an unpleasant opinion. On the other hand, if I spend hours with only my friends in Wikipedia Divine Actions IRC, and we talk non-stop about how horrible Mackensen is, how he lies all the time, how he spends all his time complaining, how he's corrupt, how he's a hypocrit, etc., and then, when new people come in, that's all they see. If they protest, we all take turns telling that person that she should not be at our channel, because she may get blocked. Now, suppose, Mackensen, that you actually saw a log of that. How would you feel if I got sanctimonious about it? How would you feel if I threatened to block you (or did it) for telling anyone about the log? As for me, let them conspire. They've been doing it, and they'll do it still. I'm a big boy and am not threatened by pufferfish. The issue is much more concrete, much more precise. We are all free to be unpleasant, disagreeable, cantankerous, and ill humored, but we are <b>not free to conspire to block</b> other users. Or, in simpler words: we have to obey policy, not our inner rage. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 00:13, 17 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, call me a worm if you like. That's not very collegial but I suppose if it floats your boat I won't argue. I wouldn't block you either, but I might start bringing up next time you ran for arbcom. I don't like civility blocks, and I'm on the record stating this numerous times, so let's move on. For all I know there are IRC channels where my name is mud; certainly there are talk pages on this encyclopedia that fit said description. I can't say that those bother me either. People of sound judgment can tell the difference between intelligent criticism and prattle, and I know whose opinion I value. Now, as it happens, I've been in a position where private evidence of someone bad-mouthing me was presented to me. I didn't do anything about it because frankly I didn't give a good damn. You're quite right that we have to obey policy. Last I looked <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> was a policy, although not one with much weight any more. You talk about character assassination: why don't you look down below, where Giano is making slanderous remarks.

<p>The arbcom has discussed this at great length. Clearly there is a problem. However, with an issue this complex, involving this many actors, there is no solution that will please everyone. On one extreme is people who advocate shutting the channel down, and on the other is people who advocate doing nothing. I think the solution Fred mentioned - working with the structures currently in place to enforce civility in the channel - is a fair compromise. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> 03:40, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You joke, but I'm left with the impression that some people think just that. That's what happens when you cherry-pick from a log file.

<dd>(edit conflict, replying to Mackensen at 04:00) Thankfully, my knowledge about IRC is limited to <i>/connect</i>, <i>/join</i>, <i>/alias</i> and <i>/quit</i>, so I am pretty neutral here. Hmm... I once tried to download some movie through a channel, but it said something about being at position 5,000 in a queue, and after half an hour I was 7,000, so I turned the computer off and bought the DVD.</dd>
<dd>I know IRC is necessary to discuss in real time, but undoubtedly, it creates a separation between administrators, just like <a href="../../../a/d/m/Category%7EAdministrators_open_to_recall_309a.html" title="Category:Administrators open to recall">Category:Administrators open to recall</a>. There are those that can/want to connect through IRC, and those that can't/won't. It is inevitable. Even I feel that difference when someone reports a user at AIV stating "sockpuppet of blocked XXX", and when reviewing XXX's block, I find a "[Un]blocked per IRC talk" or similar. However, I must assume good faith, especially without logs. Others just can't (because of personal experience or anything), and raise in arms. It is a real pity that we do not have a <a href="../../../i/r/c/Special%7EIrclogs_1415.html" title="Special:Irclogs">Special:Irclogs</a> where to check the public conversations in the channels, available only for admins, that would make things much clearer for everyone. -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 04:20, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>There's the rub: you don't why an administrator is acting <i>period</i>, regardless of what discussion took place. Even when an administrator cites a specific policy, it still came down to the functioning of various processes in his or her head. There's a thousand IRC channels out there, and most of them prohibit logging. It only comes up with #wikipedia-en-admins because a) some things said there really aren't for public consumption because there are privacy issues, and b) the relative size makes it possible to enforce the rule. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 04:25, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Of course! However, if an off-wiki action (as in, a IRC chat) brings a on-wiki reaction (in example, blocking a user), I think it would be just to include at least some information about that, just like you would point to the AFD when deleting an article, or the external link when deleting a copyvio. Ok, so full logging is not a solution, but at least consider some way of IRC board where to post the juicy parts (as in, the statements that were used to build consensus about something). We can quote an AFD, a URL or a report, we can even quote a mail to the mailing list, but we can't quote an IRC conversation? As I said, I assume good faith even though a vandal has broken two test4 warnings. However, others are less patient, and you need to comprehend them. I would even say that everyone's priority is to open the process as much as possible. -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 04:42, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, as I've said before, I see no reason to invoke IRC <i>at all</i>; every administrator is responsible for what they do. Heck, every editor is responsible for every edit they make. Whether it was discussed on IRC or not is frankly beside the point. Anyone should be able to give a rational accounting of their actions. The problem is that the mention of IRC often leads to an assumption of bad faith--not always, but it happens. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 04:46, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It is not that different from, in example, asking to review a block here, is it? I mean, some users may bring a review here (like <a href="#1_month_block_of_88.104.202.232" title="">#1 month block of 88.104.202.232</a>), others may feel more comfortable with reviewing there. You are right, if you do something, you take responsibility. But if they can't and use some IRC chat as justification, that chat should be made public.</dd>

<li>First of all, #wikipedia-en-admins is the only channel under consideration here. Latent abuses in other channels remain unexplored pending someone of importance getting wronged in one of them (no, I'm not being sarcastic, I'm quite serious about that). New chanops for #wikipedia-en-admins are: FloNight, David Gerard, Mackensen, Morven, Uninvited Company and Dmcdevit (thereabouts, anyway). JamesF, as I understand it, is controller of at least all English-language channels because of chaos at freenode following <a href="../../../r/o/b/Rob_Levin_472a.html" title="Rob Levin">Rob Levin</a>'s death. There're numerous chanops on #wikipedia, too many to list here. The information is publicly accessible if anyone wants it.

<li>Mackensen, a minor point about your list of 16 #en-admins chanops above. You say that the list "includes" these people; does that mean it's incomplete? I ask because a couple of weeks ago I was kickbanned from the channel by somebody who's not on the list. I won't inflame matters here by naming him, but you certainly know who I mean. Was he an op? Or temporarily opped in order to kick me? Is he an op today? I'm over it, but the action was random and remains unexplained, so I think the answers are of some general interest. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 06:13, 16 January 2007 (UTC).</li>

<p>Well, I am glad to see other syops on the channel will have the ability to boot those that are being incivil, but what level of incivility is needed before this happens? The problem as I see it has less to do with incivility than with the channels being used to speak a bit too openly about other editors...that should be reserved for private email only. I recognize that IRC would have usefulness if the sole purpose was to expedite a block on a troll, but all decisions to make blocks on established editors should be determined by consensus on wiki, not off it....so what pupose does it serve?

<dd>The "Chatting vs. Encyclopedia-writing" argument is moot on IRC. IRC <i>is</i> for discussion of all types, and WMF has nothing to do with Freenode. Those who use IRC are not using Wikipedia as a chat forum, they're using <a href="../../../i/r/c/IRC_b274.html" title="IRC">IRC</a> as a chat forum, whose initials, by the way, stand for "Internet Relay Chat". —<a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell"><b><font color="#333333">bbatsell</font></b></a> <a href="../../../b/b/a/User_talk%7EBbatsell_7978.html" title="User talk:Bbatsell"><font color="#C46100" size="1">¿?</font></a> 06:45, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, but the chatting has led to blockings and has led to reverting blocks made by established admins and has led to formulating abuses that have taken place on wiki on established editors.

<dd>I'm sure it has. But it's very easy to pick out singular events that happen every so often, paint all of IRC with the same brush, and in so doing lose sight of what actually happens the majority of the time, which is positive discussion. I know that I personally have been talked down from blocks that I was ready to make when I asked for second opinions, I know that discussions take place that are very positive. I know that sometimes it's okay for someone who has been blocked to be able to get on IRC, get a one-on-one chat with an admin, and explain their side of the story that often doesn't come out on-wiki. The {{<a href="../../../u/n/b/Template%7EUnblock_0164.html" title="Template:Unblock">unblock</a>}} template is great but sometimes it isn't very conducive to an in-depth review of a block. If an unblock happens based on that discussion, then it is absolutely the responsibility of the unblocking admin to monitor their contributions to ensure that they were not being disingenuous on IRC. Admins make mistakes, and discussions about what we do or about Wikipedia process or about the general goings-on can almost never be bad, in my humble opinion. I guess I just don't see the basis for the "OMG EVIL!" attitudes that some people (not you, MONGO) harbor towards IRC. Do people sometimes get into heated discussions? Sure, I got into one last night. Do sometimes administrators make bad judgments? Of course, that's true with or without IRC. I just think that people are looking at a very tiny subset of what goes on and are ignoring what goes on 99% of the time, which is very positive for Wikipedia. Anyway, just my $0.02.

<li>My experiance with the plain olde #wikipedia channel is almost universally positive: People collaberating on articles, rational discussions of policy interpretation, etc. When the atmosphere turns poisonious there are enough people around to either tell the person to can it or for the offender to get the boot. (Once it was me, and I deserved it.) #admins I <a href="../../../l/u/r/Lurk.html" title="Lurk">lurk</a> in all the time, and the ratio is reversed: There are too many like-minded people there, and the toxicity gets multiplied. I have never, not even on one occasion, seen anything discussed there that would not have gotten a better airing on the main channel.

<li>Fred Bauder says "Numerous incidents involving gross incivility on the IRC channel have been brought to the Arbitration Committee's attention. We consider such behaviour absolutely unacceptable; to ensure that it does not continue, we have worked with the leadership of the IRC channels to appoint additional channel ops" Fred gives sufficient reasons for closing down the channel but then shows the complete lack of understanding of the problem by failing to say that some of the existing channel ops are not only the worst offenders but at least one is a member of the arbcom. He then goes on to say "we have worked with the leadership of the IRC channels " again the self proclaimed owner of the channel; is not only a member of the arbcom, but yes, you've guessed it - one of the worst offenders. Well done Fred we yet again see that this arbcom is beyond redemption. However, I am glad that after so long of being told by Wikipedia's hierarchy that I am imagining these things, they do now seem to be completely unacceptable gross incivility even though the IRC logs show them to be far more serious. Bullying and intimidation are just two words which immediately spring to mind. It should also be remembered that the deplorable events which have been permitted on IRC (certainly in my own experience) are 100% to blame for any incivility which has happened on-wiki. However I must be careful what I say or Fred, Jim and Dm will be RFArbing me again for even thinking such things. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_II_8fcc.html" title="User:Giano II">Giano</a> 12:04, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Of course it's fair to add more channel ops to combat incivility and personal attacks, but if some of the older channel ops are in fact party to making those attacks, it makes a lot of sense to replace them with friendlier ops.

<li>Sorry, but this would seem to be wikidrama for the sake of it. Is there a point to this wikidrama? Is there a point to the admins channel? If something needs sorting out, AN and ANI exist for a reason. If something needs sorting out privately or you want a private opinion, as MONGO pointed out email should be perfectly adequate. If you are worried about privacy, IRC will hardly assuage your worries, as there would seem to be log leaks left, right, and centre. Does and has the admins channel caused harm, problems, and unnecessary wikidrama? That does not seem to be in dispute. The obvious solution is to nuke the admins channel and every other Wikipedia IRC channel with the exceptions of #wikipedia and #wikipedia-en, where on occasion I have had some enjoyable conversations that have benefited the encyclopedia. That will certainly put a stop to the wikidrama. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoreschi_31bb.html" title="User:Moreschi">Moreschi</a> <sup><a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Deletionism_9106.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Deletionism">Deletion!</a></sup> 13:26, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Mackensen, some of your arbcom colleagues have had a fee pass for far too long. I concur with Moreschi, any new channel ops will still be under the old disgraceful management? The arbcom's credibility can only be restored if this channel is abolished and its self proclaimed owner de-sysoped for bringing Wikipedia into disrepute along with the other admins involved. It must be remembered that leading members of the arbcom have known and approved of this deplorable situation for years.

<dl>
<dd>First, Mackensen is arguing pretty vociferously, and he's one of the ops for the channel, so I'm not sure he's uninvolved. There are so many bad arguments being made that it's hard to know where to start.
<ol>
<li>First, is there "cherry picking logs?" What is the difference between "cherry picking logs" and "citing evidence?" Of <b>course</b> you're going to "cherry pick" because you're going to cite the dang evidence. The&#160;:15 when no one is there is not going to be cited. Sheesh. That's a Karl Rove like argument. The point is that the abuse is taking place by the same few people, who are chanops, on several occasions and <i>arguably</i> regularly. The evidence is clear enough for "several occasions," and "regularly" is what's in dispute.</li>
<li>That it's the same few people no one seems inclined to discuss. That these people <i>are not administrators</i> is similarly not being argued. As far as "giving up" status and having it stripped goes, an ArbCom decision said that Kelly Martin "left under a cloud." It <i>demoted</i> Tony Sidaway. Both are at en.admins.irc, and Greg Maxwell is simply not an administrator at en.wikipedia. He's a meta administrator, but I'm not aware of his being an admin at en.wikipedia at any point. However, people who give up their status <i>give up their status,</i> and being at that cursed channel is part of the status. If it's not, then why not open the channel to people who <i>one day will be</i> administrators along with people who once upon a time were administrators? I'm not being vindictive, here: it's simply built into the very definition of the thing. The arguments for its creation were that administrators needed to speak of sensitive materials. Well, why? So they could act. These people who are not administrators can't act. This isn't me being petty: I never supported segregating the beautiful people from the hoi poloi, but it's what the channel was supposed to do.</li>
<li>Go where the people are is, in fact, the critical feature. Admins are all over the regular wikipedia irc channel. Go there, because there are enough people there to turn the conversation away from abuse. In fact, the admins.irc channel is nasty precisely because it's <i>not</i> where The People are, but where only a small group is from time to time. The more populated the channel, the less commonly it goes into abuse. Every log I have seen of abuse has been when there are few people there, mostly like-minded about the central issue that admins are superior to users, that "clueful" people run things. They are philosophically inclined to believe it their right and responsibility to do what's "right" without policy.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Finally, the people are the problem, but the medium gives them their freedom to abuse. It's like LSD: the sane people will have a slight entertainment, while the mentally unstable will make a very bad trip. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:29, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>First, Geogre, if you'd read the discussion you'd note that I'm a newly-appointed chanop, which makes me part of the solution, not part of the problem (note: this presupposes that the arbcom is sane). I don't appreciate the comparison to Karl Rove and wonder whether it was necessary. I mean, you score some points but it hardly helps matters. I say "cherry-picking" because there's an indictment on the channel as a whole based on the selected behaviour of individuals. That does not make sense. As you rightly note, certain individuals are the problem. That's cause for individual condemnation, not some broad-based approach. If you're going to indict the "medium," you have to actually <i>prove</i> that the medium is corrupt; to assert it is simply not enough. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 14:54, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

</dd>
<dd>I'm sorry you don't appreciate the comparison to Rove, but it's a <i>Rove argument.</i> It's exactly the kind of rhetorical flourish he's famous for. When evidence is presented of abuse, he says, "They cherry picked it." Well, how much would it take? The reason this is an issue, to answer the question the people who haven't followed all of this keep asking, is that <i>on-wiki actions</i> have been orchestrated on the "invisible" and unaccountable medium of that IRC channel. Each one of these actions has been quickly, if not instantly, reversed, but they just keep coming. Yes, the people are this problem, but there remains no rationale for the channel that shows any advantage to Wikipedia. What <i>purpose</i> does it have? What purpose does it actually <i>serve</i> that is not better served by media already in place that are already regulated, like AN/I? I asked that question a month ago and, unless I'm really biased, didn't get an answer that stood up. If, therefore, we have people who have to be "worked with" to get permission to change that channel and if these very people are demonstrably problematic, then what the heck are we doing? This is especially the case if they violate the very elitism the channel was set up to create.</dd>
<dd>I've tried to be helpful, to offer positive solutions, as well as to condemn what exists now. My essay was an honest effort at working out the inherent strengths and weaknesses. Although some of my points are getting repeated, the hatred and scorn poured out on me by the problem users will prevent their ever admitting that there is a problem.</dd>
<dd>Finally, I remind you of what we're talking about here. The subtext is not "play nice." That's lily livered. The subtext is "don't team up to beat on people in a private clubhouse." It's <i>far</i> more pointed than someone like me being obnoxious to Kelly. It's about blocking. It's about harassing. It's about pretending to be powerful. It's about encouraging new administrators to run roughshod over the project because they are important people. It's about <i>learning to show some respect</i> for the people who make Wikipedia, as those people are not the chanops who spend their lives on IRC. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 00:02, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Geogre: Greg Maxwell is an admin on Commons. We need <i>as many</i> Commons admins in #admins as we can get. Yes, technically, English Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons are separate projects; in practice, they have a lot of related issues, and we frequently need actions taken on Commons (such as nuking shock images being used for vandalism). --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 14:35, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Some insight into the reasoning:</p>
<ul>
<li>the AC has no jurisdiction over #wikipedia-en-admins. Really, it doesn't.</li>
<li>The channel was originally set up as a hotline for admin help being requested, particularly by Jimbo or Danny, and it's damn useful for that.</li>
<li>It's not just for admins, it's for "trusted Wikipedians" of all sorts. There's Alphax on there as a Commons admin, Greg as a developer, etc. (That someone here may feel they have conclusive proof that a given chanop is a minion of Satan out to destroy Wikimedia is irrelevant to this - it's not yours to decide. I don't care. Really.) *and Greg is on as a Commons admin too, of course.</li>
<li>It's also a good place for admins to sanity-check their personal decisions (or find another admin to deal or not with a matter they feel would be a conflict of interest to deal with or whatever). I'd like it if all new admins were invited onto it and someone should write up some suitable how-to process page.</li>
<li>Many of the IRC logs received from the AC have clearly been edited and even when not don't include a metric shitload of off-channel communication that serves as context.</li>
<li>There are admins already avoiding the channel because the cries of the torch and pitchfork toting mob above are making them afraid of what people would do with an out-of-context quote. So the AC going over the last six months of logs sent in from viewers looking for people to bring the vengeance of the Lord down upon really just is not likely to happen.</li>
</ul>
<p>So the course of action chosen is to try to improve the tone of the place by leading from the front, hence the current /topic: speak like the person you're discussing is reading. And my frequent strong suggestions to behave better. YOU'RE ADMINS, DAMMIT, YOU WERE CHOSEN FOR YOUR GOOD JUDGEMENT. Mostly the channel shows that, by the way. Anyone characterising it as a festering snakepit that must be abolished is IMO smoking crack and I really can't take them seriously.</p>
<p>Note: I am an ex-arb and still on the AC list to <s>kibitz</s> advise. I have level 40 on #wikipedia-en-admins because Jdforrester landed it on me. I'm in there a bit lately, when I'm home and my laptop is on and I remember.</p>

<dd>Well, it's really very simple. It is said there are too much nasty remarks on the channel, and that the solution is to make more people channel ops. That makes sense. Then someone points out that the nasty remarks are in part made by the older channel ops. No solution for that has been proposed, but the obvious answer seems to be to de-op those. Note that I have never used the channel, nor do I believe it should be nuked. It's appears simply to be a case of two parties being incivil, and only one party being examined for that. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 14:14, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Any chanop is no more obliged to take an admin action than any particular en: admin is obliged to take an admin action, i.e. not at all. People should not be nasty on the channel because it's bad for what is after all supposed to be a working-space-with-chat rather than a cesspit being a working-space-with-chat rather than a cesspit; and I think I'm asking nothing unreasonable by asking admins to act with GOOD ADMIN JUDGEMENT AAARGH. You can indeed and James is actually pretty approachable (if busy) and not insane and stuff. Not only does the AC have no jurisdiction over the channel, the Wikimedia Foundation specificially disclaims jurisdiction over the #wikipedia-xxx channels for reasons of possible legal liability, so bitching about it here does nothing and annoys the pig. Being nasty anywhere that affects the wiki can be taken into account by the AC. The puppy eating contest is Thursday.

<p>A somewhat more-to-the-point explanation, perhaps: the operative issue here is David's first point. The ArbCom <i>does not have any power over the IRC channels</i>. We cannot shut them down; we cannot replace the ops; we cannot, as a group, force <i>anything</i> to happen on IRC (except insofar as some members of the Committee happen to be ops on some channels). The ArbCom simply lacks that ability, and no amount of indignation—justified or otherwise—is going to magically grant it to us.</p>
<p>(As for anyone wondering why there's no desysoppings, etc.: well, the ArbCom has decreed, in the past, that off-Wikipedia matters were not its concern. This is likely not to be the case in the future—hence Fred's note—but it would be quite crass of us to extend this retroactively to past events. Hindsight is 20/20, of course.)</p>
<p>(And, on a further note, for anyone wondering: no, the ArbCom does not have Secret All-Seeing IRC Logs(tm).) <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 15:12, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Without wishing to cast aspersions at any users with checkuser access, it is certainly possible for checkuser privileges to be abused. I understand that there has been at least one complaint regarding checkuser being used outside of policy. Perhaps I have misunderstood what I have read (I can't guarantee that I could find a link if asked) but I understand the relevant person admitted that they undertook the checkuser complained of, "could not remember" why they did it, and that person subsequently lost their checkuser access. As I understand it, there are checkuser logs, but they are only available to other uses with checkuser privileges. -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 18:13, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>If you count banned trolls and sockpuppets we get complaints all the time. Some of these were deemed important enough for investigation, but the checkuser was cleared in each instance.

<p>"Behavior on the IRC channel may be taken into consideration with respect to arbitration cases if it results in disruption on Wikipedia" Fred, does this mean that the door is now open to launch RFA's relating to the orchestrated blocking incidents and use the logs as evidence? --<a href="../../../m/c/g/User%7EMcginnly_76e7.html" title="User:Mcginnly">Mcginnly</a> | <a href="../../../m/c/g/User_talk%7EMcginnly_e9ad.html" title="User talk:Mcginnly">Natter</a> 14:44, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Deep breaths everyone. To sum up;</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Fred's statement</b>
<ol>
<li>ArbCom recognizes that a problem exists and has been discussing ways of dealing with it</li>
<li>New channel procedures and operators are being pushed in an effort to increase civility</li>
<li>Comments made on IRC may have 'on Wiki' consequences if they cause 'on Wiki' problems</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><b>Outstanding concerns</b>
<ol>
<li>Channel continues to exist and thereby damages 'faith in Wikipedia'</li>
<li>No punishments for past abuses - banning from the channel and de-sysoping were suggested</li>
<li>Non en-wikipedia admins on the channel</li>
<li>Failure to enforce civility on Wikipedia itself / double standards</li>
<li>Lack of details about new channel operators/procedures that Fred mentioned</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Disclaimer: After long avoiding IRC (ick, ptooey!) I requested access to the admin channel when this blew up about two weeks ago, and (after not hearing back) asked again and got access yesterday. This likely makes me either 'an evil insurrectionist mole', 'irredeemably tainted by IRC toxins', or both.</p>
<p>As to my opinions; I'd say that the changes Fred described all sound like good things. On the concerns/complaints: I have no doubts that if the channel were removed another (or several) would be set up - without any sort of civility requirements or access to people who might object to 'cabalism'... the same would be true for removal of the non admins. It has been de facto policy until now that 'what happens in IRC stays in IRC' - retroactively applying IRC bans and Wikipedia de-sysopings would thus seem improper to me (not to mention rather vindictive). Incivility on Wikipedia itself certainly has been a major factor here, but we have existing procedures for that which <i>generally</i> work - despite glitches and disputes over application. Finally, I <i>would</i> like to hear more about who is being asked to help operate the channel and what sort of guidelines / directions for civility are being contemplated.</p>
<p>My impression based on <i>one whole day</i> would be that the channel was 60% silly, 25% productive admin work, and 15% complaining about things... the last including occasional incivility which I'd consider on par with what is normally seen amongst admins <b>on</b> Wikipedia. One person was called a 'clown', there was a <b>joking</b> suggestion to ban everyone who supported a particular featured article, an old major dispute was discussed and one of the primary participants complained about, et cetera. Not perfect and surely not the worst which has taken place, but nothing which couldn't be managed. There was markedly less nastiness than <i>this</i> discussion for instance. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 15:11, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>CBD has the thread here. It's part of the last 15% that we'd generally like to deal with, but sometimes it can't be avoided–especially when this very topic came up and partisans from both sides were in channel. On the other hand, as you rightly note, nothing was said there that wasn't said here, and it's also my impression that the conversation on IRC was more polite. This may be because on IRC you can be kicked for being a jerk. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 15:17, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Thank you CBD, for actually investigating on your own and not just believing the mindless hype. The way some of the way people on here talk about it, you'd think #admins goes through a dozen kittens a day, and that's just the ones used for <i>sacrificial</i> purposes (feasts not included). --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 15:25, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>So how do you propose we deal with people on Wikipedia who are jerks? I'm not thinking of anyone in particular but this place frequently turns downright nasty. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 15:27, 16 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, blocking used to work, but recently this whole place has become downright partisan that the blocks are overturned even when the person really deserves it. As a result, the person feels vindicated, and continues on with the bad behavior. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 15:30, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Obviously the answer is to delete WP:AN and subpages and salt them. Also, if we make a rule against incivility, that should stop it in its tracks - look how effective <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_dense" class="extiw" title="m:Don't_be_dense">m:Don't be dense</a> is - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 15:48, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

</li>
<li>This always confused me. Wikipedia has no jurisdiction over the IRC channels, fine. If they were closed down people would only find other ways to communicate, yes, that's all well and good. But Wikipedia currently <i>explicitly sanctions</i> use of these specific IRC rooms, by pointing people to them on <a href="../../../i/r/c/WP%7EIRC_f8e0.html" title="WP:IRC">WP:IRC</a> and <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/IRC" class="extiw" title="meta:IRC">meta:IRC</a>. If Wikipedia wishes to bear no responsibility for these rooms, and insists that what happens in there does not relate to what happens on Wikipedia, then they should not be plugged on-Wiki, right? <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></a></small> 15:32, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Can we tone down the discourse and look at this in cost-benefit terms? Sure the channel has uses, but noncontroversial alternatives seem to exist for all of those uses. Wikipedia is almost entirely a volunteer operation. Part of the reason why millions of people have joined up is because it's an open meritocracy. Admin-only IRC introduces a degree of opaqueness. Although the overwhelming majority of that may be responsible dialog, a small number of serious problems can discredit the undertaking. I doubt effective fail-safes can be implemented. If ArbCom doesn't have authority then I'd like to see that formalized by disaffiliating the channel from Wikipedia. It's a recipe for trouble to have a secret-but-leaky chat that 1000+ people can visit that lacks firm admission criteria and that putatively has a formal connection to Wikipedia outside the reach of ArbCom. I'm an eventualist on this issue, which means I've always suspected the channel will sink under its own weight but maybe the folks who like it can patch the hull. <font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charge</a></i></sup></font> 15:32, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sadly for you Cyde the logs show it is not "mindless hype" and that is why we are all here. According to you Mackensen above - there is no problem of huge concern? No wonder they chose him to be chan op! It's going to be another "let's wipe it under the carpet and save the arbcom" - He is of course on the arbcom mailing list. I think we are having our intelligence insulted here by Cyde, Mackensen and David Gerard, I expect as we speak they are rounding up further little IRC admins to come here with their 10 pennies worth - it is truly amazing - what are they going to come up with next?

<dd>Giano, much as I am <i>really</i> enjoying the humor value in the implication that I am a 'little IRC admin in cahoots with David, Mackensen, and Cyde' (ROTFL)... 'not a battleground' comes to mind. Yup, people have done things they shouldn't have. Welcome to the human condition... you need to get over it. 'An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind', 'forgive and forget', and all that. If everyone insisted that every wrong be punished we'd spend all our time fighti... &lt;looks around&gt; oh wait. You haven't been above reproach either and in expecting such lapses to be forgiven you should also understand the need to do so for others. People agreeing to 'try to do better' is a <i>victory</i> for everyone... and insisting that 'there will be no peace until vengeance is satisfied' a loss for all. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 16:35, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It seems to me that the main issue here (other than the incivility that brought the issue into the open, and that official policy seems to be to sweep past indiscretions under the carpet) is that use of IRC is encouraged, as a quick and dirty way for interested parties to discuss issues as they arise, but there is no official relationship between Wikipedia and IRC (by design, it would seem, on account of legal concerns). There is no clarity about what the #admin channel for, and who should have access to it. Should it be limited to current admins? Should it be available to ex-admins too, or indeed any editors in good standing? And if it is being used to formulate consensus for taking admin actions on-wiki, shouldn't it be logged and transparent?</p>
<p>Reading <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">User:David Gerard</a>'s comments above, I have a second concern: he says he is on the ArbCom mailing list, as a former arbitrator.

And someone is bound to ask for a diff now). Who else, other than the current members of ArbCom, have access to the list (is there a list somewhere?)?

<p>Well, I'm sure the ArbCom is capable of looking after itself, but then we peons have an legitimate interest in knowing who is copied in on the internal ruminations of what is essentially Wikipedia's highest decision making body, and which is privy to the most sensitive information about all sorts of topics.</p>

<p>why are we discussing IRC? IRC is off-wiki. AC has no jurisdiction there, we have no jurisdiction there, case closed. If there are problems, spell out in giant letters somewhere that IRC channels, even if called "wiki" have serve no official function on wikipedia, whatsoever. I've been an admin two years, and I've never been tempted to look into IRC. It's not part of Wikipedia, period. The AC must be out of its mind considering accepting evidence from IRC logs. Are they bored? Have they considered the difficulties, such as identity-theft and verifiability? Leave IRC alone, but crack down on anyone that takes IRC-feuds onto Wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(𒁳)</a></small> 16:47, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As long as that IRC channel bears Wikipedia's name, and is, or is seen to be, an official organ of Wikipedia administration, then Wikipedia needs to be responsible for that IRC's actions. If on the other hand that channel were to be no longer affiliated with the encyclopedia, by changing its name, and by suitable public statements of disaffiliation, then the encyclopedia could wash its hands of any responsibility. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_August_590c.html" title="User talk:Paul August">☎</a> 19:00, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'd like to clarify a few things for the purposes of this discussion:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are 272 people with access to the #wikipedia-en-admins channel which constitutes about 25% of all English Wikipedia administrators. I'm not aware of any Wikipedia administrators asking for access for the very first time and not being given it (however I believe there have been instances where channel occupants have had their access revoked due to abuse).</li>
<li>These days there are usually between 40 and 50 people in the channel at any one time.</li>
<li>James Forrester is not the "self proclaimed owner of the channel". He is the IRC Group Contact for the Wikimedia Foundation, and in that WMF-sanctioned role he is the person authorised to deal with Freenode on behalf of the Foundation.</li>
<li>If Wikimedia/the ArbCom requested (e.g. through James Forrester) that the admins channel be shut down, then there would be absolutely nothing (apart maybe from goodwill on the part of Freenode) to stop people from creating an identical channel and picking up where they left off. The IRC channel is not a service of the Wikimedia Foundation, and as such the Foundation only has peripheral authority through the fact that several of those with high-level access on IRC are also deeply involved in one way or another with the Foundation or Wikipedia.</li>
<li>I think I got given operator access in this channel because I asked for it, to fix some faulty channel mode:s or something like that. From there, I have just done the occasional access-giving to admins new to IRC. Rarely have I had to use my operator access to op myself in order to diffuse a situation. I am more hesitant to kick or ban people from the channel, or remove their access, because they are admins. But I've always been a devotee of civility, as some on the WikiEN-l mailing list might know, and I'm happy to enforce a stricter level of civility in the channel into the future.</li>
<li>The channel is more useful than some people are giving it credit. At least twice in the last week I have found the channel useful to discuss extremely sensitive matters, which would be entirely inappropriate to discuss in larger, more public channels like #wikipedia.</li>
<li>I would like to know what this new position of the ArbCom means when it comes to IRC logging. At the moment, public logging of #wikipedia-en-admins is strictly prohibited. How are the ArbCom going to take into account statements made on IRC if such logs which they take into account cannot be posted as part of their decisions?</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope some of that made sense to someone. - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_d9f5.html" title="User:Mark">Mark</a> 16:49, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Much worse things have been said on-wiki than anything the ArbCom has looked at from the #admins channel. ArbCom didn't seriously take any actions against the on-wiki stuff and they aren't seriously taking any actions against the #admins stuff either. This is just an advisement message. And no, the thirty day thing wouldn't work. Some of the stuff dealt with is stuff that needs to stay private over legal lifetimes — that is, decades. The only possible way for public logging to work would be for someone to go through and redact everything that cannot be said in public. I don't see that as being workable. Alternatively, #admins could be opened up and a new channel for dealing with private issues could be started elsewhere. I don't think that would solve the accusations of cannibalism, however. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 17:58, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You're conflating two separate and highly different issues. One issue is common incivility against other Wikipedians (which happens on and off wiki). There are no legal ramifications. The other issue is stuff that must be discussed privately to avoid legal complications. This is not ever discovered on-wiki. As for the leaky nature of logs — yes, that is why, largely, other channels are being used to handle the tricky legal issues. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 18:38, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would like to clarify that Freenode no longer uses the concept of "group contacts" for channels with no official relationship to the thing being discussed. I don't believe that any change to the logging policy is being proposed at this point. While I could be mistaken (and would welcome a link to the salient Freenode policy if I am) I believe that the logging policy is a tradition carried over from #wikipedia rather than a Freenode matter. I would hope that everyone involved in the channel would adhere to the highest standards of Wikilove. Be excellent to one another and to those not present. If there are any current and ongoing problems with misuse of the channel, I would welcome any logs emailed to me privately. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">The Uninvited</a> Co., <a href="../../../u/n/i/User_talk%7EUninvitedCompany_4866.html" title="User talk:UninvitedCompany">Inc.</a> 18:05, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't believe that additional logging is warranted unless there is still a problem.

<dd>That's all well and good, but the point is I'm still in a position where I, and every other non-admin - just has to take your word for it. What I've seen over the past months, leads me to believe that there are personalities at wikipedia, in positions of trust, that abuse that trust. with 1000 admins you'd expect a few rotten apples - but when ArbCOM are implicated - you'd expect resignations really. It seems they are unable to police even themselves, let alone the rest of us - I'd prefer to be in a wikipedia, where behaviour like that isn't condoned by the authorities. --<a href="../../../m/c/g/User%7EMcginnly_76e7.html" title="User:Mcginnly">Mcginnly</a> | <a href="../../../m/c/g/User_talk%7EMcginnly_e9ad.html" title="User talk:Mcginnly">Natter</a> 18:35, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Oh, fun. Cyde's back to the "I demand evidence! (If you give it to me, I will block you.)" &lt;sigh&gt; Then we get to "if there were evidence, ArbCom would do something" from one head, while another announces dismissively that ArbCom can't do anything and that no one on the channel has to give a rat's fig what ArbCom says about who is or is not an op there. This kind of spirit of cooperation, this level of self-examination, this desire to make sure only the highest standards of behavior are upheld by administrators is, in fact, what keeps this "drama" ongoing.

<dd>Whilst trying to answer a question about how this whole thing started I said on IRC "Doc_glasgow&gt; The problem is, that when people believfe [sic] Giano has a free pass, they DO conspire, from a sense of injustice, to find a way to convince the community to act and stop his nastiness". I stand by that remark as my impression of what has happened. I was not 'denouncing you' in secret. There is a vicious circle: 1) your incivility isn't dealt with. 2) People feel aggrieved and discuss it. 3) You get paranoid and indulge in more incivility. I said nothing I haven't said on-wiki before. I have posted this analysis on an arbcom talk page in the past. Why anyone felt it helpful to send you the logs I have no idea! But that person out to be booted, not for breaching confidence, but for trying to stir up trouble and feed trolling.

<dd>Sorry to be prolonging this thread here, but this is a direct response to what Mackensen says above. Mackensen, I don't understand your thinking when you insist that Giano should quote the log for today, or when you ask that he show how civility was breached (which is in turn hardly to be done without quoting). Aren't you asking rather a lot&#160;? Tony Sidaway, the person who (in my opinion) did make attacks this morning, has been asked for permission to quote his words, but hasn't replied. Consequently Giano would be banned if he did quote them. Wouldn't he? <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 17:29, 17 January 2007 (UTC).</dd>
<dd>I think the question has been rendered moot. I have the impression that Giano would like to leave the matter where it sits, and I want to respect that wish. However, since you asked, allow me to clarify: I didn't ask Giano to post logs, though it's quite obvious he has them. A private communication would have been more than sufficient. I was mainly asking for clarification as he had me (and, still has me) at a disadvantage. Again, I've reviewed the logs from this morning on my own, and I see nothing–from any party–that rises to the level of a personal attack or would be construed by an uninvolved party as incivility. However, if you'll note below, I've taken the step of banning all further discussion regarding, mention of, or inference to Giano and these related matters. Under the circumstances, it isn't possible for those things to be mentioned without someone taking offence, and I've had more than enough drama this month. I should think we all have.

<dd>To clarify, in my opinion not one word that I have said about Giano on that channel comes close to being a personal attack, I consider none of the words I have uttered about Giano on that channel or anywhere else to be confidential. Nothing I have said there about the ongoing problematic behavior of Giano and one or two editors, to wit, their baseless personal attacks and their fantasies of a conspiracy, is other than what I have said on the wiki. Giano is a problem editor as long as he continues to launch false and baseless attacks on other editors. We have to recognise this fact in order to achieve a solution. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 11:25, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I haven't read all the above, but David Gerard did emphasise that the WMF and Wikipedia organisations like ArbCom have no jurisdiction over wikipedia IRC channels, which is fair enough, though I wonder whether they are allowed to use wikipedia in the channel name if this is the case. Maybe the names should be changed to include the qualification 'unofficial'?</p>
<p>My main point is that if they are unofficial and Wikipedia has no jurisdiction there, doesn't that place the wikipedia IRC channels in the same class of organisations, like Wikipedia Review, Wikitruth, Uncyclopedia and similar critical, humorous and attack organsiations, that are clustered around the behemoth that is Wikipedia? ie. Related to but not really part of it? If someone set up a website staffed by Wikipedia admins for Wikipedia admins to go to to get advice about admin actions on Wikipedia, would that be any different from the wikipedia IRC admin channel (apart from not being IRC)? If not, then I suggest leaving the IRC channels to stand or fall on their own merits, and simply make clear, here, on Wikipedia, that these IRC channels exist, but they are not official. Make them ex-officio, if indeed they ever were official. Then, if the IRC channels get a reputation for being closed and cliquey, and/or the wrong place to go to (I don't know the truth of this, as I've never been there), they will start to wither and die, and people will learn (or be prompted) to use on-wiki processes instead. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 18:33, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

IRC channels don't exist by virtue of any office, unless you're implying that administrators have, ex-officio, an expectation to entry in one or more channels. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 18:38, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>It is only reasonable if you start from the point that the channel is of net detriment to Wikipedia. Perhaps some dispassionate person should do a cost-benefit analysis to the project. I'd strong suspect that the net benefit is immense. (That's not to deny there may be some costs and problems.) I handle OTRS - in many instances I need help, second opinions, or oversight. I can't request that on-wiki for obvious reasons. I could e-mail, but that's inefficient. I'd have to e-mail dozens of people to guarantee a response - and each wouldn't know if it has been dealt with by the time they are reading it. The admins' channel allows me to call on, and discuss the issue, with a cross section of trusted people, and they is normally someone in there with the time to assist. (And yes, before someone points it out, some OTRS issues cannot be discussed even in that channel). Killing the channel would lose that, and I'm not convinced it would stop incivility. Frankly, I've experienced more incivility on-wiki.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 20:16, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Disaffiliating it would not mean killing it.

<li>Well then I don't understand. If you disaffiliate it, what is the intention? If it is to discourage its use, then you lose the benefits or at least decrease them. You also forfeit some level of control. Will arbcom still watch over a disaffiliated channel. And wouldn't the 'issues' still continue? Either the intention is to diminish/discourage the channel's use - in which case you are saying it is a net loss to Wikipedia. Is it?

The post says: <i>"We hope it [the donation] will help the servers to keep running smoothly"</i> - ie. there had been problems with the servers (which also explains why it was a one-off donation). The post also ends with: <i>"We also renew our condoleances for the death, 2 months ago, of FreeNode founder, aka Lilo."</i> - this refers to the death of <a href="../../../r/o/b/Rob_Levin_472a.html" title="Rob Levin">Rob Levin</a>. My reading of the post is that the donation is to help Freenode through a difficult period following the death of its founder. The Wikimedia Foundation is big enough now to stand on its own two feet (and maybe Freenode is as well, I don't really know), but consider what might have happened if Jimbo had died suddenly (Rob Levin was knocked down by a car while cycling) during the first year or two of Wikipedia. Imagine the chaos that could have caused, and how a donation might have helped. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 21:34, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The the channel in question (and possibly more, as you say) is an invitation only place that has accountability designed <b>out</b> it by virtue of secrecy and no logging. In reality, like minded friends go there and interact. It crackles with social energy. The arbcom (some of whom are regulars in that channel) has found "incidents involving gross incivility", only grudgingly after months of non-stop work by the victims, one of whom was threatened with banning while defending himself. They haven't yet corroborated (or denied) the allegations of character assassination and conspiracy. A quote from one of our articles (and I'm not implying criminal activity, this is just conceptual) - <i>Under the common law the crime of conspiracy was capable of infinite growth, able to accommodate any new situation and to criminalize it if the level of threat to society was sufficiently great.</i> So what's the level of threat when a secret, closed group allegedly gangs up on and trys to drive away some of wikipedia's greatest contributers? What other cases have there been where the victims weren't lucky enough to see the logs? What consequences have been given to the people responsible for this "gross incivility"?

<dd>Giano's assertion "that more experienced admins on the IRC admins channel encouraged less experienced admins to block certain editors in a manner that was widely considered wrong" appears to refer to Kylu blocking him. There is no supporting evidence. The fact that Giano continues to make this assertion indicates his paranoia-distorted reality. Simply believing such a thing could occur is an insult to Kylu's intelligence. It was this absurd assertion and Giano's subsequent refusal to admit he could be wrong that have earned him my enmity. --<a href="../../../i/d/e/User%7EIdeogram_de1d.html" title="User:Ideogram">Ideogram</a> 00:15, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>With respect, it's not a "wild, unsubstantiated" accusation. While the "evidence" is fairly thin (logs copied from wikitruth indeed) barring a refutation from Kmartin I've got no reason to doubt the veracity. And *cough* I'm well aware of the casual nature of "I thought it was a compromised account" malarky used as a justification for abuse of checkuser privledges. It's well and truly beyond the terms a of "good faith" when the high-level privledges are used for personal gain. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="black">brenneman</font></a> 23:03, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The members of Arbcom seem convinced that there has been gross incivility on IRC, even if you have not witnessed it (I have not been on the channel, so have not either). In the absence of evidence either way, those of us who are not privy to the sort of private communications that convinced the Arbcom that there was gross incivility we will just have to recognise that you and Giano (and others) are making contrary assertions on these points too, unless or until Arbcom or another authoritiative decision-maker concludes one way or the other.</dd>

<dd>Tony, I'm guessing that this situation is doubly hurtful to you, since you've campaigned for openness (a year ago on WikiEn-L with regards to an admin-only mailing list) and offered permission to publish all your comments from #wikipedia-en-admins. Very commendable and consistent. Maybe you're worried about guilt by association of what the arbdom calls "Numerous incidents involving gross incivility", but the closed nature of the channel is preventing you from defending yourself, or from showing that the channel isn't always such a bad place. It could be worse - this discussion could be going on in a secret channel you're excluded from, where some of your worst enemies are grossly and uncivilly maligning you. Secrecy and censorship suck.</dd>

<dd>But still, the main problem here isn't "Numerous incidents involving gross incivility", as bad as that is. Sometimes tempers flair and people get grossly uncivil, sometimes in self-defense. When it happens on wiki, back and forth communications and a road to dispute resolution is still open, people hear each other. However, when it happen behinds people's backs, in a secret closed meeting room of like minded admins with no intent of dispute resolution, then it's destructive in nature and corrupts our leadership and our culture. People who go down that road should take a long look at themselves and ask whether they are really interested in creating a free encyclopedia, or if they are more interested in power and status and destroying their enemies. --<a href="../../../d/u/k/User_talk%7EDuk_82a4.html" title="User talk:Duk">Duk</a> 20:29, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm afraid Tony's mouth is only part of the problem. The crux is the arbcom itself, who are so ashamed of some of their members behaviour in this matter (and equally importantly the behaviour of some of their closest friends) they cannot reach agreement on how to solve the problem. If they had a grain of common sense, and feeling for wikipedia, the matter would now be firmly closed and finished, but they are torn between their loyalty to each other, and their duty to wikipedia. I suppose they should all resign if they can't reach agreement, but I don't think they have quite enough honour between them for that! So they will allow this to drag on rather than finish the totally discredited #wikipedia-en-admins which is the obvious solution. I had dropped this matter, but the arbcom's friends (i.e. Tony) cannot help themselves, they are so afraid that their power base is going to be completely destroyed they have to keep digging away seemingly unaware it is the admin channel's justly deserved grave they are digging. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_II_8fcc.html" title="User:Giano II">Giano</a> 20:57, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would advise anyone, Giano included, to avoid making inflamatory comments. He has been treated abominably, and it is nothing short of remarkable that he is still here, writing excellent articles on a daily basis: that is a testimony to his dedication to this project. He often expresses himself forcefully, sometimes too forcefully, and he makes many allegations, some of which are or turn out to be entirely justified and others for which I have not seen the evidence. Along the way, he makes some very good points which should be answered and addressed. Perhaps his style of debate can be counter-productive, but I doubt there is much a comment from me would do about that.</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the advice. I don't think I have been particularly quick to rush to Giano's defence - my contributions to this debate have been relatively sparse compared to some others - although clearly it looks different to you. You may not be aware that Giano and I have fallen out quite seriously at least once, but I will not hide the fact that I consider his contributions to be immensely valuable, nor that I think that the rumpus over the last 6 months or so has been caused largely by the way Giano has been treated, rather than the way that he has treated others. He is not perfect; none of us are. I am not convinced that he really needs me to defend him anyway - he is quite able to put his own view across. It should not be forgotten that he is not to only person to have suffered at the hands of those who are said to have been grossly uncivil on IRC, although the "Giano" label as a shorthand for this whole mess inevitably means that the conversation returns to him.</dd>

<li>What I find strange about this whole thing is your stance that the whole channel is (insert hyperbole here). It's a channel, no different than many on wiki pages, and there are various contributors to it. Taking the fact that there has been some bad behavior (actually I've not really personally seen it, I just take that on faith based on the number of people that have said as much) and equating that with a need to completely shut it down is equivalent to saying the fact that there has been some terrible behavior on wiki means the whole wiki needs to be shut down. Not very many people nor evidence back your claims that everyone in the channel is behaving terribly, nor that the whole channel and all it's participants are disgraced. In fact claiming that all participants in the channel are deplorable people as you have essentially done, just reflects poorly on you. The reality is some relatively small percentage of the discussion there ranges from terrible and regrettable to not helpful. Hopefully the current efforts will be enough to clean up the channel, and allow the useful efforts there to go on. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 22:35, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>It dosen't matter if the "terrible" (which means what? just "incivility"?) accounts for 5% or 50% of that channel's activities, because we, the community, are not able to tell. If you wish to speak about "evidence" (which is not sensitive — and it is not) backing up anything, it needs to become publicly <i>available</i>. Otherwise, invoking the word feels rather absurd. It was interesting to see how the Committee became divided over this issue, and how those whom I consider the more sensible arbitrators (before any of this happned) opposed the wildly pro-IRC "remedies" against Giano. But nevertheless, as a body, the Committee has been —and remains— far too equivocal, which, by extension, reflects poorly on it/you. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 00:37, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Interesting that you jump straight to ad hominem instead of addressing the argument. It's clear from your biting sarcasm that you're not really interested in helping things improve, but that you're so emotionally tied up in conflict you don't see your part in causing problems. At least I made a good faith decision in consultation with other bureaucrats and can feel good about making a decision in the best interests of the project, and that my behavior throughout carried in it not the least bit of incivility. Can you say as much? But clearly it's not going to be fruitful to continue discussion.

<li>Perhaps Taxman, it is for others to see their parts in this. It is always convenient to shoot the messenger but in this instance the messenger is refusing to lie down and die. The channel has been abused, if people gather to discuss others in secret places, they cannot be surprised if they are accused of nefarious deeds, especially if they carry out some very strange acts following those secretive discussions. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_II_8fcc.html" title="User:Giano II">Giano</a> 15:09, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Taxman, I realize that you don't know with any precision what has actually been going on in the admin channel, and still to a certain extent goes on. The evidence situation makes the discussion absurd, as El C says: the actual events must not be presented or discussed. I despair when I see the necessarily vague descriptions of "gross incivility", "character assassination" and "conspiracy" dismissed as "paranoia" above, and when I see you sarcastically suggest "(insert hyperbole here)". All I can do is make some bald, non-evidence-supported statements, and you, Taxman (and <i>you</i>, dear reader), will have to decide if they bear the stamp of truth, and if I have any personal credibility. Thus: I know what goes on in the way of character assassination in en-admins because I've been ganged up on and attacked to my face, and I've seen others ganged up on and attacked behind their backs. I've seen admins asking for help in getting Giano blocked. The most distasteful thing I've seen there is the way instant decency has broken out when Jimmy Wales has dropped into the channel, and been as instantly withdrawn when he has left. I've sent my record of a couple of incidents to the arbcom, logged by myself and without one pixel edited, removed, or added; that's how the "numerous incidents involving gross incivility" were brought to their attention. (Perhaps other people have sent logs also, I wouldn't know. One neutral person, at my request, submitted his own logs for the same times as mine, and I hope that the two versions were compared.) Please don't shoot the messenger Giano—he wasn't there, though he is a victim of the bad channel culture—better shoot the witness if you don't believe me. One thing I've noticed is that when people actually manage to get hold of those or similar logs (not apparently a startlingly difficult feat, as many log the channel 24/7), they tend to stop saying "paranoia" and "hyperbole" and start saying "I'm shocked", and "I had no idea". (Quoting an arbitrator—I won't name him, but perhaps he'll name himself.) And here's an expressive small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bishonen&amp;diff=101727026&amp;oldid=101704292" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bishonen&amp;diff=101727026&amp;oldid=101704292" rel="nofollow">item</a> on my talk.</p>
<p>Even if these things are true, why do I rake up the past, now that measures for cleanup are being taken? Several reasons: the channel isn't very clean, in my opinion—I've just decided not to go there any more, as there's now precious little support to be had, with both <a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> having given it up in disgust. The new chanops no doubt do their best, in an authoritarian manner, to keep it civil; but they're not always there, and the more effective and proactive of them are <i>far</i> from always there. Is a channel that needs so much policing worth trying to keep on course? Its own culture is bad. Social meeting-places do develop cultures of their own—to say so is not indeed to claim that the members of it are all bad people, as you suggest in your <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> above. This one has a troubled past. In the very last exchange I saw in channel, yesterday, the policing was merely pushing the tone of discourse (in, as it happens, a discussion of Giano) from attack to insinuation. Secondly, the abusive chanops are still chanops, though they've chosen not to be active at the moment. The arbcom is, as far as I can gather, leaving them free to resume these leading roles at any moment of their choice. This, to me, is offensive—I actually find it hard to believe—and it seems to me a good reason to either shut down the channel, or open it to all. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 17:23, 23 January 2007 (UTC).</p>

<p>I find it patently absurd to say that something with Wikipedia in it's name is not under the jurisdiction of the same authorities that police Wikipedia. If it isn't going to be answerable to these authorities than frankly I don't think it should bear the Wikipedia name, and should be usurped, or deleted. However, I'll also say that attacking the <b>venue</b> of the discourse is also patently absurd. People are people, and the people that are acting up on the admin channel would not be better people without it, I'm sure I can say.

<p>It's outright strange that so many people concentrate on incivility of #wikipedia-en-admins while omitting the real problem. The channel has become a venue where certain current and former admins and (amazingly) assisted by sitting ArbCom members conspire how to give a Wikipedia an enema (sic!) and rid it from the editors who oppose them. There is a log from the last year somewhere out there where the self-styled "arbitrator emeritus" discusses with a then (and still now) sitting ArbCom member how to "get rid of Irpen" through a "slow and grinding process" with another ArbCom member (still sitting as well) who professes a chairmanship of the channel watching and proclaiming that "idiots should go". ArbCom has been made aware of that log, they tell me. Still no action. There is plenty of evidence about blocks orchestrated via the channel and I saw no desysopping and instead we concentrate on "incivility". Big deal! I am not worried about incivility. I am by far more worried about teaming up to find an excuse to block Giano (or Irpen or Ghirlandajo) and the names of the conspirators are well known.</p>
<p>Anyway, I am going to act at this point. Within days I will submit a case to ArbCom backed up by evidence of the orchestrated blocks. We will see what comes out of that.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, please drop the nonsense about incivility. Whoever wants to discuss manners, go to alt.fan.miss-manners or other fora. Time to address admin abuse, violations of existing blocking policies and broken RfAdm. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 20:22, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

I have been asked to clarify elsewhere what I understand by the term conspiracy. As I understand it, a conspiracy is two or more people discussing in a secret place how best to deal with a third party not privy to those discussions. Of course in a place like Wikipedia some people i e the Arbcom should have a private place to discuss matters. There is no need for every "quickly come lately liitle admin" to require such a place. I am delighted Mackensen intends to recuse, it is so unseemly when as in the last aborted "Giano case" arbcom members such as J Forrester were forced to recuse after they had already (with strange haste) voted. I very much hope Irpen's case will prove that he was not only unjustly blocked, but that strange things (which the arbcom accept, but we are not allowed to mention) have happened on that channel. I won't comment further on the details of that case, as Thatcher seems to be concerned by <a href="../../../s/u/b/Sub_judice.html" title="Sub judice">Sub judice</a> rules, but of course we all know (don't we Thatcher?) these things don't apply on wiki - so no worries there. It is such a pity we have to have these repeated and damaging cases because the arbcom, whose members are so numerous and clandestine (why is there not a readily available list of those entitled to receive and pass comment on the arbcom mailing list?) fail to deal once and for all with the notorious abuses which have taken place and are taking place in the designated "admin channel." <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_II_8fcc.html" title="User:Giano II">Giano</a> 21:56, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>That's not a mailman members list. With chanops in the admin channel that aren't even admins, I think it warrants a look as to whether there's people in the ArbCom kitchen that aren't cooks, too. Transparency is vital to the health of the wiki.

<li>Essjay - I respect and trust Essjay greatly, but he isn't an Arbitrator, so should he really be on the list?</li>
<li>Mindspillage - Didn't Kat step down from Arbcom?</li>

<dd>I could be wrong but it could have to do with one of the many hats Essjay wears. Essjay is a bloody valuable contributor and I can see why he'd be the exception if anyone was going to be. Round my way we always have an exception that proves the rule, and I guess in this instance Essjay is that proof. Hope that helps. Personally, I'd hate to see Wikipedia get that far up its own arse it couldn't have exceptions to rules. But I guess I'm a rules are made to be broken kind of person. That's why I have a great fear of writing rules down. I take it there's no chance people are just going to let this whole issue die quietly?

<dd>If memory serves, Essjay was added at about the same time he became the first non-arbitrator on en to get checkuser (I'm fairly sure he is still the only one). It was decided since the arbcom mailing list was the primary venue to discuss checkuser related activities, it was logical for him to have access. A secondary benefit to this was that we thought he would provide valuable insight into other committee discussions. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> 01:59, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks, Fred. That makes a degree of sense, given the turnover of personnel; on the other hand, I am sure that there are plenty of other editors and admins who could help in discussing issues and who would provide equally useful "memory and insight". Will former Arbitrators stay on the list in perpetuity? Perhaps the same "memory and insight" could be achieved by keep them on the list for a term of, say, a year after they leave Arbcom? The bottom line is that access to the mailing list gives an enhanced level of access to confidential information and to the decision makers. I just does not seem right to me that people who are not on Arbcom should be on the Arbcom mailing list. -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 23:38, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Note that these are all if/thens. If the "ifs" aren't right, then the "thens" won't follow.</p>
<ol>
<li>If en.admins.irc has non-administrators at en. on it who have been implicated in several cases of bad behavior,</li>
<li>If the composition of the channel is entirely outside of the scope of ArbCom, as David Gerrard says,</li>
<li>If James Forrester must agree to any change in ops and composition of the channel and will not do so,</li>
<li>If the channel's additional ops are the only ones who can police against malicious talk (because the previous ones were participating or approving of it),</li>
<li>If the channel's "vital functions" are easily replicated by WP:AN/I and the mailing list and e-mail,</li>
<li>If these other venues are usually superior but never inferior to the IRC,</li>
<li><b>Then</b> we are looking at an unnecessary chat forum that has, built into it, persistent bad behavior which is <i>entirely unrelated to Wikipedia rules and regulations.</i></li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, this is the equivalent of a MySpace "Friends" circle. While ArbCom can do nothing about it, we can. Wikipedia pages currently give users their access to the channel. We do not allow links to MySpace and Friendster and Facebook "Friends" pages and web forums of that nature even in our articles, and we darn sure don't need to have our namespace pages linking to any. If we remove all links to en.admins.irc, then the current cast of characters can have the isolation and pride that they seem to seek, and we needn't worry what they call their chat room. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:26, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Some observations. For ease of replying, I've changed your list to a numbered one. Number three is incorrect, as James agreed to and did appoint additional channel ops, including several sitting arbitrators. Furthermore, op access has been removed from at least one of the users in question, and the others are not active as ops. Number four is misleading; informed of the new rules, every person is responsible for his or her own behavior. Ops are the only people who can kick. A corresponding argument for the encyclopedia would be that only administrators can police malicious talk, because they have the power to block. That would do a disservice to all the conscientious non-administrators on this site. Number five is also incorrect, for reasons that I and others have asserted elsewhere but will do here. Some things cannot be conducted on WP:ANI, or must be conducted faster than e-mail allows. Checkuser and oversight are two of these functions. ORTS complaints are another. The functionaries who perform these tasks have made it clear that they prefer IRC over other mediums. Number six is a question of taste, and I think my answer to five covers it. The official uses of the channel are important and must be protected. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 14:45, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If every user who logs in to the channel is faced with the message: <i>"Allowed topics are only limited to the checkuser, oversight issues as well as other issues that <b>require</b> confidentiality"</i>, the whole thing would become harmless instantly.</p>
<p>And, besides, several individuals who are allowed to log in to that channel and even have sysop powers there, namely Tony Sidaway, Kelly Martin and NullC should not be anywhere near such confidential discussions as being able to take part in them requires a significant degree of the community trust which these individuals do not enjoy whatsoever. Tony and Kelly being forced to quit all their privileges specifically because of their abusing them should not be on a confidential channel.</p>

<dd>Irpen, why are you continuing to discuss the channel when you agree with my statement above that "coordination" is going to happen whether the channel exists or not? Why can't you concentrate on the abusive blocking issue which you assert is what is really important here? --<a href="../../../i/d/e/User%7EIdeogram_de1d.html" title="User:Ideogram">Ideogram</a> 23:00, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Let me attempt a response here. There are both official and unofficial uses to the channel. The former are the most important and mainly the ones I've already mentioned. For these to be of any real use, of course, require the presence of trusted users, mainly sysops. <i>Being a sysop is not, and never has been, a requirement for entry into that channel.</i> The high degree of overlap between the two bodies speaks well of the community. Any time you have a concentration of users there will be discussion; some of it important, some of it not. I don't see much value in restricting the free flow of discussion beyond mandating that nothing untoward or unkind be said. Now, returning to your main point, this is a sticky matter and I would like ask that good faith be assumed as I tackle it. First of all, Tony Sidaway and NullC do not possess "sysop powers" on that channel. The former's were removed, without protest, several days ago. NullC has them because his nick is linked with Mindspillage's; I haven't seen him there in some time.</li>
<li>Moving on to the second point, IRC access has not been removed because no cause has been given. I'm well aware that members of the community do not trust said individuals to use admin tools, and they no longer have those tools. As they have not abused their access to the channel by demonstrably violating its rules (in particular, those rules governing confidentiality) they have not been removed. Now, if the forthcoming arbitration case were to find that any user, not just those who have been singled out, was responsible for the off-wiki coordination of a bad block, that would of course be a different matter.

Don't you try and pin everything onto Irpen's forth coming case, while I'm sure that will prove very interesting indeed, your channel was being abused long before that sequence of events. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_II_8fcc.html" title="User:Giano II">Giano</a> 18:20, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>First of all, it isn't *my* channel. Up until a week ago my access there was no higher than anyone else's, and I've not been implicated in any sordid goings-on. Let's not even start down that road. Second of all, I will indeed await the verdict of bodies responsible to the community before acting. While I do not agree that the committee has oversight over the channels, if it was the opinion of the committee than an unethical coordination of blocking or other such abuses had taken place I would remove access, or argue at least for such removal (mind you, I'm but one of several ops), because I trust the arbitrators' judgement in these matters. As I'm apparently not trustworthy on these matters, in your view, I can't begin to imagine why you think I should make such a call myself. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 18:26, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Sure, and I can accept that. However, if the channel is <i>for administrators</i>, non-admins should not have access.

<p>Wait a minute. You have seen the very same logs mailed to ArbCom since you are at the ArbCom mailing list. And from those logs you don't see that "unethical coordination of blocking or other such abuses had taken place" yet? The additional ArbCom case should not have been necessary and I am forced to write it only because our ArbCom seems not decisive (or lazy) or wants to wash its hands off, I don't know.

<dd>Another point, I don't understand NullC's nicj being "linked" to anyone else's as an excuse for anything. Mindspillage is respected by many (myself included) despite I disagreed with her at times. She can log in all right with her own nick. NullC is not an admin, he is not a "trusted member of the community". Why is he there?</dd>
<dd>Finally, as far as Kelly goes, I understand from your message that NotACow is not only allowed to log in but she is still a sysop. I am familiar with at least two occasions of the checkuser misuse by this individual (and perhaps there were more). Moreover, her ArbCom voting showed convincingly that the user is one of the <i>least</i> trusted by the editor's community. What's more? Her personal blog is full of attacks on Wikipedia users. Why is she allowd to log in? And to be a sysop too? We are all looking forward to find out. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 18:36, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i><b>Irpen:</b> NullC is not an admin, he is not a "trusted member of the community". Why is he there?</i> NullC is an admin on Commons. I do not support his using an identity linked to Mindspillage's, but NullC is not the only admin on Commons (who is not him or herself an admin on en:wp) that has access to #wikipedia-en-admins. There are others. I support that and think it is appropriate. There have been instances when action on commons was required, and having someone there that was an admin on commons was beneficial. Some of the people who were granted access on the basis of being admins on commons have subsequently become admins on en:wp but that's besides the point. Commons admins are as trustworthy as en:wp admins and it is appropriate that they have access as well, in my view. I won't address the rest. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 19:54, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'll address all points here. Please bear with me. Yes, I've seen the logs that arbcom has seen; I emailed several myself. I've reviewed them and offered commentary. I'm not convinced that coordination took place. I'm not calling anyone a liar; I'm simply stating that in my considered opinion I don't think that's what happen. I see ill-considered and hasty actions, but I don't see malice. That's another reason for you to wait for arbcom; they might well see things differently.</dd>
<dd>NullC is a commons admin and has some kind of developer access. If he's not a trusted member of community then this is news to me. I'm aware that his kicking of Bishonen from the channel is highly controversial but as her access was restored I see no lasting damage. I would prefer that Greg not exercise ops in the future.</dd>
<dd>I haven't seen Kelly Martin log in for well over a week at this point. Her blog is no more malicious than other user's blogs (whom I'll not name in the interest of kindness) but that's no excuse for past harm done. If there have been actual concrete checkuser violations they were not brought to my attention so I can't comment on them. As she's no longer a checkuser I'm not concerned about any future damage. She hasn't been removed because no one has seen fit to. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 18:55, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><a href="../../../e/t/_/Et_tu.html" title="Et tu">Et tu</a>, Calton... The most commonly repeated accusation against Giano (an unfair one, IMO, but everybody who's heard the rumours knows better, no doubt) runs something like "Just because you write those admittedly brilliant Featured articles all the time, it doesn't mean you get to be rude to people!" It's a refreshing novelty to see somebody instead tell him to "go and do something useful for once like write a page."

<dd>My comment did not, does not, have never been, and are not intended in the slightest to be dependent on whatever contributions Giano has or hasn't made in the past: I don't know what they are and I DON'T CARE. They're dependent on his disruptive, bad-faith, and complete-waste-of-time bollocks he's been inflicting on this page for the last umpteen days RIGHT NOW. I don't give a rat's ass if he's spend his time before this walking on water: he's being a disruptive waste of time RIGHT NOW, and his past contributions are not nor should be a "Get Out of Jail Free" card for being a disruptive waste of time RIGHT NOW.

<dd>How many articles someone has written is not relevant. Giano et. al. love to assert how admins have no standing higher than other users. When pushed, they might grudgingly give them equal status. But comments like "Why don't you go and do something useful for once like write a page" (which we have seen before) indicate that Giano et. al. clearly consider people who write articles (i.e. themselves) to be superior to anyone who helps out the encyclopedia in any other way. --<a href="../../../i/d/e/User%7EIdeogram_de1d.html" title="User:Ideogram">Ideogram</a> 23:40, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I didn't take your comments to be specifically directed at me. I'd say that the problem is a fairly widespread and wholly false assumption that the admins channel has been used for launching or coordinating activity that subverts Wikipedia's purpose in some way. Your recent comments could be viewed as advancing that assumption. You referred, for instance, to a place where "the accused never get a chance to defend themselves, or even hear the charges." That's a very distorted way of saying that on the admins channel sometimes matters are discussed concerning people who are not present on the channel at the time. The idea that this leads to campaigns of persecution against certain users is completely baseless. Nobody who would engage in such nonsense would be tolerated on that channel for one minute. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 11:35, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

Either I am incorrect in my asssesment of that based on what is available to me (and I have access to the channel) or you are incorrect in your assessment of what is available to you (and you do not currently have such access... are you an admin on commons or en:wp in good standing? if so, contact me for access) or one of us is lying. I believe you are honestly mistaken in your statements about confidentiality, not that you are deliberately lying about it. Are you calling me a liar, then, or do you think I have misinterpreted the information I have available to me?

<li>I have tried to stay out of this conversation, but all this talk of "kind hearts" is too revolting for words. Now watch my lips and believe what I'm telling you Kylu and Lar were (I don't say now) in this up to their necks. Kylu had never heard of me until she blocked me - why? Who convinced her?

<dd>Bastique, we would not be having all these discussions if Lar had solicited the opinions of non-involved admins at WP:ANI rather than in an all-secretive #admins IRC channel. The matter did not involve any checkuser data, any personal info or required confidentiality for any other reason. This is exactly what's wrong with the very existence of this channel. <b>There is no "all-secret" admin-only stuff. There is secret ArbCom stuff. There is secret checkuser stuff but not admin stuff.</b> More at <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html#that_sad_incident" title="User talk:Lar">User_talk:Lar#that_sad_incident</a> --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 22:13, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I do think that there will be much less abuse. If the official #admin channel channel does not exist, Kelly or JamesF can still start their own private channel, true enough. But I doubt that, say, Kylu, will be going to Kelly's channel to get advise on her administrative actions. This channel will have no semiofficial connection to Wikipedia and new admins will not go there as well. Of course there may be 5 or seven current regulars who will be at the new channel, true. But there will be much less harm that they will be able to do. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 00:36, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Now you've <i>really</i> lost me. The first RFC seems to be a heap of fuss over the deletion of some useless templates by Kelly Martin. The second RFC seems to be a similar heap of fuss over a declaration by Kelly Martin that she intended to block editors who persistently placed unlicensed material on Wikipedia.

<p>(resetting indent) Paying attention elsewhere. It's likely that if all the prior acts were properly handled right now, you all would be blocked. Do you really want that? <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 03:50, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Do you want me to give you the diffs for how long this has been going on before I decided to respond in kind? If I hadn't responded in kind would I still be "being the bigger person"? --<a href="../../../i/d/e/User%7EIdeogram_de1d.html" title="User:Ideogram">Ideogram</a> 03:56, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As I said: if we look at the history, you're likely to be blocked immediately. You can either take the warnings now as what's been stated - a final line in the sand warning, for all parties... or you're likely to be blocked in short order.</dd>
<dd>This is not fair or balanced - it's reacting to what's going on now that you all do have others' attention. The behavior that got attention has to stop. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 04:04, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Who's more familiar with the history, you or me? And given that at least five people have removed my comments because they disliked me I would be quite happy to take a block if we are all blocked for the same period of time. I have not nor will I ever remove any comments from talk pages (other than my own) since you have asserted this policy. If someone does it to me in the future, I will simply bring it to your attention. I really don't understand what you are asking of me that I haven't already promised. --<a href="../../../i/d/e/User%7EIdeogram_de1d.html" title="User:Ideogram">Ideogram</a> 04:11, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You threatened above to keep it up if someone else does it to you. That is unacceptable. That will get you both blocked. If you refrain from doing so in the future, and bring it to people's attention, you have nothing to worry about, and nothing to complain about. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 04:17, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
