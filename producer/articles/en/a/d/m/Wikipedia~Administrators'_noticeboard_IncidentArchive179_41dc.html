<p>I have nominated the above articles for deletion (regarding a deceased rapper and his unreleased album, they seem likely hoaxes or at best wholly unverifiable). <a href="../../../j/e/e/User%7EJeezy123_c8ca.html" title="User:Jeezy123">Jeezy123</a> is the originator and principal editor of both. Soon after the AfD was posted, this user blanked the AfD page and removed the AfD notice from Young Argo, while apparent single-purpose account Theresa12 did the same for Thug Invasion. I hope an admnistrator will consider appropriate notices for these editors and that eyes will be kept on the AfD (which, given the time lost when it was unavailable, I moved from January 13 to January 14). <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertissimo_7443.html" title="User:Robertissimo">Robertissimo</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobertissimo_59de.html" title="User talk:Robertissimo">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Robertissimo_5158.html" title="Special:Contributions/Robertissimo">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>I would like admin's interference with behaviour of user Eupator. I have applied to assistance procedure regarding dispute on Urartu page. The dispute was considered and my editing was approved <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Urartu#Article_dispute._Association_of_Members.27_Advocates" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Urartu#Article_dispute._Association_of_Members.27_Advocates" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> SilkTork identified that future editing (my part) should be discussed with him. However, user Eupator (and Nareklm as well) did editing without further consultation. Eupator and other Armenian users are harrasing me, and they even don't conceal that they are revenging <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:SilkTork#once_again_on_Urartu" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:SilkTork#once_again_on_Urartu" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> ("since you opened that can of worms deal with the facts"). I have already complained about personal attack from Eupator on page Paytakaran. He went unpunished and continue his inappropriate behavior. You can look at my talk page - they placing questionable warnings on my talkpage <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Dacy69#3RR" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Dacy69#3RR" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> and other things, imposing their POV. Almost all my editing are checked by them and either reverted or in other manner modified. While I understand that from formal point of view everyone can edit what s/he want, there is also evidences of wikistalking. Such users like Eupator should be banned from editing. --<a href="../../../d/a/c/User%7EDacy69_b62d.html" title="User:Dacy69">Dacy69</a> 22:45, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Like i said that was a friendly notice you were one edit away from reaching the limit and no one has ever warned you so it was a friendly notice theres no reason for this and this was my first time not "Numerous" times as the sentence expresses itself. Also your post concerns me it is not wikistalking if you check the history ive posted here before so please don't even start accusing i have nearly 400 articles on my watch list. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=101020368&amp;oldid=101020141" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=101020368&amp;oldid=101020141" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> the only reason you are reporting this is so that you can edit freely without people judging your edits that are POV or bias or misleading people. <font color="#0099FF">Nareklm</font> 01:07, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The main concern of this post is Eupator, not you, Nareklm, though you should also restrain from certain things.

<p>Template:User Sexy was requested for a db-empty after the creating editor asked for it to be deleted. But the speedy tag was removed because the tag ended up transcluded on all of the user pages that included the userbox template. I have placed the db-author tag on the template's talk page directly under the section where the author asks for deletion. The intention is for deletion of the template, not the talk page, but if I understood the template deletion criteria page, then this is the way to go and I should ask an admin to help in removing the template article (which is why I posted here now). Anyone lend a hand on this one? Thanks. <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 19:35, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I feel really uncomfortable about what I've been noticing and think this should at least be brought up for attention here. I just noticed there is a recent string of Israeli law firms and lawyers up for AfD or tagged for notability and all of them have come from either <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">User:Ju66l3r</a> or <a href="../../../e/d/c/User%7EEdcolins_06ae.html" title="User:Edcolins">User:Edcolins</a> and with one exception, all of them include votes by one or the other, depending on who created the AfD.

Further investigation showed a category largely populated with articles with no assertion of notability (and my opinion on that matter was validated by admins who deleted those articles per db-bio as tagged by Edcolins). For other articles, I felt some assertion was made, but unsubstantiated and my own searches could not provide any verifiable notability (other than existence and press releases). Those were submitted for AfD (and some of those are uncontested). The only reason I have been involved in a number of Israel-related articles is because the creator of those articles wrote articles that fell short of meeting notability guidelines. If that user had written a number of poor articles/stubs about Mexican gymnasts, then I would have just as readily discussed and submitted them all instead (and perhaps, I would still be here defending my good name against someone claiming I'm anti-Hispanic or anti-flexibility, who knows). <strike>Thanks for your passive-aggressive assertions tying my good faith work to anti-Semitism.</strike> <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 01:53, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Ju6613r, since I've already called out Oakshade on the bias issue, that last sentence looks excessive.

<dd>Yes, you are right; I think that I was a bit excessive on retrospect. I was a bit heated after finding these same comments spammed across multiple AfDs that I chose to contribute or initiate on this topic (and had the comment replaced when I pushed it to the discussion talk page on one of them).

<dd>"Spammed" is offensive. The comments were edited in only 3 of of the AfD's of Israeli law firms. Under the same criteria, one could argue that tagging almost ALL of the Israel law firm articles with either notability tags or AfDs is a much greater example of spamming, but since I consider editing and constructive critisism of edits not spam, I withold such a slur as I wish you had. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 04:04, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Oakshake, Ju6613r extended an olive branch by striking through a statement despite your rather stinging accusation of prejudice. In the etymological sense it is you who have <i>pre-judged</i>. Would you return the good faith by striking through the bias allegation? Everyone here seems to be a good editor and honest misunderstandings happen sometimes.

<dd>I made it very clear above that I'm not charging an anti-Israeli POV. As you mentioned in the responses in the AfD's, it's important to look out for something like that and when two users discuss tagging every Israeli law firm article, it does rais eybrows. As Edcolins indicates below, I wasn't the only editor who took notice of this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AEdcolins&amp;diff=100514711&amp;oldid=100463920" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AEdcolins&amp;diff=100514711&amp;oldid=100463920" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>. Still, this was no accusation. Please note that this section starts with the word "possible" and the introduction simply asked for attention. I appreciate other people looking into this as you have done, Durova. I will take your word that due to these users histories, there is not a demonstration of something anti-Israeli occurring. As far as the spamming comment, if Ju6616r strikes the spamming slur, I'll strike the response.--<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 23:02, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just speedy deleted the above page. I created it as an essay, and mine were the main contributions to the page, a couple were adding see also's and correcting grammar and wikification. I created it on a false premise, that it would explore the need for an article topic to have independent sourcing discuss it to warrant an article. It appears to have been interpreted more broadly than that, and is being pushed as a deletion tool. This was not my intent, therefore I'm asserting my right under the speedy criteria to delete it. I would have created it in user space had I realised it would be misinterpreted, therefore my mistake was in the arena of creation. I realise the essay has been linked to somewhat, so I am posting the decision here for review. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 13:40, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It has been linked too quite a lot, from several AfDs and talk pages. Having a red-link there might make those discussions seem a bit meaningless.

<dd>Hey, sorry if that upset you. I thought it was a reasonable way to handle the situation. If you feel strongly about an essay, the User namespace is the best place to develop it. As you've seen, stuff in the Wikipedia namespace can be seized upon and/or rewritten fairly quickly. That's how Wikipedia works. I suggest you take an early version of your essay and develop in your user space until you are happy with it, then advertise it, then move it to the Wikipedia namespace. The discussion on the talk page, <a href="../../../i/n/d/Wikipedia_talk%7EIndependent_sources_4c8a.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Independent sources">Wikipedia talk:Independent sources</a> helps with some understanding of what went wrong. The name ambiguity was a problem, as you say. Can't think of any suitable name for what you were trying to write about though, but I agree with your talk page comment, something is needed, though maybe as a point in a larger guideline. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 16:10, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

You might have looked at the talk page before deleting, as I've had the rug pulled out from under me on talk pages before, as the main page (and its associated talk page) get <b>speedy deleted</b>. In fact, I think the CSD criteria should include something about checking the talk page for recent discussion, as <i>good-faith</i> discussion on the talk page of any page would indicate that CSD is not quite the right way to go. There is indirect mention of talk pages at <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#Procedure_for_administrators" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD#Procedure_for_administrators</a>: <i>"The talk page may refer to previous deletion discussions."</i> I'm going to expand that to ask administrators to check talk pages before they speedy delete. I suspect many admins look at the page, then speedy delete both page and talk page with out looking at the talk page - which is obviously wrong. If you still believe that <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#G7" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD#G7</a> allowed you to delete that page, then please help to rephrase it to avoid future misunderstandings. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 17:05, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, I suspect someone would have restored it. I've seen several discussions like this where CSD G7 gets misinterpreted. I've never yet seen someone successfully get something deleted under G7 that the community had taken over and started using. And that's the reason why we are still discussing this - to avoid future misunderstandings like this. CSDs are not something that there is a wide latitude for interpretation on. For what it is worth, when the speedy deletion was contested, you could have undeleted and taken it to MfD instead. Anyway, apologies for dragging this out. I hope you understand why I felt I should clarify my understanding of these points. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 22:46, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Keesiewonder's analysis of the situation. This new user account is acting disruptively, and is obviously not a new user account. I agree with this new user that the article requires across-the-board condensation, and also that in the past things have gotten talked to death. However, simply coming in and slashing and burning is not the answer. --<a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMantanmoreland_c701.html" title="User:Mantanmoreland">Mantanmoreland</a> 15:54, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Checkuser outcome is declined with the statement "Unfortunately, we don't have records for Ptmccain, so there is no way to check if this is him." Can someone explain to me how this is possible, if 1) WP intended to indefinitely ban a user, and if 2)subsequent usernames were determined to be sockpuppets of Ptmccain?

<p>Why is this AN/I receiving so little attention? Even if it is reasonable for records to no longer exist for Ptmccain, why was checkuser not run for the other 3 current usernames, checking to see whether they are all one and the same?

<dd>Thank you, ReyBrujo. After it became apparent that Astrit wasn't going to explain his edits in any way (not even edit summaries), I have been trying to contact him in the article's talk page since January 11 and at <a href="../../../a/s/t/User_talk%7EAstrit_ec96.html" title="User talk:Astrit">User talk:Astrit</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Astrit&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Astrit&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">history</a>) since January 12. So far, Astrit has restricted himself to edit-war without communicating in any way. I will try again. - It appears to be another nationalist editor, trying to present his version of the truth with complete disregard for Wikipedia policies. - Best regards, <a href="../../../e/v/v/User%7EEvv_34c2.html" title="User:Evv">Evv</a> 03:08, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for your quick reply. I gather that this was a "Speedy Deletion", presumably because I tagged it "Copyrighted, used with permission". If I understand this correctly, it appears that <b>no</b> copyrighted images at all will now be accepted <i>even when permission is obtained</i>. If that is indeed so, why not simply state on the upload page that Wiki only allows Public Domain images?<a href="../../../j/g/h/User%7EJGHowes_89ea.html" title="User:JGHowes">JGHowes</a> 21:28, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Not to belabor the point, but the Upload Image page presents the Licensing choice: "The copyright holder gave me permission to use this work in Wikipedia articles". Why list a choice that is contrary to Wikipedia policy and results in Speedy Deletion without the courtesy of a message to the contributor's mytalk? Oh, and by the way, what the heck is "CC-ASA"? <a href="../../../j/g/h/User%7EJGHowes_89ea.html" title="User:JGHowes">JGHowes</a> 22:08, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's an interesting question. My gut feeling is that it remains so that users don't fudge licenses — if that's the license the image is under and they can't find it in the list, they'll just pick another, incorrect one, and while we're usually able to sniff that out, this makes it a little easier. And CC-A-SA is an abbreviation for a specific implementation of the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creative_Commons_licenses_d4d4.html" title="Creative Commons licenses">Creative Commons licenses</a>. There are 4 parts of CC, 2 of which are acceptable (A — Attribution, SA — ShareAlike) and 2 of which are not (NC — Non-commercial, ND — No derivatives). A CC license can generally combine any of the 4 in any arrangement, but any with NC or ND cannot be accepted.

<dd>If one attempts to upload an unsupported image, such as .bmp or .tif, immediately there's a popup window warning "Invalid file format".

<p>After repeated warnings for incivility and a block last month for WP:POINT and personal attacks, I've blocked Light current for 24 hours for recurring recent incivility. (He has taken to calling a couple of editors he disagrees with 'Hippo' and 'schizoid', he's also taken to calling Chairboy 'chairy' after he gave Light current a warning.)</p>
<p>Because I have been involved in the imbroglio at the Ref Desk over appropriate standards for behaviour there, I may be in a position where there is a perceived conflict of interest. I therefore ask for independent review of this block.</p>
<p>Before this comes up in another post, I've also issued several warnings to <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite"><tt class="userlinks" style="1.3em">Hipocrite</tt></a> (<span class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">talk</a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Hipocrite_2a8e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Hipocrite">contribs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">logs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../b/l/o/Special%7EBlockip_Hipocrite_b7d1.html" title="Special:Blockip/Hipocrite">block user</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">block log</a></span>) for repeated incivility.

(To clarify, I might be annoyed if someone called me Picaroony, but I wouldn't consider it a personal attack.) However, I have to agree, saying things like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Light_current&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=100781402" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Light_current&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=100781402" rel="nofollow">this</a> are blatant personal attacks. <a href="../../../p/i/c/User_talk%7EPicaroon9288_6280.html" title="User talk:Picaroon9288">Picaroon</a> 03:32, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No opinion on the block (other than perhaps surprise) since it was me he was called "schizophrenic". But, I continue to be concerned about erratic behavior from this editor. This is far from the first time we've seen him push the limits of tolerable behavior and then say he doesn't understand why he was blocked. If he wasn't doing useful article work, the answer would be obvious. Maybe he needs mentoring? <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 16:34, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>He says to rhyme with "boat", and I say "toe-att". (Also, he says "toMAHtoe" and I say "toMAYtoe", but let's call THAT whole thing off!) Here's my reasoning. Clearly he was not referring to <b>T</b>en <b>O</b>f <b>A</b>ll <b>T</b>rades, whom he calls "Ten". (I presume this is a Borg designation, like "Seven of Nine", rather than a step down from being a "Jack of All Trades".) Then, by analogy with "FOAF" ("Friend Of A Friend", "foe-aff", the ubiquitous source of urban legends), "TOAT" must mean "Trend Of A Trend", "toe-att", and he is discussing statistical derivatives, like the beginning of an upswing in the financial markets. Quite technical, and confusing to the uninitiated, but it shouldn't distress the lay readers, who can simply skip over that part.

<dd>As I endorsed the block just after having a (very minor) interaction with him over his deletion of a picture from an article, it may be that further input from an utterly uninvolved admin would be beneficial. The latest focus of his ire seems to be that he feels justified in ridiculing anyone with a lower edit count than he has got. I agree with Friday's point above that these blocks (while I still agree with them) do not seem to be having the right effect. I won't be in the least offended if anyone finds a better way to make this editor a more productive and collegial one. --<a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinnog_5d26.html" title="User:Guinnog">Guinnog</a> 18:31, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I didnt call someone 'juvenile'. I asked if his opinion was becuase he was a juvenile. careless remarks like this are likely to inflame an already difficult situation between us.

<dl>
<dd>To be fair, the user that Light current called a juvenile does self-identify on his user page as a teenager. This is the problem - Light current sails very close to the wind, and seems to think that by having a few grains of truth scattered about what he says, he can get away with things. He needs to learn that such behaviour is not clever, and will probably get him blocked. Equally unfortunately, he got a chip on his shoulder after his first block, and now seems determined to continue his behaviour, while being self-righteous at the same time. I'm out of ideas as well, except maybe just to (within reason) ignore his behaviour and hope he will grow out of it. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 00:56, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I was the target of the "freshman" jibe that resulted in his latest block, therefore its probably best if I decline to comment of that specifically. However, Light current is the very definition of a tendencious editor, in my opinion. The tendency being that what he says/thinks is <i>always correct</i>, even when person after person independently informs his that his behaviour is not acceptable within Wikipedia norms. No matter how logical, friendly or sensitively one frames an explanation, Light current will attempt to wikilawyer the discussion to one of a few themes:
<ol>
<li>The person making a request is not old enough, have enough edits, or enough of a (usually RD) regular to have a valid opinion.</li>
<li>The person is an admin who is "out to get" him or looking to abuse their powers.</li>
<li>The person is not obeying the very letter of Light current's interpretation of some policy (which he will usually quote <i>ad infinitum</i>)</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Combine with this a remarkable ability to generate a straw man argument out of pretty much anything, and what happens is that a neutral admin will very soon become an adversary to Light current. He then finds an angle per 1) and starts to see how far he can push the bounds of civility before he gets blocked. When the inevitable block comes he uses it to fuel his complaints per 2) and 3). This cycle perpetuates the perceived injustice he feels, yet what he cannot see is that they are entirely of his own making. I have never blocked him, only having asked him to stop namecalling, yet am already firmly labeled among "rookie/freshmen" admins who abuse their tools. Despite his now numerous blocks for gross and persistent incivility leading to disruption, there appears to be no lessons learned. I honestly don't see how he is going to stop of his own volition. <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockpocket_2e94.html" title="User:Rockpocket"><font color="green">Rockpock</font></a><font color="black">e</font><a href="../../../r/o/c/User_talk%7ERockpocket_62af.html" title="User talk:Rockpocket"><font color="green">t</font></a> 02:34, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If Im shown where I have breached the letter of the rules, I will be the first to admit it, apologise profusely, and take any punishment gracefully. Trouble is , nobody can ever point to anything specific, they just go on their interpretations of the rules which are purely matters of individual judgement. Why should the judgement of a few Admins override the opinions of the majority of editors when Admins make up only 0.03% of the total no of users. This percentage figure shows the gross imbalance of forces on the RDs in particular. You can see why ordinary editors like me and Sturat feel under attack all the time? Whatever we say is shouted down my Admins and if we complain, we get blocked!</dd>
<dd>Any way apologies if I offended you. I was merely pointing out that there are a lot of editors out there who have a hell of a lot more exerience than a lot of Admins (esp recent Admins)</dd>

<p>There was a fairly graphic image on the ejaculation article&#160;:Image:Ejaculation sample.jpg that has been the topic of dicusssion of that article. We had been discussing a variety of things, including linkimaging the image, replacing with two other images, and such. At some time in the past few hours, the image suddently turned black. Looking at the image page itself, it looks as if the image, history and everything exist, but all versions of the image have been removed. There is no talk, and no discussion about this as far as I can tell. This seems to either be vandalism at an admin level or higher, or a decision that has been made outside of the normal protocol of wikipedia (certainly there is no discussion of it on the image page, or in the article it was used.) If there is some secret cabal to censor images, or some admin behind it, then we need to have discussions about this, as people would leave Wikipedia in droves. There may be very good reasons for removal of the image. But the discussion of such things should follow normal wikipedia protocol, or if there is some secret protocol then it needs to be revealed. If someone could look into this and correct it, I would appreciate it. <a href="../../../a/t/o/User%7EAtomaton_fe94.html" title="User:Atomaton">Atom</a> 14:32, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>No, that wasn't that. Every past reversion was black'd also. Only an admin could do that, not an unregistered user. Well, it does seem a bit odd that it was gone until I complained about it and someone looked into it. I responded to another persons inquiry on the talk page of the article, so this affected others as well. Also, BTW oddly enough it now appear's in two places on the talk page of the article where it is used, but not in two other places where it is used. (non appeared five minutes ago). I suspect that there is a filter to prevent certain images from being used except in specific articles where they are "approved" to be listed. Perhaps to prevent use of the image for vandalism on other articles? Try looking at it on the image page itself (:Image:Ejaculation sample.jpg). Also, I note looking at the image history, it has been altered since a half hour ago. Notably the contributor had two entires. One where he put the image in, and then a few days later when he added the licensing info. Now the one where he put the licensing in is gone. Very unusual. <a href="../../../a/t/o/User%7EAtomaton_fe94.html" title="User:Atomaton">Atom</a> 15:02, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Fine. Now that I complained that my reversion was not there, it suddenly appears, along with a reversion that I didn't make. Also, all of the reversion images work now, instead of being black. This is clearly some kind of manipulation of the image history by an admin. If other admins could look into things to find out what is going on, I would appreciate it. <a href="../../../a/t/o/User%7EAtomaton_fe94.html" title="User:Atomaton">Atom</a> 15:15, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Any chance that cache problems in your browser were responsible for you seeing only the blacked out revision, Atom? I've been bitten by that before here, and I would have expected someone to have figured out if an admin had done something bad, there's logs for everything. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChairboy_157e.html" title="User:Chairboy">C<small>HAIRBOY</small></a> (<a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChairboy_882d.html" title="User talk:Chairboy">☎</a>) 16:09, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for the ideas. I forced a refresh of the page first thing. Plus, my reason for questioning it was a message on the talk page of the article where another user had complained of the image being blackened. At least one user responding to my complaint here indicated it was missing for them as well. All images worked fine on the main article and on the talk page, except for the references to that image (shown once in the article and four times on the talk page). On the image page itself, it was blackened, as were every single version in the revision history. I think it highly likely that his was some behind the scenes work, based on the evidence. The modification in the edit history (missing revisions that were there before) and inconsistencies between edit dates and times, as well as the sudden resurfacing of the image just after I complained leads me to that conclusion. Contact me on my talk page for further discussion. At the moment, the image works again. <a href="../../../a/t/o/User%7EAtomaton_fe94.html" title="User:Atomaton">Atom</a> 17:05, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I can look now. I see nothing, no evidence of any maelevolent behind the scenes twiddling at the Wikipedia end. I find it highly likely that there was no malicious behind the scenes twiddling.

<dd>As the person who initially noted it was missing, I can eliminate cache as the issue. I'm running with all caching disabled. When I close the browser, all information (cookies, history, pages, images, etc.) are lost. Each time I restart my browser and return to a page, I am seeing a fresh copy, not a locally stored version. If something isn't looking right and I can refresh the page manually or I can restart the browser and look again. In this case, I did both. -- <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoseph_S_Atkinson_b94d.html" title="User:Joseph S Atkinson">jsa</a> 02:22, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>When I did a check on the articles I created, I came across this editor. They added middle names to articles of young British actors and changed birthdays without references. I know the edit he did on the page I created was factually wrong and sources for some of the other articles he edited suggests they're wrong too. He probably committed sneaky vandalism. Could someone with more time on their hands run through his contributions and revert any unsourced and factually incorrect edits?

<p>There was an on-going discussion concerning the proposed deletion of the MWHS Mami Wata Healers Society Page of which none of the admins presented convincing evidence or argument that the article was in violation of wiki policy or in need of improvement. Although there was a "consensus" by some editors who are friends of the admin, of having the page deleted, we believe this effort was conspiratorially spearheaded by this admin in retaliation for us contributing heavily to an article he has written. When we went to post more discussion, the article was removed completely without our being officially informed of the final discussion or outcome. We are requesting an admin to intervene and immediately undelete the article so that a fair settlement can be agreed.

<p>It looks to me like his evidence is the editing pattern, which we do accept here as evidence of sockpuppetry. When he says "no evidence," he seems to be referring to the incomplete checkuser request. Let's not get hung up on semantics; if Travb is right, then we have a major (not to mention newsworthy) conflict of interest here, and that is the problem that needs to be addressed. | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">Mr. Darcy</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a></small> 15:34, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually that rule <b>suggests</b> not editing articles where a possible COI exists, but does not prohibit it. While I agree that the deletions these editors or single editor made were aggressive in there ANTI-ANTI FIRESTONE nature, they do not break any rules. While I may have edited similar sections of the page, you will see from edit history that I did not just delete sections but tried to bring them to what I believe are a NPOV section. I am sure that lots of corporate articles are started by the employees of those companies and then edited by others later on. I do not see anything wrong with an employee editing an article about it's company if those edits help to improve the article. As explained on my talk page, I have a history with tyre manufacture dating back 36 years and my efforts on this page have been to improve the article and return it to NPOV. Currently been forced into an edit war protection over the article by Travb who is the initiator of this discussion here. regardless of what these two or one editors and possible sock LucaZ edited on the article, it has nothing to do with me and is being used as support for this users persecution of me. See Travb/m and the sock puppet accusation he has placed on my name page <a href="../../../m/o/b/User%7EMobile_01_c54b.html" title="User:Mobile 01">User:Mobile 01</a>. Thanks for allowing me to have a say in this and I wish you good and happy 2007 from The Land Down-Under. <a href="../../../m/o/b/User%7EMobile_01_c54b.html" title="User:Mobile 01"><font size="2"><font color="green"><b>Mobile 01</b></font></font></a><a href="../../../m/o/b/User_talk%7EMobile_01_2f77.html" title="User talk:Mobile 01"><i><sup><font color="red">Talk</font></sup></i></a> 12:52, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>I think there is a serious amount of civility/npa issues on all three of those deletion discussions. Some of the rationales have nothing to do with our deletion policy and some even conflict it. --<small><a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Cat_eb3e.html" title="User:Cool Cat">Cat</a> <a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Cat_0d3e.html" title="User talk:Cool Cat">out</a></small> 18:46, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Consensus opinion amongst the voters over at CfD seems to be diametrically opposed to yuor point of view; I'd say that there really isn't anything here for an administrator to correct. --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScimitar_bbe8.html" title="User:Scimitar">Scimitar</a> 20:09, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The "consensus" (consensus will be determied at the end of CfD) of the CfD is beyond the scope of this complaint, that is soemthing completely different. All CfD discussions are expected to be preformed in a civil tone not violating <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> and other similar complimentary policies. My complaint is a lack of that. --<small><a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Cat_eb3e.html" title="User:Cool Cat">Cat</a> <a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Cat_0d3e.html" title="User talk:Cool Cat">out</a></small> 20:36, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I said "seems to be" because consensus was not yet determined, although, personally, I doubt the outcome is in much doubt. As for the lack of civility, I really don't see that an administrator can do much more about it than any other editor can.--<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScimitar_bbe8.html" title="User:Scimitar">Scimitar</a> 21:37, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I've taken another look and made some comments; some of those editors disagreeing with you are being less than civil, but, that said, I really don't see anything here to get worked up about.--<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScimitar_bbe8.html" title="User:Scimitar">Scimitar</a> 21:46, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It would be fine for me if they were given a strong warning. I did warn one of them twice but it had no effect on behaviour.

<dd>Some people might think "Why must you be so dense" was commenting on the contributor rather than the content. Whether you see anything problematic or not, I'm fairly sure that there's a policy page somewhere that says not to do that. I'm not here to give free advice, but if I were going to come shopping for warnings, I'd want to make very sure I had followed the relevant policy down to the last jot. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 01:33, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There's a devoted spammer who has been using Wikipedia as a soapbox at least since the year 2005. He always registers a disposable account and uses it to post horrible, all-caps, poorly formatted preaching/crackpottery page.</p>

<p>I have bumped into this user on some 9/11 articles today. I found them adding a cartoon to a 9/11 conspiracy template, arguing that it is directly relevant to the 9/11 conspiracy theory page since the cartoon was joking on 9/11. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:911ct&amp;curid=8923018&amp;diff=101556730&amp;oldid=101556346" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:911ct&amp;curid=8923018&amp;diff=101556730&amp;oldid=101556346" rel="nofollow">[54]</a> They then went and removed the same template from the September 11th attacks page, which one would think is more relevant then a cartoon episode. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=September_11%2C_2001_attacks&amp;curid=5058690&amp;diff=101556475&amp;oldid=101555436" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=September_11%2C_2001_attacks&amp;curid=5058690&amp;diff=101556475&amp;oldid=101555436" rel="nofollow">[55]</a> I do not wish to get into an edit war, especially since they are an admin, but this editing pattern makes little sense. How can a cartoon be more relevant to 9/11 conspiracy then the 9/11 page itself. I am asking an admin to please ask Tom to cease this disruptive editing. The additions to the template devalue it, as much as adding South Park hitler episodes to WW2 template. In the same hand the removal of the template from the 9/11 article makes little sense, as it contains the 9/11 conspiracy theories and is the main article all the others are based around. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 14:19, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>The overall issue is a content dispute which covers <a href="../../../9/1/1/Template%7E911ct.html" title="Template:911ct">Template:911ct</a> whose design criteria are illustrated on its talk page. As the creator of this template after a consensus elsewhere I am simply concerned that major changes to it (ie structural changes) are made after a consensus is built, and that it is deployed in accordance with a consensus on its purpose. I think raising it here under an editor's name is somewhat premature when the template's own talk page is being used to build the various consensus needed. However, the fact that it is raised here invites many more editors to visit the <a href="../../../9/1/1/Template_talk%7E911ct.html" title="Template talk:911ct">talk page</a> and to participate, should they desire, in consensus building. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 14:52, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

What coverage they do get is in less reputable venues, and I really don't see what the problem is in adding pop culture references to the template.

<p>Help! I noticed the re-creation of a deleted article (deleted as speedy following unanimous AfD today) by user:KiddyFlidders and tagged it for speedy deletion. A little later, the speedy tag was removed by user:172.142.133.127. The speedy tag was re-added by user:I Love Baldurs Gate, but subsequently removed once again by 172.142.133.127. He also added a section stating the film as fictional. I've considered simply re-adding the tag once again, but it will probably be removed, it's been subject to one AfD discussion already, so I'm not sure an AfD would do much especially in light of the user's apparent resistance to allowing wikipedia process to work.

<dd>First of all... Shame on you edit waring to keep warnings on his talk page. That's inappropriate. And has escalated the dispute further, leading into the personal attacks. When someone simply removes a warning, simply take note as evidence that the person has read the warning.</dd>
<dd>Now, I'm not trying to defend his actions... making personal attacks, messing with archived AFDs, and edit waring are all unacceptable behaviors.

<p>This user has uploaded several automotive promotional photos and passed them off as GFDL. Prior to that, he took images from eBay Motors ad passed them off as his own. The last two he uploaded were done after I had notified him of the copryvio on his other images. He has also uploded two Oldsmobile logos as GFDL. I believe them to be ripped off, but there is no evidence to prove it outside of his general lack of respect for copyright. --<a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESable232_a828.html" title="User:Sable232">Sable232</a> 02:51, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Blocked 48 hours for POV-pushing spam and incivility. A stronger warning than the one already there would have been nice, but the user's been doing this for month with no useful edits and I doubt we're missing anything while he's gone. If he returns I'll block for a longer period to reflect the length of time he's been doing this.

<p>How you doing today? I am in total agreeance with my fellow Dragon Ball editor. This Jrapidfire has not only personally attack people trying to make him understand and warn him about his way but he has went on many articles involving the Dragon Ball character Broly and has put much <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_Research_bdeb.html" title="Original Research">Original Research</a> into Broly's article and has go to sites like www.Answers.com, a Site that gets it references to there article for this site, and has copied and paste the old info answer.com has from the article before changes were made with official facts back onto the article Broly: Second Coming. His apparent obsession with Broly is clouding his or her judgment and is disregard for the truth told to him or her has lead him to attack editors personally as well as vandalize many talk page subject to help him or her understand. Yes as my fellow user Dark Dragon Flame as suggested this user needs to be banned.

<p>Adding my two cents as well: Jrapidfire completely ignores attempts to curb his vandalism. He repeatedly deletes notes on the <a href="../../../b/r/o/Talk%7EBroly%7E_Second_Coming_afd5.html" title="Talk:Broly: Second Coming">Talk Page</a> requesting "whoever" is adding OR, to stop.

The user has now added {{<a href="../../../u/n/b/Template%7EUnblock_0164.html" title="Template:Unblock">unblock</a>}} to his talk page and as this is my first real unilateral block decision (the other three came from AIV, or, in one case, was an obvious sock of a banned user), I wanted to request a review.

<dd>I support either a community ban in general (given his increasing incivility) or a topic ban on articles related to creationism and evolution in the broad sense.

<dd>This is getting ridiculous. This guy has done very little but troll in the time he's been here. I recommend a lengthy block - maybe 72 hours, or even a week - and for it to be made absolutely clear to him that what he is doing is just not on. Mind you, if anyone wants to block indef, I won't be calling for your desysopping. I can just about envisage this fellow turning into a decent editor, but it's a stretch. Block now and the next time he trolls kick him out for good. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoreschi_31bb.html" title="User:Moreschi">Moreschi</a> <sup><a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Deletionism_9106.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Deletionism">Deletion!</a></sup> 22:12, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It's unfortunate that the situation got so out of control that FeloniousMonk set up a whole separate page on <a href="../../../i/n/t/Talk%7EIntelligent_design_be07.html" title="Talk:Intelligent design">Talk:Intelligent design</a> for Raspor's and another editor's various rants and rapid-fire diatribes. I support FM's way of dealing with the situation, which had gotten well beyond reason. That page alone (<a href="../../../i/n/t/Talk%7EIntelligent_design_Raspor%27s_and_adlac%27s_objections_141b.html" title="Talk:Intelligent design/Raspor's and adlac's objections">Talk:Intelligent design/Raspor's and adlac's objections</a>) is already at 137kB of content (a couple kB of which is due to my own attempts at response/explanation/conciliation, along with similar conciliatory attempts by several other users). Raspor has settled down just a bit of late on <a href="../../../i/n/t/Talk%7EIntelligent_design_be07.html" title="Talk:Intelligent design">Talk:Intelligent design</a>, and [s]he's mostly respected the request to post comments on the page that was set up to accommodate the various shotgun-style objections and accusations (though I see he's moved his activities to some other pages in the meantime). I'm in favor of a temporary block, perhaps a week, if only to give it a rest for awhile, take a forced wiki-break, and hopefully have Raspor come back (if [s]he wishes) with more of an orientation towards interactive discussion and contribution rather than just ranting. ... <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenosis_581f.html" title="User:Kenosis">Kenosis</a> 04:02, 9 January 2007 (UTC) I now see Jayjig appears to already have blocked Raspor for a week.

<li>Support this course of action - if this editor returns and makes one more personal attack, I support indef. The "fellatio" remark alone is beyond the pale, and one look at the talk page of his Rfc shows mutiple personal attacks and a total lack of interest in being even remotely civil. His goal seems disruption and trolling, with one or two productive edits buried amongst thousands of counter-productive hostile rants.

<p>For the record, I believe that some of the comments in this section are incorrect and/or misleading. I question the claim that "there was a huge turn out from both sides of the debate"; it seems that most if not all of the people objecting to him are on one side of the debate (and not his side, of course!). I'm not sure what the claim that "he simply shugged (sic) off his last block" means; he was new, didn't know about the three-reverts rule, but now does and hasn't reoffended on that. And although I agree he has been aggressive and abusive, it was largely in response to others insulting him or being abusive to him. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_J._Rayment_3d07.html" title="User:Philip J.

<dd>For the record I am in full support of this ban. Based on how he has responded poorly to even the numerous calm and friendly attempts to guide him I suspect he'll be back to his disruptive ways as soon as the ban is lifted. With that in mind I think he has no business editing any ID or ID related articles until he demonstrates an ability to respect other editors, Wiki policies. He could do that by limiting his edits to non-controversial subjects. <a href="../../../m/r/_/User%7EMr_Christopher_e7f1.html" title="User:Mr Christopher">Mr Christopher</a> 01:21, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Looking at Raspor's edits to his talk since he's been blocked, I see he's not only continued the personal attacks/name calling, but escalated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Raspor&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=99627885" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Raspor&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=99627885" rel="nofollow">[104]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ARaspor&amp;diff=99782144&amp;oldid=99779016" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ARaspor&amp;diff=99782144&amp;oldid=99779016" rel="nofollow">[105]</a> and has made his talk page a locus of disruption drawing responses from a number of editors. Considering that even while in the pokey he's continued the very sort of disruption that landed him there in the first place, misusing the one priveledge he retained while blocked to turn his talk page into a source of friction, I think Raspor is a hopeless case and therefore a permanent block is the only thing that will put an end to the disruption. And sooner rather than later to spare the community any additional time and goodwill being wasted. <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 18:17, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My thanks too for your admirable and patient words. One problem that came up earlyish was that when I requested raspor to stop trolling, he took this as a personal attack and repeatedly complained about it. The <a href="../../../t/r/o/WP%7ETROLL_3085.html" title="WP:TROLL">WP:TROLL</a> article definition is dependant on motive, which of course is impossible to judge, and so is useless for defining behaviour which is what's important. The <a href="../../../d/e/_/WP%7EDE_3fff.html" title="WP:DE">WP:DE</a> article focusses on article edits rather than talk page disruption. Should these guidelines be changed or clarified? .. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_souza_a1d9.html" title="User:Dave souza">dave souza</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDave_souza_f5b4.html" title="User talk:Dave souza">talk</a> 22:15, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"<i>...when I requested raspor to stop trolling, he took this as a personal attack and repeatedly complained about it.</i>" That's typical 'victim bully' behavior. Dean Dad, in writing about <i>The College Administrator's Survival Guide</i>, by C.K. Gunsalus (Harvard U Press, 2006), notes that Gunsalus distinguishes between traditional, assertive bullies, who throw their weight around with bluster and force, and 'victim bullies,' who use claims of having been wronged to gain leverage over others. He goes on to write "that unlike simple passive-aggression, victim bullies use accusations as weapons, and ramp up the accusations over time. Unlike a normal person, who would slink away in shame as the initial accusations are discredited, a victim bully lacks either guilt or shame, honestly believing that s/he has been so egregiously wronged in some cosmic way that anything s/he does or says is justified in the larger scheme of things. So when the initial accusations are dismissed, the victim bully’s first move is a sort of double-or-nothing, raising the absurdity and the stakes even more. Victim bullies thrive in the no-man's-land created by the deadly combination of slow and cumbersome processes, and failure of administerial nerve. I've had some experience with these, and I can say without reservation that they are, by far, my least favorite editors to wrangle. It's not just that they're unpleasant and batshit crazy; they're self-righteously unpleasant and batshit crazy. They're implausibly persistent. Gunsalus makes the correct point that the key to defeating victim bullies is the classic administrative pincer movement of process-and-time. Easier said than done, but still right." <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 17:39, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for that information, FM. On his talk page Raspor coninues to demonstrate a profound lack of understanding of fundamental Wikipedia editing policies as well as being unfamiliar with intelligent design in general (as evidenced <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Raspor#is_ID_science_.3F.3F.3F" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Raspor#is_ID_science_.3F.3F.3F" rel="nofollow">here</a>). This is something he has shown since day one. I suspect he has either not yet studied any of our policies or has decided they are of no use to him. This makes working with him impossible. If he'd spend some time actually learning our policies his disruptions would go down by 99% or so. With this is mind, what happens after his block is lifted? I mean from an administrative standpoint, I pretty much know what to expect from him but I'm curious if/when he starts acting out again, will a new Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents report need to be submitted or will we utilize this existing one? And will there be an administrator assigned to monitor his behaviour? <a href="../../../m/r/_/User%7EMr_Christopher_e7f1.html" title="User:Mr Christopher">Mr Christopher</a> 18:34, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

He seems to be looking for the word "theory" now in every article and inisting we change the other articles to read like the ID one. How can we work with such a person when he begins posting on the article talk page again and not just on his own personal talk page? <a href="../../../m/r/_/User%7EMr_Christopher_e7f1.html" title="User:Mr Christopher">Mr Christopher</a> 18:47, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To answer the "what next" question - it all depends on how Raspor acts after the block runs out. If he decides to act within accepted norms, then he will probably be given a second chance.

<p>I admit only spot checking his contribs, but this seems like a case where someone, a subject expert, feels his areas of expertise are being poorly represented by the articles and subject novices who are "equal" with him in the WP system. The user is thus getting frustrated and some apparent mob rule against him by other editors is been making matters worse. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">CyberAnth</a> 21:22, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not sure who's who in your analogy. However, raspor has shown no expertise, rather an uncanny ability to play on people's desire to explain things, then pick on points with a remarkable resemblance to standard creationist arguments and interpret or ignore the answers to emerge triumphantly having proved his point.

<dd>From the link you gave and the link he gave therein referencing his talk page on the matter, the user obviously appears pretty knowledgeable about ID (or whatever naming variants it goes by). He seems to feel his expertise area is being very poorly represented in articles. He appears to have gotten very frustrated and, from it, done some communication games; but I think this is more a reaction to what really does appear to me as some "mob rule" against him and his views. Keep in mind that my analysis here is coming from someone who is looking in from the outside. You might want to give him an olive branch and really listen to his concerns and see how they can be incorporated into the article some more. In short, appease him by addressing his concerns some more. No one will get their fill plate. That means everyone. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">CyberAnth</a> 02:37, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you for clarifying. I am perplexed as I have been studying <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligent_design.html" title="Intelligent design">intelligent design</a> for several years now, I routinely read both sides of the debate even today. I have also read a tremendous amout of posts and responses from raspor since he stumbled upon the intelligent design article and I have yet to read a single item written by him that suggests he has even a conversational understanding of <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligent_design.html" title="Intelligent design">intelligent design</a>. and certainly not a subject expert on intelligent design. But based on what you have expressed I am obviously overlooking very important information and evidence that should be weighed in this Administrators' noticeboard/Incident. Would you mind helping out by showing a few diffs/examples where raspor has demonstrated a subject expertise in <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligent_design.html" title="Intelligent design">intelligent design</a>? Thank will help me and I think others here quite a bit. Thanks again. &lt;insert&gt; also, some examples where he simply came accross as "obviously knowledgable" would help too. <a href="../../../m/r/_/User%7EMr_Christopher_e7f1.html" title="User:Mr Christopher">Mr Christopher</a> 06:40, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>&lt;reduce indent&gt; Intriguing. I appreciate that CyberAnth has only been able to spot check raspor's contributions before commenting, and the sympathy is entirely understandable. However the impression that raspor was immediately set upon by a mob is not supported by looking at his start on the ID article. His first contribution there on 22 December was unfortunate, as he deleted the previous post and was reverted.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AIntelligent_design&amp;diff=96742833&amp;oldid=95875270" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AIntelligent_design&amp;diff=96742833&amp;oldid=95875270" rel="nofollow">[109]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Intelligent_design&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=96742833" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Intelligent_design&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=96742833" rel="nofollow">[110]</a> with the comment <i>(please do not remove or edit others' posts)</i>, then he did the same again on the talk page<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Intelligent_design&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=96745268" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Intelligent_design&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=96745268" rel="nofollow">[111]</a> and on the page of the editor who'd reverted the first comment.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKillerChihuahua&amp;diff=96746439&amp;oldid=96722113" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKillerChihuahua&amp;diff=96746439&amp;oldid=96722113" rel="nofollow">[112]</a> This could of course be a newbie's error, but oddly enough it's a mistake raspor did not make almost a month earlier when first editing a talk page.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Gurch&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=90767403" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Gurch&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=90767403" rel="nofollow">[113]</a> Anyway, that mistake was sorted out and discussion resumed at <a href="../../../i/n/t/Talk%7EIntelligent_design_Archive33_5edd.html#Permission" title="Talk:Intelligent design/Archive33">Permission</a>. If you read down you'll find editors responding to raspor's opinions by asking him to "please read" archives at links they provided, "If you have some new points which have not been hashed out already, please feel free to bring them up" and to "Please provide a reliable source" for his assertions. He did not do the latter, despite having learnt the hard way about the need to cite sources on his first article by the 28th of November.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sharen_Gravelle&amp;oldid=90667656" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sharen_Gravelle&amp;oldid=90667656" rel="nofollow">[114]</a> His responses lack such niceties of politeness, and introduce allegations of bias and inaccuracy without any supporting citations. If that's being set upon by a mob, it was a remarkably polite and patient mob. .. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_souza_a1d9.html" title="User:Dave souza">dave souza</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDave_souza_f5b4.html" title="User talk:Dave souza">talk</a> 10:26, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>CyberAnth: you said <i>the user obviously appears pretty knowledgeable about ID</i>. Really? I have not seen any evidence that Raspor knows much about ID at all. On the contrary, s/he seems to be sadly unaware of much of the issues surrounding ID. In fact, Raspor recently said that s/he was <i>starting to read</i> the <a href="../../../w/e/d/Wedge_document.html" title="Wedge document">Wedge document</a>, which is one of the fundamental documents related to ID. While Raspor is very aggressive in his/her assertions, s/he has not displayed much knowledge of either ID or science. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 16:04, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>CyberAnth is mistaken, Raspor is hardly a subject matter expert. As seen at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Raspor_6760.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Raspor">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Raspor</a> he is regarded as not knowledgable on the topic of ID by every credible long time contributor to that article. The fact is the greatest cause of Raspor's problems here, other than his refusal to comprehend and follow our policies, is his incomplete knowledge of the subject matter. He is apparently either aware of only one side's opinion, or he is intentionally promoting only that side's view, neither of which makes for good editing. <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 17:38, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Indeed he is now accusing an administrator (who has been doing an exemplary job if you ask me)of "siding with the darwinists" and also stating she is "biased" and he wants to know who "monitors" her.

<dd>Presumably the ban will stick if no admin will unblock, but is 5 hours long enough for a community ban to be discussed? From the sound of it, the block is totally justified, but from <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAN_eb66.html#Community_ban" title="WP:BAN">WP:BAN#Community_ban</a>:</dd>

<dd>"There have been situations where a user has exhausted the community's patience to the point where he or she finds themselves blocked. Administrators who block in these cases should be sure that there is widespread community support for the block, and should note the block on the Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents as part of the review process. Additionally, "community ban" wording should be noted in the block log. With such support, the user is considered banned and must be listed on Wikipedia:List of banned users (under "Community"). Community bans must be supported by a strong consensus and should never be enacted based on agreement between a handful of admins or users."</dd>

<dd>Hmmm. I can't defend his reaction to Merope's posts on his talk page, and any defence I put up of him would be outweighed by everyone else, so I have little doubt that this ban would have happened anyway. But I do wonder about the integrity of a discussion on a ban that is over so quickly that it's finished before one of his main defenders (me) even knows it's happening.

I was under the impression that the Arbcom can override us any time they wish, if they choose to do so.

<dd>The wording at <a href="../../../b/a/n/Wikipedia%7EBanning_policy_2e63.html#Appeals_process" title="Wikipedia:Banning policy">WP:BAN</a> seems, indeed, ambiguous. Your take on it sounds much more realistic. I've been wondering if we shouldn't somehow take into account Raspor's apparent age and/or inexperience in cooperating with others. His behavior may well change over time even if he does not consciously acknowledge what he did wrong and decide to follow Wikipedia's rules in the future. I would like to welcome him back as soon as he is ready to do the latter. An appeal would provide that option. <a href="../../../a/v/b/User%7EAvb_3038.html" title="User:Avb">AvB</a> ÷ <a href="../../../a/v/b/User_talk%7EAvb_5b28.html" title="User talk:Avb"><small>talk</small></a> 13:19, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have had a hard time figuring out whether Raspor is unable to see the problem, or whether he is just trolling. As I have said in the past, I am willing to support a community ban only on articles related to evolution and creation, including talk pages, for some extended period (like a month, initially) to give him/her the opportunity to learn to be a Wikipedian on topics that are both less controversial and (hopefully) ones s/he can approach from a more dispassionate position. A week away didn't help. So either a month away from Wikipedia, or a month away from evolution and creation related articles (broadly defined), with the option to extend it to other topics if s/he behaves similarly elsewhere. Obviously if my suggestion is followed, Raspor should be given the choice of which option s/he prefers. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 14:49, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>&lt;reduce indent&gt;For that it is worth I doubt he would behave any better on less controversial subject only because his comments tell me he either has never read a single Wiki policy or has no use for them. Even his post ban comments on his talk page reflect he still doesn't get it and believes he is being victimized by "darwinists". His inability to objectively observe his own behaviour makes him a social liability in any setting. If there is a discussion of "lessening" his ban I don't care what he edits as long as it is not ID, evo, biology or science related. That said I would pity those editors who find themselves having to work with him on any subject. Philip J. Rayment has shown an interst in him, perhaps we might let him work with Phil on an article where he has been a significant contributor. <a href="../../../m/r/_/User%7EMr_Christopher_e7f1.html" title="User:Mr Christopher">Mr Christopher</a> 16:29, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>For the record, I agree with Christopher. Raspor did not appear to ever demonstrate any interest in understanding the fundamental tenets that Wikipedia is founded on, reading policy pages, or cooperating with other editors who civilly disagreed with him. He appeared to construe text that did not openly advocate for the ideas he preferred as deeply biased against his cause. In spite of the effort that I exhausted in trying to help him, he appeared to have one idea set in his head from his first edit to a page regarding the controversial topic he edited at. I am sorry to see him blocked for exhausting community patience, but I understand the reasoning behind it. --<a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHassourZain_3b99.html" title="User:HassourZain">HassourZain</a> 18:41, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The user persisted past warnings and explanation, and I blocked for 24 hours. I'd advise blocking for the duration of the RfA if he continues after this.

<dd>I would hope not. The "campaign" was disruptive (at least in terms of the time spent on dealing with it, attempts at influencing an RfA, and in terms of userpage "spam"). Seems like a reasonable block to me. <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECrimsone_36a6.html" title="User:Crimsone">Crimsone</a> 18:37, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Do I report problems here, what is the difference betweent this place and noticeboard?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, please report incidents that require administrator attention here. The noticeboard itself is more intended for discussion of bigger issues relating to administrative work, and notices of issues that may impinge upon them. Nobody will penalise anyone for using the wrong one, though, but the message may get moved.
