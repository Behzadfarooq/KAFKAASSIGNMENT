<p>I'm not sure what can be done of if action is even merited, but I want to bring attention to a certain user who <i>seems</i> to be just charging ahead without actually knowing what they're doing. The user in question is <a href="../../../l/t/2E/User%7ELt._Col._Cole_6ce1.html" title="User:Lt. Col. Cole">User:Lt. Col.

I noticed some pretty bad grammar in one of this users contributions so I corrected it then did a little poking to see if this was a one time thing or it was consistent. When I looked over this users contribs I found that there is a history of uploading images without proper tag (several of which have been deleted), and a few cases where he/she is just duplicating content which is eventually redirected by another user (I did one). See these...</p>

<dd>How in the world can one be a <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppet_9d8b.html" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppet">sock puppet</a> of the other, when a sock puppet, by definition, is "an additional username used by a Wikipedian who edits under more than one name"? In this case, there isn't even <i>one</i> username, let alone two? What's more, there's no evidence provided of any attempts to avoid a ban or other disciplinary action, nor an attempt to increase the perceived support for any particular campaign. In short, there is no sockpuppet there.</dd>
<dd>By the way, even if they're the same person, there's not even any reason to assume that they're trying to appear under a different IP address. They're both simply coming from Road Runner accounts. It's my understanding that Road Runner assigns dynamic IP addresses, no? <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBladestorm_00c0.html" title="User:Bladestorm">Bladestorm</a> 01:10, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>he is follow me and have many friend harass me so i ignore or try ignore but is not do good for me he follow me around. <a href="../../../6/9/2E/User%7E69.132.199.100.html" title="User:69.132.199.100">69.132.199.100</a> 00:54, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The "many friends" in question include an admin and a well-known user. In fact, I think those are the only two who "follow" him "around", warning him against his disruptive editing practices. As for me, I have the Shelby Young pages that on my watchlist, hence I'm able to view any changes he and others make. The whole issue stems from a credit, which was disputed by myself and some others. I spoke with a few editors, did a Google, and was satisfied Shelby had, in fact, been involved in the film. A sort of "silent consensus" has been reached, in the fact that no other user has tried to remove the credit and the fact that the actual Shelby, <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShelbyyoung_93fa.html" title="User:Shelbyyoung">Shelbyyoung</a>, has, in fact stated her involvement in the film. He has moved on, all right, to trashing Shelby's usertalk page, claiming it's not her, and that the photo she provided (now not in existence in Wikipedia) was photoshopped. The identity of <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShelbyyoung_93fa.html" title="User:Shelbyyoung">Shelbyyoung</a> was confirmed here by bbatsell a few days ago.</p>
<p>To address Bladestorm's statement, yes, a sockpuppet is an additional username used by a Wikipedian who edits under more than one name. However, IP addresses here are treated as usernames. Yes they are both coming from roadrunner accounts. However, a reverse DNS of both shows they come from rr.res.carolina, or something to that effect and, doing an IP check on www.ip-address.com, they are coming very close to one another. The original "puppetmaster" was trying to avoid disciplinary action per his constant edit warring, and I beg to differ on the "increased support for a particular campaign". He has tried to have the credit removed several times, claiming that "because IMDB doesn't list the credit". IMDB also didn't have a page for Emma Fenton, an actress who worked on the same film as Shelby. They had AN Emma Fenton, a producer who began producing when the OTHER Emma Fenton was a mere toddler, and listed the actress Emma Fenton's credit in with the others, until an eagle-eyed contributor (hi!) brought it to there attention. In short, his argument about IMDB being an undisputed source in this matter is faulty. Also, he has tried, in his own "unique" way, to have others agree to the credit removal.</p>
<p>I don't know what he has against Shelby, but two things remain certain: 1. Unless there is good reason to remove it, the credit stays. 2. I don't know what he's trying to accomplish here. Regardless of whether or not the credit is on Wiki, it's on her resume. No casting director is going to turn her down for a role on the basis of a Wiki page. It's not harming her or her career in any way. It just harms the encyclopedia. Put it this way. I have writing credits. I also do not have a Wiki page. Does this mean I don't deserve credit for what's on my resume? <a href="../../../i/s/p/User%7EIspy1981_59ed.html" title="User:Ispy1981">Ispy1981</a> 14:52, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

The block length was 48 hours, and during that time InvaderSora abused the unblock command, adding it in at least 6 times after being declined, and then arguing with the administrators over that rather aggressively. InvaderSora refuses to admit error, and refuses to listen to reason. After an AFD on an article he had contributed to was closed and deleted by me, he recreated the article. Note, he'd been warned before about removing AFD tags and interfering with AFD process on another article, which I noted. I left a message on his talk page to try deletion review and re-deleted the article. He then said "why was it deleted" (what do you think AFD is for?) He then recreated the page once again. I deleted for a third time, then protected and salted. Given his past history of tendentious editing, edit warring, AFD manipulation (he tried to vote twice), AFD tag deletion, and complete lack of any attempt to understand wikipedia policy, I felt that a block was warranted to allow him time to read up on and understand wikipedia policy before continuing editing. As the prior block was 48 hours and he did not learn anything from that, I therefore blocked for 1 week, with the stipulation that I'm very much open to rescinding the block sooner than that if he shows an attempt to edit acceptably. I also left a warning that if he continues to abuse the unblock template, he will lose the ability to edit his talk page for the duration of the block. Therefore, I'm asking for a review of the block here. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">⇒</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../c/l/i/WP%7ECLIMBING_ffc5.html" title="WP:CLIMBING"><small><sup>On Belay!</sup></small></a> 21:33, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>One user (X) made a polite request at <a href="../../../s/i/n/Talk%7ESinmiyangyo_8e1a.html" title="Talk:Sinmiyangyo">Talk:Sinmiyangyo</a> to move <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sinmiyangyo.html" title="Sinmiyangyo">Sinmiyangyo</a>. I disagree with his/her reasoning, but reasoning was provided, and the request was entirely proper. There were one or two short, polite, but unreasoned reactions one way or the other. There have also been longish, reasoned, and I think polite objections from two users (Y and Z), one of them myself. X on the one hand and Y and Z on the other appear to be talking past each other. Well, these things happen, and I (sorry I mean Z) thought we could keep talking a little longer and reach agreement. But X has just gone ahead and moved the page.</p>
<p>As an admin, I could easily reverse this move, which I'm certain was improper to make before obtaining what WP calls consensus. But as Z, I think the move was wrong at any point; I recognized that I'm interested and may be biased, so I'm "recusing myself" (ah, such grand language).

<p>This is really bugging me, for all sorts of reasons. It's an example of a user that has been proven innocent being blocked obsessively by the same admin.</p>
<p><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a> has now blocked <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrater_Xyzzy_0e2b.html" title="User:Frater Xyzzy">Frater Xyzzy</a> 3 times now. The first block was "23:53, January 18, 2007 Blnguyen (Talk | contribs) blocked "Frater Xyzzy (contribs)" (anon. only, account creation blocked, autoblock enabled) with an expiry time of indefinite (sock of Jefferson Anderson, by RFCU)" (That RFCU does not exist, more on that below)</p>
<p>Xyzzy then moved accross country, took a wikibreak while traveling, and edited on an anonomous IP (from his new home) while waiting for his main account to get a new RFCU on it, and get unbanned. That RFCU was <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_checkuser_Case_Frater_Xyzzy_1253.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Frater Xyzzy">completed</a> on February 4th by <a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">Jpgordon</a> who established that the first RFCU (which I cannot find) was faulty, and that they are infact different people. Using that RFCU result, Xyzzy Requested an unblock and it was granted "10:35, February 4, 2007 Yamla (Talk | contribs) unblocked Frater Xyzzy (contribs) (Unblock as per checkuser)"</p>
<p>Now this is all 100% ok and how wikipedia should work. Now is when it gets fun.</p>
<p>Immediatly after Xyzzy was unblocked due to the RFCU showing that him and his suspected sockpuppet were unrelated users, <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> began admin-shopping to get Xyzzy re-blocked.

Given the editing patterns, there was also suspicion that these guys had multiple computers or were meatpuppets of some banned users. So I blocked Frater Xyzzy. It turns out he was evading that block, as he later admitted using an IP, and then re-signed the IP address using his username." Blnguyen blocked Xyzzy originally as a sockpuppet due to circumstancial discussion and analysis of editing patterns there was no Check User done as he claimed in the original block. He then re-blocked Xyzzy for evading his original block, even after a RFCU proved that Xyzzy was not a sock, and that the original block was invalid. This is in Blnguyen's own words.</p>
<p>Now the 2 week block on Xyzzy lapsed and he was unblocked. Blnguyen couldn't stay away and once again blocked Xyzzy, this time perma-block with the block "21:00, February 22, 2007 Blnguyen (Talk | contribs) blocked "Frater Xyzzy (contribs)" (anon. only, account creation blocked) with an expiry time of indefinite (Ekajati/999 sock) "</p>
<p>What's wrong with this? How about the fact that the new checkuser <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_checkuser_Case_999_a4a6.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/999">Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser/Case/999</a> didn't show that Xyzzy was a sock of Ekajati/999, infact it showed exactly the opposite. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">User:Fred Bauder</a> ran the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser/Case/999&amp;diff=103022318&amp;oldid=103022159" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser/Case/999&amp;diff=103022318&amp;oldid=103022159" rel="nofollow">Checkuser</a> and "Checkuser shows no connection. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">User:Fred Bauder</a> 23:47, 24 January 2007 (UTC)". So somehow Blnguyen decided that even though checkuser shows no connection that he would ban them all as socks anyway. This is unacceptable behavior from an admin.</p>
<p>To make the situation worse, Xyzzy posted a Block Review <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Frater_Xyzzy&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=111627399" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Frater_Xyzzy&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=111627399" rel="nofollow">request</a> on his talk page. With the reason "Arbitrarily blocked by Blnguyen on a witchhunt. Multiple checkusers have been done which show that I am not a sock of anyone. This is getting ridiculous." Which is 100% accurate. Multiple checkusers have been done, and all have proven that Xyzzy is NOT a sock of anyone. Why is the situation worse? The block was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Frater_Xyzzy&amp;diff=112671541&amp;oldid=111627399" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Frater_Xyzzy&amp;diff=112671541&amp;oldid=111627399" rel="nofollow">reviewed</a> by <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">User:Ryulong</a> and DENIED with the reason "I trust Blnguyen's discrepancy."</p>
<p>This is rediculious. How many times does a user need to be cleared??? What's the point of Checkuser if the results of it are completly ignored by admins? And what is the point of a Block Review if the reviewing admin doesn't look into the block, but instead simply says that they trust the blocking admin? Talk about a breakdown of the system. Personally i'm disgusted by this, and it needs to be addressed. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimXI_248e.html" title="User:SeraphimXI"><font color="#FF3399">Seraphim</font></a> 03:04, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your post above contains a lot of false information. I asked Dmcdevit to do a RFCU, and he said that they were the same guys (early January) - and when I looked again Dmcdevit had recused from the case, so I asked UC to reconfirm the date for me. He noted the connection at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Starwood_Workshop_34b8.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Starwood/Workshop">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Starwood/Workshop</a> that both JA and FX were related. Thus, they were blocked, with the on-wiki certification of a CU being run. The claims by Seraphim that I invented the sock data are false. Thus, my reblock of FX for block evasion was not a second punishment for an innocent user, since the CU already showed that he and JA were related. I did not state that I was justifying the initial block due to my instincts alone. After a few IPs from open proxies and TOR hosting machines started swamping an AfD in the general topics of these editors, I asked Dmcdevit to do another careful dissection of the data of 999. The results are here -&gt;<a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_Archive40_2730.html#User:A_Ramachandran.27s_block" title="User talk:Blnguyen/Archive40">User_talk:Blnguyen/Archive40#User:A_Ramachandran.27s_block</a>, after I have IP addresses left lying about by the aforementioned editors, it yielded a match. It also showed extensive use of anonymous proxies, TOR etc, by the parties. In February after another spate of socks turned up, I talked to another arbitrator and checkuser and he checkusered the accounts, and they revealed widespread use of proxies and tors from right across the world in one day. From the discussion, it was agreed that the chances that multiple honest new users all popping up on the same obscure topic with TOR and proxies was very unlikely. Added to that the fact that they had the same religious ideology with strong knowledge of wikipolitics, arbitration cases, and instantaneous use of popups tools makes things very obvious. Given that I had already noted at the Starwood evidence that HD, Ek and 999 had interweaved edits despite being in the same timezone, that the latter two were created or became active 3 hours after the first was blocked, etc, they were blocked. I went back and checked FX's record as well, and it shows perfect overlapping as well with the other four. This is in addition to the use of subversive technology. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> (<a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">bananabucket</a>) 02:15, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>So where are the checkuser results for the indef block posted? The only checkuser results that are up on wikipedia now after his first block, all show no relation. Basically what your saying is, even though the public checkusers showed no relation, somehow you decided that since people have the same religious ideology and knowledge of wikipedia they are obvious socks? Even though for example, the Frater Xyzzy account has NEVER edited the Starwood pages that the people he was blocked as a sock of obsessively edited it? The lack of transparancy in this case is kinda scary. I don't want to be blocked sometime in the future because someone else in my city starts editing pages that I edit and some admin comes around and decides to indef block me even though the RFCU shows we aren't editing from the same IP. The checkusers on the site clear Xyzzy every time. You might have found another sock group, that's great, however the Xyzzy account NEVER edited Starwood. Never ever ever. There was no reason to block him as a sock of those other users. The fact that nobody from the starwood case is pushing for him to stay blocked, instead his case is being pushed by people who edit the freemasonry related pages that he was active on. The lack of transparancy in this case is simply a complete failure of the wikipedia system. Don't block someone saying you blocked them because of a RFCU if a RFCU doesn't exist. And don't just deny block reviews stating that you trust the previous admin. That seems to just be common sence. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimXI_248e.html" title="User:SeraphimXI"><font color="#FF3399">Seraphim</font></a> 05:06, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The results weren't posted publicly, they were discussed by arbitrators. The results showed that the editors used the same techniques of technological obfuscation. I have been advised that the percentage of honest editors who use these techniques are very low. Then the second user also has the same editing interests as the other on many obscure pages, has the same POV, and seems to have instantaneous knowledge of wikilaw. The user is blocked because he is the same guy evading his block, and editing the same articles that the master wrote. If these guys have nothing to hide, then they would edit cleanly. The RFCU does exist, although only the checkusers can see it. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> (<a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">bananabucket</a>) 05:43, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>So basically to sum up. People went through the official channels to get socks checked, the results of the official sock checks were that the users were unrelated. Then some arbitrators discussed the situation and decided to block the users anyway, and run a new checkuser because apparently the people that ran the 2 checkusers before, the official ones, apparently don't understand how to interperate checkuser results? I cannot understand how 2 admins with checkuser find no connection, but then somehow on a secret checkuser all of asudden there was an obvious connection. Also you don't seem to be understanding my other point. "user is blocked because he is the same guy evading his block, and editing the same articles that the master wrote" Xyzzy NEVER EVER EVER edited the Starwood page. He has ZERO edits on the starwood page. If he was a sock puppet and the guy was making socks to evade blocks then he would have been editing the page on his sock! "If these guys have nothing to hide, then they would edit cleanly." What is Editing Cleanly? How does someone edit cleanly? I wasn't aware there was such a thing. Plus I am not the only one disturbed by the idea that RFCUs that only checkusers can see exist. The idea of people running checkusers without a proper RFCU filing kinda defeats the whole idea of checkuser. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimXI_248e.html" title="User:SeraphimXI"><font color="#FF3399">Seraphim</font></a> 05:54, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It's a FISA warrant RfCU, and it's a need to know basis. (joke.) I agree with Seraphim. When did wikipolicy start permitting secret actions by people outside the real wikia offices? (other than like, Jimmy Wales' actal paid staff?).

<dd>Actually RFCU was started as an outlet for people to put a request in conveniently. It never stopped arbitrators or checkusers from just doing it themselves if necessary. As for what the report is, there is no magic machine which prints the result or conclusion from the data, so there is no difference between what an arbitrator says on a Wikipedia report and what they say via email, unless they tell different stories.As regards to the CU, it depends on how closely one is looking of course. As I pointed out above, I found instances where IP addresses were left lying around after the initial check, and with the extra evidence, Dmcdevit certified that the users were indeed the same. As for the second point, if a user is subverting the system by violating <a href="../../../n/o/p/WP%7ENOP_fa61.html" title="WP:NOP">WP:NOP</a>, then there will be no connection at all just by numbers, unless someone verifies to see if the numbers are from illegitimate editing means. And FX did edit the same articles as 999, who is currently blocked. The fact that he does not edit all of them, eg Starwood, still does not mean it is not him. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> (<a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">bananabucket</a>) 06:15, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I was unimpressed with the block and I was unimpressed with the behavior of those supporting the block who felt the need to harass the user while he was blocked. I trust Blnguyen, but would like to hear a good explanation. From my own research then and now, I haven't seen anything to justify it.

<dd>My best advice, from the outside perspective, is email the ArbCom mailing list. Fred, jpgordan, and Blnguyen are all on there and two of the users ran the RFCU. I certainly cannot check on the IP information and what might be causing this confusion, and they might best clarify their actions. It's an interesting case that you've presented, but what is there to say if there seems to be private conversations taking place concerning abuse?

<dd>I was doing a normal <a href="../../../r/f/u/CAT%7ERFU_768d.html" title="CAT:RFU">CAT:RFU</a> check. I looked at the block log, saw that he had been blocked before for other reasons, and I trusted Blinguyen's block, as checkusers are not definitive at times and for all I knew, he could have asked for a checkuser off of Wikipedia. I do that from time to time to close down sockfarms that I come in contact with.—<a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong"><font color="blue">Ryūlóng</font></a> (<a href="../../../r/y/u/User_talk%7ERyulong_923f.html" title="User talk:Ryulong"><font color="gold">竜龍</font></a>) 04:39, 9 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>A clean checkuser is "definitive" in the sense that it is (supposedly) the last resort, so the fact that a case is accepted means there is no other evidence sufficient (via edit patterns etc) to establish that the user was a sockpuppet. To suppose "oh, well, he might be a sockpuppet anyway, despite there being no sufficient basis to say so, because it's unprovable that he's not" is a blatant violation of AGF. On that basis, you might be a sockpuppet, and you can never clear your name of that - AGF, in this case, implicitly means innocent until proven guilty.</dd>
<dd>And for someone who had already _had_ one checkuser run on them establishing nothing, there should _not_ be a presumption that another checkuser with different results was conducted in secret - any further checkuser should be done openly. And, regardless of anything related to this particular block... if you "trust" the blocking admin, you should leave the unblock template for someone else not so trusting to look at, otherwise we might as well just delete it. --<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERandom832_8f73.html" title="User talk:Random832">Random832</a> 13:53, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'd disagree with that assessment of Checkuser utility, it's a last resort confirmation if nothing else is conclusive, but it doesn't prove a negative, particularly when there is a lot of behavioural congruence.</dd>
<dd>In this case one C/U indicated a link, a second was inconclusive inasmuch as it didn't show enough to confirm a link. jpgordon, who ran the second, did become aware of this debate the last time Seraphim raised it and took no action.</dd>
<dd>A recent SSP case regarding this link was closed without action because of the onging starwood arbitration, rather than because there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate a link.</dd>

<dd>I didn't say it proves a negative. It is conclusive in so far as it is final, since there is nothing else that comes after it. It doesn't prove a negative only because a negative cannot be proven. If there's "a lot of behavioural congruence", then a checkuser is unnecessary. If there's not enough to make a checkuser unnecessary, and a checkuser is negative, there is NO valid basis for considering the user a sockpuppet. --<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERandom832_8f73.html" title="User talk:Random832">Random832</a> 15:46, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'd just like to second the concerns of <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimXI_248e.html" title="User:SeraphimXI">Seraphim</a> here. It seems like, recently, there've been several people blocked as socks of <a href="../../../e/k/a/User%7EEkajati_914d.html" title="User:Ekajati">Ekajati</a> by Blnguyen that have been done without enough transparency and that seemed dubious to me on the surface. First <a href="../../../9/9/9/User%7E999.html" title="User:999">999</a> was blocked as a sock of Ekajati, which struck me as wrong because a) I don't know too many socks that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Kenneth_Grant&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=87558791" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Kenneth_Grant&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=87558791" rel="nofollow">disagree with each other</a> and b) like Xyzzy he had previously been cleared by checkuser of connections to Ekajati. However, my doubt about the block was lessened when he <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Blnguyen&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=105671428" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Blnguyen&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=105671428" rel="nofollow">responded</a> with his reasons. But, I'm particularly incredulous about this block, just because Xyzzy and Hanuman Das (another person blocked as a sock of Ekajati) seem even less like the same user than 999 and HD did. I would like to see these blocks reviewed beyond a simple "I'm going to go with whatever Blnguyen has decided." I don't know if it's a systemic flaw in Wikipedia admin practice, but at the very least I think <a href="../../../s/s/p/WP%7ESSP_fb6b.html" title="WP:SSP">WP:SSP</a> cases should be opened, because it doesn't strike me as right that long-time contributors should be blocked for life without a formal presentation of <i>why</i>. --<a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENotJackhorkheimer_b41b.html" title="User:NotJackhorkheimer">notJackhorkheimer</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../n/o/t/User_talk%7ENotJackhorkheimer_17fc.html" title="User talk:NotJackhorkheimer">talk</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_NotJackhorkheimer_ed1a.html" title="Special:Contributions/NotJackhorkheimer">contribs</a>)</sup> 21:02, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well yeah, there was that SSP, but it was basically unrelated to Xyzzy being blocked as a sock of Ekajati. From what I saw of that, it was edited for a while with accusations re: Xyzzy and JA, then let sit for a while, then the closing admin saw Xyzzy being blocked as a sock of Ekajati and went, "Oh, well this is irrelevant now, Xyzzy's blocked. So, closing this." What I wish would be done is for there to be SSPs for long-time editors <i>for the block in question</i>, basically showing why a block was done.

<p>I also have concerns in this case. The evidence and rationale behind the indef block is way too thin, or there is a serious lack of transparency. Either way, more process is required to substantiate an indef block. I'm also disturbed by the actions of Ryulong in reviewing the block with such apparent superficiality. —<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Bell_8398.html" title="User:Doug Bell">Doug&#160;Bell</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoug_Bell_81b5.html" title="User talk:Doug Bell">talk</a></sup> 07:24, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the detailed explanation. I would hope in the future that the evidence supporting a indef block of a longtime user would be presented at the time the user is blocked instead of after the fact. Transparency is important and should not be lightly tossed aside.

<dd>Of course the major problem with not presenting the evidence, is that it's impossible for another admin to review the block. How would in this case any admin beable to review his block properly? You blocked him as an admin not an arbitrator since it was not an arbcom ruling. Are we to assume that somehow your blocks are not reviewable? <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimXI_248e.html" title="User:SeraphimXI"><font color="#FF3399">Seraphim</font></a> 01:03, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If another admin wants to review a block and the reasoning isn't clear, he/she can simply email the blocking admin and ask for information.

<p>I realize that they're supposed to follow the <i>spirit</i> of the policy, and not the letter... but still, 4 reverts in 28 hours? That hardly seems like a 'revert war'. Especially since there's still a note on his talk page about how someone <i>wasn't</i> blocked in spite of literally violating 3RR, gangsta getting blocked when he didn't violate the letter seems a bit heavy-handed. It certainly appears to present an inconsistent application of policies. "If you violate the policy, you may go entirely unpunished. But, even if you <i>don't</i> technically violate it, you still may get punished. Just because." <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBladestorm_00c0.html" title="User:Bladestorm">Bladestorm</a> 01:25, 14 March 2007 (UTC)<br />
Excuse me. I hadn't realized. The person who actually <i>reported</i> the "edit war" was, in fact, the same editor who avoided being blocked for literally violating 3RR. Seriously, what sort of message does this say?<br />
Ideogram clearly violates 3RR, and isn't blocked.<br />
Gangsta doesn't technically violate it, and <i>is</i> blocked, when he's reported <i>by Ideogram</i>.<br />
Does nobody else see the inconsistency here? "Do as I say, not as I do"? (For reference, I'm not saying that ideogram should've been blocked either. But it's certainly a double standard, and a disproportionate application of policies; especially for very-much related cases. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBladestorm_00c0.html" title="User:Bladestorm">Bladestorm</a> 01:30, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>(edit conflict)&#160;:Any previous block (or lack there-of) had no bearing on this one. 3rr is not a right and 28 hours is four hours past the normal 3RR deadline, however I that agressive editing style is very disruptive and hence he earnt the block.

<dd>Well, first off, you really did more to prove my point than you may realize. The action was taken for who he is, rather than what he did. Being pro-taiwan, and occasionally lacking neutrality doesn't provide license to nudge the rules around. And no, that is absolutely <b>not</b> covered by the exceptions, and intentionally so. Content disputes, even when stubborn, misguided, etc, are <i>not</i> allowable exceptions for 3RR. I wish I could remember where I saw an admin explaining that very point.</dd>
<dd>I still stand by my initial protest: rules should be applied as consistently as possible. When two people clearly have issues with eachother, admins should endeavour to <i>not</i> take sides. What's more, if editor A reports editor B for a verifiable violation of 3RR, and then editor B reports editor A for a violation of the spirit <i>but not letter</i> of 3RR, it's grossly inappropriate to punish B, but not A. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBladestorm_00c0.html" title="User:Bladestorm">Bladestorm</a> 03:42, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Four edits within just under 22 hours. And, in this case, even if other people have issues with gangsta, this is still very much a matter of a dispute between two editors.</dd>
<dd>First gangsta reports Ideogram's actual violation. Then Ideogram reports gangsta's violation in spirit. That doesn't sound like a dispute between two editors to you? (Since I don't remember which page I said this on, I'll say it again: I'm not saying Ideogram should've been blocked either. I'm only saying that there should be consistency with how rules are applied.) <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBladestorm_00c0.html" title="User:Bladestorm">Bladestorm</a> 04:37, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Those 4 reverts you showed were the ones reported by C.G as there is a self revert a couple of edits after the last one. Yes, 3RR was broken, but it was self reverted. Consistency between admins is very hard to achieve. I personally try to apply consistency among all my actions, and in an attempt to be fair to the parties involved, I have above asked that any admin who feels the block was unjustified to unblock or reduce it as they see fit. However without hard and fast rules (which 3RR is not) you cannot be totally consistent between different admins as we all approach the situation differently. <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViridae_a0d4.html" title="User:Viridae">Viridae</a><a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViridae_b84f.html" title="User talk:Viridae"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 05:09, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again, that's a content issue. And maybe a civility issue. But those are beside the point. I have no specific allegiance towards gangsta. To be frank, my only interest is in both fairness, as well as the <i>appearance</i> of fairness. When A reports B, and then B reports A, if A is the only one to literally break the rules, then B shouldn't be the only one punished. Simply put, it doesn't inspire confidence. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBladestorm_00c0.html" title="User:Bladestorm">Bladestorm</a> 05:32, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There's no point in talking to <i>you</i> if you aren't capable of addressing my actual concerns. I'll say it again. I don't give a flying crap if he was generally uncivil, beligerant, or even radioactive. If the admin position is to have <i>any</i> credibility whatsoever, then it needs to be presented as a fair and unbiased position. Using an evaluation of an editor themself, rather than the specific action you're addressing, is a step in the wrong direction. When two editors are in an edit war together, and only one of them actually directly violates 3RR, then punishing the <i>other</i> is inappropriate. And it annihilates credibility.</dd>
<dd>I don't care what you think of gangsta. You don't need to convince me that he isn't a saint, because I couldn't give a flying crap if he was a deranged giraffe pretending to be a human editor. Frankly, at least half the articles on my watchlist are topics that I have relatively little interest in, but where my only concern is that they are approached fairly and neutrally. Two editors involved in the same dispute, with similar 'crimes' should be treated similarly. If one editor has a <i>lesser</i> 'crime' (or none at all), then he certainly shouldn't be treated worse, <b>regardless of who he is</b>. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBladestorm_00c0.html" title="User:Bladestorm">Bladestorm</a> 06:00, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(I stopped reading at your first flying crap.) I don't give a flying crap about your concerns. You only care about the letter of the law which is the perfect definition of wikilawyering. If you can convince an admin of the validity of your concerns, more power to you.

<dd>Ideogram, don't mess with my comments. Not only does it make it harder to follow what people are saying (signed or not, if it's inline then it becomes harder to read), but it's also terribly rude.</dd>
<dd>Next, announcing that you didn't even bother reading a point, but still felt the need to reply to it is the height of "disruption". I'm now going to request that you refrain from commenting at all. If you're going to admit that you don't feel like reading before replying, then there's no question that you aren't even trying to accomplish anything.</dd>
<dd>Next, I'm not wikilawyering. Nor am I only concerned with the "letter of the law". There's a difference between wikilawyering and asking for consistency and fairness. If you don't know the bloody difference, then you shouldn't be announcing that fact to everybody else. Incidentally, I think that's ignoring the whole AGF thing; attributing false motives to everything I do? Remind me again, <i>who</i> was the disruptive one in that dispute?</dd>
<dd>If anyone wants to actually discuss the issues, then I'm game. But if you once again announce that you don't feel like reading before replying, or that you don't care about people's concerns (but will still belittle them), then I'll expect an admin to immediately blank such comments. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBladestorm_00c0.html" title="User:Bladestorm">Bladestorm</a> 06:33, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Hmm, yeah, well, I hope you can see by reading the link I supplied that it's not simply a matter of (1) a content dispute, or (2) two editors warring with each other. A user's behaviour in what starts as a content disupte, beyond a certain point, becomes an issue of disruptive editing.

<dd>I wanna add my two-cents here, having dealt with him rather recently mostly on Culture of Taiwan. I have to say it is wrong to say it's a content dispute, about pro-taiwan vs. pro-china. Based on my interaction with him, he shows that he basically knows little about the issue and when approached on discussion pages generally writes a lot of nonsense, things that even an extremely pro-taiwan person would not say. He also reverts and accuses everybody opposed to it of being "pro-china" and has accused me of being of "community banned sock puppet". It's one thing to be back and forth with reasonable arguments on the talk page, but it's another when he's totally inaccesible and "just don't get it". <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueshirts_801d.html" title="User:Blueshirts">Blueshirts</a> 16:56, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, this has officially entered a new chapter.<br />
Previously, I had been proceeding on the assumption that gangsta was exaggerating, at least a little bit. However, Ideogram has now <i>just</i> started stalking me as well.<br />
Take a look at this edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Richard_Gere&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=114984521" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Richard_Gere&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=114984521" rel="nofollow">here</a>. In a long, drawn-out problem with whether or not to include references to richard gere cramming small rodents up his butt, there was a problem with someone choosing not to address the actual issues at all, but rather accuse editors who care about the policy for bios of living persons as being "rabid Richard Gere fans" whoa re "unable to cope" that "feel the need to suppress them at every opportunity." Since this wasn't directly about the article, and was an accusation of bad faith, and was a direct personal attack, I removed it.<br />
Maybe the right choice, maybe the wrong choice. But that's not the issue here. Here's the issue.<br />
In addition to proclaiming that he wouldn't read my arguments (but would still belittle them), Ideogram actually traced back my contributions to try to find something to report. And, sure enough, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Georgewilliamherbert&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=114996675" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Georgewilliamherbert&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=114996675" rel="nofollow">take a look here</a>. Notice that, when he was unable to address my arguments directly, he instead tried to find another method of getting to me.<br />
Not only is this rude, and disruptive, but it also throws out any possible arguments that gangsta is a strictly disruptive editor, while Ideogram acts in good faith. Normally, I don't comment on contributers. Only content. However, I don't know how else to interpret this. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBladestorm_00c0.html" title="User:Bladestorm">Bladestorm</a> 06:53, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Okay, I don't think anyone seriously believes that this one block is going to make Gangsta change his ways. If people are willing, the next step is to file an RFC against Gangsta to show that the community disapproves of his actions. If that doesn't work, the next step would be ArbCom. I am not eager to take it that far, but I really don't know how to convince him he needs to change. If anyone can propose any other solutions I would like to hear them. --<a href="../../../i/d/e/User%7EIdeogram_de1d.html" title="User:Ideogram">Ideogram</a> 08:11, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you've been upset enough to do all this on ANI and then the spinoff into my talk page, please take the time and effort to do a RFC.

<p>You're not in any position to accuse me this way since you're the one who is crusading to have me blocked and advocating a pro-China agenda. Your accusation is bogus. You use article talkpages as forums to gather support for your Rfc against me. We all know Taiwan-China relation is a delicate topic and the most important issue here is presenting encyclopedia reader with a neutral point of view. You need to cut the talk about consensus because in this case, a few people who endorse your change don't represent consensus. Of course, Taiwan vs. China is like David vs. Goliath so if we talk about consensus rather than content factuality than all Chinese editors will probably make these articles uneyclopedic and unreadable. At one time, you successfully obtained a 3RR block on me by presenting blatant lie and false accusation on this page (not to mention it's misplaced, it shouldn't be on AN/I). The blocking admin didn't do enough research. Then after another neutral and uninvolved user Bladestorm voiced his objection on my block above, instead of discussing constructively with him, you make veil threat and stalk his contributions and reported him for something that is uncalled for. A heated dispute occured soon after between you and bladestorm above and on Georgewilliamherbert's talkpage. You claim you represent consensus but all you're doing is stalking me all over the place, even in article you don't care about (John Profumo for example, you better apologize for your actions) Therefore, intentionally instigating me to edit war with you.

<dd>Just want to point out something here, the issue at hand has <i>absolutely nothing</i> to do with pro-China vs pro-Taiwan. It has to do with "gangsta"'s repeated reverts without any reasons that are convincing or even "debatable". Say, on the culture of taiwan page, if he were to write up some examples that show "dutch and spanish" influence on Taiwanese culture, then that'd be great, because now we can argue about how much influence is there, is the influence long lasting, how relevent it is to present day taiwanese culture? But NO, gangsta doesn't do anything like that. He just automatically reverts and then labels anyone of being "pro-China" and writes egregiously blanket statements about taiwanese people. In essence, gangster hides his own refusal to discuss competently by resorting to playing name attacks and identity politics. To the outsider, our arguments with gangster might look like yet <i>another</i> china vs taiwan issue, but in reality it has <i>nothing</i> to do with the issue. So, please don't be played into thinking that the argument is about content dispute, this is a very important point here. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueshirts_801d.html" title="User:Blueshirts">Blueshirts</a> 23:45, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Wikipedia Stevenstone93 seems to have assumed the identity of living person, Professor Steven Suttles Stone of UC Davis, California and appears to be presenting Professor Stone as a racist, homophobic 14 year old boy.:</b> I came across <a href="../../../m/i/s/Wikipedia%7EMiscellany_for_deletion_User%7EStevenstone93_46d2.html" title="Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/User:Stevenstone93">Wikipedia:Miscellany_for_deletion/User:Stevenstone93</a> and reviewed the user page. This person holds himself out to be living person Steven Suttles Stone, a 14 years old boy living in California. Between this user's talk page and user page, there is enough information to particularly identify living person Steven Suttles Stone. There is no evidence that this user is in fact Steven Suttles Stone and the posts and actions demonstrate a level of sophistication well above that which would be held by a 14 year old boy.

<p>I don't see any evidence that Steven Suttles Stone is a professor in real life. A post on an internet forum with the signature "Steven Suttles Stone, UC Davis" doesn't make someone a professor. A student, possibly, though probably not even that. The UC Davis directory lists nobody by the name of Steve/Steven/S. Stone, whether faculty/student/staff <a href="http://www.ucdavis.edu/search/directory_results.shtml?filter=stone&amp;sa=GO" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ucdavis.edu/search/directory_results.shtml?filter=stone&amp;sa=GO" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>. So if this is a libel campaign I don't know who it's against. Maybe he really <i>is</i> a 14-year-old boy?

<dd>I believe you've hit the nail on the head. The user just claimed on <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevenstone93_da89.html" title="User talk:Stevenstone93">User talk:Stevenstone93</a> that the post in the Walt Whitman article alluded to above was someone vandalizing using his name, probably one of his schoolmates. I'm inclined to believe that over Jreferee's scenario, especially because in the edit attributed to the "real" professor, the person signs "Steven Suttles Stone Corporation LTD" or something like that, which this 14 year old user does all the time, but I doubt a real professor would happen to also do. Faulty evidence to back up a strange theory. I, as well, have failed to find any evidence of such a professor in reality. So I must raise the question, was an indef block necessary on this user? He has ignored all advice given to him, but now promises to edit articles besides his own userspace. --<a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETractorkingsfan_8ee9.html" title="User:Tractorkingsfan"><font color="black">Tractor</font></a><a href="../../../t/r/a/User_talk%7ETractorkingsfan_0b20.html" title="User talk:Tractorkingsfan"><font color="green">kings</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tractorkingsfan_5bb2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tractorkingsfan"><font color="red">fan</font></a> 20:13, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Given his behaviour both before and after his block, I am highly doubtful that Stevenstone93 will develop into a useful editor any time soon. He's engaged in vandalism, racism, homophobia, sockpuppetry, and incivility. The one or two good-faith article-space edits he did make were inappropriate and reverted immediately. Nevertheless, I do agree that <a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">Jreferee</a>'s accusation is baseless, and Stevenstone93 should not have been blocked on that basis. <s>I think it would be appropriate to give him another chance to try to contribute to Wikipedia, with the proviso that he make some useful (i.e., not-immediately-reverted) article-space edits before any further updates to his user page, and that he then continue to focus his efforts on building articles instead of his user page.</s> —<a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychonaut_e6a0.html" title="User:Psychonaut">Psychonaut</a> 23:53, 15 March 2007 (UTC) <b>Update:</b> Stevenstone93 has taken exception to this post in a rather arrogant and unrepentant comment on his talk page.

One needn't be clairvoyant to see that unblocking him now will just result in more blocks and bans for gross incivility in the near future. —<a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychonaut_e6a0.html" title="User:Psychonaut">Psychonaut</a> 00:35, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The fact that he's responded poorly to an out-of-process <i>permanent</i> block is hardly a sufficient basis for any such judgment. This block should never have been issued (and if <i>any</i> block could or should have been, a week would be a sufficient warning). I suggest that this block be lifted immediately. If the user responds with incivility, impose another <i>temporary</i> block, as appropriate.

<p>I would like to ask the opinion of administrators if it is OK to nominate the article for deletion 5 days after the previous AfD closed with "keep"? This is what happened here: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Khachkar_destruction_%28March_14%2C_2007%29_bed9.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Khachkar destruction (March 14, 2007)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Khachkar destruction (March 14, 2007)</a>. I was the one who nominated the article for deletion first time, but then deletion did not get a consensus because of the position of users, who nominate the article for deletion now: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Khachkar_destruction_a9b3.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Khachkar destruction">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Khachkar destruction</a> After that the article was expanded, and apparently some are not happy with the outcome and renominated it for deletion 5 days later, claiming that both sides agree to deletion, why it is not so. I don’t know if this is the right place to ask, but is there a certain policy on how often an article can be nominated for deletion and is it OK to renominate the article for deletion so soon after the previous AfD closed? <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 20:32, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is discouraged to quickly relist, with two exceptions. Those are when the closing admin of the first AFD decides that a relisting is needed or when the first AFD is taken to DRV and the article is relisted there. I've generally maintained that the delay needed after a no-consensus AFD is shorter than the delay needed after a keep AFD. The usual thinking is that a second nomination ought to be a few months after the first. If the new AFD is better interpreted as challenging the close of the first (your description does <i>not</i> sound like this), then closing the second and taking it to DRV would be the thing to do. But if it is those who opined keep in the first that think it should be deleted, what the heck, let them change their mind, it doesn't cost that much. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 22:40, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Oh good, I would really like an admin to set us straight here. Let's forget the other possible sockpuppet post earlier please. Apparently there was some personal info concealed in that one that no-one would notice unless they knew what they were looking for. So I admitted that, had I known there was personal info in there, I would have removed it myself, not restored it. Honest mistake.</li>
<li>Now on this one - My understanding is that if you suspect a sock then you tag it somehow, maybe with {{spa}} then report it and let the normal admin and checkuser process take over. You would not remove a simple posting just becsue you suspect it is a sock. Am I right? Because Orsini, an inexperienced wikipedia editor, thinks that he should get rid of non-threatening posts that he thinks are socks of <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbara_Schwarz_fc5e.html" title="Barbara Schwarz">Barbara Schwarz</a>. Can an admin please provide us fellas with some guidance. Thanks. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 04:31, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you Ted. Please note also the sockpuppet also edited on her favorite places to cause disruption. I agree it's a foolish reason for an edit war. However, is it appropriate or inappropriate to leave edits by a banned user to stand? This is a point on which I am uncertain, and I hope you can set me straight.

<dd>Here's where <a href="../../../c/a/l/WP%7ECALM_952a.html" title="WP:CALM">WP:CALM</a> comes in. The suspected sock edited made one comment each on two talk pages and an AfD. Where's the disruption? Add the SPA tag if you have a good-faith basis for doing so, and it won't be the end of the world if an administrator gets to it on Friday instead of Thursday. It's not going to influence the AfD decision any more than it does when a newspaper columnist encourages readers to flood in to vote in an AfD. -- <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedFrank_f8cb.html" title="User:TedFrank">TedFrank</a> 04:54, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree completely with you about canvassing in that way. However it may be worth noting the Talk page archives of <a href="../../../b/a/r/Talk%7EBarbara_Schwarz_ee6c.html" title="Talk:Barbara Schwarz">Talk:Barbara Schwarz</a> available to admins only, or the previous 3 AfD discussions to see the degree of disruption which this one abuser can cause in a very short time.

<p>whats the official policy on this, out of curiosity? I saw this come up on Brandt's afd as well, where certain admins supported his posting, others RV'd it out, and one even threatened to ban anyone who removed his commentary. - <a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDennyColt_8821.html" title="User talk:DennyColt">Denny</a> 06:01, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'd also like to know this. My understanding of policy is 1. a banned user doesn't get to edit Wikipedia at all; 2. edits from banned users are treated as vandalism; and 3. dealing with vandalism can be done by any editor by reverting. However I've been over-ruled here and the banned edits were restored. I don't understand why. Please point me towards a clue, since <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANDAL_b36a.html" title="WP:VANDAL">WP:VANDAL</a> is what I've based my actions upon and I must be missing something. <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> 06:12, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>(1) is true. I see no basis for (2) in <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVAND_6593.html" title="WP:VAND">WP:VAND</a>. And, once again, we're talking about AfD-space, not a substantive article edit. A sock or two with an SPA tag isn't going to make a difference; a hundred socks are going to be obvious and counterproductive. In either scenario, a reversion isn't necessary. Moreover, given that this is a suspected sock, rather than a confirmed sock, <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> militates against reversion. -- <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedFrank_f8cb.html" title="User:TedFrank">TedFrank</a> 06:22, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The puppetmaster has used a huge number of sockpuppets. Her style can be easily identified by those familiar with her editing paterns and writing style. As normal users, we do not have the tools (like IP checking) available to admins, and they only confirm the suspicion. As Smee stated, if we went to <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a> every single time that <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_real_Barbara_Schwarz_12c8.html" title="User:The real Barbara Schwarz">User:The real Barbara Schwarz</a> creates a new sockpuppet, there would be even more disruption. Usually <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">User:ChrisO</a> spots her sockpuppets quickly and deals with them since he is familair with the pattern. <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> 06:23, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So if a sympathetic and knowledgeable admin is already involved, I don't understand why an SPA-tag + wait-for-a-few-hours isn't sufficient, and the aggrieved parties feel the need for an edit-war and a lengthy AN/I thread. Especially when the sock's only role is to make unpersuasive AfD and talk-page arguments. It makes me want to create a WP:WOLF essay. -- <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedFrank_f8cb.html" title="User:TedFrank">TedFrank</a> 06:32, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry Ted, it wasnt my intention to waste ANI's time or fill up space with a frivolous matter. I reverted edits in good faith which I reasonably suspected to be from the banned user's sock, and which were edits made in bad faith. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">User:ChrisO</a> has dealt with this in the way I did, and Justanother didn't see fit to complain or restore those edits, only mine. History shows the sockpuppets' inciteful comments soon begin a flood of disruption, so doing a fast revert has minimized this impact. AGF policy also covers those situations where there's evidence to the contrary of good faith, and trolling by a banned user is not GF; I hope you and Justanother can AGF in my judgement that the sockpuppet is a banned user. I also believed Justanother's actions were inappropriate, and so I apologize for wasting your time. I note your comment in the AfD itself, and will take that comment on board with regards to my own behavior.

<dd>I sympathize with your plight. From personal experience, when one is dealing with a disruptive editor, the most effective strategy is to minimize one's own disruptive actions so that third-party editors can quickly see who is at fault. If the other editor is truly disruptive, they'll hang themselves quickly; if they're not truly disruptive, then hanging back and avoiding provocation can save both parties tsuris. -- <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedFrank_f8cb.html" title="User:TedFrank">TedFrank</a> 07:03, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We are up to 30 plus socks not counting the many that were just plain IP addresses. There are numerous editors and admins that aware of this issue and they will remove her comments as soon as they appear. She has made legal threats and she attempts to "out" anonymous editors. He latest comment adds nothing of value to the AfD and it contains material that is against Wikipedia policy, namely it accused other editors of bad faith and even suggested that Wikipedia editors "wished her harm".

<p>TBeatty is a decent enough editor, FAAFA is shaping up to be banned by <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Free_Republic_1f7d.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Free Republic">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Free Republic</a>.

<dd><s>Although I've been having some issues of my own with Wikipedia lately, I've been watchign this whole Freerepublic thing spread and spread, and I don't think there's been a day gone by in over a month that some FR-editors-war-related incident hasn't been up here, either a new one or one taking days to resolve. By now, everyone involved ought to be on eggshells around each other, avoiding the appearances of attacks, stalkings, hostilities and improprieties. Instead, I note that Faafa is accurate. He's got an established edit history on both articles, then TBeatty shows up. while I'm also aware that TBeatty isn't a 'subject' of the RfAr for FR/BB/FaaFa/DH/BfP, he's been a highly active participant, and All I've seen shows him leaning heavily to to FR/DH/BfP side. As such, he really shouldn't be out there trying to get Faafa riled up into another violation. I think it's definitely questionable behavior to do what he's doing. This stupid FR mess is so big on Wikipedia that it's almost impossible to avoid it if you pay any attention to the Wikipedia pages of wikipedia... (or however AN/Policy/VillagePump should be called...), and anyone involved should be trying to look like they're participating in the spirit of the AN/I, not just the letter law. It's mildly unethical, I think, but I'm not sure if it violated he written text of any WP policy, since he's claiming that he's 'checking Faafa', which means with have to evaluate 'check' with AGF, meaning he's just 'reviewing for hte good of the project'. parsing games aside, I think TB should be told to step off.Neither's an angel, and they all need to know that this mess is serious.

Aside from the fact that it's just a harmless comic, it also happens to be a pithy, distressingly accurate social comment, and a valuable warning to members of internet communities.

Scroll down to 'Academy Award Winner Page Vandalism' to see what I am talking about. The user barely knows how to use Wiki and despite multiple warnings, continues to engage in various forms of vandalism and page blanking. His current 'kick' is the bizarre concept that saying someone is an Academy Award winner is somehow 'advertising' and randomly editing various Academy Award winner pages to remove this reference. Additionally, he/she is blanking out warnings whenever he gets the chance: See his/her log <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.112.7.212_7075.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.112.7.212">Special:Contributions/71.112.7.212</a>. I'm exhausted trying to revert this trolls constant vandalism and I truly need someone else to step in. There is also a long history of this IP address simply engaging in similar behavior on other articles. The IP address traces to a Verizon address, but it seems static; same person, same behavior.

<p>Okay, this is really, really silly and stupid, but I would like to get some input from uninvolved users anyway. There has been an ongoing heated discussion on <a href="../../../f/o/o/Talk%7EFootball_%28soccer%29_c1f8.html" title="Talk:Football (soccer)">Talk:Football (soccer)</a> about the name of the article. That discussion seems to have cooled down, and "my side" seems to have "won". This seems to have lead to a user on "the other side", <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThumperward_1d10.html" title="User:Thumperward">User:Thumperward</a> (signs with name "Chris Cunningham" on talk pages) making a few undiscussed edits to the article to "improve it".

Now, I know that I should probably just have been cooler and just ignored this, but I really can't understand his behaviour in these edits and I could not stay away, although his edit summary implies that I could not make another revert without breaking 3RR, he's wrong, "I have one revert left", but I'll stay away from using it this time and instead seek the opinion of others. –&#160;<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohan_Elisson_10de.html" title="User:Johan Elisson">Elisson</a><small>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohan_Elisson_e39b.html" title="User talk:Johan Elisson">T</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Johan_Elisson_6c3e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Johan Elisson">C</a>&#160;•</small> 13:23, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>How are the link edits in keeping with MoS? Please give a link and citation. You just waste server resources by doing edits that actually does not help the article (and so was I, reverting you...). This is also what I wanted to tell you by the second edit summary, and it is applicable to all edits anyone makes anywhere. I don't see how <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> is relevant in that context. –&#160;<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohan_Elisson_10de.html" title="User:Johan Elisson">Elisson</a><small>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohan_Elisson_e39b.html" title="User talk:Johan Elisson">T</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Johan_Elisson_6c3e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Johan Elisson">C</a>&#160;•</small> 13:50, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> comment was a pithy retort at being told to leave the article as it was. I meant to link to <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS-L_d1af.html#Context" title="WP:MOS-L">WP:MOS-L#Context</a>, which states: "<i>Don't use a piped link to avoid otherwise legitimate redirect targets that fit well within the scope of the text.</i>" this includes splitting <a href="../../../z/u/r/Zurich%2C_Switzerland_1bc5.html" title="Zurich, Switzerland">Zurich, Switzerland</a> into <a href="../../../z/u/r/Zurich.html" title="Zurich">Zurich</a>, <a href="../../../s/w/i/Switzerland.html" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a> (Switzerland is irrelevant except in that it helps place Zurich in context) and expanded instances of things like <a href="../../../f/%C3%A9/d/F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration_Internationale_de_Football_Association_4d91.html" title="Fédération Internationale de Football Association">Fédération Internationale de Football Association</a> where the redir points to <a href="../../../f/i/f/FIFA_a2be.html" title="FIFA">FIFA</a> unambiguously anyway. As for "wasting server resources", server resources are less valuable than editor resources, which is why MoS recommends keeping markup simple (to make it easier to edit). <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThumperward_1d10.html" title="User:Thumperward">Chris Cunningham</a> 14:20, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS-L_d1af.html#Context" title="WP:MOS-L">WP:MOS-L#Context</a> does not give you justification to remove such a pipe link, the meaning of that section is that if you link to for example <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion_in_Sweden_9321.html" title="Religion in Sweden">Religion in Sweden</a> (I created it for this example as it didn't exist), which is a redirect to <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_Sweden_ff25.html" title="Church of Sweden">Church of Sweden</a>, don't do a pipe link [[Church of Sweden|Religion in Sweden]] because 1) the concept religion in Sweden is not neccessarily the same as the concept Church of Sweden, and 2) it hinders the usage of "what links here" on <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion_in_Sweden_9321.html" title="Religion in Sweden">Religion in Sweden</a> to check if it is a good idea to create a more general article on religion in Sweden. It can not be applied on this case, where "FIFA" and "Fédération Internationale de Football Association" mean the exact same thing. I have no opinion on the Zürich matter whatsoever, as it is not the thing I reverted over. And regarding keeping markup simple, I'm not sure that the difference between [[FIFA|Fédération Internationale de Football Association]] and [[Fédération Internationale de Football Association]] is that big of a thing for anyone to parse... If someone decided to type the first version when writing something new, I don't see any point in changing that perfectly working link to something else, just as I don't see any point in "fixing" redirects as it works just as fine. The whole point about keeping markup simple is to not use HTML and CSS where it is not needed, the point is not to change things that work just because you can make the link five chars shorter. –&#160;<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohan_Elisson_10de.html" title="User:Johan Elisson">Elisson</a><small>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohan_Elisson_e39b.html" title="User talk:Johan Elisson">T</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Johan_Elisson_6c3e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Johan Elisson">C</a>&#160;•</small> 14:54, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I fail to see the point of this revert war. From <a href="../../../l/i/n/WP%7ELINK_488d.html" title="WP:LINK">WP:LINK</a>, "It is not necessary to pipe links simply to avoid redirects. The number of links to a redirect page can be a useful gauge of when it would be helpful to spin off a subtopic of an article into its own page." In these cases, full names &amp; acryonyms are pretty stably connected. It is feasible that the acronym <a href="../../../f/i/f/FIFA_a2be.html" title="FIFA">FIFA</a> will become a disambig page if some notable organization starts to use it, so unpiped is marginally better in my opinion. However, mostly this appears to be just a dumb turf war.</p>
<p>The first edit ("fixing" the links) was rather pointless; the reversion was arguably <i>more</i> pointless since it seemed to be picking a fight over an unhelpful, but unhurtful, edit. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThumperward_1d10.html" title="User:Thumperward">Thumperward</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/u/User_talk%7EThumperward_bcaf.html" title="User talk:Thumperward">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Thumperward_3ddb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Thumperward">contribs</a>), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Football_%28soccer%29&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=115544083" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Football_%28soccer%29&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=115544083" rel="nofollow">"see you in 24 hours"</a>, a clear reference to <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>, is borderline uncivil &amp; disruptive, as I interpret it as goading <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohan_Elisson_10de.html" title="User:Johan Elisson">Johan Elisson</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohan_Elisson_e39b.html" title="User talk:Johan Elisson">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Johan_Elisson_6c3e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Johan Elisson">contribs</a>).

<p>Well, there are many problems. First, the user <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_g2s_b24e.html" title="User:Ed g2s">ed g2s</a> has been deleting images from the Evanescence articles, because according to him the use of album cover images violates thes Fair use criteria. This is totally fake, and it can be proved. <a href="../../../n/i/r/Nirvana_%28band%29.html" title="Nirvana (band)">Nirvana (band)</a> and <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nightwish.html" title="Nightwish">Nightwish</a> have images of album covers, and these articles are Featured articles. If the use use of album cover images is forbidden, then these articles would never have passed the FA. Now, he is also contradicting himself, because he has also deleted an logo ([[:Image:Evanescence early.png, an earlier logo of the band). Logo are not album covers, so...? He has deleted it with no reasons. The only thing he said was that the use of the images hasn't been discussed. What's that??</p>
<p>Some edits he made (deleting images):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Evanescence&amp;diff=115134138&amp;oldid=115095667" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Evanescence&amp;diff=115134138&amp;oldid=115095667" rel="nofollow">14:42, March 14, 2007</a></li>

</ul>
<p>Another problem is that he has nominated an free-use image created by me, <a href="../../../e/v/-/Image%7EEV-In.svg_4e0a.html" title="Image:EV-In.svg">Image:EV-In.svg</a>, with a very vague reason. He says this is a derivated work of the Evanescence logo. It would be a derivated logo if I would have copied the Evanescence logo and added something like some lines or whatever. Here's the <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImages_and_media_for_deletion_2007_March_12_38ac.html#Image:EV-In.svg" title="Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion/2007 March 12">discussion</a>, but it's going nowhere.</p>
<p>And the last thing, he has tagged the Image:Evlithium1.jpg for deletion. This is a fair-use image, but many of the contributors in the Evanescence articles including me, reached a consensus. (<a href="../../../e/v/a/Talk%7EEvanescence_Archive_2_cc87.html" title="Talk:Evanescence/Archive 2">this</a>.</p>
<p>Also the fair use rationable stated the reasons why we are using a fair-use image by now.</p>
<div style="font-size:85%">No free equivalent is available or could be created that would adequately give the same information. While Evanescence is a very popular band and would probably be easier to get user-created pictures of than most, the fact remains that in general it's incredibly difficult to get good free use images of bands. The reasons are two-fold: the majority of user-contributed images are going to be from 1) dark concerts with bad lighting, where the band is spread across the stage and difficult to see, or 2) individual members posing with a fan. Highly unlikely that a decent picture of <i>just the band</i> outside of a concert setting could be found. (Check the fair use rationable for more reasons).</div>
<p>You should also check this <a href="../../../a/r/m/User_talk%7EArmando12_6440.html#Evanescence_main_article" title="User talk:Armando12">discussion</a>.</p>
<p>I really don't understand his reasons. I can even compare the fair use rationable of the main image of Nirvana (FA) with the rationable of the Evanescence (GA) rationable. The Evanescence images is very very very detailed.</p>
<p>Well, I hope these problems end and we can continue our Wikipedian lives normally... <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmando12_bd10.html" title="User:Armando12"><font color="#276394">Armando.O</font></a><sup><a href="../../../a/r/m/User_talk%7EArmando12_6440.html" title="User talk:Armando12"><font color="#2C518F">talk</font></a> • <a href="../../../e/v/_/WP%7EEV_8e07.html" title="WP:EV"><font color="#2C518F">Ev</font></a></sup> 23:29, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I believe that it is ridiculous on how long this dispute has continued. I, for one, see no possible outcome that can satisfy both parties to the point that the bickering will cease, therefore I am going to step in and close this section. I will <i>strongly</i> suggest that all editors involved grow up and head to the appropriate policy page and get this hammered out. A change in policy, guidelines, or whatever is the cause of this mess is the only way that I can see this dispute being resolved amicably.

<p>I was called in to a dispute about the naming of <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straight_Outta_Lynwood_728d.html" title="Straight Outta Lynwood">Straight Outta Lynwood‎</a>. Our naming conventions had always stated simply that articles, prepositions, etc., shouldn't be capitalised, so I backed one editor, and move the article to <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straight_outta_Lynwood_56fe.html" title="Straight outta Lynwood">Straight outta Lynwood‎</a>. When this was challenged (and my move reverted) I explained the situation, and made the move again. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryulong</a> (<a href="../../../r/y/u/User_talk%7ERyulong_923f.html" title="User talk:Ryulong">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ryulong_83a6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ryulong">contribs</a>), despite a continuing discussion at the Talk page, has taken it upon himself to move the article and to protect it against moves (on the basis that the capitalisation at other sites trumps our conventions).</p>
<p>Not only does this show a misunderstanding of our naming conventions, but is surely a misuse of admin powers. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Talk</font></a>) 22:14, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>However, this appears to be an actual title. In that case, the fact that "outta" is a preposition is surely irrelevant.

<dd>(edit conflict) Our internal naming conventions in the case of something with a proper name need to defer to the most obvious initial criterion for naming something, which is the something's actual name. There is ample evidence, including from Weird Al's official website, that <i>Straight Outta Lynwood</i> with the capital "O" is the actual real-world title of the album. This is consistent with <i><a href="../../../s/t/r/Straight_Outta_Compton_460b.html" title="Straight Outta Compton">Straight Outta Compton</a></i>, the name of the <a href="../../../n/2E/w/N.W.A._142e.html" title="N.W.A.">N.W.A.</a> album that is being used as a referent, which also is spelled with the capital "O". <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 22:22, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>(EDIT CONFLICT × 3) Both of the threads that I brought up at the talk page of the article and that Mackensen brought up show that the moves are questioned, and also that the move protection be done, which I also did. My only actions at the article have been to originally do a histmerge (and then fix the various usages within the article), then I find that the same article is being discussed, again, and I undo the move, fix the usage of the title in the text, and install the move protection per the discussion at the thread. I have also performed a histmerge with the talk page, today. I seriously do not find that my actions are out of line here, as they are in response to two threads at WP:AN, and I also fully explained myself at the talk page of the article.—<a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong"><font color="blue">Ryūlóng</font></a> (<a href="../../../r/y/u/User_talk%7ERyulong_923f.html" title="User talk:Ryulong"><font color="gold">竜龍</font></a>) 22:25, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>The notion of an "actual title" makes no sense with regard to capitalisation; our naming conventions always override other sources — that's what they're there for. If Dickens had written on his manuscript, and publishers had followed him, <i>A Tale Of Two Cities</i>, we'd still call it <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i> — that's how Manuals of Style work.</li>
<li>The notion that Ryulong merely returned to some <i>status quo</i> is also a mistake. When admins protect a page, they should do so according to the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProtection_policy_d869.html" title="Wikipedia:Protection policy">protection policy</a>: "The same restrictions that apply to full protection during a dispute also apply to move protection during a dispute (for example, admins should avoid favouring one name over another, and protection is not an endorsement of the current name)."</li>

<dd>Can you point to any evidence that Ryulong was favoring a given version, except to undo what he saw as the aftermath of a disruptive move war?

<p>WP:MOS is certainly lacking in this area (amazing since I counted at least four different MOS and naming convention pages that apply to this situation). An additional rule that I learned is that words with five or more letters are <i>always</i> capitalized in titles, no matter the part of speech. --- <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockMFR_f871.html" title="User:RockMFR">RockMFR</a> 23:02, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>First, when a guideline like <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28capitalization%29_e7bc.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (capitalization)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (capitalization)</a> says "In general, titles of <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28books%29_a736.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (books)">books</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28films%29_2f24.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (films)">films</a>, and other works are also capitalized, except for articles ("a", "and", "the") and prepositions and conjunctions (e.g., "to", "from", "and"). Examples: <i><a href="../../../a/_/n/A_New_Kind_of_Science_173f.html" title="A New Kind of Science">A New Kind of Science</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../g/h/o/Ghost_in_the_Shell_7b72.html" title="Ghost in the Shell">Ghost in the Shell</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../t/o/_/To_Be_or_Not_to_Be_c5ab.html" title="To Be or Not to Be">To Be or Not to Be</a></i>.", it doesn't say "follow whatever the publisher of the book, film, or album does"... there's a reason for that. That's the whole point of having a Manula of Style and naming conventions.</dd>
<dd>Secondly, we're not talking about trademarks, which are treated differently by most Manuals of Style.</dd>
<dd>Thirdly, the issue of lowercase second and subsequent words is irrelevant here; that refers to capitalisation in article and section titles, and tells us that we don't call an article <a href="../../../a/_/t/A_tale_of_two_cities.html" title="A tale of two cities">A tale of two cities</a>.</dd>
<dd>Fourthly, capitalisation rules regarding titles are not part of English grammar; they're the choice of publications. Some publications capitalise no articles, prepositions, etc., some capitalise all, others use an intermediate scheme. Some Manuals would insist on "Alice In Wonderland" and "Alice Through the Looking Glass", some on "ALice in Wonderland" and "Alice through the Looking Glass", and some on "Alice in Wonderland" and "Alice Through the Looking Glass". We have always gone for the second option.</dd>
<dd>Oh, and fifthly, the claim that my page move – which is the one that Ryolong reverted – was disruptive should be backed up. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Talk</font></a>) 23:29, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>File a <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a>. Right now, there are several people here who feel that I did nothing wrong, and before my histmerging yesterday, I had not editted the page once (that I can recall). There has been too much moving of pages being done in the past 24 hours that I protected it from being moved. That and it's blatantly clear that the owner of the copyright does trump the local MoS. If Weird Al used "Straight <b>o</b>utta Lynwood", then it'd be where you want it. But he doesn't. He uses "Straight <b>O</b>utta Lynwood" which is where the article had been until sometime last week.—<a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong"><font color="blue">Ryūlóng</font></a> (<a href="../../../r/y/u/User_talk%7ERyulong_923f.html" title="User talk:Ryulong"><font color="gold">竜龍</font></a>) 23:35, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>YES!</b> This is a growing issue that the Wikipedia community should set up something more <i>definitive</i> and <i>cohesive</i> when it comes to Capitalization and article titles. The gross inconsistency that you see with page move disputes like <a href="../../../k/i/s/KISS_%28band%29_69cc.html" title="KISS (band)">KISS (band)</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_d_foy.html" title="Brian d foy">brian d foy</a>, <a href="../../../k/d/_/Kd_lang.html" title="Kd lang">kd lang</a>, <a href="../../../e/b/a/EBay_4cc0.html" title="EBay">eBay</a>, etc gives way too many headaches. As Rock said, there are _several_ MOS pages (and varying interpretations) that all seem to point one way or the other. You also have segments of editors &amp; admins who are either very liberal with capitalization or very fundamental and whoever happens to be most active on a page move wins. It's crazy and it is going to keep popping up till something is hammered out. <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.157.110.11.html" title="User:205.157.110.11">205.157.110.11</a> 02:13, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The rules about "prepositions" and similar words in our and other MOS's are really just proxies for important/stressed versus unimportant/unstressed words. In these titles, "Outta" is clearly a stressed word and hence takes the cap. Even "out" can be a stressed word and need a capital on occasion. <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Piersall_6fc7.html" title="Jimmy Piersall">Jimmy Piersall</a>'s life inpsired <i><a href="../../../f/e/a/Fear_Strikes_Out_ef51.html" title="Fear Strikes Out">Fear Strikes Out</a></i>, not <i>Fear Strikes out</i>. Mel is right to the extent that in a clear case like his Dickens example we mightn't like an authorial idiosyncrasy override our rules, but this case isn't that one. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 02:29, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>First, I'll simply ignore the venomous ignorant answers, and try to stick to replying to good-faith ignorance and to good-faith honest disagreement.</p>
<p>My change to the naming conventions were because the insertion of the four-letters or less condition was made without consensus (or, indeed, discussion) a few months ago. I asked for discussion on the matter at <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia_talk%7ENaming_conventions_b869.html#Capitalisation" title="Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions">Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions#Capitalisation</a>, which is the main page on this issue.</p>
<p>Prepositions, articles, etc., are always capitalised when they're the first or last words of a title; "fear Strikes Out" is thus not indicative of anything relevant here.</p>
<p>Deciding on stress and importance is subjective; I know of no Manual of Style that appeals to such a principle, and I think that it would be disastrous here. (For example, I'd say that the "out of" in "Straight outta Lynwood" was clearly unstressed, "Lynwood bearing the main stress, and "Straight" a secondary stress.) --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Talk</font></a>) 11:10, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>A quick look at search results for "Outta" shows a fairly large number of albums, books, TV episodes, etc. with Outta in the title, all capitalized. My opinion is that creative works should be titled in the encyclopedia the same way the creator intends and that the style guide may need updating. But I wanted to put out there that there are easily dozens of other entries with capitalized "Outta" in Wikipedia, so these will need to be changed if this is to be our convention. In particular, as Weird Al is a parodist, the title of this album should match the title it is a play of (<a href="../../../s/t/r/Straight_Outta_Compton_460b.html" title="Straight Outta Compton">Straight Outta Compton</a>). As well, other tributes to this such as <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straight_Outta_Ca%24hville_5b44.html" title="Straight Outta Ca$hville">Straight Outta Ca$hville</a> should also be consistent one way or the other. <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanjunk_9f8a.html" title="User:Ryanjunk">Ryanjunk</a> 16:26, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I totally agree, the title on Wikipedia should match the title in a publishers catalogue, unless there is a more popular variation, what people need to remember is we're in the business of providing people with the information that they want, when and where they want it. If we're going to change titles just to keep in line with our Manual of Style, we're effectively telling people they can't have the information they want where they want it, when they search for something as it appears on the album cover, book sleeve or what have you.

<li>Could those who think that we shouldn't have an MoS or naming conventions, and have no consistent style of our own, because (unlike any other publication, printed or on-line) we should simply follow whatever other sites or publications do on a case-by-case basis, please go to the relevant Talk pages and argue their case there?

<p>Is it the consensus here that it's OK for an admin to move an article, then protect the move, all without discussing the issue with those who disagree? If so, I should obviously have done that myself, when I was called in to look at the dispute. Of course, unlike Ryulong I corrected all the double redirects created by my move (I see that they've been done by someone else — and somewhat hysterically all protected).</p>
<p>So, for future cases: it's OK for me to page move, and protect my move?

<dd>Ryulong didn't do anything wrong, Mel Etitis was acting in Good Faith. The title should be 'Straight Outta Lynwood'. Wikipeda lacks a sufficient policy on the matter, and thus should default to the Artist's intent. This is an Encyclopedia. We should strive to report about the album. If the artist intended 'outta', he would've used it. As we have no MoS references on vernacular slang which juxtaposes the adverb 'out' with the preposition 'of', use Yankovic's intent, as demonstrated by his interviews promo material and so on. While it would've been easier if he'd ue the MoS approved 'Yeay, I am come to you direct and straight out of the olde Borough of Lynwood, verily and forsooth, tis True!', He didn't. He used 'Outta'. We should too. Consider for a moment that someone abused DuChamp with <a href="../../../l/2E/h/L.h.o.o.q..html" title="L.h.o.o.q.">L.h.o.o.q.</a>, when it ought to be L.H.O.O.Q.. DuChamp's use of language in his work was deliberate and precise, and as much a part of the art as any other element. Consider that he mocked language, used language to build a phrase that fit his mockery of language, and then included all of that in five capitalized letters. Artists may not always have such a clear and distinct relationship with language, but where such is demonstrable, Wikipedia should acqueisce to the artists' intents and report on such so long as it doesn't actively disrupt (we should not, for example, have winding formatted text in <a href="../../../e/2E/e/E.e._cummings.html" title="E.e. cummings">e.e. cummings</a>' article, nor wiggling animated text in <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurt_Schwitters_655e.html" title="Kurt Schwitters">Kurt Schwitters</a>').But as to the simple matter of titles of works, we should default to the artist. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 23:54, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes,that's it. I didn't agree with you, so I'm confused. No. I get it, and I'm saying that since everyone's saying the MoS is unclear, it should default to the artist's intent. That's not hard to understad, I think. but then, i'm an idiot who's confused cause I'm not agreeing with you. Try this: No Way Out. A proper name(title), in which Out is capitalized, and should be. As 'Outta' is a slang melange of Out and of, we use the leading word, Out, which SHOULD be capitalized bye any MoS, since Adverbs and Adjectives get capitalized, see A tale of Two, not two, Cities. As such, it is IN keeping with the MoS to capitalize SOL, (hey, interesting... SOL.) as it is botha proper name (title), AAAAAAANNND since the word in question is an adverb, which SHOULD be capitalized anyways.<a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 11:45, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with your conclusion (capitalize Outta), but a couple of minor nits to your argument which might tend to confuse people about the MoS. In "No Way Out", out is the last word, and they are always capitalized. Also, the word "out" can be used as several parts of speech, but in this case is used as a preposition and would otherwise fall under the "no capitals" rule. So if we were to follow the MoS exactly, we'd have a lower-case outta. The main argument here being <a href="../../../c/o/m/WP%7ECOMMONNAME_4276.html" title="WP:COMMONNAME">WP:COMMONNAME</a> and artist intent. <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanjunk_9f8a.html" title="User:Ryanjunk">Ryanjunk</a> 13:23, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not to delve too deeply into grammatical discussion, but out can be used as an adverb, as in the phrase "stretched out" or "to eat out".

<p>So far, then, the situation is this. The majority of admins here think that it's OK for Ryulong to choose one version of a page name to revert to and then to protect his move (despite the clear policy against that, as quoted above).

<dd>No, the majority of editors here think that ADVERBS are NOT Prepositions. Once again, We can look at it like this: Straight Outta Lynwood has an implied verb, with some meaning akin to 'to travel', 'to go' 'to come' or so on. As such, 'straight' modifies the verb, referring to the nature of the path of travel, and 'out' modifies the adverb 'straight'. This makes 'out' a modifying adverb as well. Return to the 'slang terms by the primary word' argument I made above, we're back to 'adverbs get capitalized. Per section 9c, Harbrace college handbook (1986), "In titles and subtitles of books, plays, student papers, and so on, capitalize the first and last words and all other words except articles, coordinating conjunctions, prepositions, and the 'to' in infinitives." As such, Straight and Outta comprise an adverbial phrase/clause, and qualify for capitalization. Finally, the move to talk pages of SOME but not all of those involved (I certainly got NO notice to participate) when it starts to go against you is highly unethical.

<dd>But that topic was being discussed here. And I think you've reached the wrong conclusion. Consider that, in "pull it out", "out" is a preposition, but in "pull out", "out" is an adverb. So there's a question of whether the context is "drive the car straight out of Lynwood" (preposition) or "drive straight out of Lynwood" (adverb). The latter is more likely, but the ambiguity is yet another reason why the current policy should be abandoned (as it has been de facto on other pages) and titles should be used verbatim. -- <a href="../../../j/i/b/User%7EJibal_6b94.html" title="User:Jibal">Jibal</a> 01:17, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Never mind. "straight" and "out of Lynwood" both modify "drive"; "straight" is an adverb, "out of Lynwood" is a prepositional phrase, "out" is a preposition (as is "outta"). -- <a href="../../../j/i/b/User%7EJibal_6b94.html" title="User:Jibal">Jibal</a> 01:51, 17 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>uh, no. Out modifies straight. Further, There's multiple citations of wikipolicy and nonwiki sources for keeping it capitalized. But I must still be a confused idiot who is also worried about smoky back room cabalism. Done, do what you want.<a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 02:20, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>As I said, "out of Lynwood" is a prepositional phrase; "out" can't possibly modify "straight". And I have cited the wikipolicy, <a href="../../../n/a/m/WP%7ENAME_8ce9.html" title="WP:NAME">WP:NAME</a>, that says it should not be capitalized, and that agrees with most manuals of style. If you have "multiple citations", please provide them. As for what you must be, I'll refrain from commenting. -- <a href="../../../j/i/b/User%7EJibal_6b94.html" title="User:Jibal">Jibal</a> 03:01, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>BLAST!! It's been a while and I really thought we'd seen the last of Jacob. Oh well. Spotting his socks is child's play these days, so there's no point bothering the checkusers. Personally, I think we should just go by the rule that if it quacks like a duck, waddles like a duck, fucks like a duck, and pushes pro-Communist POV like a duck, it's probably Jacob Peters. No need to waste RFCU time, blocks after ANI reports should be the norm.

<p>The log is full of these incidents, but these are sixteen inappropriate blocks over the course of one hour. The log is full of blocks before adequate warnings have been given, immediate blocks upon a single incident of vandalism, indefinite blocks of usernames after a single vandalism edit, and excessively long blocks of shared IPs. I spoke with Naconkantari <a href="../../../n/a/c/User_talk%7ENaconkantari_6fb8.html#Recent_school_blocks" title="User talk:Naconkantari">here</a> but saw no indication that anything would change, so I am reporting it here. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 21:55, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>block 1: Short 3hr block for two rapid fire vandalisms? seems ok to me. Block 2 and 3: Again, seems ok, 3hrs is a short block to cool off vandalism Block 4 and 5: user made disputed edits AFTER a final warning. Short block = ok to me. Block 6 and 7: see block 2 and 3. Block 8-11, again, see blcoks 2 and 3. Blcok 12 registered users should be held to a higher accountability than anons. I disagree with indef, but I haven't looked in depth into it.</p>
<p>etc. etc. None of these blocks is for more than 31 hours, a suitable cool off period. Every single one of those users is a vandal, some repeat times, some clearly violating the rules, others less clearly so, but none of them constructively editing. I don't really see the problem here. If they were all indef blocks you'd have a valid complaint but come on....complaining over 1 hour and 3 hour blocks? <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">⇒</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../c/l/i/WP%7ECLIMBING_ffc5.html" title="WP:CLIMBING"><small><sup>On Belay!</sup></small></a> 22:19, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Per <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBLOCK_89b0.html" title="WP:BLOCK">WP:BLOCK</a>, "Blocks should not be used against isolated incidents of vandalism." That means that blocking a user who has made one edit is a violation of blocking policy. Per <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>, a user should receive a proper set of warnings, including a final warning, and should vandalize after the final warning, before being listed. That implies that they should be warned, including a final warning, and continue to vandalize, before being blocked. Per <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVAND_6593.html" title="WP:VAND">WP:VAND</a>, vandalism is NOT an NPOV violation. A user has no business giving someone vandalism warning for a content dispute, and an admin has no business blocking someone for a content dispute. Again per WP:BLOCK, dynamic IPs should be blocked for <i>up to</i> 24 hours, and logged-in users should <i>start</i> at 24 hours. It is implied in WP:BLOCK that blocks of shared IPs, such as those at schools, should be shorter and be given out more carefully. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 22:26, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Wikipedia is far too tolerant of school vandals as it is, and it hurts the project. I daresay that anon users create more problems than they solve. Looking at some of these contribution logs, there remain vandalism edits to be cleaned up, even with as quick as a gun as Naconkatari's. E.g.,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Margaret_Atwood&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=115148431" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Margaret_Atwood&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=115148431" rel="nofollow">[33]</a>. It's safe to say someone making plainly vandalizing edits from a school account isn't likely to start making legitimate edits in the next three hours.</dd>

<dd>I was unaware that we now block editors for vandalism on sight. Am I honestly being told that this is now standard operating procedure? The whole warning thing... we don't do that any more? Nine out of the above sixteen blocks were in response to exactly one recent vandalism edit, and only one of those was a school. Setting aside tolerance for school vandals, the other eight were the very <i>definition</i> of an isolated incident. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 22:39, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It's entirely possible that Naconkantari has seen the exact same edits before and is blocking as a preventative measure, which is the purpose of blocks anyway. A lot of school vandals come day after day and make the same changes. Even if the IPs are different, they're still probably the same person. Has Naconkantari been notified that this is being discussed here? They're probably willing to explain themself. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalie_Erin_58a7.html" title="User:Natalie Erin">Natalie</a> 22:57, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would like to ask administrators to please look at the above incidents, as well as Naconkantari's block history in general. I understand that you're assuming good faith on Naconkantari's part, but please also assume good faith on my part: I am honestly trying to bring a serious problem to your attention here. I had never had any encounter with Naconkantari before this. I have explained above how the blocks violate blocking policy, but I'll reiterate below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Blocks have been in response to isolated incidents of vandalism, including blocks without warning of IP addresses that have never edited Wikipedia before.</li>
<li>Blocks have been of excessive length. Per blocking policy, 31 hours is too long to block a dynamic IP, and an indefinite block for one vandalism edit by a logged-in user is inappropriate as well.</li>
</ol>
<p>The blocks above are contrary to what WP:BLOCK says explicitly. I would appreciate a response from anyone explaining either why they do not violate WP:BLOCK or under what circumstances WP:BLOCK should not be followed. If, as some people have suggested, these blocks that <i>appear</i> to be of isolated incidents are in fact part of a campaign against an active vandal, I would appreciate an explanation of the circumstances. No pattern is obvious looking at the edits. Please do not simply say "school vandalism isn't an isolated incident", as that can only possibly apply to one of the above blocks. Please explain <i>all</i> blocks that appear, at first glance, to violate blocking policy.</p>
<p>I'd also like to reiterate that I have not cherry-picked Naconkantari's block history to find the sixteen worst blocks. I just looked at a one hour period. Please extrapolate out; if a half of these are iffy, it is a serious problem for such an active blocker. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 23:23, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The whole point in the blocking policy is to prevent further disruption, it is not a rigid set of rules and indeed the section your complaint seems to rely on is a section marked quite clearly as a guide. Admins are expected to apply common sense as to when a block may or not be appropriate. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 07:28, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If it is acceptable to apply dozens of blocks per day to isolated incidents of vandalism then the guide should reflect such. I acknowledge the need for admins to be able to make case-by-base decisions on what particular situations requite, but blocks should generally follow the guidelines laid out in the blocking policy. I am not complaining about a handful of questionable blocks, but about what Naconkantari spends all of his or her time on Wikipedia doing. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 09:40, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd not have a problem with that block and certainly not enough to go and undo another admins actions without first consulting but merely diving in and declaring myself to be right (the opening of a wheel war if both admins insist they are in the right). The user was warned and continued, the edits clearly weren't of the "test" type, deletions of content from disconnected pages, deleting content from the user pages of a user who had warned. <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> only goes so far and I personally cannot see anyway that user could be perceived as being here to do anything but disrupt. As to the issue of the block notice, I can hardly see it as relevant for an account which had only done vandalism (I know other admins differ on this point), but that is only a procedural issue and since <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">wikipedia is not a bureaucracy</a> doesn't invalidate the block. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 14:13, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have no problem with Naconkantari's blocks. Instead of "blocks should generally follow the guidelines laid out in the blocking policy", the policy should reflect actual practice. I routinely block school-boy vandalism with no or minimal notice, usually for 15 minutes to 3 hours, but longer if it seems called for. I block whenever I think it will prevent further vandalism, and plan to continue unless there is a consensus that I should not. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 14:30, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree that we should change WP:BLOCK to support 31 hour blocks of IPs without warning upon the first incident of vandalism, but as the majority here do appear to support that sort of block, I agree that WP:BLOCK should absolutely be brought in line with actual practice. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 15:19, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Some of the blocks may have been a bit quick, but for the majority of the cases I will endorse them. I cannot see everything which has taken place here, but one very real possibility is that some of the IPs blocked are vandals returning with a new IP to continue their juvenile nonsense, and blocking those immediately is quite justified. Although a naive look at only the block log and talk page will make those blocks <i>appear</i> hasty, there is frequently a deeper story than just the one vandalism edit. Dealing with vandalism really wastes a lot of our time and resources, and putting the vandals out of action quickly is quite justifiable. I also think that a person subject to a block like this is not going to be upset the same way that a person blocked for, say the 3RR will be. They probably think its loads of fun that an administrator got their attention and they got to test the Wikipedia defenses to the breaking point. I think we should be tougher and quicker when it comes to blocking people for vandalism (though I also advocate more conservatism when it comes to blocking people for disruption.) <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 14:49, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>What is the official policy on article sandboxes? When <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essjay_controversy.html" title="Essjay controversy">Essjay controversy</a> was protected yesterday, I made a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Essjay_controversy/sandbox" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Essjay_controversy/sandbox" rel="nofollow">sandbox page</a> for two very <i>specific</i> purposes, linked off the Talk page (include an image yay/nay, and where; and the placement of ONE sentence). my aim was to hash out the stuff amicably there rather than have article edit warring another week. User:QuackGuru, who has been very contentious on the Essjay talk page (and posted here on ANI previously, two days ago), has been... alternately I think trying to help, but has been hindering equally. His <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:QuackGuru&amp;curid=9943823&amp;diff=115731584&amp;oldid=115259089" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:QuackGuru&amp;curid=9943823&amp;diff=115731584&amp;oldid=115259089" rel="nofollow">own user page</a> is a hyper-sourced copy of the Essjay article now also. what is the proper decorum/handling/rules/policy for development sandboxes?

<p>Over the past week, various IP's and one user, who I suspect to be the same person, have been repeating the same vandalous edits over and over again despite being reverted, and when a higher level of warning is issued to that IP, they have switched to another. Now, they are using several IP's, each with only one edit. I am unsure how to proceed.</p>

<dd>To clarify—yes, my concern was about the incivil implications of the edit summaries. They imply (pretty directly, and completely inaccurately) that the editors whose comments were removed are vandals.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive215_1375.html" title="Edit section: Rebroad and Person">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Rebroad and Person</span></h2>
<p><a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebroad_730a.html" title="User:Rebroad">Rebroad</a> came to the Person article early today and completely ignoed that it was a contoversial article.</p>
<p>He went to the disambig page, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Person_%28disambiguation%29&amp;diff=115760188&amp;oldid=115471731" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Person_%28disambiguation%29&amp;diff=115760188&amp;oldid=115471731" rel="nofollow">edited it</a> and then <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Person_%28philosphical%29&amp;diff=115760123&amp;oldid=114810985" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Person_%28philosphical%29&amp;diff=115760123&amp;oldid=114810985" rel="nofollow">moved</a> the Person page, "as per distinction on disambiguation page" a distinction of course, that he created.</p>
<p>He then edited the Person page redirecting it to <a href="../../../p/e/r/Person_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Person (disambiguation)">Person (disambiguation)</a> which went against long standing consensus and kept non-admins from being able to undo his move.</p>
<p>I've already listed undoing the move as an uncontroversial move at Wikipedia requested moves (because if someone wants it done, then can request it as a controversial move).</p>
<p>The whole idea of renaming it is silly if you look at the article or the talk page--the new name isn't appropriate much anyway, since the article keeps shifting between philosophy and rights associated with being a person (and people keep trying to split it).</p>
<p>But I'm really concerned by this editor's edits to the article. The entire process of the renaming not only ignored that the article was controversial and that splitting it and renaming it had been discussed, but was done incredibly deceptively, editing the disambig page and then using the disambig page as an excuse to change the name, when really, you don't rename an article because a disambig page says something anyway.</p>
<p>Then further blatantly going against consensus and making sure that an admin was needed to undo the move--the entire thing comes very close to vandalism, too close for my comfort. I'm trying very hard to AGF, but it's very hard for me to believe that this was just an experienced editor who came to the article (these are Rebroad's first edits to Person) and had such a strong point of view that he moved a controversial article and lied in an edit summary and so on and so on.</p>
<p>I'm obviously involved, I'm been working on undoing the edits, because if these changes are ones that are going to be made, they'll need to be suggested and gain consensus--something they don't have now. And I've obviously been an editor on the article before, though I haven't edited it recently, and I have opinions about the article and where it should go.</p>
<p>I'd really appreciate if someone could weigh in on this--this is really troubling to me, but I recognize that I'm involved and so... Thanks. <b><a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiss_Mondegreen_925d.html" title="User:Miss Mondegreen">Miss Mondegreen</a> | <a href="../../../m/i/s/User_talk%7EMiss_Mondegreen_a6d2.html" title="User talk:Miss Mondegreen">Talk</a> &#160; 12:03, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</b></p>

<dd>I must say I found the disambiguation page quite well laid out. It's not appropriate for <a href="../../../p/e/r/Person.html" title="Person">Person</a> to remain a redirect, however, so I'd actually move the disambig page over. I'm not sure many people think philosophy when they think about the term.

<dd>Yes, it's a nice disambig page. And I'm one of the people who really thinks that this page needs a major overhaul and that the disambig page should probably be located at person, but this is a controversial article. No name change proposals have gone through--no content overhauls have gone through, and moving the disambig page to person has not gone through. Consensus hasn't been achieved and even if I agreed with everything this user did, I'd still want it undone so that it could be done properly, and I'd have real problems with the way it was done. The move back hasn't gone through yet (an admin is needed to do that, and apparantly I didn't give enough of a rationale) and I have an enormous problem with a person getting around consensus by moving the article and editing the namespace so that it can't be moved back. Uncontroversial moves says</dd>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>"If there is any prior discussion as to the name of the article please link to it. If there is any possibility that the proposed page move could be opposed by anyone, do not list it in this section. If the move location appears as a red link you should be able to move the article using the move button of the top of the article's page"</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dd>This user has been around Wikipedia for years and should understand the difference between controversial and uncontroversial moves. The user was new to the article, and should have read the article and the talk page before moving it. If the user did, the user should have realized that the name wasn't appropriate and that there was consensus against moving the page, that the page had been tried to be moved before and to more applicable names and they hadn't gone through. The user didn't even move it to the proper spelling of philosophical, and only when the user came back hours later was this fixed. The user hasn't commented on the talk page once or made any other edits--all of this is very troubling to me.</dd>

<dd>And, in the meantime, the article sits in limbo, person is a disambig page and while this may bring editors back to the article (as it did me, I haven't had the time recently), I'm not working on the article now, I'm working on cleaning up this mess, and my time would be better spent editing or working on the proposals that everyone had last sorta agreed on. <b><a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiss_Mondegreen_925d.html" title="User:Miss Mondegreen">Miss Mondegreen</a> | <a href="../../../m/i/s/User_talk%7EMiss_Mondegreen_a6d2.html" title="User talk:Miss Mondegreen">Talk</a> &#160; 22:01, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</b></dd>

<dd>I have to question this block a bit, although I see it was done in good faith.

<li>For what its worth, the original blocks were for making unilateral changes to football templates and 3RRing. The new sock seems to be making brand new templates, not disrupting old ones. So while it is definitely block evasion, I'm not seeing any other blockable acts by the new account. <font face="monospace"><a href="../../../d/g/i/User%7EDgies_d44c.html" title="User:Dgies"><font color="#00F"><b>—dgies</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../d/g/i/User_talk%7EDgies_d02f.html" title="User talk:Dgies">t</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dgies_24b2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dgies">c</a></sub></font> 20:27, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah I understand that, but this is the second time its been an issue with the current block, which is why I feel an extension is required, the 1st time, certainly I agree it should just have been a reset block, however, continued abuse of his block merits an extension in my opinion <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanpostlethwaite_bb6d.html" title="User:Ryanpostlethwaite">Ryanpostlethwaite</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ryanpostlethwaite_1aae.html" title="Special:Contributions/ryanpostlethwaite">contribs</a>/<a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanpostlethwaite_d7e9.html" title="User talk:Ryanpostlethwaite">talk</a> 20:31, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As Ryan noted, this isn't the first time this has happened. When he uses the unblock template, he admits to using sockpuppets and says he will stop if he is unblocked. He shouldn't have to be unblocked to stop using socks.

<p>I need another admin take a look at the absurdity of the user that is the subject of this report. He has declared we can do nothing to block him because he'll just rack up 100's of IPs. He trolls from page to page, complete with photo-illustrations of this "benjiwolf" character that he is playing (see the report above) and has already used 13 IPs and one (to our knowledge) registered account to avoid blocks. I quite honestly don't know what to do with this one, as range blocks will have a heap of collateral damage. On top of all this, I'm leaving in the morning for <a href="../../../s/p/r/Spring_Break_03d1.html" title="Spring Break">Spring Break</a> and will not likely have much time to invest in this over the next week.

<p>User Biophys already earlier made a personal attack against me due to his unstoppable edit warring see the whole matter here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Archive78#If_this_a_personal_attack" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Archive78#If_this_a_personal_attack" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Archive78#If_this_a_personal_attack</a>. He was warned by administrator Alex Bakharev <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABiophys&amp;diff=114473197&amp;oldid=112400950" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABiophys&amp;diff=114473197&amp;oldid=112400950" rel="nofollow">here</a> and personal attack was removed.</p>
<p>However, Biophys has created an article which he titled Internet troll squads, which is based on single unreliable source - immigration advertisement newspaper with circulation less than 5 000. And on the talk page to this article Biophys has created section entitled "KGB trolls in Wikipedia?" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AInternet_troll_squads&amp;diff=115321490&amp;oldid=115220397" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AInternet_troll_squads&amp;diff=115321490&amp;oldid=115220397" rel="nofollow">diff</a>, where he invites everyone to his talk page entitled "Vlad" - <a href="../../../b/i/o/User_talk%7EBiophys_2fc8.html#Vlad" title="User talk:Biophys">User_talk:Biophys#Vlad</a>.

Considering that user Biophys entitled his section on the Internet troll squads talk page "KGB trolls in Wikipedia?", it is clear that Biophys publicly slanders and defames me and Alex Bakharev. As you could see from my IP address (which is not proxy like in Biophys case), I can't be man working for KGB. I would like to stop this unstoppable continuing harassment by user Biophys. It seems that his only business in Wikipedia is discussion of other Wikipedians, rather than discussion of the articles. I pretty much understand his desire to republish blog La Russophobe and all other anti-russian sources in the Wikipedia, but this has nothing to do with personal attacks and with discussion of reliability of these anti-russian sources.<a href="../../../v/l/a/User%7EVlad_fedorov_a7bd.html" title="User:Vlad fedorov">Vlad fedorov</a> 04:51, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I want to protest nominating this aricle for deletion based on the false peraonal accusations by Vlad. The article Internet troll squads and its talk page does not include a single word about any person. It was Vlad who decided that article is about him and Alex Bakharev. I have never claimed this anywhere. Ithink that Internet troll squads is a very interesting and general topic. There is nothing personal here. Besides, I was not the person who opened this question. It was someone probably from Germany.

<dd>Most likely it was you, Biophys, who used that proxy from Germany. Long before this anonymous message appeared, you posted information about troll squads on your user page when you had a conflict with me over FSB article editing (clearly for harrassment of me). So how you could reconcile the fact, that this anonymous user from Germany conviniently appears just in time when you have received a warning over your another uncivilty and Politkovskaya article was blocked by Alex Bakharev because of your edit warring with me? Moreover, why you then started discussion about KGB trolls in Wikipedia by inviting everyone to this discussion? Haven't you violated Wikipedia rule that we discuss articles, not editors?<a href="../../../v/l/a/User%7EVlad_fedorov_a7bd.html" title="User:Vlad fedorov">Vlad fedorov</a> 05:42, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Gentlemen, it is not the first time <a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">user:Azerbaijani</a> makes up things and directs it against everyone who opposes his disruptive editing (which is a case of its own -- and by the way, we are all part of Armenia-Azerbaijan ArbCom that goes on right now). From those two diffs he provided, I failed to understand, what he considers as a "personal attack"? If telling him that his so-called DNA information, which uses a Persian-language Iranian state-run news agency as an only "source", is POV and biased, or that he is not an Azerbaijani ethnically (which he never denied until now, and now has actually essentially confirmed it), can be considered as a personal attack, then how about these words of his in the same thread (to which I responded, and now <a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">user:Azerbaijani</a> tries to present me as an "attacker" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAzerbaijan_%28Iran%29&amp;diff=115288799&amp;oldid=115124787" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAzerbaijan_%28Iran%29&amp;diff=115288799&amp;oldid=115124787" rel="nofollow">[48]</a>: "The culture of us Iranian Azerbaijani's is vastly different from the culture in the Republic of Azerbaijan. If you knew anything about Iranian Azerbaijani's, you would have known that! Your culture is completely different than ours, you have gone through 80 years of Soviet occupation, and you assume that we have the same culture? This is ridiculous. <b>I am Iranian</b>, dont worry about me so much about me." Here he personally assaults the entire nation of Azerbaijan, and by the way, note that he admits being Iranian, not Azerbaijani.</p>
<p>He goes on much further with his insults and attacks in an older edit on January 2, 2007 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAzerbaijan_%28Iran%29&amp;diff=97871003&amp;oldid=97833196" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAzerbaijan_%28Iran%29&amp;diff=97871003&amp;oldid=97833196" rel="nofollow">[49]</a>: "<b>There is not Republic of Azerbaijan</b> if thats what you mean, <b>the nation is fictitious and it is founded on one lie after another</b>. Now you are not only trying to take our land but take away our rightful name too? <b>Stop with your POV edits all over the place</b>!". As you can see, <a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">user:Azerbaijani</a> simply loves to insult everyone based on national basis and then, adding insult to injury, accuse the victim of his aggression of "POV". What an ingenuity!</p>
<p>Also, note that just above this complaint, <a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">user:Azerbaijani</a> is listed as a party to another case of disruptive editing<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents#Persian_Gulf_name_in_Arabic" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents#Persian_Gulf_name_in_Arabic" rel="nofollow">[50]</a>. It looks like he read that, and while responding to it, decided to drag unrelated people on unrelated cases into that. No thanks, don't want to be part of this game. But for such words about "ficticious" nation of the Republic of Azerbaijan, he, and not anyone else, should be reprimanded. --<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">AdilBaguirov</a> 23:25, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

Adil, your comment which said "user "Azerbaijani", had you been a real Azerbaijani, you would have known that Azerbaijani culture is as different and unique from the Iranian culture as any other culture of the region" is, indeed, a personal attack. <a href="../../../p/i/c/User_talk%7EPicaroon9288_6280.html" title="User talk:Picaroon9288">Picaroon</a> 23:40, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>More of Adil's personal attacks! He knows as well as anyone that there are 20 million Azeri's in Iran. I'm sick of his continuous personal attacks and I ask the admins to apply Wikipedia's rules and punish him accordingly. My comments about the Azerbaijan were about its name, not any nation. I'm tired of this user. He says I'm fabricating evidence yet the two links are there for everyone to see. This user is known to use OR, POV, and PA. He has a history of this. And oh yea, do you know why I'm in Arbcom? Because users like Adil fabricated evidence about me. I never went through any dispute resolution to even be on an Arbcom. My name was added days later by Grandmaster, under false pretenses. The Administrators are aware of this fact.</dd>

<p>This user has been creating multiple useless templates and images and appears to only be interested in being disruptive. The user has also made some positive edits, but they don't seem to understand that we don't need templates telling people to write in big text as some users are legally blind.</p>
<p>Some of his creations include: Template:HappyPatsDay!, Template:Blocked2, Template:typo, Template:Blindusername, and putting an account with no contributions who just happens to be the alternate account of a sysop on AIV. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrator_intervention_against_vandalism&amp;diff=115893490&amp;oldid=115893259" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrator_intervention_against_vandalism&amp;diff=115893490&amp;oldid=115893259" rel="nofollow">[52]</a>. Also the delightful image Image:Cannotsee.JPG.</p>

<p>I suggest the removal of all non-professionals (ie. podcastors, beach bums) to another page. A lot of the categories are nothing close for being professional.</p>
