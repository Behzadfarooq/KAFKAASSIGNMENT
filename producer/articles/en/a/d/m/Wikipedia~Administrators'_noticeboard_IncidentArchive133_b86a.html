<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive133_b86a.html" title="Edit section: User:Netscott">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">User:Netscott</span></h2>
<p>For weeks now <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott">User:Netscott</a> has been agitating concerning <a href="../../../a/n/t/Image%7EAntiWarRallyFeb162003.jpg_0b52.html" title="Image:AntiWarRallyFeb162003.jpg">this image</a> uploaded by SlimVirgin. He kept insisting that the image be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=New_anti-Semitism&amp;diff=71601636&amp;oldid=71547009|labelled" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=New_anti-Semitism&amp;diff=71601636&amp;oldid=71547009|labelled" rel="nofollow">as "Anti-Semitic"</a>, against the objections of SlimVirgin and other editors. Netscott then tried to have it deleted as a derivative image; though the photographer had released it, Netscott claimed the poster in the photograph itself hadn't been properly released. Jkelly then proposed that the photograph be used under the photographer's release, and the poster image on the photograph itself under Fair Use. Netscott then objected, saying that we couldn't claim Fair Use on the poster unless we knew the name of the artist. SlimVirgin then went and discovered the name of the artist, and added it on the image page. Netscott then claimed it wasn't Fair Use based on "Counterexample 4". When this was shot down, he complained about the name of the image, insisting it was making claims of anti-Semitism. SlimVirgin then uploaded the image under a new "neutral" name that didn't mention anti-Semitism. Netscott then kept trying to attach the new image to the old name which contained the name anti-Semitism, trying again to make that linkage. When this was reverted, Netscott then tried to associate the name of the artist with ANSWER, a controversial group, and continually kept associating the poster creator's name with anti-Semitism on all sorts of Talk: pages and message boards, trying to get the image deleted again, ostensibly out of concerns about <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, but in actuality excacerbating any BLP concerns, since it was Netscott alone who kept making this connection, in a dozen different places. SlimVirgin then removed the name of the poster creater from the image page; at this point Netscott then insisted on listing the image as a Copyright violation, claiming the artist was no longer attributed.</p>
<p>The image itself is quite famous; it's been reproduced and discussed on a number of famous blogs and websites, and has been discussed in the media. Netscott's purpose here seems to be to troll as much as possible, agitating in any way possible to get the image deleted, while possibly endangering Wikipedia itself by deliberately associating an individual's name with anti-Semitism. In his relatively brief Wikipedia career Netscott has been blocked 8 times already. In fact he would still be under his last block, for a week, if not for the fact that an admin involved in a content dispute on Netscott's side unblocked him and re-blocked for a day instead. I'm suggesting a 1 week block at this point, though I'm open to the idea of an indefinite block as well.

<dd>Netscott was blocked for a week on August 25 by <a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">User:Blnguyen</a> for persistent 3RR violations, but unfortunately <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastique_e135.html" title="User:Bastique">user:Bastique</a>, who was involved in that particular content dispute with Netscott, reduced the block to 24 hours. Otherwise none of this trolling would have happened. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 03:36, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Was mildly involved in some of the early issues, but would also support a week long block for persistent trolling and disruption. Given the user's other productive edits I do not think an indefinite block is called for at this point. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 03:42, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Total misrepresentation of the facts here. My efforts relative to this image has been to properly establish neutral point of view relative to it. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=New_anti-Semitism&amp;diff=71601636&amp;oldid=71547009" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=New_anti-Semitism&amp;diff=71601636&amp;oldid=71547009" rel="nofollow">This</a> is what my first edit relative to this issue consisted of. Without any discussion whatsoever <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> (<a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SlimVirgin_2cc7.html" title="Special:Contributions/SlimVirgin">contribs</a>) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=New_anti-Semitism&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=71601636" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=New_anti-Semitism&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=71601636" rel="nofollow">reverted</a> my addition. Because Wikipedia is not a soapbox we're not to be making statements about what a given piece of content is (this is clearly spelled out in <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>). On every turn my efforts in this direction have been thwarted. I even went so far as to <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_NPOV_image_policy_4e18.html" title="User:Netscott/NPOV image policy">make a guide</a> illustrative of how a caption needs to read in order for Wikipedia to meet neutral point of view. Unfortunately <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">User:SlimVirgin</a> and to a lesser extent <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">User:Jayjg</a> have demonstrated ownership on this article to the point that virtually all of my good faith edits were reverted. SlimVirgin even went so far as to say that SHE had to verify my edits.&#160;???? With that image as the lead for <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_anti-Semitism_dc04.html" title="New anti-Semitism">new anti-Semitism</a> and with no in article text about reliable and verifiable sources statements included Wikipedia is seriously in jeapordy of libel relative to branding this artist's work anti-Semitic and in consequence the artist himself. A good number of editors have been supportive of my efforts including <a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">User:AYArktos</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastique_e135.html" title="User:Bastique">User:Bastique</a>, <a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">User:Gmaxwell</a>, <a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">User:Fastfission</a> (in WikiEn-i) , <a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELiftarn_fddd.html" title="User:Liftarn">User:Liftarn</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">User:Geni</a> to name a few. A number of <a href="../../../n/e/w/Talk%7ENew_anti-Semitism_6f68.html#RfC" title="Talk:New anti-Semitism">responses</a> to an RfC I started also were supportive of my suggestions. All of the editing I've done has been in good faith. I've made <a href="../../../n/e/w/Talk%7ENew_anti-Semitism_6f68.html#Question_about_top_poster_image" title="Talk:New anti-Semitism">quite a few efforts</a> to discuss this matter to try to come to a consensus and I've been shut down on all sides by these two editors. <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia%7EBiographies_of_living_persons_Noticeboard_archive1_28c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons/Noticeboard/archive1">Here</a> is the BLP discussion wherein I expressed the very real case that Wikipedia is in libel relative to the artist by publishing his work as the lead image and thereby implying that it is an example of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_anti-Semitism_dc04.html" title="New anti-Semitism">new anti-Semitism</a> (particularly when there's no sources cited in the article as saying that). Both SlimVirgin <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image%3AAntiWarRallyFeb162003.jpg&amp;diff=73146714&amp;oldid=72880791" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image%3AAntiWarRallyFeb162003.jpg&amp;diff=73146714&amp;oldid=72880791" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and Jayjg <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image%3AAntiWarRallyFeb162003.jpg&amp;diff=73147996&amp;oldid=73147714" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image%3AAntiWarRallyFeb162003.jpg&amp;diff=73147996&amp;oldid=73147714" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> have themselves expressed concern about libel by contravening <a href="../../../f/u/c/WP%7EFUC_7b76.html" title="WP:FUC">Wikipedia:Fair use policy #10</a> in removing the artist's name from the image page itself (for an image to qualify for fair use an artist or copyright holder <b>must</b> be attributed).

<dd>That is absolute nonsense. Geni, Gmaxwell, and FastFission did not support Netscott, and in fact several people questioned why he was posting to the mailing list about it. (Geni's position was that we needed the name of the copyright holder, and we now have it.) Liftarn did support Netscott, because Liftarn also wants the image gone at any cost. The image has been discussed with Jkelly and the matter settled.</dd>

<dd>You are using the word "trolling" to discount my efforts (in a very <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda.html" title="Propaganda">propagandistic</a> way).

<p>Edit conflicted for the fifth time - I was the original blocker and was briefed about an IRC conversation which lead to the unblock after Netscott was unblocked. At no time was I informed that Bastique was himself involved in editing the part of the article in question let alone the general sphere of Jewish editing. I am quite unimpressed by the excessive levels of agitation which have been employed, in particular when he tags the pic as a copyvio of wikipedia. Leaning 1 week, definitely not indef, as Netscott is a serious contributor. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">rant-line</a> 04:23, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Jayjg, is it improper to insist that images are in compliance with Fair use policy? Is it improper to insist that Wikipedia not defame an artist with poorly sourced statements about his art being "anti-Semitic" (particularly not including such statements in the article). When I came to the article there was virtually no relevant text in it's caption relative to the image. Here's what the caption read when I started to call for NPOV on it:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p>"A placard at a <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_16.html" title="February 16">February 16</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, anti-war rally in <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_a4a4.html" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a>. Photograph by zombie of <i>zombietime.com</i>. <a href="http://www.zombietime.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.zombietime.com" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Essentially the image was "there" as the perfect example of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_anti-Semitism_dc04.html" title="New anti-Semitism">new anti-Semitism</a>. Then after my efforts and comments by <a href="../../../g/i/m/User%7EGimmetrow_3628.html" title="User:Gimmetrow">User:Gimmetrow</a> about <a href="../../../c/a/p/WP%7ECAP_97cb.html#Some_criteria_for_a_good_caption" title="WP:CAP">WP:CAP</a> <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> (<a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SlimVirgin_2cc7.html" title="Special:Contributions/SlimVirgin">contribs</a>) added some text to at least establish the image's relevance to the rest of the article like so:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Photographed at an anti-war rally in San Francisco on February 16, 2003, this placard mixes anti-imperialist, anti-capitalist, anti-Zionist and anti-globalization imagery with some classic anti-Semitic motifs. Photograph taken by zombie of zombietime.com. [8]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But where are the reliable sources in that caption? This sets up negative details relative to the artist and as such reliable and verifiable sources need to be <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html#Writing_style" title="WP:BLP">written into the article</a> in support of such negative details. <i>(<a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetscott_c779.html" title="User talk:Netscott">→</a><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott"><span class="pBody" style="border: 0; color: gray; padding: 0; font-size: 100%;">Netscott</span></a>)</i> 05:41, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

Netscott, you are editing tendenciously because you have some fundamental misunderstandings about Wikipedia policy.

Netscott wasn't warring with himself, unfortunately, he caught a throng of POV warriors who will not tolerate any page other than the way they say it. I actually am very neutral on the particular topics, and try to remain so when working on these pages.</dd>
<dd>Furthermore, when I was willing to offer a compromise, to try to come to a middle point, I am responded to within minutes with cacaphony of aggression and antagonism, as if there are users repeatedly refreshing their watchlists. How someone can respond within three minutes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:New_anti-Semitism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=71705935" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:New_anti-Semitism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=71705935" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> with such an incredible surge of energy is beyond me, unless they're doing exactly that.

<dd>Your analysis is factually inaccurate, and you're basing decisions and opinions on limited information. If you were to read all the diffs (going back a couple of weeks), you'd see that Netscott has been massively disruptive around this issue, and that others have not. You'd also see that he has caused similar problems elsewhere, based on a failure to understand our edit policies. You're doing people a disservice by equating behaviors that you've only spent a short time examining. That's all I'm going to say on the matter, because the amount of time spent on this has been ridiculous. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 00:12, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Bastique, I find it difficult to believe that you would still attempt to edit under the veil of neutrality on the subject. In every single instance that you have come into contact with an article that even remotely relates to the wider topic, you take the same position and always end up defending the same people, all the while insisting you are a standard of impartiality. Furthermore you do this in such a way that implies authority that must be listened to. Frankly I cannot see a signifigant difference between you and Netscott.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 13:42, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Prior to this article, I was responding to complaints at <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/OTRS" class="extiw" title="m:OTRS">m:OTRS</a> that you, and others, owned certain articles and wouldn't allow anyone else to edit who had a difference of opinion from yours. This has happened a number of times with you. If you can't see a significant difference between me and Netscott, its your head is so stuck in your own limited worldview that you can't see anything beyond that. You do have a knack of completely pissing people off, Moshe, and my responses to you might have been tainted with a bit of rage at your accusations and insinuations.</dd>
<dd>Because I'm an admin, I don't edit articles in which I have a strong opinion, or haven't in a considerable time. I have a blog, that's linked from my user page. Try to find anything remotely connected with a pro-Israel or anti-Israel policy. I do have strong opinions. I try to remain objective, and that's why I don't edit articles in which I have strong opinions.</dd>
<dd>My opinion is that you guys are POV-pushing in a most nasty manner. When someone trolls and disagrees with your point of view, like Netscott, you get him blocked. When someone trolls and agrees with your point of view, you call him or her a contributor. There is a very large double standard on articles in which Slim Virgin and Jayjg have an opinion. People don't want to edit them if they have a Neutral point of view, because POV pushers like yourself will gather together and eat them alive.</dd>
<dd>Prior to this entire incident, I had at least a positive opinion of SlimVirgin. The incessant harping about my actions regarding Netscott, however, are hypocritical to say the least. Netscott deserved unblocking, because the actions should be applied unversally, not just to people whose opinions are not of your own. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastique_e135.html" title="User:Bastique"><b>B</b>astique</a><span class="Unicode" style="color:#FF72E3;">▼</span><b><sup><a href="../../../b/a/s/User_talk%7EBastique_d47c.html" title="User talk:Bastique">parler</a></sup></b> <sub><b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bastique_7452.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bastique">voir</a></b></sub> 22:06, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I apoligize for how condescending this may sound, but I actually find it funny that you have chosen to take such a tone in your response. You couldn't have shown a better example of the false authority mixed in with inappropriate personal remarks and irrelevant commentary that I pointed to in my previous comment here. Furthermore it is utter nonsense- to add some backround for people who do not know, the "people" I have "pissed off" that Bastique is referring to is <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">User:Alienus</a> on the <a href="../../../i/r/m/IRmep_d748.html" title="IRmep">IRmep</a> article. I seriously invite anyone to look at the record of that user, as he is currently banned for a year after a whole wiki-career of bad behavior. Bastique not only found himself on the same side of the above user, but he rigiously defended his actions while belittling and disrespecting me for not agreeing with him.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 11:58, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I came off too harsh here and it's not fair to the parties involved. To me it would appear to me that in some subject areas we have a group of dedicated and hardworking users who spending a huge amount of effort protecting the articles against outside bigots and POV pushers. The problem is real, and much of the work they do is good. However, it appears that the stress of this work is causing paranoia... where we see a lurking POV pusher behind every action, even actions by topically disinterested but hard working Wikipedias. This results in a situation where some editors, myself included, are honestly afraid that if they wade in again and argue for neutralizing edits on such articles that they will be cast as some sort of bigot by people who are trying to protect the articles from the actual bigots. This fear translates into frustration and results in a break down of cooperation and communication. So even in the absence of establish article protectors who are themselves POVpushing (which I do believe, from JayJG's unfortunate comments WRT NPOV not applying to images on the enwiki thread that we do have as well) we've still got an environment which is not friendly to cooperation. I don't know how to solve it, but my barb above certainly wouldn't help things. I apologize for that. --<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 00:05, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(after edit conflict) I am sorry if some see Moshe, Jayjg or SlimVirgin as part of the problem, because IMHO they are a part of a solution. Not sure where is the right place to address this, but it would be hard to find an article related to Jews that is not under daily attacks: from subtle POV to blatant vandalism. WP's openness and popularity are great but someone needs to keep repairing and NPOVifying it. If you see this process as some kind of conspiracy, too bad. ←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a> <sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">ну?</a></sup> 00:17, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My take of the situation: 2nd Piston Honda made a mistake and forgets to remove Duke53's signature after cutting and pasting on <a href="../../../g/e/o/Talk%7EGeorge_W._Bush_758a.html" title="Talk:George W. Bush">Talk:George W. Bush</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:George_W._Bush&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=73502602" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:George_W._Bush&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=73502602" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> for which he apologises for at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:George_W._Bush&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=73505229" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:George_W._Bush&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=73505229" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>. Duke53 refuses to accept Honda's apology and takes further offense when Honda tries to return the thread back on topic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:George_W._Bush&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=73505766" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:George_W._Bush&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=73505766" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> and begins "<a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiLawyering_098e.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiLawyering">WikiLawyering</a>" accusing Honda of impersonation, talk page vandalism and starts issuing warnings on Honda's talk page. Honda loses his cool and calls Duke53 an "asshole" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Duke53&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=73558272" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Duke53&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=73558272" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> for refusing his apology.</p>
<p>Both users then proceed to war over issuing warnings to each other for vandalising each other's talk pages and for removing each other's warnings from their respective talk pages. Honda then makes the above report to <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> requesting that Duke53 be blocked. I refuse to block either of them citing that they were both "making mountains out of molehills." In attempt to de-escalate the situation, I offer both of them the chance to remove all the warnings that they've given to each other over this whole incident so that they can both walk away like nothing ever happened. <a href="../../../k/o/j/User%7EKojiDude_79b7.html" title="User:KojiDude">KojiDude</a> (<a href="../../../k/o/j/User_talk%7EKojiDude_b028.html" title="User talk:KojiDude">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_KojiDude_f1ad.html" title="Special:Contributions/KojiDude">contribs</a>) recommends that both users accept my compromise. Neither takes the opportunity to do so, so I intervene and remove all warnings issued related to this conflict stating that it was over and signalling that I was to take no disciplinary action against either. Honda agrees, but Duke53 disagreed with my handling of the situation and now we are here. What an "eventful" first day as an administrator I have to say. *sigh* -- <small><span style="border: 1px solid"><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetsnipe_10c5.html" title="User:Netsnipe"><b><span style="background-color:White; color:#003333">&#160;Netsnipe&#160;</span></b></a><a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetsnipe_6c35.html" title="User talk:Netsnipe"><span style="background-color:#003333; color:White">&#160;►&#160;</span></a></span></small> 01:56, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Duke53, you've said a few times that 2nd Piston Honda has never apologized - is it possible that you missed the apology he made in the <a href="../../../e/s/_/WP%7EES_f020.html" title="WP:ES">edit summary</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:George_W._Bush&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=73505229" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:George_W._Bush&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=73505229" rel="nofollow">this early edit</a>? If so, that would explain your adamant pursual of the topic on the GWB talk page, which Honda in turn interpreted as belligerence, and which then spun the situation out of control. I think Netsnipe has done a fine job here, and was right on the money when he said "mountains out of molehills."

<dd>I will answer Peruvianllama and Hbdragon88 both in this paragraph. The apology for calling me a <b>'douche'</b>, an <b>'asshole'</b> and an <b>'ass'</b> is still forthcoming. I believe that those names could be considered a personal attack under Wikipedia policy. Deleting items from a talk page is also against Wikipedia policy; he did it repeatedly. I followed Wikipedia policy. As for insulting the administrator, well, it's not my fault that he's new at it. I'm not about to put a 'class' of people here on a pedestal, simply because they have a title. If that administrator thinks he did a good job then he's got low expectations of how Wikipedia should be administered... <b>ignoring numerous instances of Wikipedia policy being broken is not good administrating, no matter what your friends may tell you.</b> If I were to be banned I would hope it is for breaking policy, not for telling the truth about a situation that arises (or for someone's 'interpretation' of my words).

<dd>Deleting items from a Talk Page is not always strictly against Wikipedia policy. The first time Honda deleted items, it was to keep the discussion moving as s/he thought the issue had been resolved. The subsequent times were (I presume) because Honda interpreted your persistence on the matter as a sign of belligerence. Honda shouldn't have called you names - that was out of line, and there are channels of dispute resolution that can be followed if you still feel slighted. For your part however, the better strategy would have been to try communicating with Honda instead of repeatedly posting templated warnings on her/his talk page. The warnings are there to standardize our (the Community's) message to those new to Wikipedia, or to those who don't yet understand the basic policies. Once you grab their attention with the warnings, it's almost always better to then engage the other party in more dynamic discourse to resolve the issue if there's been a misunderstanding. You both handled things poorly near the end by calling every edit made by the other party "vandalism", and responding only with template warnings and alerts to <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>. Initially, it was you that forced the issue with your persistent posts; later, it was Honda that stepped over the line with the foul language. They might not have been equal transgressions, but I agree with Netsnipe that for now, there isn't much more to be gained from pursuing the matter. If you'd like formal mediation, I think you know where to go, but if you'd like something more informal, if there's anything I can do, I'd be happy to help. Cheers. --<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeruvianllama_baf8.html" title="User:Peruvianllama">P</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeruvianllama_baf8.html" title="User:Peruvianllama">ruvianLlama</a><sup><small>(<a href="../../../p/e/r/User_talk%7EPeruvianllama_bd23.html" title="User talk:Peruvianllama">spit</a>)</small></sup> 06:15, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Old TI-89? I was under the impression that he was a good faith contributor. I encountered him last night on vandalism patrol, and I contacted him on his talk to congratulate him on his vandal reverting efforts and ask him about his username. He seemed a pretty civil user. I think the only strike against him is that he has a similar sig as RadioKirk.

<dd>Nah, glancing at about 10 of them, they all made the correct decision, and this is the kind of stuff an AI would not be able to do (making decisions based purely on context). So I think it's reasonable that it was just human-assisted. I've heard people on IRC claim speeds about that fast with the python disambiguation solver.

I want to apologise for our misdeeds which we actually stopped doing a long time ago - about late 2005.

While I have no problem with this, I am concerned about the specific administrator who locked the page. The page lock states, "Protection is not an endorsement of the current page version." However, FayssalF himself was involved in the revert war, reverting at least twice from the previous consensus version. And rather than locking the page outright, he reverted once more to his desired version before full-protecting the page. I think this is a clear endorsement of a version and another example of administrator abuse from a user who has himself been involved in multiple revert wars on this very article. —<a href="../../../a/i/d/User%7EAiden_abfd.html" title="User:Aiden"><font color="#077CD0"><b>Aiden</b></font></a> 14:58, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You have failed to mention that you are part of that revert war, having earlier pretended to be a disinterested editor. This is not a revert war, but a content dispute. I have added new sources, new information and quoted your sources verbatim, to remove the POV you had introduced. You have refused to justify your edits on talk, and recent editors have sided with me on that Talk page.

<dd>SPUI: Perhaps if you (and to a lesser extent, others) had collegially worked with everyone else to reach a consensus prior to this, instead of having it have to go to ArbCom, it wouldn't have come to this. It certainly would have wasted <b>far</b> less time on everyone's part. But you and others did not and ArbCom acted.

Pick one convention – <i>any</i> convention that's not patent nonsense will do – and get on with all your lives. (It seems that the ArbCom-imposed process has generated such a result. I haven't looked at the poll to see what that result is, but from previous exposure to this issue I know that both of the favoured alternatives were reasonable.) Please add me to the list of admins who are sick and tired of this, and who are likely to block any editors who are responsible for this <i>utterly pointless</i> fight returning to WP:AN or any of its subpages.

<dd>I can't believe it even made it this far. I'm sorry to say that, as a result of this naming mess, we have loss a great number of contributors to the highway projects because of edit warring, mass page renames, and attacks on character as a result of only one or two people on Wikipedia. It's very sad that these warring individuals spend <i>so much time</i> worrying about something <i>so trivial</i> that it devolves the quality of the encylopedia, through contributors leaving, rather than improve upon it. As a result, many articles are no longer being formed or created out of fear that their contributions will be made meaningless as a result of a shift in the page, or a renaming that makes it inaccessible, or whatever is their reason.</dd>

And as such, I will agree with Lar, that no one person is indispensible to the highway project (or editing on Wikipedia in general), that any disruption in the process of this vote, or disruption after a consensus has been reached (through edit warring) should be blocked and that this nightmare be put behind us. <a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeicer_9e78.html" title="User:Seicer"><b><span style="color: #B33C1A; font: Trebuchet MS; font-size: 10px;">Seicer</span></b></a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/e/i/User_talk%7ESeicer_8d2f.html" title="User talk:Seicer">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Seicer_6c61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Seicer">contribs</a>)</small> 14:34, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The fact that the poll is 59/41 shows there is considerable support for SPUI's position and we shouldn't belittle him for that. However it is important to consider the Arbcom ruling (which seems to me common sense) that sometimes a decision has to be made and in those cases an arbitrary decision is better than no decision. Of course no decision is final but that does not mean continually fighting over it. To me it means accepting a decision, living with it for a few months, and then revisiting the issue. At this point the only viable options are to close as no decision, meaning the highways articles will remain at status quo ante and perpetuating the argument indefinitely, or closing as decided, resulting in a plausible solution that may nevertheless disappoint or even infuriate one editor. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131 (talk)</a> 14:23, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree. I would have accepted a 59/41 had it gone the other way. We have a definite majority that while not quite 66% generally used for consensus, it is damn close. And it is definitely the clearest will ever expressed in the highway argument and probably the clearest there will ever be. There was nothing uncouth about the vote, it was performed fairly, there was discussion involved and a decision has been reached as arbcom demanded. This should put an end to it. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnnyBGood_3156.html" title="User:JohnnyBGood"><font color="green"><b>JohnnyBGood</b></font></a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnnyBGood_d6fd.html" title="User talk:JohnnyBGood"><font color="red"><b>t</b></font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JohnnyBGood_a89f.html" title="Special:Contributions/JohnnyBGood"><font color="red"><b>c</b></font></a> <b>VIVA!</b> 18:35, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I fully support <a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>'s block, and if SPUI persists in this sort of behaviour after the block expires, I'd support making it permanent.

<dd>I won't shed any tears over SPUI's self-inflicted travails. But, you know, he does have at least a small point. That naming convention poll was vague and confusingly constructed and garnered a weak majority - it should in no way be taken as license to run rough-shod over any remaining objections. But despite my reservations about the actual poll, SPUI has proven time and again to be a real PITA. <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a> ≠ <a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 19:58, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I second all of the above. I happen to largely agree with SPUI on the poll: it's confused as to its scope (started off as being on "US state routes", then wandered into Canada and US territories <i>after</i> the first round of voting), its process (is a non-consensus outcome on the first part binding on the options for the second part? are some states exceptions on the basis of having unique common names that contradict the part one majority, while other common names are precluded by it?), and its basic mandate (is it to determine the common name, or pick a naming convention that's able to override that principle? is there a consensus to accept a non-consensus? has arbcom mandated picking an NC, regardless of consensus? do the judging admins in fact determine if there's consensus?). But let's face it, SPUI has gotten away with murder in the past (industrial-scale incivility, rampant WP:POINT -- including nomination of deletion processes for deletion, signature-spamming campaigns against a certain Wikiproject, and doubtless much else I've blocked out of my mind), so it's hard to argue that he's being done a huge injustice if he's for the time being out of "community patience". <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 00:06, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The poll was more than vague and confusingly constructed... it was written almost entirely by SPUI's primary adversary in all this, that user's preferred format was listed first, when SPUI objected to some of the judging admins the requirement that they be accepted by all participants mysteriously vanished, one of the people supporting SPUI's proposal was badgered into withdrawing his vote by a mob over a minor point of protocol, et cetera. The poll has been atrocious. <b>However</b>, a solution which is <i>preferred</i> by a significant majority, at least acceptable to most others, and strongly opposed by only a handful <b>is</b> a consensus... and that appears to be the case here. I think it could have been a much stronger decision if <b>either</b> side had been a bit more willing to work towards overcoming the concerns of the other, but as it stands it seems a disputed consensus is the best we are likely to get. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 13:28, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So what would you have proposed, moving Principle II to the top? Oh wait, that would seem like <i>favouritism</i> towards that principle and then we would all be complaining about that, right? Give me a break, I can't even believe you are complaining about the <i>order</i>.

<dd>Seicer, I did not "object <i>then</i>" as you say because I wasn't aware of the problems. The poll specifically asked for admins who were <b>not</b> involved in the highway debate. I wasn't. And hence I did not know who the major players were, what positions they supported, et cetera. After having read the poll discussion, past discussions, the ArbCom case, various Wikiproject debates on the issue, past policy proposals, et cetera in order to make an informed decision I am now sadly far more familiar with the issues and participants than I would like to be.&#160;:] As to the rest of your intemperate rant... it is behaviour like that which led to this being a debacle rather than a reasoned discussion. Though one of the more minor problems here, order of options is <i>routinely</i> considered for possible bias in professional polling and, while something must go first, it would have been better if the one which did hadn't been the one preferred by the person who designed the poll. For instance, I doubt many people would have objected to listing 'Principle III' first... if it had been listed at all initially. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 07:49, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So, if Principle II would have been listed first, would it not be out of line to say that it was biased towards Principle II and not Principle I or III because of order?

<dd>All true, but somewhat missing the point. I wasn't saying that anyone 'set out' to bias the poll, but that there were definite problems with the way it was done. As someone heavily involved in the dispute you really shouldn't have been the one setting up the poll... and rather than stepping back you have subsequently made comments about you deciding how it should be run since you <i>did</i> set it up. Yes, getting enough admins is a reasonable argument... but can you <i>really</i> look at the fact that <b>you</b> were the one waiving the requirement that admins be accepted by participants after <b>SPUI</b> objected to some of them and say that looked 'fair'? You, of all people, getting to say that SPUI's objections "seemed not to be well-supported" and 'changing the rules' after the fact to ignore them? <b>Then</b> insisting 'we must follow the rules' (which you wrote) when a supporter of the other position wanted to include a one line comment with their vote? There's just an inherent conflict of interest which ought to have been avoided because no matter <i>how</i> fair you tried to be you're the wrong person with the wrong history on this issue. Until I read up on the background I had assumed you were an uninvolved party... because that's the only sort of person who should have had so much control over the process. But, water under the bridge. We are where we are... and I think we can construe a weak consensus from the result. Just don't say that this was 'the best that could be hoped for' or that SPUI and others who share his viewpoint (Polaron, Rory096, et cetera) have no grounds for complaint on the way it was handled. Because they do... and the 'we do not <i>have</i> to work towards consensus, we have a majority' attitude <i>openly stated</i> by some <b>really</b> isn't helping matters. We should all ALWAYS be trying to develop a true consensus. Of course, this is not to say that there weren't (or aren't still) problems on the other side as well. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 07:49, 3 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Specifically, we had developed a consensus against including comments when voting. You seem to be missing that point. Also, if you examine the discussion closely, <b>I was not involved in that at all.</b> I just logged on to Wikipedia one day and found out that all of that happened. I didn't revert any comments or anything. With the judging admins, I was not sure what to do at that point. Noone else seemed to agree with SPUI or have any objections, so I let it slide. And as to my creating the poll in the first place, <b>noone was doing crap about the issue.</b> We had users like <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthenglish_4623.html" title="User:Northenglish">User:Northenglish</a> leaving over the indecisiveness.

<dd>Sorry, it doesn't work that way. We kindly asked him many times to stop so we could discuss. We started a mediation case. Then an RFC. Then ArbCom. We gave him many chances.

<dd>So now, ArbCom has succeeded in making him stop move-warring, and he agrees to discuss it. Why won't you discuss it with him?

<dd>Well, then why don't you just link him to where it was explained <i>why</i> this decision was reached, instead of just giving links to <i>how</i>? Of course he's trying to start a discussion; just because the designated time period for discussing the method of disambiguating is over doesn't mean discussion is banned, he still wants to know the reasoning behind the other method so he can better cope with its being used. --<a href="../../../r/o/r/User_talk%7ERory096_912b.html" title="User talk:Rory096">Rory096</a> 00:34, 3 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The most obvious fact here is that very few Wikipedians really give a toss about parentheses or roads, we just want an end to this ridiculous edit warring and the <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_Committee_a514.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee">Arbitration Committee</a> does too and it has provided us with the means to resolve the problem.

What, you say that's a bridge too far? Too bad. That is <i>precisely</i> what the arbitration committee said in the Highways case.

<dd>That goes too far. My highway edits are constructive and do not involve mass page renames, adding unwarranted tags, or bickering endlessly on how a highway should be named. To ban any highway edits would involve a great deal of work on your part, to which is not justified nor approperiate. Let's get off the emotion bandwagon and let's talk facts:</dd>
<dd>*Only one or two users in the <i>entire highway project</i> are involved in the mass page renames and adding unwarranted tags. Namely <a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_637c.html" title="User:SPUI">SPUI</a>.</dd>
<dd>*Only two or three users are continuously complaining about the entire system. To them, if it is not done in their way, its not to be done at all. After the mass page renames and mass tagging of articles (e.g. such as Ohio state highways), SPUI was asked to stop and discuss. After that failed, a mediation case was started. And then RFC, and now ArbCom. Per what <a href="../../../r/s/c/User%7ERschen7754_0301.html" title="User:Rschen7754">Rschen7754</a> noted.</dd>
<dd>To be clear, let's keep a watch out on the articles, not ban constructive editors from doing constructive edits. I have yet to do anything wrong in this case, therefore I should not be punished for waging a vote in a legitimate process judged by several admins. <a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeicer_9e78.html" title="User:Seicer"><b><span style="color: #B33C1A; font: Trebuchet MS; font-size: 10px;">Seicer</span></b></a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/e/i/User_talk%7ESeicer_8d2f.html" title="User talk:Seicer">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Seicer_6c61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Seicer">contribs</a>)</small> 23:51, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Personally, to me this looks more and more like harassment <i>of</i> the user. Yes, Tobias Conradi reacts very badly when he is treated in an unfair and/or abusive manner. Perhaps various admins ought to stop doing that? Maybe Chairboy and Pschemp could <b>not</b> improperly delete perfectly valid stubs (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nyanga-li_language&amp;oldid=73396111" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nyanga-li_language&amp;oldid=73396111" rel="nofollow">[43]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tobias_Conradi/Kayah_Li&amp;oldid=73403978" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tobias_Conradi/Kayah_Li&amp;oldid=73403978" rel="nofollow">[44]</a> right after he creates them? Maybe Pschemp could <i>not</i> place an unwarranted block on him for trying to move a discussion about the 'Kayah Li' article to the <a href="../../../k/a/y/Talk%7EKayah_Li_f27c.html" title="Talk:Kayah Li">Talk:Kayah Li</a> page? Where exactly is that proscribed by policy? Or a block for it remotely proper? Maybe you, Lar, could stop <i>warning</i> him on civility every few days while saying nothing about your fellow admins making incivil comments and personal attacks (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tobias_Conradi&amp;diff=73491687&amp;oldid=73491241" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tobias_Conradi&amp;diff=73491687&amp;oldid=73491241" rel="nofollow">[45]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tobias_Conradi&amp;diff=73569360&amp;oldid=73569119" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tobias_Conradi&amp;diff=73569360&amp;oldid=73569119" rel="nofollow">[46]</a>), <i>to</i> him? You badger this user <i>constantly</i> with threats of blocks, telling him that he has to keep your warnings displayed on his talk page or you will block him for removing them, and insisting that he should not complain about admin actions... even though <b>many</b> of those admin actions were in fact improper or mistakes. Then you act surprised when the user accuses admins of stalking and abusing him. I can't imagine that it would look like anything else from his perspective. It looks rather alot like that from mine. This user has been blocked for 3RR <i>by</i> the admin who was edit warring with him, mistakenly blocked for user page vandalism that turned out not to be, blocked for complaining about that mistaken block, blocked longer for complaining about <i>that</i> block, et cetera. He has reason to feel abused by admins. It is absolutely true that Tobias Conradi should do a <i>much</i> better job of responding to such things politely and moving on... but I for one get tired of watching a pack of admins harass and abuse a user and then point and say, 'look how angry and incivil he is being'. Stop harassing him and the problem would end. You say that you want to help him be a positive contributor, but it seems obvious that he is only <i>not</i> such when he is fighting with admins whom he thinks (often correctly) have mistreated him. Stop mistreating and/or fighting with him and the problem goes away. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 12:00, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>CBD, would it be accurate to sum up your above as "if you stopped enforcing policy, Tobias would stop breaking it"? That sounds like a circular argument. I deleted a sub-stub (Kayah Li) that all the other admins I consulted agreed met CSD-A1 because it lacked sufficient context. That's the extent of my action, but then Tobias instantly jumped to calling the deletion admin-abuse. In fact, the first thing he did was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Tobias_Conradi/admin_right_abuse&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=73402728" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Tobias_Conradi/admin_right_abuse&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=73402728" rel="nofollow">add me to his admin abuse</a> page, THEN he <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chairboy&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=73402877" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chairboy&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=73402877" rel="nofollow">left me a message</a> telling me to undelete it. The fact that I ended up on his 'abusive admins' list before he even talked to me is significant. As far as I know, I've never interacted with him before this, but he jumped straight to abuse. For your argument to work, he would have needed to have been 'persecuted' by me previously. Instead, we've got an editor that jumps straight to assuming bad faith. I immediately <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Tobias_Conradi/Kayah_Li" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Tobias_Conradi/Kayah_Li" rel="nofollow">copied the content</a> of the deleted article to his userspace with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tobias_Conradi&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=73404173" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tobias_Conradi&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=73404173" rel="nofollow">encouragement</a> that he expand and repost it. Instead, he planted his heels in the ground and just kept calling me an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chairboy&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=73404197" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chairboy&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=73404197" rel="nofollow">abusive</a> admin. I've been polite, civil, and encouraging to him the entire time, but he has not returned the favor. He has alternately called me a liar, stupid, and malicious. He has accused me of vandalism and deleted my responses on his talk page. Finally, he has a page with a list of abusive admins that have attacked him. CBD, ask yourself if it seems at all unusual that he's had soooo many run-ins with evil administrators. At what point do you start to examine the claims critically? I've <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tobias_Conradi&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=73404173" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tobias_Conradi&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=73404173" rel="nofollow">offered</a> to help Tobias with setting up an RfC against me (in light of his continuing claims that I've maliciously abused my "powers") but every time he backs off. His persecution complex does not, it appears, seem to extend a formal airing of issues. I am beginning to have a difficult time assuming good faith on his behalf based on what appears to be an almost pathological victim complex. I feel that if he were really interested in the Kayah Li article that started this whole thing, he would have spent the 30 seconds needed to add context to the userfied content I sent him and reposted it. Instead, he has attempted to turn this into some sort of circus. He has created a page called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tobias_Conradi/2006_Kayah_Li_incident" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tobias_Conradi/2006_Kayah_Li_incident" rel="nofollow">2006 Kayah Li incident</a>, a grand name for a sub-stub that was appropriately deleted under WP:CSD. He is a prolific editor that has amassed a tremendous number of edits, but that edit history does not appear to have come with a commensurate maturity, understanding of WP policy, and civility to other users. I endorse Lar's block and hope he will come back a productive user who does not choose picking fights over contributing to the project. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChairboy_157e.html" title="User:Chairboy">C<small>HAIRBOY</small></a> (<a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChairboy_882d.html" title="User talk:Chairboy">☎</a>) 14:58, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>To answer your first question, no, obviously that is not anything remotely like an accurate description of my position. Say rather, 'if admins would stop violating policy Tobias would stop responding in kind'. The fact that other admins supported your deletion of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tobias_Conradi/Kayah_Li&amp;oldid=73403978" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tobias_Conradi/Kayah_Li&amp;oldid=73403978" rel="nofollow">this</a> does not change the fact that it was <b>not</b> a proper use of CSD A1... as many people have since affirmed. Indeed, admin support of a plainly out of process deletion rather proves his complaint. It was a valid stub which provided complete context of what the subject was. Yes, he reacted very badly to the deletion... see above where I've said this repeatedly. You call his reaction a "persecution complex" (demonstrating some of that 'perfect civility' with which you have treated him)... but generally those only come into existence following actual persecution. No, he doesn't have past history with you... but as I demonstrated he <i>does</i> with other admins. Consider that maybe he isn't 'acting in bad faith' as you suggest above, but legitimately feels 'persecuted'.

<dd>To be clear, I said that I felt he had a victim complex, and I said that above. You said "demonstrating some of that 'perfect civility' with which you have treated him" in reference to that.

<dd>I'm sorry but Chairboy was correct in his deletion, kindly put the deletion in userspace, was never hostile to Tobias and has never harped on Tobias in his life. Tobias's reaction was rude, uncivil, and unwarranted. Tobias is a victim of nothing but his own temper, and never assumes good faith in anything, and you are making excuses for him by claiming he is the victim. He brought all of this on himself by not being able to control his temper. His reactions were his choices, no one else's, and just as you said, there is no excuse for incivilty, so why are you trying to give him one? Even if Chairboy's action was a mistake, (which it wasn't) Tobias reaction is out of line. Way out of line. This is a simple matter of a man who can't control his temper, when nothing was done to deliberatley provoke him by Chairboy. That is unacceptable behaviour and actions against him resulting from this uncivilness are entirely justified. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 20:13, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I also don't think indefinite is warranted here, as Tobias is a productive contributor as long as no one disagrees with him. The attempt to paint him as the victim is laughable though. Tobias has been yelling admin abuse from day one, before he was ever blocked for his quite uncivil responses and rants. CBD is also ignoring Tobias's use of IP sockpuppets and meantpuppets to get around his blocks, and the fact that even the people who try to be nice to the man get lambasted by him. Aditionally, moving an irrelevant personal argument about speedy deletions to the talk page of a deleted article is not appropriate. Chairboy has acted with nothing but civilness here, has no hostory with Tobias, and yet has met with incivilty at every comment. He even userfied the deletion so Tobias could work on it. I'm sorry but Tobias has shown that he in incapable of dealing with even the smallest disagreement in a civil fashion (even before the alleged mistreatment) and as such deserves blocks until he can learn to play nice. Excusing incivilty because Tobias has an admin abuse chip on his shoulder is unfair to those editors who do remain civil in conflicts. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 15:47, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think indefinite is warranted this time, which is why I went with a week. And I'm not averse to trying months next time rather than indefinite. But I have to take issue with some notions mooted early on in this thread, namely that giving civility warnings (when instead, based on prior history and the knowledge that the user has been told what the problem is) instead of just handing out a block, or giving out more than one block, is somehow stalking or harassment. (and further, I think calling it that shows disrespect to admins and their judgement... CBD ought to know better) Taken to the extreme, that means that any one admin could only ever give out one warning or block to a particular misbehaving user. And that's not workable. Further, while I think that admins should be held accountable if they are incivil, I'm not seeing that there is massive incivility on the part of admins in this case (I admit bias!), and more importantly, I don't think it appropriate that a user get a "free pass" because an admin wasn't civil. That's a double standard, it says admins have to be perfect or else users can be as nasty as they like. Anyone who reviews Tobias's discussion with other users will find a pattern of repeated nastiness that there seems to be little prospect of ever changing. His interaction with Chairboy is perfect evidence of it... continued hostility and wild accusations of all sorts of things and no acknowledgement that he did anything that could stand improvement. If you want more, look at the tail end of <a href="../../../t/o/b/User_talk%7ETobias_Conradi_1f4c.html#Blocked_for_one_week" title="User talk:Tobias Conradi">User_talk:Tobias_Conradi#Blocked_for_one_week</a> where a previously more or less uninvolved editor <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEvertype_f1b1.html" title="User:Evertype">Evertype</a> (<a href="../../../e/v/e/User_talk%7EEvertype_12bd.html" title="User talk:Evertype">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Evertype_207b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Evertype">contribs</a>) gives some good advice and Tobias rips into him for it. We need to get away from the notion that a lot of previous conttributions give you a free pass to act like a prat. I've seen it in several cases lately and it's corrosive and damaging. I agree with pschemp, above but note that "Tobias is a productive contributor as long as no one disagrees with him." == "NOT a productive contributor" because disagreements <i>happen</i>. They are part of how things get better. If you can't disagree civilly, your contributions, however large, can be done without. <i>No one</i> is indispensable to this project. So, I will continue to monitor this user's behaviour and if it doesn't get better, probably block again, or, seek another editor to apply it. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 12:27, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Lar, again... the fact that Tobias responds very badly to mistaken, questionable, and/or incorrect admin actions is a reason to block him. It is absolutely <b>not</b> a reason to continue to engage in mistaken, questionable, and/or incorrect admin actions against him. You all keep going on about how he should not "get a 'free pass'" because of 'number of contributions'... which is a complete straw man. Have you seen me saying that what he did was ok? That he should not be blocked? No. I'm saying that admins should not be deleting his articles out of process, hounding him over every civility infraction, subjecting him to incivility and personal attacks in turn, blocking him for edit wars they took part in, telling him not to complain about admin actions, forcing him to keep warnings displayed on his page, et cetera. On your intention to continue to "monitor" Tobias I refer you to <a href="../../../h/a/r/Wikipedia%7EHarassment_9843.html#Coolcat.2C_Davenbelle.2C_and_Stereotek" title="Wikipedia:Harassment">Wikipedia:Harassment#Coolcat.2C_Davenbelle.2C_and_Stereotek</a> and leave it at that. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 13:00, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"Have you seen me saying that what he did was ok?" I have seen you leave that implication. First, you characterise admins monitoring his behaviour as "harassement" which leaves the implication that he did nothing incorrect, at least in the way that he apparently analyses things (based on my own analysis of his statements) Also, see here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ATobias_Conradi&amp;diff=73745235&amp;oldid=73744741" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ATobias_Conradi&amp;diff=73745235&amp;oldid=73744741" rel="nofollow">[47]</a> See also here:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ATobias_Conradi&amp;diff=73744741&amp;oldid=73722959" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ATobias_Conradi&amp;diff=73744741&amp;oldid=73722959" rel="nofollow">[48]</a> where you don't address that he has things he needs to do to get it lifted, just that you want it lifted. You're leaving him the impression that you think this block is not justified. Given who you are dealing with, it is my view that you need to be a lot more careful and precise in your statements. As for my monitoring Tobias, I don't see the issue you do with watching a problematic user to see if they continue to cause problems. Because this user is problematic, nothing you have said refutes that. I think you need to think harder about whether your actions, in general, are helping, or undercutting, other admins and their efforts to make this a better place. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 13:35, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Lar, the "implication" is in your imagination. I have stated unequivocally over and over again that Tobias's actions were unacceptable. Your citation of a few edits where I <i>didn't</i> say so (nor that they were acceptable) as evidence of an 'implication' in contradiction of my numerous direct statements strikes me as disingenuous at best. You say that warning against harassment "leaves the implication" that what the user did was fine... no, it really doesn't. Why would it? I refer you again to that link. Note that it covers a situation specifically where the user <b>did</b> do things wrong... but the ArbCom found the "monitoring" and continuous badgering on that to <i>still</i> be harassment. It isn't an 'either / or' situation. Both can be true. As to me stymieing 'efforts to make this a better place'. Look at the <i>results</i> of your efforts here. How are they working out so far? Making alot of good progress in getting Tobias to be civil are you? If not... consider that maybe there is a better way to go about this. Maybe <i>not</i> threaten him with blocks if he doesn't keep your warnings displayed on his talk page. <i>Not</i> excuse or ignore admin violations of process and policy against him. <i>Not</i> hound him constantly. I'm sorry, but if these are your efforts to "make this a better place"... they obviously weren't working <b>long</b> before I noticed the train wreck and tried to do something about it. I'm sorry, but isn't it obvious by now that the approach you have been following just keeps making matters <i>worse</i>? I'm not saying that's your intent... but can you honestly tell me it isn't accurate? Likewise Nandesuka... I'm not about to apologize for 'undercutting' your efforts to wheel-war, engage in personal attacks, and place punitive blocks clearly well outside the bounds of policy... because I really don't think they do a heck of a lot to "make this a better place". Rather the opposite. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 15:40, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The problem with that analysis is that the block was handed out for his actions with respect to Chairboy. These have been demonstrated as being completely unacceptable. Tell you what though, next time I see something egregious I'll drop you a mail and let <i>you</i> warn him instead of me. You can do it in a way that satisfies your critieria of how it ought to be done... If you warn him and he responds positively, great. If he goes off (as, unfortunately, given past history, I have every reason to expect he will), YOU block him instead of me. But if you can't demonstrate satisfactorily that the infraction (whatever it is) wasn't egregious (I assume your mail is turned on?) and you don't warn, I will. And if after he's warned, if he goes off, I'll expect you to block. Again I'll use email to discuss it, but if you won't block and you can't explain why, I will. I think that if you mean what you say about not tolerating his behaviour, this will be entirely satisfactory to both of us, because you'll be handing out the warnings and blocks... But if you don't... well, consider it "put up or shut up", you don't just get to snipe at everyone else indefinitely. It's time for you to do better than me, or... admit you're wrong, that this user is incorrigible, or at least that all the admins that have tried so far are acting in good faith and not just harasssing him. Now on the other hand, if knowing it's YOU on the case instead of any of the rest of us causes him to straighten up and fly right so as not to make you look the fool, well, that's a win too. It's time this user's issues were resolved, one way or another. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 15:55, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Entirely reasonable, and while blocking isn't my preferred method of 'conflict resolution' I've done it before when acting as a 'proxy' in similar circumstances. It is at least worth a try and I'd think preferrable to continuing a downward spiral with an inevitably bad conclusion. In reference to the 'outcome' you cite above... even <i>before</i> we undertake this effort, there is no question in my mind that you were acting entirely in good faith.

<li>Hmmm, now you mention it, it could be read another way. However I think the reference to Jimbo allowing the account back in means he is referring to his own account, since it was Jimbo's personal intervention that got <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Garcia_d523.html" title="User:Mike Garcia">User:Mike Garcia</a> unblocked in the first place. Notice that Mike's recent edits have been almost solely tagging supposed sockpuppets of JtV. The way I see it, this admission could have something to do with the increasing appliance of <a href="../../../d/e/n/WP%7EDENY_da3a.html" title="WP:DENY">WP:DENY</a> and the recent deletion of {{Johnny the Vandal}} and Wikipedia:Long term abuse/Johnny the Vandal. I have informed Jimbo on his talk page anyways. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_wub_6388.html" title="User:The wub">the wub</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_wub_1807.html" title="User talk:The wub"><font color="green">"?!"</font></a> 14:09, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Again, I've never had any good fortune dealing with Mike, and I was trying to not refer to his distant past, but, because of the ambiguity, I'd recommend lifting the block, or at least shortening it, until this is hashed out a bit more. (Again, Mike has been a ball of frustration for me, but I don't see him <i>quite</i> admitting to being JtV, and it's within Mike's personality to start on something like catching JtV and then following through to the exclusion of everything else, so that's no evidence, one way or the other.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:41, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Has anybody told Danny about this? It was through his efforts that the unrepentant troll who is Mike Garcia was allowed back to Wikipedia. Danny probably has good rapport with him, and might be able to get some information. It does look like he's been playing us all along, though, especially referring to Jimbo as "Wales", which implies a little more ... enmity, I guess would be the word, than someone who seems to have autism, or whatever other things he has claimed to have. I've never been happy with his returning, especially his repeated nastiness to me and to Hephaestos, and I blame him for Hephaestos having left Wikipedia, and never understood the rush to bring him back. Unless and until he makes a <i><b>completely understandable</b></i> explanation, keep him banned. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe">(talk)</a> 17:59, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I think the critical thing is that first sentence. I'll go check, but Danny is his mentor, so he should want to know. I've no words to say in Mike's defense, but he went several months with legitimate, if...socially unaware...edits. A person with autism could well choose the wrong level of familiarity, misunderstand nuance, and get obsessive about tracking a vandal, but that's neither here nor there. If there are no notes about this on Danny's page, I'll drop one. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 19:04, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Though Mike is (in?)famous for being an AOL user it may be worth running a checkuser - he could be one of the lucky ones to be getting an XFF header (or is that still not implemented?) Also I'm going to be away for a few days, and just want to make it clear I have no problem with anyone overturning/shortening the block if they feel it appropriate. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_wub_6388.html" title="User:The wub">the wub</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_wub_1807.html" title="User talk:The wub"><font color="green">"?!"</font></a> 08:50, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, at least this explains why it's been virtually impossible to use AOL over the last few weeks. And no, there still aren't any XFF headers, and there probably never will be. But if a vandal is stupiud enough to use a 172, those can be checkusered--<a href="../../../1/5/2/User%7E152.163.100.65.html" title="User:152.163.100.65">152.163.100.65</a> 12:51, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No, Donnacha, I said my first edit included a sentence that was written in a pov fashion. I was being honest and changed it completely. My edits are neutral and sourced. You object to my and other editors' edits constantly because they get in the way of your apparant Amnesty International public relations job here at Wikipedia. You work for them. You are making and reverting in a biased way. Also, you continually attack other editors rather than commenting on their edits. You made <b>10</b> reverts yesterday, too.

<dd>Look back at the history. Mr Whiskey posted a personal criticism of the Control Arms Campaign, then linked to a cite that didn't criticise AI (in fact, it quoted them in support of the author's argument) and now, having failed to find a proper cite as asked, has, instead, decided to expand the Control Arms piece of the History out of proportion with the other campaigns, despite me starting an article on the Campaign (the link to which he's removed), and removed it from the criticism section. He's consistently tried, as someone who opposes arms control, to push his point of view and now, with increasing attention on the piece, he's hiding behind factual quotes - the lack of proportionality and balance in the history section is now the POV problem. There's also a typo in it - "It's stated intent". Anyway, I'm not going to edit it anymore, so it's up to others now. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonnachadelong_ddd0.html" title="User:Donnachadelong">Donnacha</a> 13:26, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's also worth noting that quite a few people volunteer for AI and even more are sympathetic, so I'm not sure that working for them is anything like a bar to editing the article.

<p>I wasn't sure where to report this but this page is being vandalised with the same website link over and over again. I've been reverting it back every time. The person (or people) doing it are changing one or more of the references to a link that redirects to a site that has nothing to do with the person in question (although his pictures may be hosted somewhere on the site). I warned the first two users about 3RR and each time I did, a different user came along and chaged the links. So I suspect they are sockpuppets as well.

<dd>For the record I think your 'being the heavy' in that discussion has helped to move things along. Obviously there are 'agitators' on every side, but there are also occasional real efforts at compromise and consensus in amongst the bickering.

And there have been fits of progress, in fact yesterday I really thought we were over the hump on NJ. But today we backslid a bit... Regrettably I just handed out a 15 min to SPUI because he was doing the arguing thing again (and then arguing with me when I called him on it).

My administrator opinion is the same advice I've given to many users who get their knickers in a twist on this page about having their stupid warning templates removed from somebody else's page: please do yourself a favour and stop compulsively checking Giano's page. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 09:59, 5 September 2006 (UTC).

<dd>I think I have every right to look at every page I feel like on Wikipedia. That's why it's <i>"a free encyclopaedia"</i>. So, would you care to change the statement at the top of Giano's talk page to conform with Wikipedia guidelines, or are you going to continue to treat policy with contempt as you did in the post above? I really don't want to have it forcibly changed, but that's the next step. <font face="sans-serif"><b><a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel.Bryant_22a1.html" title="User:Daniel.Bryant">Daniel</a><a href="../../../r/a/n/Special%7ERandom_5382.html" title="Special:Random">.</a><a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDaniel.Bryant_8f7b.html" title="User talk:Daniel.Bryant">Bryant</a></b></font> 10:11, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ironic, maybe you should too - I have created 112 articles since August 7, and you have created 4 for the same time period. If you notice the diff, I changed my template, as Wikipedians are human, and we do make mistakes. His comment that "Well at least he has a new accusation" is out of line, and your comment attacking my sensitivity is too. "Comment on the contributions, and not on the contributor". All I want is my name removed from the hate-list, and I'd go away. So far, it seems that all everyone wants to do is defend Giano with a giant shield. It's one simple request, which, if people didn't jump in, could have been dealt with between the two users in a civil fashion. The fact that I will probably be blocked unjustly for this (I envisage a nasty RfC) is testimant to the fact that if Giano and I were left alone to discuss this between ourselves, this would all be fine. I can live with the thing at the top of the page, barely, but I want my name removed from the list.

Isn't that failure to assume good faith? That statement was removed by another admin as being pretty incivil, I'd note. Remember also that Giano just got done with a rather long incident. Or is it more of a statement that you didn't see these issues and weren't aware of them? Or that you don't consider them behavioural issues at all? As for "best to let it drop"... if there actually ARE issues but you want it dropped anyway, doesn't that pretty much validate the notion that Giano is in that protected "free pass" class I refer to? I'm not in that class. I can be perfectly civil during a long rant exchange (in which I'm called "naiive", "incompetent", "fool", "stupid", and "devious" without ever responding in kind) with someone apparently in that class, even getting a civility barnstar from one observer, and yet still get taken to task over how things went. That's fine, I'm OK with it, I just want to know if you think such a class exists, or should exist. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 13:45, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see from a thread above this that you're annoyed about another user, but that has nothing to do with Giano. As I said, this is something of nothing. In general, we do give more leeway to good editors, of course, because this is an encyclopedia, and what we should care about is good editing above almost anything else.

After all, getting annoyed is counterproductive. I'd still like your perspective on whether you think Giano is completely civil or not, because I am interested in it. I think I gave specific examples, so having you comment on those specifics might be useful instead of just saying it's "something of nothing". I'm glad you agree that people ought not to get free passes, but I am concerned that some seem to, just the same. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 14:07, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(edit conflict) I fully stand with SlimVirgin; it appears that Bryant is trying to make a mountain out of nothing. I find considerably irritating that all this rumour is being made for one of our best editors; in my experience, I've never seen all this devotion with trolls, that often happily remove the warnings on their pages without any intervention. Instead, one of our best editors is being harassed, while so valuable assets for the project should deserve instead some leniency. As for Lar, I understand your anger, as Giano passed the line with you; but he had been badly wronged by Carnildo. Only, please remember this: editors like Giano can't be easily replaced, differently from most.--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 14:16, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(outdent) Aldux: we've now had two different admins remove the same phrasing from Giano's page that Daniel raised as an issue. Go look at the history and see for yourself. So clearly there's <i>something</i> to Daniel's allegations at least in the minds of some administrators. Should Daniel take it personally and work this so hard? Perhaps not. Establish that this is one more incident in a pattern of incivility and let it go, would be my advice. But when you say "As for Lar, I understand your anger", I don't think you do, because I'm <i>not</i> angry. Anger is counterproductive. I'm just <i>concerned</i>, not angry. And my concern is twofold: first that one wrong doesn't justify another. Which is a principle others are taking me to task for elsewhere as well, rightly or wrongly. I embrace the principle and so should others. and secondly, I see in your words that very "free pass" mentality I am concerned about in the larger case. Some allowance for contributions is appropriate, but no one is indispensable. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 15:10, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The problem with the "no one is indispensible" position, even though it's true, is that it translates into a lack of appreciation of good editors. We have very few really good editors, and we need to hang onto them and show them they're valued. That's all that's meant by giving them a bit of leeway. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 15:16, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>But this cuts both ways (or even three). Fostering an atmosphere in which someone who is proclaimed by his pals as a "good editor" can be rude to anyone he deems to be "not a good editor" is not helpful. Would you be happy if you were to arrive at someone's talk-page and discover a notice saying you weren't welcome to edit there? This is not even considering the criteria that are being used to judge "goodness", which are inherently subjective and likely to differ wildly from person to person.

<dd>I'm sorry, but I have to disagree; it quite easy to understand who's a really good editor, and it can be judged objectively by valuing the full respect of wikipedia policies. If we can value if an article is "good" or "feature", the same should go for the single edits that made the article, and for the editors behind them.--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 16:42, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This "pals" business is noisome. Bishonen and I are the only "pals" in the group. Everyone else has been a case of serious-minded editors with an interest in the highest standards who have associated with each other out of mutual respect. We've <i>gotten to be</i> friends <i>because</i> we are the folks who try to write serious articles with full development on less than common subjects. Therefore, this set of "super friends" is a bit different from others, as these are all people who met and associated with one another because we hold each others' <i>work</i> in high regard.

<p>Just as a note we don't typically link to Amazon.com (or any specific commercial source) except in extremely extenuating circumstances, which I don't think ever include bibliographies. If it's a book being cited, use the{{<a href="../../../i/s/b/Template%7EISBN_d7b2.html" title="Template:ISBN">ISBN</a>}} template if you know the ISBN, that links to lots of commercial source and the reader can choose as they like. Hope that helps. Please don't take reversion personally. Further dispute resolution should be pursued in the appropriate channels, as Doc says. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 13:49, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not yet. I would not have blocked him at all for starting the RfA. In fact i think SNOWing this RfA was a bad idea. Rather I would have let it run the full 7 days. Having 100+ opposes might have finally gotten through to this editor that he needs to reconsider his approach. But with the RfA snowed, he's got ammo to say we aren't treating him right, etc. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 06:54, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Is this user a flat out troll? Sure, close the book right away...

His contributions are light so not a LOT of effort is justified but I'm not convinced he is not rescuable. Contrast with Tobias, next thread. CLEARLY not a troll, has a big contribution record, therefore worth a fair bit of effort, but I'm starting to think... not rescuable.

<li>I think the Masssiveego's RFA voting is a problem and unhelpful, but I think imposing blocks for it is a rather drastic measure. A much better "penalty" would be for the RFA closing bureaucrats to systematically disregard his votes. Regarding the RFA, I agree with Lar that I would not have blocked him for that either, and that a hundred "oppose"s on what is in effect an editor peer review might convey the message far more clearly than a block ever will. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 13:32, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Users are allowed to use whatever criteria they like in RfAs. His are high and somewhat arbitrary, but that's his perogative. He feels that there are problems with some admins and thus that the process should be more strict/changed. He has a right to that opinion and should not be persecuted for it. Obviously his RFA self-nom wasn't meant to be a serious attempt, but I also don't see where it caused any significant disruption justifying a block. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 14:38, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It was obvious trolling. I think it's really not good as a community if we just let people do that. I really don't think I'd mind if someone opposed every RfA, at least I wouldn't want to block them for it, if I felt they were doing it in good faith. With his comments... it just seems like he's clammoring for attention most of the time.

<li>(edit conflict) He hasn't been opposing RfAs on the basis that he thinks the candiates will be bad admins, he's been opposing them to annoy people. The whole "Masssiveego is allowed to vote using his own critera" is what has allowed him to continue trolling for so long. -- <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteel359_41ed.html" title="User:Steel359">Steel</a> 14:48, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>The above look like assumptions of bad faith. It seems clear to me that Massiveego votes the way he does because he legitimately believes there are problems with admins and the process for appointing them. He has repeatedly said that is the case.

<li>I thought he was acting in good faith as well until this latest RfA. CBD have you read his statement and answers? Given how many of his edits are to the RfA pages he would know that suich an RfA would merit automatic opposes no matter who it was from and he himself has opposed before per people saying the answers to the questions are too short. <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> is not a suicide pact. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 15:01, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ok, then tell me... does <b>anyone</b> seriously claim that there was ever <b>any</b> possibility of a 'Massiveego RfA' PASSING? Anyone? No? Does anyone think that he didn't <i>know</i> that? I'm sorry, but the 'oh it was bad because it was not a serious attempt to get adminship' excuse doesn't wash. Everyone knew when they encouraged him to do it that it wasn't going to be a 'serious attempt to get adminship'... because that was completely impossible. Anyone who <i>didn't</i> know what his RfA was going to be like when they encouraged him to do it must have been completely ignoring their critical thinking faculties... because it was obvious. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 15:49, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Now <i>who</i>, exactly, isn't assuming good faith? In my time at Wikipedia, I have seen many RfA's brought by people whom, six months previously, you would have said had no chance at passing (off the very top of my head, Aaron Brenneman, who was blocked and publically castigated for vandalism but whom through hard work redeemed himself in the eyes of the community). The only person responsible for the contents of Masssiveego's RFA is masssive himself. I absolutely believe that had he brought an RfA that's wasn't an <i>obvious troll</i>, he would not have been blocked. Would he have passed? Well, maybe not this time. But a serious attempt might have laid the groundwork for the future. Trying to pin the blame for his trolling on other people for not <i>psychically predicting it and then talking him out of it ahead of time</i> is ludicrous. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 15:55, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>(edit conflict) Of course everyone knew an RfA from Masssive would never pass. The fact is, if Masssive had written a serious nomination and provided serious answers to the questions, which I for one was expecting him to do, he would have received 100+ oppose votes, but no block. Comments such as AmiDaniel's on that voting survey page suggest that I wasn't the only one who was expecting a serious request. -- <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteel359_41ed.html" title="User:Steel359">Steel</a> 15:59, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Furthermore I don't know about other users but if it had been a serious request I for one at least would have considered it. I think his behavior in regard to RfAs indicates an inability to work well with others and I might oppose or neutral for that reason. But the assumption that a serious RfA would have been 100 oppose votes and nothing else is unwarranted. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 16:06, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Expanding on that a bit, while I agree that calling a good-faith editor a troll is incivil, there <i>are</i> people whom it is OK to call trolls: to wit, trolls. I do it, Jimbo does it, everyone does it. The idea that we're supposed to wear white gloves and pretend they don't exist is poor. My rule of thumb is that what is incivil is to call someone a troll <i>to their face</i>, since if true it accomplishes nothing and if false it's just insulting. However, using the term descriptively while talking with other admins is fine, so that we can measure appropriate response (and you may have noticed that most admins are not shy about disagreeing with the evaluation that someone is a troll, if they disagree). I think your characterizing what has gone on in this case as "abuse" is somewhat over-the-top, as my lampooning of your argument shows. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 16:56, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>While you are sadly correct that admin incivility and personal attacks are widespread... no they are not something that "everyone" does. This idea that 'if admins decide that someone is a troll then they can call the person a troll' <b>directly</b> contradicts <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html#A_misguided_notion:_.22Kicking_them_while_they_are_down.22" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">Wikipedia policy</a>. The same page even lists repeatedly calling someone a troll (even to third parties) as an example of personal attacks. I completely reject the principle that we are <i>allowed</i> to be incivil...

<dd>I really am bothered that an admin would apparently support an obvious troll over someone like me, who has clearly never editted in bad faith or even been accused of it.

<dd>This interpretation is completely wrong. This has nothing to do with "supporting" anybody in anything. But actually, you can feed trolls by blocking them. The intention of trolls is to test the system. As long as they don't vandalise or mess up anything they should be simply ignored. I fail to see how a single RfA falls into this category. Please at least shorten the block to 48 hours or so if you really feel urged to block in this case.

<dd>I'm sorry that you are bothered by this, but this idea that one user is 'supported over' another is completely wrong. There <i>should</i> be no hierarchy where 'recognized as better' users get to do things that others cannot. Calling people trolls is prohibitted by policy... doesn't matter who does it. Yes, even Jimbo has done that... and people called him out over it. Personal attacks are <b>always</b> a bad idea, no matter what the 'difference in status' between the two users. The entire mindset of 'who do you support' is a blight on Wikipedia IMO. I look at your actions and I look at his actions and I criticize each on their merits regardless of who they were directed at. He made a mildly silly RfA... following encouragement. Ummm... sorry, but that just doesn't seem like much of a problem to me. At most I might have said, 'ok, hah hah... knock it off, I am closing this down', and don't do it again. You placed a lengthy block for non-existant disruption (the RfA was already closed), called the guy a troll repeatedly, et cetera. Are you generally a nicer guy / better contributor / higher 'access level' than him? Maybe so... but <i>entirely</i> irrelevant to me. I don't judge situations on the 'hierarchical status' of the participants.

<p>I feel it necessary to respond to the points above, in case people are under the impression that I may have been trying to <b>"trap"</b> Masssiveego to block him. Firstly, I said that if he wanted to run in an RfA, then he would be free to do so <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Masssiveego/votingsurvey&amp;diff=70867477&amp;oldid=70752342" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Masssiveego/votingsurvey&amp;diff=70867477&amp;oldid=70752342" rel="nofollow">[62]</a>. If anybody looks at the ten RfA nominations that I have prepared at <a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_RfA_43d5.html" title="User:Blnguyen/RfA">User:Blnguyen/RfA</a> as well as my answers to questions at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Blnguyen_1850.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Blnguyen">Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Blnguyen</a> it is easy to see that I take things seriously and have a high standard of what a "proper" RfA is - with a proper nomination and answers to questions - indeed I have received some good-natured jibes about my statements being excessive. I honestly felt that his RfA was not serious, as in some RfAs he had complained about others' lack of attention to detail himself. I was not intending to punish him, I felt that there was a possibility he would try and respond to the opposes in similar ways as in <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_The_Mad_Bomber_9eb4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/The Mad Bomber">Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/The Mad Bomber</a>. In no way was I goading him to trap and punish him - I have never indulged in retaliatory voting at RfA as can be seen by my record. As to whether the block actually made things worse and garnered attention - that may be the case and at no stage do I rule out the possiblity that a block may be a strategic mistake. I am not hurt/bothered that other admins may disagree with me and reverse my block, my decisions are not above scrutiny, nor should they be. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">BLabberiNg</a> 21:43, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmmmm, I wouldn't have blocked over this, but I can see why it was done. I'm concerned that every time there's a block imposed these days people want to argue about the reasons why they wouldn't have done it, rather than appreciating that there's an element of discretion and judgment with these things. Two reasonable admins may take different approaches, and I think we should be fairly deferential to each other's judgment. Given that there was a block, it was rather long IMHO, but that could have been discussed with the blocking admins in a courteous way, i.e.: "Um, a week is rather long for a first block without a warning. Would you consider reducing it to 24 hours?" That's all that has to be said if we assume our colleagues who have undergone the ordeal of fire and water to become admins are reasonable people. (We should all be open to suggestions when they are put like that.)

When you have experience dealing with these types of situations, you are less likely to assume bad faith on the part of admins, who, by the way, are following policies, if you bothered to get familiar with them.

I <i>don't</i> agree that violating an official policy about calling someone a troll repeatedly is OK if the person doing it is an administrator, or if the user somehow "deserves it": <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> makes this clear. I <i>don't</i> agree that an over-1-week-long block for a first offence without even a warning message was appropriate: that's why we have rules on blocking. I <i>don't</i> agree that Masssiveego's voting on RFAs is harassment, even "borderline harassment". RFA has a long history of users&#160;!voting in ususual ways: my personal "favorite" was the "7/24ths edits must be in talk space" requirement someone was using for a while. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirsfron_bff1.html" title="User:Firsfron"><font color="#0000FF">Firsfron of Ronchester</font></a> 08:04, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have agreed with <a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> throughout most of this discussion although I think he probably got a little too sharp in his defense of <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasssiveego_09fe.html" title="User:Masssiveego">User:Masssiveego</a>. I'm sorry that <a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">User:W.marsh</a> has been so offended as to want to leave. I agree with <a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELigulem_20b6.html" title="User:Ligulem">Ligulem</a> that such petulance is a bit ridiculous, even to the point of being... uh, well, I guess I better not say that as it would be considered uncivil.</p>
<p>I think <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasssiveego_09fe.html" title="User:Masssiveego">User:Masssiveego</a> has a problem although I can't quite figure out what it is. I first became aware of his RFA voting via a query that he made asking if he could be blocked for voting Oppose on RFAs. The answer was "No although it would help to provide reasons". Someone asked him what his criteria were and he gave a defensible answer although the standard was very high. I actually was starting to develop some respect for him. I am very disappointed and disillusioned by this joke RfA.</p>
<p>That said, I think blocking was an over-reaction. Either a massive oppose vote or SNOWballing the RFA would have been sufficient. It's not as if <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasssiveego_09fe.html" title="User:Masssiveego">User:Masssiveego</a> was vandalizing or engaging in serial incivility.</p>
<p>I admire <a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> for his principled opposition to the block although I think it was a bit too spirited. I can understand why he went "over the top" in the face of opposition from just about everybody else.</p>
<p>I hope we can close ranks and get back to the work of building an encyclopedia.</p>
<p>Best regards to all.</p>

<dd>I removed the RFA and did not intend to block Masssiveego. That the block has generated this much argument, however, surprises me; he was clearly trolling, to which the Wikipedia community is disappointingly susceptible. Ignore him and he'll go away. — <a href="../../../r/d/s/User%7ERdsmith4_389f.html" title="User:Rdsmith4">Dan</a> | <a href="../../../r/d/s/User_talk%7ERdsmith4_959f.html" title="User talk:Rdsmith4">talk</a> 06:45, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks Richard, and I can see where my opposition might seem stronger than warranted... though that's likely more due to this sort of thing being a personal hot button of mine. I strongly believe that any sort of 'double standard' for admins is horribly bad for Wikipedia. I compare Massiveego putting up a 'silly' RfA and getting a week long block with no warning to Cyde [to pick on one of the complainants] 'vandalizing' user pages in 'funny' ways, unprotecting the Main page, et cetera to be 'silly' despite <i>numerous</i> warnings... and getting little blocks of 15 minutes or a few hours. That's not equitable. Massiveego was encouraged to post an RfA (by people who apparently didn't guess that it wouldn't be a serious attempt)... Cyde was strongly warned to stop. Which was more willfully disrupting the encyclopedia? The admin community looked at Cyde's much more disruptive and deliberate actions and placed minor blocks (about nine hours in total) which were entirely preventative in nature. They looked at Massiveego's action and placed an entirely punitive week long block and collectively went on a 'personal attack fest'. Before anyone freaks out... I'm not saying that Cyde should have been blocked longer. He shouldn't have - until he stopped being disruptive was all that was needed. I'm saying that there is an obvious disparity in treatment which does more damage to Wikipedia than all the trolls and vandals combined ever will... in large part because it serves to <i>create</i> trolls and vandals. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 11:55, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I've long been wondering why vandals hit individual articles rather than widely-used templates ... maybe they are "learning".

<dd>Vandalizing templates that are used on alot of articles is certainly nothing new. I think we should decide on a case-by-case basis whether a template should be (semi)-protected, tho. <a href="../../../t/a/x/Template%7ETaxobox_3269.html" title="Template:Taxobox">Template:Taxobox</a> has just been semi-protected, anyways. --<a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EContiE_b35e.html" title="User:ContiE">Conti</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EContiE_12d8.html" title="User talk:ContiE">✉</a> 22:22, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think this is exactly what Conti meant, but in a similar vein I suggest that we first try semi-protecting these widely-used templates, see if that solves the problem, before moving to full-protection of these templates. Not only does it adhere to the principle that anyone can edit Wikipedia, but (more importantly, IMHO) it slows the escalation of vandalism/reaction &amp; gives us more time to consider if there is a better solution to this problem. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 19:54, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. Question here.</p>
<p>Five days ago, I marked The Cheetah Girls (TV Series) for deletion (the AfD discussion can be found <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_The_Cheetah_Girls_%28TV_Series%29_cf67.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Cheetah Girls (TV Series)">here</a>). Since the discussion has began, the article has been moved twice - first to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Cheetah_Girls_Sitcom_14e3.html" title="The Cheetah Girls Sitcom">The Cheetah Girls Sitcom</a>, then to The Cheetah Girls: The Series. I'm going to ask; is moving an article that's marked for deletion allowed? –<a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoChaosX_e5d9.html" title="User:NeoChaosX">NeoChaosX</a> <font size="1">[<a href="../../../n/e/o/User_talk%7ENeoChaosX_4f26.html" title="User talk:NeoChaosX">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_NeoChaosX_878e.html" title="Special:Contributions/NeoChaosX">contribs</a>]</font> 00:40, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Absolutely not. It can be seen as vandalism, in fact, if it's done as an attempt to evade the deletion. If the consensus of the AfD was "change to [new name]," then that should be performed at the end of the AfD, by the closer. Anyone doing anything prior to that should indicate on the AfD that it's being contemplated, then that it's done. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 01:28, 5 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As long as the deletion discussion is moved too, I don't see what the problem is. Unless, of course, none of the participants are aware of the move and get confused trying to find the discussion.--<a href="../../../k/o/j/User%7EKojiDude_79b7.html" title="User:KojiDude"><font color="blue">Koji</font></a><a href="../../../k/o/j/User_talk%7EKojiDude_b028.html" title="User talk:KojiDude"><font color="darkblue">Dude</font></a> 01:50, 5 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If it wasn't wrong, I have moved the article back to the original name. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryūlóng</a> 03:28, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The problem with moves during AfD is that it evades the closing decision, and this is particularly true if there is a double move, as the closer finds a redirect to a redirect, and it's even possible that the first redirect will have been deleted as a double redirect. My point is that AfD is a sort of freeze frame, unless we know in advance. Trust me: it can be very bad mojo. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:56, 5 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Okay, now that the article's been moved back (thanks Ryulong), can an admin come in and close this AfD? Think it's been oer 5 days now. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoChaosX_e5d9.html" title="User:NeoChaosX">NeoChaosX</a> <font size="1">[<a href="../../../n/e/o/User_talk%7ENeoChaosX_4f26.html" title="User talk:NeoChaosX">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_NeoChaosX_878e.html" title="Special:Contributions/NeoChaosX">contribs</a>]</font> 18:33, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I see no problems with moving an article marked for AfD. A redirect will remain there, so it's not evading the decision at all, and if it's moved twice, double redirects are <i>bypassed to make them single redirects</i>, not deleted. Even if they were deleted, the deletion log would show that it was just a redirect and where it pointed to, so the closer could always find the article. --<a href="../../../r/o/r/User_talk%7ERory096_912b.html" title="User talk:Rory096">Rory096</a> 19:20, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I have no intention of violating <a href="../../../b/e/a/WP%7EBEANS_2a59.html" title="WP:BEANS">WP:BEANS</a> by explaining more, but there are very good reasons to disallow page moves that are not discussed on the AfD. Telling folks on the AfD that you're doing the redirect (if it's suggested) and inviting review is one thing. Doing the move to effectively hide in the clover is quite another. Further, we have had people brought to ArbCom for, among other things, deciding that redirects were the universal solution to the "deletion problem." Again: it's a general no-no, and people moving articles, especially those moving them twice, probably violate the premise of AGF and should be presumptively treated as vandals. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 01:37, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I need some help with a situation at <a href="../../../a/e/_/WP%7EAE_df73.html" title="WP:AE">Arb enforcement</a> and beyond. <a href="../../../h/a/g/User%7EHagiographer_1a80.html" title="User:Hagiographer">Hagiographer</a> (<a href="../../../h/a/g/User_talk%7EHagiographer_d5ee.html" title="User talk:Hagiographer">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Hagiographer_af5e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Hagiographer">contribs</a>) posted a complaint about Squeakbox evading a one-month block. However this "block evasion" was editing his own talk page, which is permitted. I find in reviewing the case that on August 18, Hagiographer altered Squeakbox's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AJosé_Luis_Rodríguez_Zapatero&amp;diff=70380742&amp;oldid=70337486" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AJosé_Luis_Rodríguez_Zapatero&amp;diff=70380742&amp;oldid=70337486" rel="nofollow">signature</a> to that of a user he suspected of being Squeakbox's sock puppet.</p>
<p>There is also a complaint that Hagiographer included a personal attack in this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roberto_Weiss&amp;diff=73723747&amp;oldid=72457146" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roberto_Weiss&amp;diff=73723747&amp;oldid=72457146" rel="nofollow">prod</a> notice filed on an article about Squeakbox's grandfather, which I agree is a significantly abusive attempt to troll against a blocked user. However, the prod was removed and the complaint filed by two new users, Relator (<a href="../../../r/e/l/User_talk%7ERelator_26a5.html" title="User talk:Relator">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Relator_f82f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Relator">contribs</a>) and Mister Shower (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mister_Shower_783a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mister Shower">contribs</a>), who I suspect are Squeakbox sock puppets. Since the socks have not edited articles other than to respond to Hagiographer's trolling, I recommend blocking them but not extending Squeakbox's ban, currently set to end Sept 22. I also recommend a significant block for Hagiographer for trolling, at least a week and possibly as long as 18 days, to end when Squeakbox's block ends. Hagiographer should not be allowed to take advantage of Squeakbox's block by trolling him in this way. Comments please. (Also I can't throw the blocks myself). <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131 (talk)</a> 01:15, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>You claim I've changed SqueakBox's signature. Well, he changed a post of mine <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard%2FArbitration_enforcement&amp;diff=63622743&amp;oldid=63621970" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard%2FArbitration_enforcement&amp;diff=63622743&amp;oldid=63621970" rel="nofollow">here</a> in the arbitration enforcement page. The rules in the top of that page state clearly that the header of any complaint must be the name of the user you're complaining about. If I was complaining about SqueakBox, what was the meaning of changing the header to "SqueakBox and Zapatancas"? Nobody did anything at the time. <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ASuspected_sock_puppets%2FSqueakBox&amp;diff=64504614&amp;oldid=64451511" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ASuspected_sock_puppets%2FSqueakBox&amp;diff=64504614&amp;oldid=64451511" rel="nofollow">Here</a></b> he redirected to his user page <a href="../../../s/u/s/Wikipedia%7ESuspected_sock_puppets_SqueakBox_244b.html" title="Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/SqueakBox">Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/SqueakBox</a> and removed any evidence that a sock puppetry accusation (started by me) had been posted. Nobody took any action. Did anybody warn SqueakBox at the time? SqueakBox was blocked on August 24 because he had accessed the Wikipedia during his first month ban as <a href="../../../s/k/a/User%7ESkanking_aa8d.html" title="User:Skanking">User:Skanking</a>. Skanking was blocked on July 26. That is, it took a month to enforce a simple ban! Well, I changed the signature of SqueakBox to other signature of him (because Pura Paja is SqueakBox). Did you really want me to believe in those circunstances that changing SqueakBox's signature to that of his sock puppet when he was trying to deceive honest, neutral users making them believe Pura Paja was simply another Wikipedian and not a sock puppet of him repeating his typical vandalism was so serious? Nobody was enforcing the simplest decisions although I was getting tired of asking them to be enforced (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Arbitration_enforcement&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=70385619" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Arbitration_enforcement&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=70385619" rel="nofollow">example</a>) and nobody was answering me! SqueakBox had changed my edits blatantly and nobody had done anything!!! And you want to punish me for that now, when I had already been punished by being placed under POV parole and being banned from editing Zapatero's articles although I've simply removed vandalism from them? I believe that in the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Constitution_f91f.html" title="American Constitution">American Constitution</a> can be read that the same person cannot be put in risk of limb twice for the same offense (or something like that). Does that not apply in the Wikipedia?</li>
<li><a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">User:Guettarda</a> has exposed here "his opinion" without recognizing that he has had some clashes with me. Is that the behavior recommended for administrators? This administrator has been harassing me of late. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AHagiographer&amp;diff=73033267&amp;oldid=73007896" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AHagiographer&amp;diff=73033267&amp;oldid=73007896" rel="nofollow">Here</a> he posted in my talk page that I'm obssesed with other editor (SqueakBox), that I like picking fights with other people.

In SqueakBox's user page <b>there is an insult against me</b>: "My [SqueakBox's] greatest achievements here [...] have been [...] and restoring José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero from the POV of another user who claims to write about saints." Hagiographer means writing about saints. It's clear that's a personal attack. SqueakBox has been blocked for that!, see his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:SqueakBox" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:SqueakBox" rel="nofollow">block log</a>.

I marked it as a personal attack <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ASqueakBox&amp;diff=71121865&amp;oldid=71011996" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ASqueakBox&amp;diff=71121865&amp;oldid=71011996" rel="nofollow">here</a>, as I didn't feel I had a right to remove something to which I was directly involved, and that even though <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> states that, although isn't considered an official policy, removing personal attacks is common and even welcome.</li>
<li>Guettarda and SqueakBox have been involved in the past in harassment campaigns against other users. In <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">User:SqueakBox</a> can be found a barnstar given by Guettarda when he congratulates SqueakBox for expelling other users (whom he insults calling them strange) from <a href="../../../j/a/v/Javier_Solana_a15f.html" title="Javier Solana">Javier Solana</a>. Although he cannot be neutral as a consquence he has had no qualms in persecuting me, a honest wikipedian who only asked not to be insulted.</li>
<li>Guettarda is accusing me unfairly of "admin-shopping" "spamming admins in alphabetical order with the hope of achieving [my] desired outcome". I simply <b>want</b> that insult to be removed. I've tried to unprotect the page. That request was denied. I understood that the reason was: "Only you know you're being insulted so no need to take any action". That was what I understood at least. So I tried to look for a second opinion, as the first didn't convince me. I've not written <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>. It's there where personal attacks are banned. SqueakBox has been banned for that insult. What's the use of banning the person and keeping the insult? I'd rather prefer it the other way around. Is that such a crime? I'm from Spain so, it seems most administrators are sleeping when I access the Wikipedia, if I ask several of them the answer is expected to be faster and the problem can be solved sooner. And well, when SqueakBox created Skanking it was pretty clear he had to be blocked. It took a month! If believing that finding an administrator with time enough to analyze a situation in depth with that precedent is a crime, ok, I'm a criminal. I've posted tons of messages complaining for SqueakBox's insults and breaches of his ban and most of them have simply been ignored. This time, I've simply asked the administrator community for help. Is that an attack so terribly against the Wikipedia? That is, SqueakBox insults me. Guettarda enforces that insult and start harassing and insulting me. I post a message to ten administrators of whom, probably, at least seven are sleeping at the time so, probably, the problem will be solved before they even log in. The final deduction is: Hagiographer is a troll. And it would be solved if an administrator would haven't decided it was "spam" thus breaking <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a></li>
<li>In regard to the proposal for deletion, as far as I know I've followed the process. At the time I didn't know a Vfd had already taken place. In fact, that proves it's not so strange to believe that article had to be deleted. You claim I'm trolling against a user (?) As far as I know, articles don't belong to any user (see <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>). And, certainly, the best argument to delete an article is that only a user in all the Wikipedia (the grandson of the subject!) is interested in it. So, from a logical point of view there are only two options taking into account <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>Several users find the article interesting. Then, why am I trolling against only one? I would be trolling against all of them.</li>
<li>Only one user is interested in the article. Then, how can be considered to ask an article to be deleted when only the granson is interested in it so unreasonable?</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>How can I troll against a blocked user in this case? I know nobody will answer.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Could somebody explain to me where are those so terrible attacks in the prod notice. Give me an example of other encyclopedia where there is an article about Roberto Weiss (that's one of those attacks, isn't it?)? Is it such a crime to believe that an article has been created by the grandson of its subject because only the grandson is interested in it. Is that worse than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Suspected_sock_puppets/SqueakBox_%282nd%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=70334341" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Suspected_sock_puppets/SqueakBox_%282nd%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=70334341" rel="nofollow">this</a> comment by SqueakBox in which he says that: I've chased off legitimate users (his sock puppet Skanking) with "false accusations" o that I don't know what integrity (or honradez in Spanish) means? Nobody cares about that. Of course, posting something like that is not the same that asking an administrator (well, several) for help. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASqueakBox&amp;diff=69884070&amp;oldid=69619670" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASqueakBox&amp;diff=69884070&amp;oldid=69619670" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is other intersting edit in which SqueakBox says to <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKilo-Lima_bc04.html" title="User:Kilo-Lima">User:Kilo-Lima</a> that he's nothing but a kid, that there is no interest in what he says, that he has to grow up a bit and so on. Nobody cares, but of course posting something like that has nothing to do with following strictly the proposed for deletion process. By the way, when the Pura Paja sock puppetry case was started, Kilo Lima warned that he wasn't going to examine that case as he had a conflict with SqueakBox. That proves he deserved the insults. User Guettarda, in a similar situation, would have acted "differently".</li>
</ul>
<p>So, as a conclusion:</p>
<ol>
<li>SqueakBox page will continue to be filled with insults against me. I deserve it. Who I believe I am to ask an administrator (well, several) to remove a personal attack against me?</li>
<li>The proposed for deletion issue could've been solved easily: a message in my talk page stating that an AfD had already been rejected. Of course, it's better to ignore <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and claim that I wanted to troll a blocked user because, taking into account <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>, biographies belong only to grandsons. In the prod notice is also stated that "If you created the article, please don't take offense." That implies, evidently, that following the prod process is a direct attack that cannot be tolerated. If mustn' be forgotten that SqueakBox hasn't asked a user page not to be used as a platform to attack him, the worst crime that can be imagined, so some privileges must be recognized.</li>
<li>SqueakBox can change other user's comments but if a newbie, after seeing how his comments are removed or changed, after being ignored when he asked several times an arbcom decision to be enforced, after being ignored when he reported personal attacks decides to answer in kind tired of the lawlessness he perceives everywhere then he must be punished once and, two weeks later, threatened and probably punished. Well, I supposed that if instead of combating SqueakBox's vandalism and trusting the administrators I would have become a minion in some administrator's campaigns of harassment then I would have had no problem at all. Perhaps, the Wikipedia is about that.</li>
<li>I'm going to be banned for 17 days, until SqueakBox ends his ban. <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_SqueakBox_and_Zapatancas_ff79.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/SqueakBox and Zapatancas">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/SqueakBox and Zapatancas</a> states that SqueakBox, and Zapatancas, can be blocked at most for one week for editing Zapatero's related articles or breaking their parole and the same conditions apply to me. As far as I know, I haven't any precedent against me but, well, I will not be blocked for five days, as a warn, but for 17 days. Weeks are different over here. Maybe as claiming I'm attacked anybody is so dubious the punishment must be increased. It's pure logic. I've placed this at the bottom. Nobody is going to read this so when I will be blocked for 17 days this will be a good proof of what are the values dominant here.</li>

<p>I don't know why I've spent any time writing this. I know you're going to pay no attention to it. Every decision that has to be taken has already been taken.

<ul>
<li>I don't think you should be able to take advantage of Squeakbox's block to bait him. You could have placed the prod without personal references; you could even have waited until 9/22 knowing that it was an article that was important to Squeakbox. Regarding the other issues, there hasn't been a lot of attention paid to Arb Enforcement; I may start hanging out there more often but I'm not going back 2 months. Banning you from Zapatero was supposed to stop you from getting on each other's backs but all it has done was move the disruption around. Both of you need to cool off and quit it. As far as the block is concerned, I'm not an admin (yet) and Guettarda hasn't actually blocked you (which is proper if you two have had a dispute), so unless some other admins take an interest, you may get away with baiting Squeakbox this time as well. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131 (talk)</a> 11:25, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Regarding the sig issue between SB and H, "he did it first" is not a viable excuse for misbehaviour.</li>
<li>I have no conflict with Hagiographer - being on the receiving end of his rather amusing comments in no way constitues "conflict" (if that were the case then someone could attack every admin on the project and be unblockable). I warned him about his disruptive behaviour. That doesn't constitute "conflict".</li>
<li>"<i>Guettarda and SqueakBox have been involved in the past in harassment campaigns against other users</i>" - this is a blatent falsehood. A year or two ago <a href="../../../c/u/m/User%7ECumbey_f99f.html" title="User:Cumbey">User:Cumbey</a> insisted in inserting claims that Javier Solana was the anti-Christ into his article. When SB opposed her, she threatened to have him arrested, and "outed" him on her web page. Her behaviour was bizarre, and I gave SB a barnstar for defending the integrity of the article in the face of threats and intimidation.</li>
<li>I protected SB's user page per his request to end an edit-war. I expressed no opinion on the content of the article, but despite Hagiographer's request for unprotection, repeated appeals to Tony Sidaway, and most recently, admin-spamming, no admin has chosen to unprotect the page or remove the comments that Hagiographer believes to be a personal attack. Nor has any admin asked me to reconsider my page protection.</li>
<li>With regards to his prod'ing SB's grandfather - the issue isn't whether the action was done in accordance with procedure or not. The issue here is one of motivation. The action smacks of bad-faith intent. After I told Hagiographer to lay off baiting SB, his first Main namespace edit in a week is to prod SB's grandfather - an article which survived a VFD easily when it was last nominated. In addition, his rationale for prod'ing the article was that it was SB's grandfather. I really have a hard time seeing it as anything but abuse of the system. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 22:12, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>In this case, it is. SqueakBox changed my comments in a page full of administrators experts in the rules and nothing happened. How could I imagine that to do something SqueakBox did with total impunity would mean constant threats against me of being punished forever? As SqueakBox changes and deletes other users' comments whenever he wants I thought it was normal. It's a matter of learning curve. You see people doing something and getting away with it and you think it's accepted. By the way, SqueakBox changes other user comments in his user pages claiming they are personal attacks (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ACumbey&amp;diff=20480740&amp;oldid=19339099" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ACumbey&amp;diff=20480740&amp;oldid=19339099" rel="nofollow">example</a>). And Cumbey hadn't been blocked for them. <a href="../../../h/a/g/User%7EHagiographer_1a80.html" title="User:Hagiographer">Hagiographer</a> 07:15, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The Wikipedia is about transparency. If another user has complaint for your unpleasant comments the least you can do is: "I post this opinion about this user, who has complained about me". Every possible conflict of interest must be exposed. Claiming I like picking fights isn't much like being in the "receiving end". In my opinion is quite funny that view of: "User A has a conflict with me, but I have no conflict with him". <a href="../../../h/a/g/User%7EHagiographer_1a80.html" title="User:Hagiographer">Hagiographer</a> 07:15, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>"<i>If those aren't personal attacks tell me what they are</i>" - I thought it was pretty clear - they are a warning to stop abusing his editing privileges here. Using Wikipedia in this manner is unacceptable. That's a simple statement, not an attack.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>To warn a person you need to insult him saying he likes picking fights when you know that person is being insulted? That he had to lay off the rhetoric? SqueakBox had used an anonymous IP address to access the Wikipedia although he was blocked (isn't that unacceptable?) you were warned and you did nothing and you claim you are being impartial?</dd>

<li>Why it is "unfair" to call his actions what they are?</li>

<dd>Criticising a person for asking help from the administrator community (as far as I know, administrators have privileges for that, not to prevent insults from being removed) is very unfair, in my opinion. <a href="../../../h/a/g/User%7EHagiographer_1a80.html" title="User:Hagiographer">Hagiographer</a> 07:15, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I don't know what happened exactly at the time but <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> states clearly that "Personal attacks against any user - regardless of his/her past behaviour - are contrary to [Wikipedia's] spirit." Why is your right to say other person is "strange"? I've read some comments by Cumbey and, according to her, SqueakBox was all day long reminding her that in Honduras libel offenses are criminal and that she could end up in jail if she ever travel there and so on. So, why don't you share also that information? Where is the difference between SqueakBox's and Cumbey's behavior? Perhaps if you would have listened to her point of view instead of insulting her you all would have felt happier at the end. <a href="../../../h/a/g/User%7EHagiographer_1a80.html" title="User:Hagiographer">Hagiographer</a> 07:15, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Guettarda, Tony Sidaway blocked SqueakBox for that comment. No admin has answered me yet, but that in the request for unprotection who answered: Only you know you are being insulted! To block SqueakBox took a month after proving Skanking was his sock puppet. Are you claiming that if no administrator does something something mustn't be done? In that case, you are implying ArbCom's bans means simply you have to create a sock puppet. By the way, this problem <b>has been caused by you</b>. On August 22, SqueakBox posted a message in his talk page (where it can still be found) in which he said: "If you [Guettarda] would like me to remove anything from [my user page] please ask here and I can get one of my workers, who are not banned, to do so." So, even SqueakBox recognizes he has not acted correctly and doesn't mind about removing that insult. <a href="../../../h/a/g/User%7EHagiographer_1a80.html" title="User:Hagiographer">Hagiographer</a> 07:15, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I've made my position clear on the matter, suggesting arbitration first months ago, and again since then (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Piotrus&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=60421747" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Piotrus&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=60421747" rel="nofollow">[68]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66195000" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66195000" rel="nofollow">[69]</a>) but the kind of people he is in disputes with are the kind of people that prefer conflict to dispute resolution.

<dd>I wish you could provide any samples of my incivility or edit warring during the last month or so. The affair with Piotrus has nothing to do with the issue of Carnildo's RfA. I don't know how I was "involved" with the author of this thread. At least I don't remember having met him before. Neither do I remember him posting any concerns on my talk page. When a stranger comes to <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> and asks to block a well-established contributor... and he gets instantly blocked by a person whom that contributor criticised an hour ago... well, it is called...

<dd>I agree, and I also think that Tony doing the blocking himself looks particularly bad. It comes off looking like a case of "Oh, you disagree with me? Alright, you're blocked."

<p>I must say that Tony's block is an abuse of admin's rights, to put it mildly. Ever since <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Archive52_daf7.html#Hasty_Blocking_by_Some_Administrators" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Archive52">I raised the issue</a> of striking a <u>balance between admins's indecisivenss leading to trollfest</u> on one hand and admins through the <u>hasty and unchecked application of the admin tools harming Wikipedia and its editors</u>, I've seen no headway to this. Ghirlandajo's entries that started this whole thing could have been milder but in no way they warranted a block. Particularly, a <u>3 hour block is a totally useless action</u> whose only purpose may be intimidation by adding to the user's block log. If it's purpose was warning, it is no more effective than a verbal warning added at talk. I find the particular action of Tony, <b>normally a reasonable and useful admin</b> with no nonsense judgement to be <i>dangereous, unwarranted</i> and <i>harmful</i> and I strongly call on him <b>to take a breath</b> and think it over instead of continueing in the mode of <i>insinctive self-defence and/or defiance</i>.</p>
<p>I consider admins who don't hesitate to use their judgement to fend off trolls an important <u>asset</u> of Wikipedia and <i>Tony is one of such admins</i>. At the same time, whoever takes it upon herself to use the judgement bock should not do it carelessly. I hope Tony will post to Ghirla in a different tone to put this matter behind. I also hope that some admin will have a courage to click the unblock button, even if symbolically, to have a blocking log show that the block was controversial.</p>
<p>I would be sorry to see my hopes remain just a wishful thinking. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 16:51, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not involved in any dispute with Ghirlandajo (I honestly don't think I've ever encountered him before today).

The block was unwarranted and hasty, which does not make it a bad faith block. As for behavior, the behavior did not call for the block in the first place.

<dd>This <b>is</b> getting silly. No honest observer could ever interpret Ghirlandajo's comments as "gross incivility." Several of the comments cited are him telling other users to ignore drama and focus on the encyclopedia. None of them is any any way uncivil or a personal attack. In one of them, he complains about admins being more concerned with blocking editors than with building an encyclopedia. For this, a well-known block-happy admin issues a stern warning on his talk page, accusing him of gross incivility. His response was certainly defiant, but also civil and in my opinion just. Of course he is now blocked, for three hours to "calm down". Ludicrous. I can't imagine how any sane person could think this block would help the situation at all. Breath-takingly inappropriate. --<a href="../../../n/s/c/User%7ENscheffey_0fe4.html" title="User:Nscheffey"><font color="#000080" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>N</strong></font><font color="#FF0000" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>scheffey</strong></font></a><sup>(<a href="../../../n/s/c/User_talk%7ENscheffey_d4cb.html" title="User talk:Nscheffey">T</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nscheffey_b4d7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nscheffey">C</a>)</sup> 21:58, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Even if the users reverts were in good faith (which they clearly aren't - they're vandalism, or POV pushing at the very best), the user has just once more violated WP:3RR again under the user <a href="../../../l/e/w/User%7ELewisranja_9208.html" title="User:Lewisranja">Lewisranja</a>. This of course even discounts any edits made by his alter ego, 220.1.234.8.

<dd>I have to step in her to clear my name. That being - Lewis Ranja. What Crimsone continues to refer to as "vandalism" is nothing more than a good-faithed effort to bring some neutrality and objectivity to what is, otherwise, an extremely biased (bordering on Orwellian) entry. I have made efforts to negotiate with Crimsone. I have altered my wording of the edit and have even made an effort to simply place a "Disputed Neutrality" ta to the top of this article. Both were removed. Crimsone's accomplice in what has become a severe act of serial vandalism-by-deletion has simply come to his aid so that they both permit this article to continue to provide Wikipedia with a very leftwing slant. Despite Crimsone's socio-political disagreements with me, I assure you that I am not a vandal and am, if anything, the victim of one. <a href="../../../l/e/w/User%7ELewisranja_9208.html" title="User:Lewisranja">Lewisranja</a> 07:00, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>All I need to say is that reasons for my actions are detailed on the articles talk page. They speak for themselves. Also, please do not assume my gender, and please don't accuse me of being in some kind of cabal because nothing could be further from the truth and there is no evidence for the accusation. I don't have an accomplice. The nonsense being added has been reverted by more people than just myself and the editor you mention anyway - it's a consensus I have no political position, nor a social one - only one stemming from wikipedias desire for accurate and informative encyclopedic articles with a neutral point of view Were the edit in any way informative or relevant to the subject of the article (see article talk for explanation), I would have no problem with it. <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECrimsone_36a6.html" title="User:Crimsone">Crimsone</a> 07:17, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Not only am I being attacked, but I am now being attacked in my report of being personally attacked. My character is being defamed, my clinical depression mocked, and having outright lies told about me. Somebody please please please help.

While not an admin, I am attempting to cool matters down on the talk page. I'm going to ask both editors involved to refrain from further reverts on the article until discussion is completed.</s> While starting my edit of the Transphobia talk page, I discovered that Lewisranja has been blocked (would be very helpful in future if an announcement was made on Incidents so others would be able to discover resolution more easily). Very sad that it had to come to this. I'll keep an eye on the article in case the dispute flares up again. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 20:11, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The block resulted from my report on WP:NPA. Though I can see the strikeout on the comments, I fail to see where I violated NPA. To the best of my knowledge, I remained civil troughout, assuming good faith until such a point that I could no longer reasonably do so. Even there, I remained civil despite some very hurtful things being said - I requested admin intervention by via the talk pages of two admins very early on, then started issuing warnings, then posted a wiki alert, then this report, followed by a continued NPA report for some very hurtful attacks indeed and the user was finally blocked. The WP:3RR rule does not count towards reverting vandalism - this is not an accusation but an actual fact given everything said (and ignored by the user) on the talk page, the fact that I was not the only person to consider it so, the fact that this became a vendetta against me with no provocation using the article as a means for deliberately trying to upset me and drive me away. While I would have been within my rights to do so in my opinion, I even refrained from calling the user "a vandal", instead refering to the edit as vandalism - in accordance with WP:NPA, I remained civil and did my absolute best to comment on the statement, not the maker of it.</dd>

<dd>However, I most certainly appreciate your effort in looking at the issue, and ap[reciate that any person looking at any issue must form their own opinion of it. While I may not nessecarily agree with the opinion formed, I must however insist that at the very least, I acted in good faith. Regardless of any of my previous comment, I certainly offer my eternal grattitude for looking at the situation in the very least.&#160;:) <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECrimsone_36a6.html" title="User:Crimsone">Crimsone</a> 20:44, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I wasn't sure where to post this, but I don't think it fits requested moves, since it's a violation of that process. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">EL C</a> took it upon him self to move <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_Israel-Lebanon_Conflict_bb05.html" title="2006 Israel-Lebanon Conflict">2006 Israel-Lebanon Conflict</a> to <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_Israel-Lebanon_War_7748.html" title="2006 Israel-Lebanon War">2006 Israel-Lebanon War</a>, without any consensus for the move. Others were already deciding where to move the page, in accordance with <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">requested move proceedure</a> - at the time of the move, users were roughly evenly split (6:5) on the issue. After questioning him on his and the <a href="../../../2/0/0/Talk%7E2006_Israel-Lebanon_War_88d3.html#Why_was_this_changed_to_war.3F" title="Talk:2006 Israel-Lebanon War">main talk page</a>, El C explained that the reason he moved it was because he'd held a discussion (in fairness, <a href="../../../2/0/0/Talk%7E2006_Israel-Lebanon_War_88d3.html#Rename_to_.22war.22" title="Talk:2006 Israel-Lebanon War">he did</a>) in which he had a consensus (sort of). However, he completely ignored the poll running <a href="../../../2/0/0/Talk%7E2006_Israel-Lebanon_War_88d3.html#Issue_3_-_Description_of_Conflict" title="Talk:2006 Israel-Lebanon War">directly above</a> where he held his discussion. His dislike of democracy and polls is irrelevant to the move - the process was already underway, and ignoring the discussion of other wikipedians, he went ahead and moved the page. I'm aware this is similar to a content dispute, but I'm not asking because I think conflict is a better name, but because he didn't move it with the consensus of the discussion. Since the page is protected from moves, I'd appreciate it if an admin could move the page back to where it was until the process is complete.

<dd>I agree with lore here. There is a 50/50 split in the current RM discussion on the talk page. There is no consensus for a move and none should have been done at this time.

<dd>The definition of "wheel warring" has changed since the last time I had read it. It appears that using Admin tools to revert <b>any</b> Admin action is considered "wheel warring". Under that definition, though <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">User:El C</a> was wheel warring in moving the article when it was moved-blocked (reverting "that" Admin action). I think it may be better to leave the article where it was while we disucss who may have made a mistake. And I was wrong about the mediation and whether he was under any specific restrictions; still, I can't recall why <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">User:El C</a> was on my watch list; he must have done something I considered questionable.

<dd>This is a farce. AR <i>feels</i> I've must have done something questionable at some point (any basis for that? He thought I was involved in the <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_Apartheid_380e.html" title="Israeli Apartheid">Israeli Apartheid</a> move-war, for example. Wrong), so he move reverts me without notice. Just a few days ago, I was offered a barnstar for my contributions to the 2006 I-L series of articles, which had been extensive. But I suppose none of that matters, since to AR, I'm a priori acting questionably, so he opts for brute force, and the discussion I painstakingly facilitated (which was productive) be damned. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 15:43, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>True, however in this case I don't believe any wheel warring has occured. El_C acted inappropriately moving a page to his preferred name when no consensus had yet been achieved. This was simply reverted as it should have been so that a consensus could develop. El_C's continued claim that there was a consensus non-withstanding he should not be the one to move this page when and if the time comes because he's an involved party with a very clearly defined bias. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnnyBGood_3156.html" title="User:JohnnyBGood"><font color="green"><b>JohnnyBGood</b></font></a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnnyBGood_d6fd.html" title="User talk:JohnnyBGood"><font color="red"><b>t</b></font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JohnnyBGood_a89f.html" title="Special:Contributions/JohnnyBGood"><font color="red"><b>c</b></font></a> <b>VIVA!</b> 20:49, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thankfuly, I've never wheel warred, ever. However long JBG keeps repeating these falsehoods, will not make them so. He was not part of the original discussion, which was held for 10-days, and in it, consensus was reached before the move.

<dd>I didn't say you wheel warred. I said your move was in appropriate at that time. Your denying it doesn't change that.

<p>Over the last two months, JimRaynor55 has decided to certain material from the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_canon_254b.html" title="Star Wars canon">Star Wars canon</a> article, persistently disregarding what appears to be a consensus for the information to remain from the more experienced and contributing editors. Nearly all of his activity since June has been either trying to remove a link that appears to be a valid, well-reasoned take on the subject, or exhibiting a consistent pattern of abusve rhetoric and personal attacks on others who disagree with him or his conclusions. Other editors have presented their arguments for inclusion, which Raynor either dismisses out of hand or ignores, and continues to delete information from the article. He will not accept reason or compromise, and has stated so publicly in his comments and edit summaries. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Star_Wars_canon&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66817333" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Star_Wars_canon&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66817333" rel="nofollow">[84]</a> In short, he refuses to work with others unless he gets his own way, and I'd like to see what measures can be taken to limit his edits to this article until he learns to work with others. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRealFennShysa_6315.html" title="User:TheRealFennShysa">TheRealFennShysa</a> 00:35, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The 3rr violations seem to be from about 3 weeks ago, when the user was very new, can you put in some diffs? The edits I see look fine, from a somewhat liberal but reasonable and well explained POV, the user uses a different name in their signature every time they sign, which is not against any policy, they're clearly not impersonating anyone.

<p>There is an ongoing content dispute regarding whether or not a laundry list of detailed hardware specifications should remain or be replaced by a concise and abriged summary. The consensus seems to be very much for this latter option, but there are two editors who insist that abridging is "information removal", "harms the article", and is "vandalism". Numerous attempts have been made to reason with the users, get them to engage in discussion on the talk page, suggest alternative solutions, etc. In general the response has merely been edit warring.

<dd>I'm not an administrator, but perhaps a solution to the dispute may be to put the full specs on a sub-page of the article, and leave the abriged version of the specs in the article itself with a wikilink to the full specs (or perhaps a show/hide option in the article) <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECrimsone_36a6.html" title="User:Crimsone">Crimsone</a> 06:26, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>So, <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">User:Doc_glasgow</a> decides to close a DRV early, citing WP:SNOW <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ADeletion_review%2FLog%2F2006_September_5&amp;diff=74098200&amp;oldid=74095568" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ADeletion_review%2FLog%2F2006_September_5&amp;diff=74098200&amp;oldid=74095568" rel="nofollow">[99]</a>. As I'm told, it's allegedly an extension of WP:IAR, and "easily reversable." So what do I do? I reverse it, and then get blocked for disruption. Then his partner in snowball crime, <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">User:Tony Sidaway</a>, ends up being the reviewing admin, which just reeks of cabalism (oh, wait, <a href="../../../t/i/n/WP%7ETINC_0d39.html" title="WP:TINC">no cabal, right?</a>). Complete absurdity abound, here, and I'm getting awfully sick of these renegade maneuvers to make an end-around on policy to get the desired result. At worst, I was well within <i>my</i> right to "ignore all rules" and improve the encyclopedia by allowing an admitedly controversial deleiton challenge (by a completely uninvolved party, from the looks of things) to stand. At best, I reversed an obviously divisive and disruptive close, allowing it to get a full hearing. At what point is this lunacy going to end, exactly? When editors start being blocked for doing the right thing, there's a <i>major</i> problem. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 12:03, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, it was already upheld by DRV back in July, so I fail to what it was doing there again. Beyond that, there was an overwhelming majority in favor of speedy closing; largely on those grounds. Doc's actions make sense; yours don't. Ignoring all rules means doing what's best for the encyclopedia. In this case, that probably wasn't dragging out drama for no good purpose when the community--yes, the community--had already made up its mind. Regrettably, various rogue sysops treat militant lack of common sense as disruption. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 12:08, 6 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Whether it was upheld in July has little to do with it now, especially considering the person who brought it up was completely uninvolved. Secondly, there wasn't an overwhelming majority, it's impossible to come up with one in less than 24 hours. Third, ignoring all rules means doing what's best for the encyclopedia - that's what I did. The problem is, indeed, rogue sysops. The problem is the inability to see common sense when it's right in front of people. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 12:11, 6 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>However, no fresh reasons were introduced. You can't review a deletion review. The community has spoken; the article isn't wanted. IAR isn't a license to disruption; indeed, you cited it, not them. WP:SNOW is a recognized method for closing discussions where the outcome is a foregone conclusion. Given the drama attendant any Encyclopedia Dramatica activity, there are good reasons for closing it early. You've yet to explain how your actions benefit the encyclopedia. You aren't allowed to repeatedly reopen something just because you're uninvolved. Go try to AfD Gay Nigger Association of America again. You're uninvolved, after all. Don't blame me when you get reverted and probably blocked, though. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 12:15, 6 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't know if that's true, and of course you can review a deleiton review. WP:SNOW isn't recognized by a whole ton of people, either, it's mostly cited by people who have little interest in actually paying attention to the necessary processes. Also, so much for snowball/IAR actions being "easily reversable" - doing so simply gets you blocked. Meanwhile, how did my actions benefit the encyclopedia? It was designed to allow a full hearing for someone completely uninvolved wiht the prior discussion to present his/her case, and maybe see it with a clear hear. Doc's disruptive close ruined that, but he'll never be held accountable for it. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 12:18, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Knock it off jeff (or are you not capable of letting things rest?) Encyclopedia Dramatica had been afd'd - the decision had had a full deletion review and had been endorsed - someone relisted it - and it was being snowballed (badlydrawnjeff and one other supported it - 8 endosed 5 calling for speedy closure). How many bites at the cherry is an issue allowed? I closed it, because the result was obvious (<a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a>), and the relisting was straining the community's patience. I have no interest whatsoever in the article, however the debate was reoppened by jeff who was a participant in it, and is, I believe, connected with Encyclopedia Dramatica. I viewed that as POV-pushing campaigning, conflict of interests, tendentious manipulation of process, disrespectful of establish consensus, and downright disruptive. And this process wonking is getting really tiresom.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> 12:22, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>The issue isn't that you're challenging Doc's actions. It's that you're challenging actions that were unquestionably correct, and doing so in a repetetive and tendentious manner. Jeff, I think you're a smart guy, so when you keep engaging not in process wonking, but in <i>doomed</i> process wonking about subjects that <i>you know or should know have no hope of convincing even a significant minority of the community</i>, then I have to start asking myself: "Hey.

<li>It means nothing, mainly because it's the same people over and over. Can we get back to working the encyclopedia? Why, yhes, let's do so - that's what I'm attempting to do by reversing Doc's disruption. IAR only recently re-became instituted policy, and I hope it changes back because of asinine situations like this - both of us think we're improving the encycopedia, one of us gets blocked. Kind of bizarre, don't you think?

<p>I see I've failed to elucidate; allow me to try again. The issue is that the matter was closed. It was closed back in July. To bring it forward again threatens to rekindle all the old bad blood. This should only be done if there's a valid, pressing reason for arguing that the original combination AfD/DRV was no longer valid. This would take the form of ED doing something notable enough for a new article to be written. This has not happened. Users can reopen old issues all they want; this is a wiki, after all; but they shouldn't be surprised if administrators decide enough is enough, which is what happened here. You're talking as though this is some kind of judiciary proceeding, which it was not. Indeed, the article hasn't been discussed at all, probably because there's nothing at all to be said about it. The encyclopedia is composed of articles, not editors–they merely edit the articles. The distinction is an important one often lost here. Any action is easily reversible, but that's not a license to revert. Whether you recognize WP:SNOW or not is irrelevant to our purpose here; it isn't policy–it's shorthand. That is to say, to invoke WP:SNOW is to say, simply: "I'm doing this because I believe the will of the community and needs of the encyclopedia are so absolutely manifest that no good purpose would be served by drawing the matter out." You obviously recognize this idea, you just tried to apply it, if in error. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 12:27, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Which there is a valid, pressing reason. Your disagreement with it is no reason to endorse such disruption by Doc. As for my application of IAR, I said "at worst."

<li>Give it up, mate. This was flogging a dead horse and Doc was quite right to close it.

<p>[De-indent.] I'm not going to waste much more time on this or I'll end up getting cranky and uncivil. But what part don't you get? This deletion had <i>already</i> been through DRV. It had no business being there at all, could only have been there out of ignorance or to cause disruption (I'll assume the former), and was fair game for any admin to close on sight. This seems just so obvious to me that I can't believe you're understanding the situation. I'm really trying to assume good faith here ... <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 14:41, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Please do assume good faith, I have the best interests at heart here. There's nothing stopping a DRV from occurring more than once, it happens plenty. Considering how heated the last situation was, perhaps waiting 6 weeks and rerunning it to get an <i>actual</i> consensus dealing with how poorly the AfD was running was the right move - I think so. Doc decided no, and now the situation has effectively escalated again. Too soon? Perhaps, but that wasn't for Doc to decide, and his disruptive closes and blocks don't help. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 14:43, 6 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If that <i>has</i> ever happened in anything like these circumstances, it shouldn't have. DRV isn't something to be re-run until you get the "right" answer. There has to be an end to wiki-litigation, and DRV normally provides it. If you look at the circumstances here, far from being special (in the sense of favouring another bite of the cherry) they show that the attempt at a second DRV on the very same closure was being roundly rejected. Again, you and I seem to be living on different planets because it's just screamingly obvious to me that Doc did the right thing here and that any admin should have done the same - on first sight, in my view, but certainly in the circumstances Doc was actually presented with. If you still don't get it, I don't see what more I can say to make it clear. Anyway, that's enough for tonight. It's 1 a.m. and I'm going to bed.&#160;:) <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 15:03, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Jeff is wrong on the issue (although not on his objection to <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a>), which is his prerogative, as long as he in good faith believes that his position is right.</li>
<li>Jeff is beating a dead horse, which is tiresome but not a blocking offense.</li>
<li>Jeff is alone in holding his opinion. <b>THIS IS ABSOLUTELY NOT A BLOCKING OFFENSE</b>.</li>
<li>The thrust I see for this being considered disruptive is that he continues arguing instead of building an encyclopedia. This is bull, because it always takes two sides to argue, and I see lots of people willing to take the other side. Don't, and the argument will go away.</li>

<p>Since it doesn't seem like Jeff is going to stop anytime soon, and it takes two to argue, and because we apparently just can't block Jeff outright (or so I'm told), the best solution <i>is</i> to just start ignoring him.

<li>From the difs you provided, I can't see Pjbruce actually saying that he was going to sue anyone for libel. He just seems to find certain comments about copyvio offencive, and is angry. Giving him WP:LEGAL was 100% the right thing to do, maybe it will help him cool off a bit and realise that no one was trying to do anything libelous. If he does make legal threats in the future, that would be handled by Office, as all legal threats are, but right now, he just seems like a newbie angry that his article is being deleted. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Halo_3472.html" title="User:The Halo">Th</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Halo_Esperanza_d8f6.html" title="User:The Halo/Esperanza"><font color="green">ε</font></a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Halo_3472.html" title="User:The Halo">Halo</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Halo_8994.html" title="User talk:The Halo"><b>Θ</b></a></sup> 14:42, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I initially encountered this editor after she edited a few articles on my watch list. She seems to be heavily interested in recatagorizing articles. Initially she was doing so without any edit summaries. After a couple requests for her to use edit summaries, she used 1 edit summary in a hundred edits and I again tried to explain why this was necessary. She's now using edit summaries all the time, but they're nonsense. I've already made repeated attempts to intervene here and I would appreciate if someone else would attempt to the get the point across here. Her last 10 edits summaries:</p>
<ul>
<li>blank</li>
<li>l</li>
<li>a</li>
<li>d</li>
<li>d</li>
<li>,,</li>
<li>a</li>
<li>d</li>
<li>putting in more precise cat. in regards to neurology</li>
<li>m</li>
</ul>
<p>only one actually says what she did, and you can see the trend continuing deep into her contrib history. Of her last 50 edits summaries, I only see 11 which explain what she did in them, the rest being gibberish or blank. I don't expect 100% edit summaries, but if you're on a massive overhaul of catagories, it might be a good idea to leave some explanations and let people know what you're doing.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 20:28, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Something like 80% of all Wikipedia accounts are inactive - they have never edited and probably never will.

<p>I've just finished a huge swathe of replies on the OTRS vandalism-complaints address - about thirty of these, perhaps, due to people who experienced vandalism by modifying templates to display everyone's favourite penis photograph as a 600px inline image. Normally, I'm vaguely surprised if we get more than half-a-dozen complaints about the FA du jour or more than a couple about any other page; this does seem a lot. Not really sure what we can do about this other than closely watching high-use templates or protecting them (personally I see no downside to the latter - things like {{<a href="../../../c/q/u/Template%7ECquote_f11d.html" title="Template:Cquote">cquote</a>}}, {{<a href="../../../t/a/x/Template%7ETaxobox_3269.html" title="Template:Taxobox">taxobox</a>}} or {{<a href="../../../o/t/h/Template%7EOtheruses_bbf8.html" title="Template:Otheruses">otheruses</a>}} really shouldn't be edited without good reason anyway), but thought I'd better toss the problem out here.</p>
<p>I've seen this before - it isn't new - but it does seem to have ramped up a lot this last couple of days. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimgray_a1bc.html" title="User:Shimgray">Shimgray</a> | <a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShimgray_87de.html" title="User talk:Shimgray">talk</a> | 21:54, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Would someone please look in on the article Ezebuiro Obinna? An anon (imaginably more than one, but the IPs are in the same range) has been removing {{<a href="../../../w/i/k/Template%7EWikify_3cf0.html" title="Template:Wikify">wikify</a>}}, {{<a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnreferenced_31dd.html" title="Template:Unreferenced">unreferenced</a>}}, and {{<a href="../../../n/p/o/Template%7ENpov_9149.html" title="Template:Npov">npov</a>}} tags, and removing my comments on these issues from the talk page, as well as writing absurd comments on the talk page like "What a credible neutral point of view!" Other editor in there is User:Igbigbo. I'll admit to having a suspicion that Igbigbo and the anon are one and the same; it might be interesting to run a user check on Igbigbo at the point where <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ezebuiro_Obinna&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=74107999" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ezebuiro_Obinna&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=74107999" rel="nofollow">one of his edits is only 5 minutes after the anon's</a> after several hours with no other edits credited to him.</p>
<p>Not a particular important article, but I suspect that this is someone not playing by the rules, and trying to cover his tracks. And I bet the images are copvios, to boot. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 23:24, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
