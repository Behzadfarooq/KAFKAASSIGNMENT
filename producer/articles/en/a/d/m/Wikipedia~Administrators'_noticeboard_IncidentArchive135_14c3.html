<dd>When it comes to matters of common sense and clear factual accuracy, I should imagine they are - that's why the community made them admins. Some catholic churches are seperate from the Roman Catholic Church.

<dd>The article was moved unilaterally in a copy-and-paste move. I fixed it. One of the editors involved in the move war states on his User page his agenda the "Defense of the Catholic Church in the use of her name". <b>Do not bring your battles to Wikipedia</b>. All other articles on the national RC churches are at Roman (only Canada and Great Britain are out of step with the convention, I started a discussion on moving Great Britain to be consistent with the rest, there is already a discussion at Canada). Voting is evil. The last move created double and triple redirects, most of whicih I think I have also fixed. In other words, I did what an admin is supposed to do: fixed up the mess caused by editors on a mission. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 07:36, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with the concept that "naming conventions of pages" is not subject to a vote. Once a norm has been established that should hold sway. Just because "k.d.lang" likes to downcase her name doesn't mean we should. Just because someone decides that the "Catholic church based in Rome" is the only legitimate one, doesn't mean we do. The standard is "Roman Catholic Church of xxx" and that's what should hold.

<dd>Actually when it comes to personal names we <i>should</i> depict them the way they want. In fact v/v kd lang, it says right at the top of her page that the first initial of her name is cap'd due to 'technical restrictions' in the Wiki software.

<dd>I'd suggest a 'move lock' would be appropriate here to stop the POV pushing, and move waring. But since I've already expressed opinions on this issue, I won't be the one to do it. 'Catholic' is a ambiguous/contested title - and it is not NPOV for us to describe one denomination as <i>the</i> Catholic Church. Keep it at Roman Catholic, and note that the denomination in question usually self-designates by the contested title. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> 10:03, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I came here because of a procedural issue, which is exactly the kind of thing where I thought adminstrators should hold sway. What I have found is that there are many administrators who feel that their place is to enforce their own POVs instead of enforcing Wikipedia policy and guidelines. There is more consideration about what the policies and guidelines mean among users in the discussion at Talk:Roman Catholic Church than has been exhibited here by administrators. Of course, administrator JzG has shut down a survey being conducted there also. He tells us "voting is evil." <a href="../../../n/c/o/WP%7ENCON_841b.html" title="WP:NCON">WP:NCON</a> says otherwise.</dd>
<dd>The title I gave this section has now been censored twice. It was originally <i>Administrator JzG aborts vote in process</i>.

It included the comment "Thylacoleo's summary at the end of this section sums it up perfectly. Please note: voting is evil." This to me is not the way admins. usually close debates.

<dd>Rory was talking about being bored, and then went to do the Cats. Then, randomly, he mentioned his odd edits and in a matter of a minute after looking I went and temp blocked, he said he was going off for a bit. There's really not a whole lot to what happened; it was as quick and confusing on IRC as it was here. As I said I just hit the shutoff once I gathered the pieces that he provided willingly; I invite him to comment further or for another administrator to extend the block if necessary. <a href="../../../t/e/k/User%7ETeke_11ee.html" title="User:Teke"><font color="maroon">Teke</font></a><sup><small>(<a href="../../../t/e/k/User_talk%7ETeke_b34c.html" title="User talk:Teke"><font color="gray">talk</font></a>)</small></sup> 05:02, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think this is totally unacceptable! Let me suggest that social networking take place on a social networking site. I hear there are many of them to choose from. This is supposed to be an encyclopeida, not a social scene for in which to make "joke" edits out of boredom! There is plenty of realy work to do, and here's a bunch of wasted efforts <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete.Hurd_10f1.html" title="User:Pete.Hurd">Pete.Hurd</a> 19:38, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This entire thing has been blown completely out of proportion. I made those edits as a joke that affected <i>nothing</i> encyclopaedic. I was in the process of self-reverting when Gogo beat me by a matter of seconds. Nothing malicious happened; my edits were completely harmless. Yes, there's work to do, but that doesn't mean that every editor should be forced to do whatever has to be done every second he's on Wikipedia. Might I remind you that editing, especially editing the encyclopaedia portion, is completely voluntary? There's no harm in edits like those that I made- do we ban "vandalboxes" because anyone editing those isn't editing the encyclopaedia itself? That would be silly, because if we weren't allowed to have a bit of fun here, the rate of editors burning out would almost inevitably go up exponentially. --<a href="../../../r/o/r/User_talk%7ERory096_912b.html" title="User talk:Rory096">Rory096</a> 20:22, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Wow. Talk about freaking out over nothing. I like the IRC crowd, I spent a lot of time on there. They do this. A block? You've got to be friggen kidding me. Self professed vandalism to a userpage of two people in a joke? That's the sort of thing that shows how our community interacts, keeps level and has fun, an important part of life. Next time this sort of thing comes up, unless someone actually complains, have some fun yourself.

<dd>For those not on IRC like myself, it was not being blown out of proportion. There was no indication that it was a joke until after I asked about it. Look at it from the point of view of not having the information from IRC: User redirects another user's page to "Bitch" with the comment "vandalism". The targeted user has not edited since July 8. How is somebody not on IRC supposed to figure out that it's a joke? Then the same user makes another vandalism edit with references to an infamous vandal and then returns to sign said vandalism. How else am I supposed to interpret this without any information from IRC? -- <a href="../../../g/o/g/User%7EGogo_Dodo_6e56.html" title="User:Gogo Dodo">Gogo Dodo</a> 06:01, 9 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Gogo Dodo is saying some important things that doesn't seem to be getting through. The subtext of the IRC crowd seems to be "look, if you're not on IRC, then you shouldn't be concerned about apparent vandalism, or bot misbehaviour, just leave it to us, the in-crowd, cuz we know what's really going on". Saying things like "I like the IRC crowd, I spent a lot of time on there. They do this." sends the opposite message, something like "hey, we're just a bunch of clowns who should be kept far away from admin tools". <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete.Hurd_10f1.html" title="User:Pete.Hurd">Pete.Hurd</a> 16:58, 9 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry to keep adding to the conversation, but I'd like to clarify a few things. First, I think the two admins involved (Teke and JoshuaZ) did a fine job. After they clarified the situation to me, I have no complaints. Second, I put this whole thing on WP:AN/I because at the time, I did not know what you were up to and I thought it would be best to take care of the situation immediately instead of waiting to find out what was going on because you seemed like a bot gone wild to me. While I was typing here, you were replying to me and it was not until after I hit Save did I look at your reply.

No legal threats, no threats of violence, just one replacement of the unblock template, some continued incivility, and some personal attacks.

<dd>I agree with *that* in general. I'm only able to evaluate so much information at a time; so far, in response to the request to review, I've looked at what's happened <i>since</i> he was blocked 48 hours, under the assumption that the 48 hour block made sense at the time. <i>If it did</i>, then what he's done since then does not justify an extension to indef.

<dd>The user asked me to look into this. When I did I found that the "content dispute" was over whether <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> applies to completely unreferenced claims that <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vincente_Fox_842c.html" title="Vincente Fox">Vincente Fox</a> is a racist and having Wikipedia itself state (rather than attributing it to someone else) that Fox frequently says things which "demonstrate his inexperience or lack of culture." In my judgement... BLP <i>does</i> apply here. To put it mildly. My first thought was to simply delete the page entirely as suggested by BLP, but instead I reverted to a version which <i>seems</i> ok and protected it. Protecting a page you have edited (just that one revert) is bad, but in the circumstances... (with users edit warring to <b>keep</b> the accusations of racism unreferenced and admins <i>upholding</i> it) I thought that page ought to be locked down until this gets sorted out. I have just now seen that I've above been accused of 'bad' admin action (what, no note to my talk page?) for undeleting and expanding an article on a place rather than <i>just</i> re-writing it from scratch... no doubt this will be another example of 'crimes' on my part, but c'mon. We blocked the guy who was <i>trying</i> to add valid references? Like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vicente_Fox&amp;diff=74012625&amp;oldid=74009937" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vicente_Fox&amp;diff=74012625&amp;oldid=74009937" rel="nofollow">this one</a>... where he replaced a blog ref with one from CNN.

<dd>The request filed by Ya ya is clearly retaliatory, which checkuser frowns on. Moreover, we'd never accept it anyway, because he was trying to out Chacor's IP address.

<dd>So far as I know it <i>is</i> FSF. He has said as much and I see no reason to doubt it. However, it seems odd that if two users accuse each other of making the same IP edit we only consider the <i>first</i> accusation. Trying to 'out' someone's IP address also doesn't make sense to me.

If you review my contributions, you will note that I have made edits to multiple political candidates of both parties from several different states.

I have, however, objected to <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoehazelton_cc1a.html" title="User:Joehazelton">User:Joehazelton</a> including many disparaging items about Duckworth in the <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Roskam_8f5d.html" title="Peter Roskam">Peter Roskam</a> article.

<dd>ERcheck response:
<ul>
<li>With respect to Propol's response here:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Propol's edit history: Propol's first edits were on June 16, with 3rd edit (on same day) to the Peter Roskam article. While there have been edits to a number of other articles, the vast majority are to the Roskam and Duckworth articles. Yes there have been a few edits to other articles — 6 other Illinois candidates, one Kentucky candidate, one Indiana candidate, and the CRNC chairman; 2 Democrats, rest Republican. "Single-purpose" with respect to Duckworth and Roskam may not be the most accurate description; Propol's edits do focus on current political candidates, for the most part in Illinois. Propol's interest appears to be in Illinois and nearby politics and with a focus in Wikipedia on one particular race in which there has been public mudslinging.</li>
<li>With respect to <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEdit_war_dd06.html" title="Wikipedia:Edit war">edit warring</a>: A definition is "two or more contributors' repeated reverts of one another's edits to an article." Propol and Joehazelton have been reverting each other's edits on the Roskam article. I see 3 reverts (within 24 hours) by Propol of the open letter.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Additional comment's on Propol's ANI report:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>With respect to the 3RR rule, the report reverts, all fall outside of the 24 hour time frame between consecutive reversion. Note: 3RR violations should be reported to <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_3RR_4b52.html" title="WP:AN/3RR">WP:AN/3RR</a>.</li>
<li>With respect to the "abusive edit summary", the text is "removed more list cruft". Propol's edit summaries include "Revert whitewash", which is no less contentious than "cruft". I don't agree that is is deception (although it was not full disclosure). Joehazelton, while adding some info, did remove a link to a DCCC page criticizing Roskam. AGF, "list cruft" could refer to that link. (In my opinion, that is an inappropriate, biased link.)</li>
<li>With respect to the inclusion of blogs (not considered to be reliable sources), you have included Eric Zorn's blog as a reference. Eric Zorn may be a columnist for a mainstream newspaper, but do you know that his blog is subjected to editorial scrutiny and fact checking?</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Concerning the basic issues here:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Content dispute, maintaining NPOV in articles on current Congressional candidates: Please see <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html#Dispute_resolution" title="WP:AN">the Administrators' noticeboard section on <b>Dispute resolution</b></a>. In reviewing the edits and the talk page discussion, a neutral third party might be of help.</li>
<li>Propol and Joehazelton's dispute: There are talk page discussions between the two — none too friendly. Though both editors may have the motive of seeing a fair treatment of candidates, the situation with respect to the Roskham article has become personal. I do suggest that both take a cooling off period from each other.</li>
<li>With respect to Joehazelton's conduct: Though some tempers have flared (incivility), he has shown some willingess (see his talk page) to discuss the issues. I'm not willing to block for 3RR for the reported activity. Incivility / personal attacks (by either party) should not be allowed to go unchecked.</li>

I have just one minor response to your comments, you noted that I used a <i>blog</i> by <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Zorn_28df.html" title="Eric Zorn">Eric Zorn</a> as a source. That is correct; however, this <i>blog</i> was published in the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Tribune_3abd.html" title="Chicago Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a> and was subject to fact checking and editorial review. Really, it's more of a column than a blog. They only call it a blog because readers can post responses to the article online. I don't think an online response would qualify as a reliable source, but the original article itself does. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoehazelton_cc1a.html" title="User:Joehazelton">User:Joehazelton</a> doesn't seem to see the distinction between this and other blogs found out there.

<p>BLP official policy: "While Wikipedia discourages people from writing new articles about themselves or expanding existing ones significantly, subjects of articles remain welcome to edit articles to correct inaccuracies, to remove inaccurate or unsourced material, or to remove libel." This policy appears to be a smokescreen. At the very minimum, there is no enforcement, and no provision for redress if a subject of an article feels that he is prevented from implementing the policy. There are numerous admins on Wikipedia who contend that a banned user who is the subject of an article forfeits this welcome, and has no right to "correct inaccuracies, to remove inaccurate or unsourced material, or to remove libel." That makes this BLP a dead letter, and it isn't worth the pixels it takes to display it. Remember, it takes only one admin to ban a user forever. I was banned by Gamaliel on April 5, 2006 because I was trying to explain that a new federal criminal law affects many Wikipedia editors. I appealed my ban to the mailing list and have proof that my appeal was received, but my appeal was ignored. I have been repeatedly reverted while attempting to correct information on my article. --Daniel Brandt 68.90.165.190 14:41, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't really see any issues with our current administrative response. The article is, and will continue to be, a hot button issue for many editors. Our best course of action is to encourage discussion between editors, and invoke appropriate sanctions against those (from either side) who knowingly violate policy. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><font color="OrangeRed">alpha</font><font color="black"><b>Chimp</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlphachimp_9b9e.html" title="User talk:Alphachimp">(talk)</a></sup> 05:17, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I second that. An alternative (or complementary) solution would be to just take it through the <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">dispute resolution</a> process.

<dd>Yeah, I agree Alphachimp.

<dd>I've just pulled up the exact quote - <i>The policy states that an editor must not perform more than three reversions, in whole or in part, on a single Wikipedia article within a 24 hour period. This does not imply that reverting three times or fewer is acceptable. In excessive cases, people can be blocked for edit warring or disruption even if they do not revert more than three times per day.</i> --<a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECrimsone_36a6.html" title="User:Crimsone">Crimsone</a> 06:29, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have a SERIOUS stalking problem. A user, User:Peartdrumsticks,who started as a GIPU, and then registered, who kept adding a commercial link to the page <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rush_%28band%29.html" title="Rush (band)">Rush (band)</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neil_Peart_1b3a.html" title="Neil Peart">Neil Peart</a>, and whose links were repeatedly reverted out, began confronting the editors removing it, on their pages. I asked him to stop, because he was acting quite hostile. He re-edited a single comment time after time to reflect whatever new wording he wanted to use to seem innocent, even after I'd replied. When told how to communicate on a wiki talk page, with multiple entries, he became MORE hostile, and told me he'd edit however he wanted. I told him I was done talking about the issue because of his hostility, and I placed all his harrassment into a single archive, found here <a href="../../../t/h/u/User_talk%7EThuranX_Special_archive_1_31be.html" title="User talk:ThuranX/Special archive 1">User_talk:ThuranX/Special_archive_1</a>. He was asked again to stop, and I continued to add his material to this archive. things kept getting worse, and I decided the best thing would be to tell him that anythign further would result in me seeking administrative help. I soon had to, and went here <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia_talk%7ENo_personal_attacks_4f76.html#Harassment" title="Wikipedia talk:No personal attacks">Wikipedia_talk:No_personal_attacks#Harassment</a>. This still wasn't enough. This mornign I received an E-mail from him. He titled it 'Batman', and the message body was 'hello ThuranX' and a big smiley face. I can ONLY take this as a serious and possibly criminal stalking action, as it means he had to track down my alias by searching the internet for ways to find and contact me. The 'batman' reference I believe refers to his 'detective skills.' He has requested total removal from Wikipedia under the 'right to vanish' policy. I take this entire action as a criminal act of stalking, and I want to know HOW I can deal with a wikipedian so angry he can't make money here that he's taken to stalking me outside of Wikipedia. I also do NOT want his account entirely deleted, so that if needed, the material is available for law enforcement research purposes. Please respond promptly, because I'd really rather not have to go to the local police for assistance with this stalker.

<p>User:Peartdrumsticks claimed he was leaving the wiki and had his userpage and talk page deleted. Since he continued to mess wtih <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a>'s archive pages, supposedly in the spirit of <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Right_to_Vanish" class="extiw" title="m:Right_to_Vanish">m:Right to Vanish</a>, I blocked his account indef to help him with his going away.

The September 11, 2001 attacks (often referred to as 9/11—pronounced "nine eleven") consisted of a series of coordinated suicide attacks upon the United States, predominantly targeting civilians, carried out on Tuesday, September 11, 2001.

<p>Kelly having a history of unilateralism when it comes to policy since wikimania, the proposed policy is alarming enough on it's own, seeking to limit who creates policy and how policy is amended, while being drafted in userspace away from an unsuspecting community and proper community input, but it gets worse when one considers that recent IRC discussion on this topic at #wikipedia Kelly proposed that all policy needs to determined by a small group of policy makers in face-to-face meetings funded by the foundation, and away from the community and its' input, led by Kelly Martin and Kim Bruning. Viewed in this light, Kelly ignoring calls for this proposed policy to be placed in the Wikipedia namespace, then edit warring to keep its' proposed policy template while hidden away from community review is simply unacceptable. I'd like to hear what regulars here have to say about this before I try to remove the template again.

<dd>Kelly should not edit war, even in her userspace- this cannot simultaneously be a proposal AND a page that only she can edit. However, I don't see that what namespace it's in is a big deal.

<dd>It seems a somewhat pointless edit war. If this proposal is to be put before the community, then it'll obviously need to be publicized, so there's no problem with letting it sit in her userspace for the time being. Conversely, if this were to be a <i>fait accompli</i> from the WMF, the location of the proposal wouldn't matter in the least—so there's still no problem with leaving it in userspace. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 23:26, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Regardless of where it is, it needs to be discussed and other people have to be allowed to edit it, so I suggest that Kelly moves it to project space so that a discussion can begin. The Foundation would presumably want to know the strength of feeling about it, Kirill, if they were to involve themselves in any way, so that's why it needs to be in project space, or at least publicized and open for editing. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 23:29, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm still very confused about all this. This is a policy proposal under development. The {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProposal_1286.html" title="Template:Proposal">proposal</a>}} tag specifically covers this possibility. I really can't come up with a rational reason for the passionate insistence that it is wrong for a draft page in user space to have the {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProposal_1286.html" title="Template:Proposal">proposal</a>}} tag. And given some of the comments above, I find it extraordinarily hard to assume that the objections being levied at the mere existence of this proposal are truly offered in good faith -- especially the charges of "unilateralism" and of attempting to engineer a personal "<i>fait accompli</i>" for a proposal that would create a majority-elected body whose principal function is to recommend policy to the community. I did say that I would seek to get Kim Bruning drafted to the council.</p>
<p>I've already told the people who are so vehemently objecting to it being in user space that they can move it. Radiant! removed the tag in what appears to be me to have been "good faith" because it appeared to have been "stale". He was mistaken, however, and I reinstated the tag and solicited preliminary comment from a variety of people. Some of those comments have been fruitful (thanks, Alison), and have led to what I think is a better proposal. However, I was not quite ready to take it fully "public"; I should think that that should be a choice I get to make (but apparently not). So, I invite anyone who feels that this proposal should be debated in full now, before I've decided to move it for discussion, is free to move it to an appropriate page in Wikipedia: space.</p>
<p>Oh, and FeloniousMonk, this proposal in no way limits how policy may be created or changed. I suggest you reread the proposal, as you are clearly mistaken about that. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 00:31, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Kelly protests that she does not understand why people are upset, and she, and many others, present this as a conflict over the placement of a proposed policy tag. These people are missing the point. What is at stake here is very simple - the degree to which transparency and equal participation are core values at Wikipedia. Like many others, I believe that Wikipedia is first and foremost an encyclopedia, and a semi-anarchic wiki-community second. Nevertheless, it is our being a semi-anarchic wiki-community that distinguishes this from all other encyclopedias. And participation and transparency are essential to the integrity of the wiki-community. This is the issue. I and many others feel that Kelly's proposal would represent a major move <i>away</i> from these values by creating a small, institutionalized group with excessive power. Many of us feel that there should be <i>some</i> limits to editing policy pages, but placing them in the hands of a small group goes against the essense of Wikipedia. I and others like JoshuaZ have stated these objections (politely, I believe) on the proposed policy talk page. But the problem goes deeper. The <i>way</i> in which Kelly has forwarded this proposal is emblematic of the thing I and others so dislike about the policy - by placing it in her namespace rather than a wikispace, she is suggesting ownership of the space <i>in which the discussion of the policy is to take place</i>. I think this is why so many people felt that it was inappropriate to designate this as an official proposal as long as it was in her userspace. No one has advocated any kind of censorship - simply the position that if it is in her userspace it should not be considered an official poroposal yet, and if she is ready to make it an offical proposal it should be moved to a Wikipedia space. I suggest that people care about this so much is not because the placement of a tag is such a big deal, but rather it served as a metaphor, a symptom, of the greater issue, to what extent is does wikipedia belong to everyone or just a few. The way Kelly responded to these concerns just confirms the validity of these concerns - she was dismissive of any criticism or request to handle it a little differently. Again, this is the opposite of the wikipedia spirit where no one owns an article or a policy, and people should deal with one another in good faith in order to facilitate the collaborative process of wikipedia. Kelly's actions suggest a disregard for these values. Someone has criticized SlimVirgin for bringing up an IRC conversation, but in fact this IRC conversation once again illustrated the danger in Kelly's approach, because the IRC conversation lacks the ease of access and transparency of a discussion on a talk page. Kelly told me that she had not been keeping the proposal a secret and has been discussing it for nearly amonth. Really? How many people have been participating in this discussion? Where is it? If you look at the talk page of the proposed policy, which is where all this discussion ought to take place, more than half of the discussion is from <i>today</i>, not from the past four weeks. Hardly evidence of a transparent process and a discussion over policy with broad participation. This is the issue, folks, not whether a tag belongs on the page or not, that is just symbolic of the real issue, which is Kelly's disregard for the transparency and participatory and inclusive ideals of the wikicommunity, ideas her very proposal would subvert. As our community grows we increasingly face two challenges, the increased incidence of vandalism and trolls on the one hand, and new efforts to create more bureaucracy and a less open process and concentrated contol in the hands of a few. The former is a real problem, but the latter is not the solution / it is an equally dangerous problem <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 03:24, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Right, so who decides precisely when we stop being transparent. If I work out a policy idea in my head, is that too far? What if I transfer it to paper and solicit ideas from several friends who are Wikipedians, am I going to get my own thread where everyone accuses me of sneaking behind their back? The fact is, it doesn't matter what state the policy/guideline is in, the community can comment and make changes when they get a hold of it. <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShell_Kinney_fd26.html" title="User:Shell Kinney">Shell</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7EShell_Kinney_fbce.html" title="User talk:Shell Kinney">babelfish</a></sup> 04:03, 9 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>SlR, I agree with much of what you say, but I think in this particular case, the proposal draft will have to be proposed on the project page at some point, anyway. At that point, equale participation can commence. We don't have tags for unofficial proposals, so I don't see any harm in it being listed as a proposal. It will __not__ be ratified, however, as policy straight from her userpage and onto the project page (!). It will undergo the same length of discussion on the project page as any other proposal, even if there is an influx of support from those comfortable enough to edit her userspace (and I am not among them). <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 04:24, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Incredible. I would never have guessed that by creating a policy proposal draft in plain sight in my user space, I exhibited "disregard for the transparency and participatory and inclusive ideals of the wikicommunity". I had no idea that drafting proposals in the plain light of day was so subversive. I shall endeavor in the future that I am more careful to ensure that any proposals I might make are drafted entirely in private and discussed solely through backchannels, lest I find myself acting in a manner that does not further transparency, broad participation, or inclusiveness. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 04:18, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Indeed, you are not being shown sufficient good faith. You placed it in the category, which leaves it open to review and editing by interested parties; it appears that you attempted to make changes to the article based on others' feedback, which is in keeping with the wiki spirit. I am fairly confident that, if someone made a productive content-related edit, you would have allowed the edit to stand. Bear in mind, however, that making a claim on something in your userspace that is, in theory, being brought to the notice of the community through the proposed policy/guideline/whatever category was not likely to make many fans; I don't think you meant "stay out of my userspace" quite the way it's being taken, but for various reasons certain segments of the community are not willing to assume as much good faith as one might wish. But really, as long as you're willing to foster discussion on the talk page and consider useful edits to the policy, I think people should just chill a little. I also hope that you were being sarcastic about moving proposal drafts off-wiki; that would be a sad end to this little tale. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 07:33, 9 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>AGF is not suicide.

<dd>So, wait a moment. You're telling me that there are people who hold some belief that I have some unique, unexplained ability to change policy, perhaps via some sort of eldritch superpower?

<dd>Wasn't that, essentially, the crux of the allegations at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Kelly_Martin2_5709.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Kelly Martin2">the recent images-related RfC</a>? That particular incident, I think, illustrates the effects of (and, for some, a source of) that particular fear of unilateralist action. In that particular case you formulated a policy and acted on it, claiming (and receiving) support from discussions at Wikimania. It was at least perceived as a unilateralist action. You explained why that wasn't necessarily the case, but that central lack of congruence in editing styles- "edit first, form consensus later" versus "form consensus first, edit later" - is, in my opinion, one of the reasons for the suspicion and interference in this case. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 21:12, 9 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The recent RfC regarding fair use abuse was the result of a combination of people who don't understand how policy is made on Wikipedia, people who dislike (or even fear) me personally, people who like to throw rocks at admins for doing what admins do, and people who just like a good fight. In any case, in that instance I was purportedly criticized for acting without consensus. In this instance, I am being criticized for attempting to build consensus. If people are going to criticize me whatever I do, I may as well do whatever I want and simply ignore the criticism, which in this instance seems even more baseless than it was on the fair use abuse RfC; at least there there were some vaguely credible complaints regarding civility. Here it's just a blatant display of the assumption of bad faith on the part of a small but vocal group who seem to be in abject fear of my purported extraordinary power to alter policy on the English Wikipedia. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 07:08, 10 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Kelly, I tried to stay out of that RfC and I thought your policy suggestion was a good one. However your attempted method of constructing the tightened fair use policy was unilateral and unnecessarily divisive. Furthermore, many established editors expressed concern over that behavior and it is unreasonable to dismiss them all as "combination of people who don't understand how policy is made on Wikipedia, people who dislike (or even fear) me personally, people who like to throw rocks at admins for doing what admins do, and people who just like a good fight". And while I do see the concern here to be at best a minor policy issue, the users who have pointed out that this is symptomatic of a larger problem may be correct. In general if you approached things in a more diplomatic way we might get a lot more accomplished without these long, drawn out dramas. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 07:13, 10 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Dude, you don't get it. I could be more diplomatic, yes, but then I'd be far less effective. I'm actually very effective in accomplishing what I want to accomplish. Yes, it's true, typically any effort on my part to accomplish anything is surrounded by a huge mass of drama. None of that has any impact on my effectiveness, though, and it's not even really a disincentive for me. I personally actually find the drama rather amusing, and I think it's beneficial for Wikipedia in the long run, too, because it exposes the drama queens to the community so that the rest of us know who not to trust. I'm apparently being stalked by dozens of editors who apparently have nothing better to do but look for things to go after me for -- and they will come up with things to go after me for no matter how diplomatically I do it. It's certainly not reasonable to require an editor to stop editing simply because other editors are stalking him or her, looking for opportunities to create drama. Seriously, do you really think I'm at fault here simply because I created a policy proposal draft in my user space? <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 07:38, 10 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You'd first have to <i>try</i> being diplomatic, or else I think it's hardly credible for you to so confidently proclaim how successful being undiplomatic is working out. Thus, drama is a double-edged sword that may indeed follow from that approach. But, as for finding drama beneficial: we are here to write an encyclopedia, not to agitate, expose, be amused by, etc., real or imagined drama queens. Which is why it is important to communicate in straight forward and clear manner, with a helpful, friendly tone. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 04:40, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(after edit conflict) It is perfectly valid to create a draft of a proposal for a policy under user space and I don't see any benefit in pressing Kelly to do it off wiki. Some concerns this draft may rise is it's inclusion into <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_proposals_58de.html" title="Category:Wikipedia proposals">Category:Wikipedia proposals</a> due to the template tag. Maybe the proposal tag could be substed and then the cat inclusion disarmed. Or we might change <a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProposal_1286.html" title="Template:Proposal">template:proposal</a> in such a way that it doesn't add pages to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_proposals_58de.html" title="Category:Wikipedia proposals">Category:Wikipedia proposals</a> if they are in userspace (can be done with <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/ParserFunctions" class="extiw" title="m:ParserFunctions">m:ParserFunctions</a>).

<dd>I have mixed feelings about the proposal itself (see positive and negative aspects), but I don't see any harm in 'where it currently resides'. Always seemed kind of a weak issue even on the 'article space shortcuts' and 'userboxes in template space' debates to me. Does it really matter what it says to the left of the colon in the page title? If/when the proposal 'goes active' for community discussion we can discuss. Until then it's a proposal in progress and arguing over whether it should have to wait until 'left of the colon' says 'Wikipedia' before having the proposal template on it seems like quibbling over the minutiae IMO. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 22:32, 9 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>There is no lynch mob. There is simply a few editors who believe that the "proposed policy" tag should be added only after the proposer has worked it through enough to his/her satisfaction that it could be moved from the proposer´s user page to a wikipedia page. That´s all. Some people reject this view as unnecessary - well, okay. But just because we disagree on this doesn´t make one group (or the other) a lynch mob.

<p>The point you are missing here all is that the original author of the article had <b>MONTHS</b> to recreate it with content, at which point no one would have complained. However, he refused to until he got his way with the original article being restored. Indeed he spent those months whining and complaining about admin abuse rather than writing a decent article.

In the interest of full disclosure I happen to generally disagree with the ArbCom decision to ban Dbiv from editing this article for a year. A better solution (imho) would be to have placed him on revert patrol for the article. <i>(<a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetscott_c779.html" title="User talk:Netscott">→</a><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott"><span class="pBody" style="border: 0; color: gray; padding: 0; font-size: 100%;">Netscott</span></a>)</i> 15:37, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Tony Sidaway's comments below. Are adminstrators obliged to enforce every ArbCom decision? Obviously there will be those who will say yes but if in ignoring all rules an editor is benefiting the encyclopedia why should they be penalized?

<p>Since the axe of the Arbitration finding fell I have continued to edit the article, and no-one has actually criticised the substance of my edits. They have all been accepted in the article. I am not going to put edits through a 'filter' of the talk page; such a suggestion is an insult given that I wrote most of what's there in the article at the moment, and it's also pointless given the fact that no-one outside the Arbitration Committee seems to believe I will actually be disruptive. (The Arbitration Committee itself has refused to offer any true explanation of the article ban, however). Even if they do believe that I might be disruptive, then there are mechanisms in place which allow control - article-specific probation, or even general probation - which I would be quite willing to accept. If such a change was made then I would consider the article ban repudiated and return to contributing to Wikipedia generally. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 16:33, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The minor difference would be that I for example would use as a filter *.* aka, everything he suggests is added, unless it is uncivil or something like that.

As for the page ban, I actually disagree with the ArbCom on that, just as various other editors.

<dd>It seems to me that it would be better for the project if Dbiv would restrain himself until and unless the arbcom ruling is changed/amended/etc. It's possible that the article may be improved by his edits, but it's very harmful to the community when our last-and-final-resort dispute-resolution mechanism has its remedies ignored in this fashion. IAR has its place and it's very important, but I believe that Arbcom should have its rulings honoured while they stand.

<dd>I am. Dbiv was barred from the article for disruption, edit-warring and misusing admin tools. He has a pattern of edit-warring alongside his many useful contributions. Given Dbiv's propensity to edit-war, ArbCom had little choice than to limit his ability to do so. In continuing to make constructive edits to the article Dbiv is just a much interested in playing games with the community as he is in improving the article.

<dd>(Reindent): I don't think that admins (or anyone) should ignore ArbCom decisions because they think that they are wrong, counterproductive, ... They are supposed to be binding decisions, and the only way to go against them (except emergencies, which this isn't) is to appeal (at ArbCom or with Jimbo). If you disregard ArbCom decisions, then you loose all authority, both as an admin and the authority from ArbCom. In this case, the user has every ooportunity to make edits to other articles, <i>and</i> a good solution has been given to let him make indiret contributions to this article. That he disregards this shows a thorough disrespect for the decision taken by ArbCom and does not give the impression that he accepts that he was wrong earlier. That some admins are willing to support him in this against this ArbCom decision is beyond me, and is in a way much more serious than the behaviour of one editor. If you can't live with the policies of Wikipedia, if you can't accept the few binding decisions taken, and if you disregard them in such a blatant way, it makes me wonder how you can still be at the same time an administrator. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 18:42, 9 September 2006 (UTC)

<p><a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">User:Dbiv</a>'s rejection of Wikipedia's dispute resolution process is the cause of his problems.

<li>This is only the case if we accept the proposition that Arbcom is always right. Frankly, I think Arbcom fumbled this one badly. Its charter doesn't include content disputes but it ruled as though it did. It <i>isn't</i> a necessary evil. No one disagrees with the quality of the edits–my reinstatement stood, and with good reason. When you ban Dbiv from Peter Tatchell you don't punish him, you punish the article. If Dbiv needs punishing ban him, desysop him, burn his house down, whatever. But if he's still a contributor in good standing, it's nonsensical to ban him outright from an article. What about article probation? One-revert rule? No, Arbcom fumbled and would do us all a service by admitting the mistake and taking the necessary steps to correct it. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 19:46, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>In the sense of a community decision I propose we try to establish a consensus regarding what we <i>think</i> would be the best solution for the project relative to this issue of <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">User:Dbiv</a> editing the <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Tatchell_6e4b.html" title="Peter Tatchell">Peter Tatchell</a> article.

I admit that I don't know if there is any sort of <i>process</i> to allow for this but as I'm seeing a decent number of respectable editors having reservations about the current ArbCom remedy it seems like at least the <i>possibility</i> of another remedy should be entertained.

<dd>A solution has been presented to Dbiv (placing his comments/edits on the talk page). I can't see how sending the message that while all channels have been used and the final, binding decision was that he should not edit the article, he can now come and do that anyway, since he has useful points to make... The solution that he rejects is one that makes it possible for him to contribute and for the encyclopedia to use his contributions, while not ignoring the past and decisions that have been taken becausee of his actions. I can't see how that is unacceptable as a compromise, and if he is not willing to compromise in any way (which is the impression this gives), then I don't see why we (i.e. the community) should just give in and let him have his way. A compromise must come from both sides. If the proposal by Netscott is supported, then the consensus will at least not have my agreement. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 20:33, 9 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ok, I should have made this clear. So far I've not seen much in the way of disagreement that Dbiv's editing on the article was <i>negative</i> per se (negative in the sense that he contravened ArbCom's ruling, surely).

<p>This is a classic case of <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>, in its proper and pure sense - ignore rules that get in the way of improving the encyclopedia (which is why we are here, dammit - or at least should be the reason we are here: <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a> an exercise in democracy, a justice system, a bizarre form of nomic, or a thousand and one other things - it is an project to build an encyclopedia).</p>
<p>Without exploring the reasons why, the active members of the ArbCom (blessings be upon them) have banned him from editing the article. Fair enough. If he edits the article, he could face punitive sanctions. However, so long as he is making bona-fide edits to improve the article (and all observers agree, as far as I can see, that this is the case here) then there is no need to punish him for breaching the ArbCom ruling. It is simply bizarre that positive improvements should be reverted as a result of an ArbCom ruling. If someone - anyone - thinks that his edits cease to be improvements, he should be sanctioned.

<li>It is not our place to overrule ArbCom. I think ArbCom and Jimbo are the outer limits of IAR, and we step beyond them at our peril. It's one thing to make suggestions that Arbcom change their decision or appeal to Jimbo, and quite another to ignore their decisions. We have ArbCom and Jimbo, we admit that they may not always be right, but as a basis of editing on the site, we should accept them as having authority on these matters. People who don't like that and won't live with it (or successfully get them to change their mind) can fork. --<a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImprov_b282.html" title="User:Improv">Improv</a> 22:18, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Of course, there are bad faith nominations in AfD every day and so the Wikipedia world turns. But there was something in the viciousness of the language which I believe requires action from administrators and this has not been the case so far (for all I know). I'd like to add that I was not alone in my disgust at reading this debate and another editor in fact sent me a sympathy note on my talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Pascal.Tesson&amp;curid=4968072&amp;diff=74808268&amp;oldid=74716968" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Pascal.Tesson&amp;curid=4968072&amp;diff=74808268&amp;oldid=74716968" rel="nofollow">[32]</a> and I would be surprised if we were the only two editors to react in this way. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 00:37, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>This is a clear case of bad faith agenda pushing, as well as demonising and skewing the facts to get the result wanted. Even if the article doesn't meet notability, as some of the more coherent delete nominations have said, the problem still lies on the fact that the AFD began in bad faith and should be speedily kept as such. A second AFD can take place after that in good faith, but this current one is based on POV pushing, slander and sock puppets. –– <b><a href="../../../l/i/d/User%7ELid_b8c5.html" title="User:Lid">Lid</a></b><sup><small>(<a href="../../../l/i/d/User_talk%7ELid_6320.html" title="User talk:Lid">Talk</a>)</small></sup> 02:05, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>1. I am filing a complaint against Bertilvidet for reverting contributions to the above article on 9/9/06 without any respect to the content matter or the quality of a contribution by another party on the same day, but only on the basis of his egotistic territorialism. He, as a non-national antagonist, continously practices similar behaviour on a number of Turkey and Turkish related articles, related to Turkish institutions, both military and non-military, enforcing his political opinions with ethnic and cultural bias with the purpose of degradation. Attempts to restore objectivity and fair and valuable knowledge content in the articles that are majorly distorted with his political commentaries have repeatedly been a failure because of his unexplainable obsessive reversals of the content matter as well as his solitacion of performing the same vandalism on his behalf by some other cooperating buddies such as the user Khoikhoi. A smilar and serious prevention on their part of the improvement of the content matter took place on August 18, 2006 at the article National Security Council (Turkey), violating Wikipedia rules enforcing no reversal by the same administrator recurrently, in addition to not allowing any other party to contribute to those article s in a fair way. They did not only fail to recognize the contibutions in good faith but collectively called fair changes 'vandalism' to maintain their hegemony. I sincerely hope you will be able to prevent them continuing with this kind of disruptive behaviour.Thank you for your time and support in advance</p>
<p>2. I am filing a complaint against the administrator / contibutor named Khoikhoi for vandalising links at the article "Turkey" in a recurrent and disruptive manner, ruling out comments and requests given to him as "trolling" and "rant", also deleting them along with the links that he vandalisez. He is assisted in his activities by Bertilvidet. Please see the Turkey article and its talk history for details. The request I make from you is identical to the immediately one above.

<dd>Yes, as it says at the top of the page, this is the right page to place an informal complaint. After reviewing the pages in question my guess is that specifically you are objecting to reversions like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=National_Security_Council_%28Turkey%29&amp;diff=70551057&amp;oldid=70514114" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=National_Security_Council_%28Turkey%29&amp;diff=70551057&amp;oldid=70514114" rel="nofollow">this</a> being called 'reversion of vandalism' and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Turkey&amp;diff=74744907&amp;oldid=74731255" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Turkey&amp;diff=74744907&amp;oldid=74731255" rel="nofollow">this</a> being called 'reversion of commercial link spamming'... complete with accompanying warnings on user talk pages. I would have to agree that both of those instances seem like content / NPOV disputes rather than anything close to vandalism or spamming. The 'vandalism' claim seems to be founded on 'blanking of material', but I do not believe that was ever meant to apply to situations where someone removes some materials and adds others in a clearly 'good faith' attempt to make improvements (from their perspective) to the encyclopedia. I <i>would</i> have some NPOV concerns with the text that was being reverted, but NPOV disputes are explicitly <b>not</b> vandalism and ought to be discussed on the article talk pages... where I see little or no commentary on these issues. However, in like kind <i>their</i> actions are not 'vandalism' either. People on both sides of these disputes should stop reverting and start discussing. Use the article talk pages. Use edit summaries <i>other</i> than blank, 'rv', or the 'rollback' text. Basic communication and good faith efforts to resolve disagreements... rather than edit warring and accusations based on mis-application of policy. I may have missed something, for instance you specifically said to review <a href="../../../t/u/r/Talk%7ETurkey_3c00.html" title="Talk:Turkey">Talk:Turkey</a> but when I did so I could find nothing on this subject of link removal (though I did notice Bertilvidet calling someone "Crazy boy" and then 'warning' <i>them</i> about civility and personal attacks)... but overall it seems that there have not been any significant efforts to <i>discuss</i> these disagreements. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 12:49, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Heh, good point. But, as most users here speak English as a first or second language, we should probably disallow names that are offensive to English speakers, even if unintentionally. For example, there were a slew of usernames a few weeks ago that were obviously offensive, but the owner claimed that they meant legitimate things in other languages.

<dd>Personally, I think many admins / policymakers around here get <i>way</i> too fussy and prissy with "offensive name" rules (despite the fact that "Wikipedia is not censored for minors"). Does it <i>really</i> matter so much that somebody picks a name that pisses off some easily-offended prude? Even worse is when people who aren't offended themselves still take it onto themselves to be offended on behalf of hypothetical other people for whom the name might arguably be a slur or obscenity. This is speaking as a person so boring I almost always use my first initial and last name as username / handle on practically all sites, including this one... but I still have a "live and let live" attitude over others' handles. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan T.*</a> 18:27, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I ask yet again to have LGagnon permanently blocked for incivility and a disgraceful failure to assume good faith.</p>
<p>When I correct his teeming logical fallacies, not to mention his appalling grammar, disgraceful typos and related stylistic infelicities, he resorts to accusations of personal attack. The attack is about the low quality of what he has to say, and how he says it, not about him.</p>
<p>He has been just as foul in referring to Admins as "vandal coddling." Yet no action is taken against him.</p>
<p><br />
Most bizarre of all, I am repeatedly told that "under no circumstance does another editor's behavior excuse repeated incivility of your own." Has LGagnon, who repeatedly achieves blocks against me, ever been told -- even once --: "No matter how uncivil AOluwatoyin is to you, under no circumstances does that excuse repeated incivility to AOluwatoyin"?</p>

<li>If as I noticed 3 different admins block you for the same thing, you might want to rethink your behavior. By the way, none of them were LGagnon.

<p>(originally posted on enwiki mailing list, where it was suggested I place it here)</p>
<p>About a week ago, <a href="../../../j/h/u/User%7EJHunterJ_08ee.html" title="User:JHunterJ">User:JHunterJ</a> revised <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28disambiguation_pages%29_cc35.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (disambiguation pages)">Wikipedia:Manual of Style (disambiguation pages)</a> and then began making sitewide changes to articles on human names based on his revisions:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"People who happen to have the same given name should not be listed on a disambiguation page for that name unless they happen to be very frequently referred to simply by the given name (e.g., Beyoncé, Regis). If the name is uncommon enough for such a list to be maintainable (and if it would otherwise meet the WP:LIST guidelines), consider creating the page List of people named Title instead."</dd>
</dl>
<p>I have found that a few name pages I monitor with lists of people by name are magnets for occasional vanity additions, and more common names will have very long lists. However, such lists seem useful and interesting for causal readers, so I'm wondering what people think about balancing utility (especially for causal readers) and page size? Right now the lists are being removed entirely instead of being moved to List of people named___. This has led to protests by some editors, and he's only part way into the A names (actually, I just checked and he's now into B names).</p>
<p>My concern is that a lot of information is being removed when he implements these changes. Sometimes he's adding {{Lookfrom}}, sometimes not, but many of the articles with lists had explanatory information, not just a list. At the very least, I'd like to see that information moved to another page rather than deleted outright. I have asked him to hold off until a few more people had a chance to weigh in, but he has decided to continue.

<dd>Just a note, my revision to <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOSDAB_2469.html" title="WP:MOSDAB">WP:MOSDAB</a> made it less restrictive, not more. My edits since then were indicated by previous guideline as well (most lists of people by given name include more than just those people who are referred to only by that name). The disambigs are much less messy now, particularly when the word refers to more than just a given name, but suspending with the change to MOSDAB. -- <a href="../../../j/h/u/User%7EJHunterJ_08ee.html" title="User:JHunterJ">JHunterJ</a> 00:40, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is a fundamental problem with names and disambiguation pages. A disambiguation page is a navigational aid. Background information on a name's derivation, history, distribution, etc - what <a href="../../../j/o/k/User%7EJokestress_f864.html" title="User:Jokestress">Jokestress</a> calls "explanatory information" - does not belong on a disambiguation page.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The solution, IMO, is for a disambiguation page, <i>Title</i> to link to a separate page <i>Title (name)</i>. <i>Title (name)</i> could contain information about the name's derivation, etc, and if appropriate, a list of people who have that name. Disambiguation is about distinguishing between articles with the same title. The list of people with a particular name is clearly not a list of articles with the same title. <i>Title (name)</i> pages would be outside the scope of <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_78fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation">Wikipedia:Disambiguation</a>, and <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28disambiguation_pages%29_cc35.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (disambiguation pages)">Wikipedia:Manual of Style (disambiguation pages)</a>.</dd>

<dd>All of the above does not apply where more than two people share <i>both</i> the same surname and given name. A disambiguation page is still appropriate, here. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarolGray_46ad.html" title="User:CarolGray">CarolGray</a> 20:12, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Bint_Jbeil_a8a4.html" title="Battle of Bint Jbeil">Battle of Bint Jbeil</a> article has been protected for about a week now (in part due to a request by <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanGerbil10_1003.html" title="User:RyanGerbil10">rbil10</a>). Today, <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanGerbil10_1003.html" title="User:RyanGerbil10">rbil10</a> unprotected the page (without any announcement or discussion saying he had done so), proceeded to make a series of edits, then re-protected the page.

About 2 weeks ago, <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanGerbil10_1003.html" title="User:RyanGerbil10">rbil10</a>, while being involved in an edit war (with me and other editors) on that page, abused his admin priveleges to protect the page after it had been reverted to the version favored by him. I asked him to undo his protection and noted that his actions were a violation of very clear WP policy which forbids admins from protecting pages they have been editing. He refused. I filed a <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> report regarding these actions, and he was warned by at least 2 admins that his actions were inappropriate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:RyanGerbil10/Archive_5#Violation_of_WP_policies_and_abuse_of_admin_tools" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:RyanGerbil10/Archive_5#Violation_of_WP_policies_and_abuse_of_admin_tools" rel="nofollow">[34]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=73879796" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=73879796" rel="nofollow">[35]</a>. he then unprotected the page, declared that he was now an active editor of the page, and promised not to use his admin tools on that page: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ARyanGerbil10&amp;diff=73679118&amp;oldid=73678485" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ARyanGerbil10&amp;diff=73679118&amp;oldid=73678485" rel="nofollow">[36]</a>.

<p>I edited quite on purpose. In the "editing protected pages policy," there is an exception made for spelling and typoes. I simply took it a little bit further and turned a list of bullet points into a paragraph, keeping all of the content and references.

<dd>It's not a big deal at all, but I think you took it too far. It's easy to understand how other editors of that article—who are locked from making even minor changes, and who presumably disagree with you on the content issues—would be upset by what you did. In the future, I'd recommend getting another admin's help for that kind of change after all—or just solving the content dispute before worrying about reformatting. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 05:04, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Fair enough. Honestly, I don't see the page being unprotected anytime soon. Seen as how we <i>are</i> trying to write an encyclopedia, I brushed up the article a little bit since it appears admins will be solely responsible for its content for the foreseeable future, and because the article needed some attention. However, I will ask another admin for any edits to the article as long as it's protected. <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanGerbil10_1003.html" title="User:RyanGerbil10">RyanG</a><font color="green">e</font><a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanGerbil10_1003.html" title="User:RyanGerbil10">rbil10</a><small><a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanGerbil10_836d.html" title="User talk:RyanGerbil10">(Kick 'em in the dishpan!)</a></small> 05:08, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is a content dispute - so not here (although actually I disagree, 'terrorist' is a value judgement not a neutral description, it is thus an inherently unencyclopedic word. No doubt the UN (rightly IMO) would also describe the attacks as 'outrage' 'inhuman' 'offensive' 'criminal' and generally 'a Bad thing' (and who'd disagree) but those aren't words you'd expect to find in an encyclopedic description).--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> 10:16, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

The whole message is priceless and worth a read in its entirety I'd say, but it says "In my free time, I will vandalize and disrupt Wikipedia as much as possible. I'll make minor technical edits that are inaccurate, that your know-it-all admins won't know enough to correct" and threatens to use a "PHP script that uses proxies to automate the vandalism of Wikipedia pages."

<dd>Terryeo acknowledged violating his article ban by posting edits to Scientology articles while logged out. A ban of up to 5 days is permitted under the arbitration decision. I have argued for a shorter ban because he admitted it and most of the edits were minor, but there is a good argument that the evasion was deliberate and and he only admitted it when confronted by a checkuser request (which was withdrawn after he admitted it, so there is no record). Maybe one day off for good behavior? <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131 (talk)</a> 22:13, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In my opinion, all three users (NinjaNubian, Ccson and Bearly541) have been severely misconducting themselves by constantly edit warring, while they should have gone one step further with a RfC instead. As I am just the one user, I cannot open a user conduct RfC on these guys (which I believe was warranted), but I did open a RfC on the content matter.

<p>I'm not sure whether this is an AN/I matter, or just something that should be forgotten. This (now-perma)-banned user has spammed a number of Admins (including me) with unblock requests. (Quoted at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Plautus_satire&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=74273379" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Plautus_satire&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=74273379" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Plautus_satire&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=74273379</a> , although that may technically be a copyright violation.) I didn't participate in the last round, but his (6) edits in this round don't see to me to be a violation of the rules, or even of common sense. On the other hand, it looks as if his actions last time warranted a permanent ban, so I'm not really asking for a review.

<p>Raul654 and Phil Sandifer have blocked me indefinitely after two one-year bans, I have not even edited a single article since the previous ban expired, and already Raul654 has instigated his personal vendetta against me. He is a menace to wikipedia and an overinflated fat toad with way too much free time on his hands. If you are able to, help me reverse this ban, I have done absolutely nothing to deserve it except defend my edits as vigorously as Raul654 and his pals and alts have done. Help make wikipedia a better place by not only reinstating my editing priveleges but also by helping me get Raul654 removed from wikipedia. He is a destructive influence who lets his personal feelings about people cloud his reason and close his eyes. He is a spiteful, wretched man, let's clear him and his kind off wikipedia. Any reply is deeply appreciated. For two years this bonehead has been harassing me on wikipedia and hiding behind his admin status. I know for a fact not every admin on wikipedia is his friend.

<dd>This is starting to get a little obnoxious. Why are you bringing this here instead of to the article's talk page? For that matter, none of the injunctions passed against you recorded in the RFArs you're involved in appear to restrict you from reverting vandalism. You're just required to maintain one identity given a history of bouncing from username to username, and you were desysopped a long time ago.

<dd>I thought you were an administrator.. why the hell would I bring up concerns about vandalism on the talkpage? I was blocked for: a. <b>Reverting vandalism</b>, and b. <b>Adding references.</b> My history of "bouncing" is necessary because incompetent admins who abused their power, violating various policies, tried to enforce their own POV on less powerful users. My desysopping is completely irrelevant, and you know it... or you dont know it, and you shouldnt pretend to.

<p>OK Before you all jump on me "OMG!!!ONE!!11 USE DISPUTE RESOLUTION" there is already a RFC open on this user. I was content to leave it at that. However, the IP is STILL inserting uncited, blatantly POV edits to several pages despite repeat warning. See talk page <a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.35.182.234.html" title="User talk:68.35.182.234">User talk:68.35.182.234</a> for an example.</p>
<p>BTW before I proceed further: apparently the IP is <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDevin79_1ff8.html" title="User:Devin79">User:Devin79</a>.</p>
<p>Now look at the talk page: The IP is ranting on and on about the users he's edit warring with, (and I'm not one of them, for the matter), threatening them, attacking them, etc. It's incredibly uncivil, and I'm sick of reverting his edits. I issued him Test4, but I think due to the severity of his talk page a block is needed.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/User:Devin79" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/User:Devin79" rel="nofollow">RFC for the user</a></p>
<p>The IP has been blocked multiple times for 3rr rule, and is the first user I've ever seen to get a Defamation template posted on their page.</p>
<p>Now the conversation on that talk page is not particularly civil from both Jdorney's or Devin79 end, but here are some of the highlights:</p>
<p>"Not to worry...jdorney will not be with Wikipedia much longer." "I have informed Wikipedia staff about his biased and unprofessional behavior, and have recieved back that Wikipedia will look into it. It is sad that Wikipedia has to be hampered by a few biased, purposely innacurate Editors, who ignore facts and make up their own...just to support their own one sided views." "I will file another complaint with Wikipedia about you, and I will continue to edit this article to ensure that it is professional and not the work of some biased little editor, who is more interested in pushing his own views then he is in the facts." "Either you don't bother to read them, or you read them but ignore them because you are so biased in your beliefs that you only include facts that support them, and in some cases you lie altogether. How in god's name you are allowed to continue to be a Wikipedia editor is beyond me" "Get a hobby And stop wasting people's time with things you know nothing about Jdorney 12:13, 10 June 2006 (UTC)" "This is just plain sad. This guy is so biased and pathetic, that he has to immediately revert ANY facts that he decides are "Not in keeping" with his own, highly biased and anti-Republican point of view."</p>
<p>Note: The page is hard to read but it appears the indented conversations are Jdorney and the left aligned ones are Devin79's.</p>
<p>Now, I think some sort of blocking on the IP is in order, as he's been repeatedly asked not to make POV edits without citing sources, or discussing in talk. I'm specifically referring to <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_Activities_Division_86dc.html" title="Special Activities Division">Special Activities Division</a>, but I haven't really looked into Jdorney's side of the RFC a whole lot. If it were me, I'd suggest 1 week, and if he continues, increase the length by a week each time. Thoughts? <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">⇒</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Swatjester_088b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Swatjester"><small><sup>Ready</sup></small></a> <a href="../../../r/s/t/RSTA_5dcc.html" title="RSTA"><small>Aim</small></a> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_United_States_Armed_Forces_74b7.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject United States Armed Forces"><small><sub>Fire!</sub></small></a> 01:47, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Further, I should note that the Devin79 account was blocked for reverting Bot Image removals repeatedly, and warned about the legal implications of doing so, and then warned against using sockpuppets. There are currently allegations against Devin79 that he is using his IP address to get around the 3RR rule on some page: I don't remember which one since I'm only concerned with the SAD page, but its listed in the RFC I believe. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">⇒</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Swatjester_088b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Swatjester"><small><sup>Ready</sup></small></a> <a href="../../../r/s/t/RSTA_5dcc.html" title="RSTA"><small>Aim</small></a> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_United_States_Armed_Forces_74b7.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject United States Armed Forces"><small><sub>Fire!</sub></small></a> 01:49, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is a section called "The Path to 9/11 controversy which references several articles that should be filed under the film and not under David Cunningham's bio. The writers are using sources that are not verified by David Cunningham, and have many factual errors, such as information from David's The Film Institute. The article leads to others that are also personal opinion rather that objective fact-based journalism.

<dd>I could understand a list of dynamic/shared IPs given to vandalism etc. to help someone periodically review the contribs and take appropriate action. But offhand this seems like a list of people who edit largely Macedonia-related topics, not a list of vandals or anything. Nevertheless I think precident that keeping lists of people, even if your intent is mostly to antagonize by keeping those lists, is not actually against any particular policy. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 14:50, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>I submitted the following for checkuser and result was <i>Declined: "obvious, block away"</i>. Can someone help out with this? Thanks.</p>
<p>L.G. is a frequent hoax article creator for fake radio stations (particularly urban-format in the San Diego area). See examples: KFYT FM (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_KFYT_FM_bb61.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/KFYT FM">AfD discussion</a>), KMBS FM (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_KMBS_FM_7434.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/KMBS FM">AfD discussion</a>), KBIT FM (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_KBIT_FM_357d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/KBIT FM">AfD discussion</a>), and KWLD (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_KWLD_0b44.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/KWLD">AfD discussion</a>). That account has not been active since July 20, 2006. At the same time that L.G. was creating and editing hoax articles, they were also constantly edit cycling station descriptors in the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_urban-format_radio_stations_in_the_United_States_f79f.html" title="List of urban-format radio stations in the United States">List of urban-format radio stations in the United States</a> article as L.G. and as IP 68.8.29.40. A few days ago, Shany2006 arrived and has also acted in exact same manner creating KYMY (a fake station ID) which is now up for AfD as well. Some of their most recent edits to the article attempted to change it to "KWWD" (another non-existent station ID) but without moving the page. Tellingly, the 68.8.29.40 IP just showed up to blank the article (the same thing that occurred last time L.G. got slapped down with the 4 AfDs) as you can see in this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=KYMY&amp;diff=75233039&amp;oldid=75230947" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=KYMY&amp;diff=75233039&amp;oldid=75230947" rel="nofollow">diff</a>. I'm including 287radio because of identical edit and content style (even though this time it was creation of an actual radio station in FL and has not gotten involved in hoaxing yet). I believe these sockpuppets (all originating from 68.8.29.40) need to be dealt with so as not to have their constant hoax radio station articles poisoning the site.

After I posted this RFC, he left Wikipedia and hasn't came back. He also failed to respond at the RFC completely. Since this RFC has been running through for 2 and a half months, and a unanimous 23-0 result of my claims at the RFC was supported and no objections at all, I was wondering if it would be worth it to block this account from furthur editing. He has been inactive since I filed the RFC, so I am pondering if he started a new account or was range blocked from editing, and if he did, I see no reason not to indefblock this account for trolling, but I was wondering what others thought. — <span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva"><a href="../../../m/o/e/User_talk%7EMoe_Epsilon_62b6.html" title="User talk:Moe Epsilon"><font color="#CD2626">Moe Epsilon</font></a></span> 20:44 September 12 '06</p>

<dd>No set "straw poll" or discussion was brought upon to see if an indefblock was in order. Many users though, have stated on my talk page or through relevant comments, that an indefblock was probably best. The user has similar edits as the indefblocked user - Friend of Ed (which has a string of vandalism regarding some topics similar with F.O.E.). Not really sure if there would be a benefit to blocking the account since he has left, it was just a thought that occured to me since it was suggested before. Personally, I would prefer if the account was active before blocking, but I wanted others opinions. — <span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva"><a href="../../../m/o/e/User_talk%7EMoe_Epsilon_62b6.html" title="User talk:Moe Epsilon"><font color="#CD2626">Moe Epsilon</font></a></span> 21:01 September 12 '06</dd>

<li>User:Bonito e Gostoso recently appeared out of nowhere in the middle of the ongoing content dispute at Howard Moscoe.

I bring this here either for action on the Sock issue, or simply because I'm at the 3RR limit, so I can't continue removing his nonsense, if anyone could jump in, that'd be great. -- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChabuk_81ec.html" title="User:Chabuk">Chabuk</a> 20:44, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I hate to bother you with something this stupid, but if it makes you feel any better, you won't be the only one to have been bothered by it.</p>
<p>User:Fireitup has an article on a local radio show that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Dante_and_The_Brick" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Dante_and_The_Brick" rel="nofollow">just got an AfD</a>. No big deal, happens every day. Fireitup proceeds to spam the living daylights out of the AfD discussion, and then suddenly User:24.147.18.43 shows up and begins making edits such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Dante_and_The_Brick&amp;diff=75388100&amp;oldid=75387724" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Dante_and_The_Brick&amp;diff=75388100&amp;oldid=75387724" rel="nofollow">this</a> but otherwise most of this user's edits are very much in the style of Fireitup. Suggest that handing out blocks will reduce the wildly absurd amount of spam in this trivial discussion.

<ul>
<li><b>Jersyko</b> is self-opinionated and displays arrogance, audacity, a superior sense of entitlement, as <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVary_c05b.html" title="User:Vary">Vary</a>, and a sense of invulnerability and untouchability in Wikipedia.</li>
<li><b>Jersyko</b> has a deep-seated contempt of other users, especially new users, in contrast to his or her professed compassion for Wikipedia.</li>
<li><b>Jersyko</b> is a control freak, as user <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVary_c05b.html" title="User:Vary">Vary</a>, and has a compulsive need to control everyone and everything you say, do, think and believe; for example, will launch an immediate attack attempting to restrict what you are permitted to say if you start editing knowledgeably about a topic they oppose - but aggressively maintain the right to edit (usually unknowledgeably) about anything they choose if it becomes a personal issue against the new user.</li>
<li><b>Jersyko</b> and user <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVary_c05b.html" title="User:Vary">Vary</a> despise anyone, especially a new user, who enables another to see through their deception or mask of sanity, such as new user <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoodro_8931.html" title="User:Boodro">Boodro</a> has done. Jersyko has falsely accused this user of <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sockpuppetry.html" title="Sockpuppetry">Sockpuppetry</a>.</li>
<li><b>Jersyko</b> displays a compulsive need to criticise whilst simultaneously refusing to value, praise and acknowledge others, their achievements, or their existence.</li>
<li><b>Jersyko</b> shows a lack of joined-up thinking with textual conversation that doesn't flow and arguments that don't hold water.</li>
<li><b>Jersyko</b> flits from topic to topic so that you come away feeling you can't get through to him.</li>
<li><b>Jersyko</b> is, perhaps, a loner with few friends and needs a forum like this to bully others as an anon. <a href="../../../r/e/n/User%7EReneec_9c3d.html" title="User:Reneec">Reneec</a> made that option more attractive to him as he's removed anything that might clue the new user to his identity. See <a href="../../../s/c/z/User_talk%7ESCZenz_5641.html" title="User talk:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> page Official Songs of Memphis Tennessee.</li>
<li><b>Jersyko</b> is beguiling and is always plausible and convincing when peers, cronies, superiors or others are present allowing him to deceive as well as to cover for lack of empathy.</li>
<li><b>Jersyko</b> is glib, shallow and superficial with plenty of fine text and lots of form - but no substance.</li>
<li><b>Jersyko</b> will attempt to outmanoeuvre new users in verbal textual interaction, especially at times of conflict, giving him the opportunity to belittle, undermine, denigrate and discredit anyone who calls, attempts to call, or might call him to account on a matter.</li>
<li><b>Jersyko</b> is arrogant, haughty, high-handed, and a know-all.</li>
<li><b>Jersyko</b> appears to gain gratification from denying new users what they are entitled to upon verifiable entry.</li>
<li><b>Jersyko</b> often has an overwhelming, unhealthy and narcissistic attention-seeking need to portray himself as a wonderful, kind, caring and compassionate person in his user talk, in contrast to his behaviour and treatment of new users; Jersyko sees nothing wrong with his behavior and chooses to remain oblivious to the discrepancy between how he likes to be seen and how he is seen by new users.</li>
<li><b>Jersko</b> is mean-spirited to new users, officious, and often unbelievably petty.</li>
<li><b>Jersyko</b> often misses the semantic meaning of language, misinterprets what is said, sometimes wrongly thinking that comments of a satirical, ironic or general negative nature apply to him, as <a href="../../../r/e/n/User%7EReneec_9c3d.html" title="User:Reneec">Reneec</a> had attempted to demonstrate with an isolated fact separated from the whole in the <i>song</i> matter.</li>
<li><b>Jersyko</b> has imposed a false reality considering new users <a href="../../../r/e/n/User%7EReneec_9c3d.html" title="User:Reneec">Reneec</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoodro_8931.html" title="User:Boodro">Boodro</a> made up of distortion and fabrication.</li>
<li><b>Jersyko</b> is embittered when challenged, seething with resentment, irritated by others' failure to fulfill his superior sense of entitlement, and fuelled by anger resulting from rejection. Jersyko displays an obsessive, compulsive and self-gratifying urge to displace his uncontrolled textual aggression onto new users whilst exhibiting an apparent lack of insight into his behavior, the issues at hand, and its effect. Is it possible that jealousy and envy motivate Jersyko to identify a competent and popular individual David Saks, and a verifiable issue Official Songs of Memphis, which is then controlled and subjugated through projection of Jersyko's own inadequacy and incompetence in this forum ?</li>
<li><b>Jersyko</b> distorts, twists, concocts and fabricates criticisms and allegations, and abuses the disciplinary procedures - again, for control and subjugation, not for performance enhancement, and uses gossip and back-stabbing to spread rumours that undermine, discredit and isolate the truth.</li>
<li><b>Jersyko</b> wraps himself in a flag of Wiki-cronyism and usurps others' objectives, thereby nurturing compliance, reverence, deference, endorsement and obeisance; however, such veneration and allegiance is divisive, being a corruption for personal power which exhibits itself through the establishment of a clique, coterie, cabal, faction, or gang of bullies that intimidate new users with verifiable and conclusive objectives. Wikipedia is an assembly of plagiarists that steal other people's work - and the credit for it as well.</li>
<li><b>Jersyko</b> tends to regurgitate what others (especially superiors) say.</li>
<li><b>Jersyko</b>, as <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVary_c05b.html" title="User:Vary">Vary</a>, is adept at appropriating rules, regulations, procedures and Wiki-law to manipulate, control and punish new users regardless of relevance, logic, facts, consequences or verifiable matter when it threatens his need to control, manipulate and punish as it develops into an obsession with the hallmarks of an addiction.</li>
<li>*<b>Jersyko</b> exploits new users allowing him to excel at talentless mediocrity and favours, protects and promotes non-threatening sycophants whilst marginalizing and hindering the advancement of those who challenge him.</li>
<li>I've examined user <b>Jersyko</b>, carefully, and warn newcomers. This individual is insecure and sees others as a threat; the threat seems to comprise a fear of exposure, and borders on paranoia; the individual has a paranoid personality and is a lurker.</li>

<p>I have modified <a href="../../../s/c/h/Template%7ESchools_in_jurisdiction_17c4.html" title="Template:Schools in jurisdiction">Template:Schools in jurisdiction</a> to remove categories for middle and elementary schools because they encourage articles on nonencyclopedic topics.

<dd>Schools are inherently controversial on Wikipedia, so only obvious speedy candidates (like attack pages, no-content pages, or patent nonsense) are speediable. Any school entry on <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion</a> will attest to that.

<dd>If the template is harmful, nominate it for deletion. Do not modify it so that its useless to the end-user (a navigational template with only one link is rather pointless). That's similiar to page blanking, and is bad. If you oppose the existance of any category, then go to CFD. If you oppose the existance of articles, go to AFD. But, disabling navigational template, is incomprehensible. Also, a7 does not apply to schools, and is designed for articles where there's a clear consensus they shouldn't exist. Please do not try to bypass community discussion and consensus, to remove that which you personally dislike. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 02:22, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Comment: Lets' not get off track. Which/what schools are notable is irrelevant to what <a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImprov_b282.html" title="User:Improv">User:Improv</a> did (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Schools_in_jurisdiction&amp;diff=75106982&amp;oldid=48840655" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Schools_in_jurisdiction&amp;diff=75106982&amp;oldid=48840655" rel="nofollow">here</a>). The template, is designed to navigate between the different categories in any given jurisdiction. Improv removed all but one of the links to the categories, essentially disabling the entire purpose of the template. Improv's actions are similiar to page blanking, only worse, as it leaves behind something visible and useless, that our readers see (e.g. if I'm in a high school category, a link back to the high school category, with no other links, makes little sense). Discussions for the template, can proceed at TFD, but dont' belong here. Category inclusion goes to CFD, and school inclusion goes to AFD. General school inclusion issues might go to places like <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_f507.html" title="Wikipedia:Schools">Wikipedia:Schools</a>.

<dd>I've noticed this person around and observed a certain quality to the general pattern of edits that, in the interests of civility, I will describe as often having a certain "<a href="../../../t/h/r/Three_Billy_Goats_Gruff_e5b3.html" title="Three Billy Goats Gruff">under the bridge</a>" quality about them. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 06:02, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>As you can see on my and Pussy Galore's talk pages, I share Metamagician's concern about the user's attitude. But is there anything wrong with removing the speedy tag? The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Raymond_C._Lemme&amp;oldid=75207639" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Raymond_C._Lemme&amp;oldid=75207639" rel="nofollow">notice box</a> says to remove it if you intend to fix it. We should probably change that if it's not the behavior we want. Also, the user did edit the article minutes before the speedy tag, so the claim of being in the middle is plausible. I agree the vague claims and general behavior are an issue, but an actual magazine (albeit an unsavory one) published an article on the guy, so I don't think opposing the speedy is in itself unreasonable. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 06:32, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Cause that would allow the user to just make a new name. As you can see by their talk page, Chairboy instead was looking at Sockpuppetry accusations instead. I find this odd that Chairboy and Nan both were involved in the CB discussion and Chairboy picks a fight with Galore and then Nan lays the block for "trolling", even though Chairboy appeared on Galore's page first with accusations, nice vice versa.

<p>While in principal there is nothing wrong with removing the speedy tag, it started to strike me as odd when this person spent an hour on various talk pages and discussion pages trying to establish he could remove the speedy tag, but after being told he should provide evidence of notability, he dodged the issue and made a vague assertion about the individual and removed it. I had no idea about this other dispute thats going on, but his behaviour here came across to me as someone who was trolling or playing games as I repeatedly requested that he provide this information, and his only response for a long time was to make up some false claim about how he was getting entirely different search results for the same term.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 13:15, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hang on - was it an accusation Chairboy made? It doesn't look like one, it looks like a valid request - If a user has sockpuppets that they <i>used</i> to use, maybe they should make an appreciable effort to be friendly, and declare them. I find it hard to believe she forgot the account names, and even if she has, surely it's not tricky to look at an article's history and note them down? It's only polite. <a href="../../../h/a/w/User%7EHawkerTyphoon_6353.html" title="User:HawkerTyphoon">HawkerTyphoon</a> 13:29, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes it was, Chairboy misquoted WP:SOCK in stating the user was a "malicious sock" because they had edited under multiple accounts before, accounts the users states have always been abandoned before starting a new one. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Pussy_Galore&amp;diff=75151243&amp;oldid=75149496" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Pussy_Galore&amp;diff=75151243&amp;oldid=75149496" rel="nofollow">[54]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Pussy_Galore&amp;diff=75168595&amp;oldid=75168524" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Pussy_Galore&amp;diff=75168595&amp;oldid=75168524" rel="nofollow">[55]</a>. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">User:Zer0faults</a> 13:39, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>(sigh) Once again, I'll ask you to provide a diff of where I accused PG of being a malicious sock.

<dd>Umm we already covered its your own comprehension, hence why you do not understand your own quote ... I am not sure the joke nor the problem. "If you want people stop thinking you cant read english perhaps you should stop admitting your own quotes arent understandable in english." See the jump from a major to be based off a minor. You stated if he didnt want people thinking he was a malicious sock, then he shouldnt have admitted to having been a sock, though actually he admitted no such thing. He admitted to having other accounts in the past. Again let me know if you need me to do that research for you. See you said he admitted to something he in fact did not, see editing under more then onename is different then having edited in the past under a different name, reading comprehension indeed. You can reference WP:SOCK on instances where its ok to edit under multiple accounts at the same time, which was not the case this time. So the user clearly does not fall under the sockpuppet label. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">User:Zer0faults</a> 15:50, 12 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Ah, I think I see the nature of your misunderstanding. In the quote above, I said merely that he had admitted to being a sock puppet. You appear to have misread the sentence and interpreted it as me calling him a malicious sock. That's not correct. I've said that there were things he could do to prevent folks from <b>assuming</b> that he's a malsock, but that's certainly not the same as accusing him, no more than telling a teenager "Remember to obey traffic lights" is accusing him of being a criminal.

<p>To Zer0faults: It wasn't so much that he was having trouble finding it, it was his mannerism indicated that he supposedly had the material but wouldn't share it.He didn't really state why he felt the individual was notable, just that he was notable. After another user grew impatient with his constant dodging, he was again asked to provide this supposed evidence of the individual being notable, and instead he said "You guys can argue, I'm going to go improve the article". Which consisted of a bunch of unverified and highly contested claims. He claimed to have gotten huge amounts of hits on google and blamed the discrepency on "data centers" and wouldn't provide a link to his search on which he got huge amounts of hits even though he was asked for it. If someone puts an article up for deletion and does a search and gets a low amount of hits, yet I do a search and get a huge amount, I'm going to link to it to show the difference. This individual failed to do so, and I see this as just another part of his behaviour where he was playing games.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 21:39, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As far as an indef block goes, that might have been extensive, I was simply posting it here because I viewed his behaviour as suspicious and it truly came across as trolling to me. I never asked for a block, though its possible one might have been in order, as I said I wasn't aware of this individual or his behaviour outside of this incident. I thought it might be appropriate to have an admin or two to see if they saw trolling behaviour there as well, and if so, perhaps look at an appropriate action then (whether it was a block, a warning, etc).--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 22:00, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My apologies, I did not mean to come off as railing against you. If you view the users talk page there have been admins harrassing him since he came out in favor of CB in an admin to admin dispute. The quick jump to an indef ban over this minor situation is illustrated by that. What I am quite annoyed with is a perfectly valid article got deleted in the process, one that I have provided here 4 sources for, one being a hustler article. You can almost argue that a non porn related article in Hustler is worth more then an article in the newspaper, since a newspaper runs thousands of articles and hustler runs only 2-3 non porn ones a month. The worst part of it all is the article will probably remain deleted because if it was undeleted it would show the user had merit in the first place. I cannot attest to "data center" issues. However if you search for this person with the middle initial included, then without it, you will get a larger result list, then there is the peple who simply called him Ray Lemme. Then there is the few that have the middle initial spelled out. So using quotation marks is quite a problem in this case. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">User:Zer0faults</a> 00:19, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>To which he could of stated, but if you go back and read you will see he didn't. Even when asked. It would have solved the issue to simply provide a link to the search. If I ask someone a question several times, and instead of replying, they dodge the question, make vague claims, or otherwise to muddy the waters, I lose all assumption of good faith, especially when the behaviour continues over a long period of time as it did in this situation. I'm not commenting on the article itself here, but the behaviour of the editor. Also when the only other person around to defend the article was a brand new user who'd made no other edits, you'll forgive me if that doesn't scream sock/meat puppet off the rooftops. If there is a valid article to be had here per WP:BIO, I won't oppose its recreation, however it certainly can't be left in an unreferenced and <a href="../../../w/e/a/WP%7EWEASEL_bba5.html" title="WP:WEASEL">weasel</a> state that it was in before.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 00:56, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can't help with blocking, but I can help keep an eye on him. Sadly, Pnatt is one where we dropped the ball. He had every prospect of becoming a dedicated and detailed editor, despite (or perhaps because of) his OCD, but we didn't find any good ways of communicating with him and steering himtowards the right way of doing things. Instead he got an escalating series of blocks. I came in late and tried to help, but by that stage he was convinced we were all a pack of bastards. In the end, I gave up on him because he won't make any effort to work with others. He's done things like this before, but he's fairly easy to spot because a series of differently named new editors appear to make the same edits on the same articles. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperJumbo_33a0.html" title="User:SuperJumbo">Jumbo</a> 22:30, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>One editor restored <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_Fascism_ff36.html" title="Islamic Fascism">Islamic Fascism</a>, as a text page. It had been a redirect page pointing to <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a>. The restoration included much duplicated text. The editor then proposed a merger from <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a>. There were only a few comments in the current discussion, and no consensus for a merger. Another editor proposed making the page a dismabiguation page. I agreed. We could have just restored it to the original redirect, this seemed like an actual compromise. Now the unhappy editor continues to recreate the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_Fascism_ff36.html" title="Islamic Fascism">Islamic Fascism</a>, page as a text entry, demands another merger vote, and inserts into <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neofascism_and_religion.html" title="Neofascism and religion">Neofascism and religion</a> the false claim that the "Main Page" on discussing Islam and fascism is <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_Fascism_ff36.html" title="Islamic Fascism">Islamic Fascism</a>.

<dd>I agree here (as editor not as admin, obviously). There are, as far as I can see, two separate and distinct concepts here: the history of fascist overtures to Islamic countries pre 1945, and the modern concept of "<a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">islamofascism</a>". To disambiguate the two seems the logical course of action, especially when a third usage, in <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neofascism_and_religion.html" title="Neofascism and religion">neofascism and religion</a>, also presents itself. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 10:17, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>@JzG/Guy, tx for letting me know about this topic being talked about on this page.</p>
<p>The problem is that someone had been removing all references to "Islamic fascism" from the "<a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a>" page, even in contexts where the expression "Islamic fascism" had clearly been used as a synonym of (or at least <i>interchangeable with</i>) what you called on my talk page "the recent concept of islamofascism" (definitely not the pre-1945 stuff).</p>
<p>That is a NPOV problem, which, as far as I can see can not be solved by the technical surgery of declaring that the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a> page is only about a <i>word</i> disconnected from its meaning. As far as I understand guidance on the matter (<a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContent_forking_411e.html" title="Wikipedia:Content forking">Wikipedia:Content forking</a>,...) Wikipedia does not allow to make two separate pages, with differring content, about a same *concept* even if there are two synonyms referring to that same concept.</p>
<p>If there would be agreement to treat 21st century synonyms to "Islamofascism" on the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a> page that page would no longer be a POV fork. There is <i>currently</i> a POV fork in this sense while the page doesn't clarify that if a post-9/11 speaker/author uses both the expressions "Islamofascism" and "Islamic fascism" there is generally no reason to assume these expressions are used to signify something different - or is there any reason to assume that?</p>
<p>As far as I know there's only one Wikipedian opposing to clarify that on the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a> page. Could we join to try and convince <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott">user:Netscott</a> that it is not a good idea to remove all references to "Islamic fascism" from the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a> page, like this user has been doing in the past, e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Islamofascism&amp;diff=69034440&amp;oldid=69026848" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Islamofascism&amp;diff=69034440&amp;oldid=69026848" rel="nofollow">[58]</a>? --<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Schonken_676e.html" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> 11:16, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But this type of content question should be decided on <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a> or <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neofascism_and_religion.html" title="Neofascism and religion">Neofascism and religion</a>, and if editors there agree to a page name change or text content changes, then that is what collaborative editing has produced. The issue on this Administrator notice page is that <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Schonken_676e.html" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> is not willing to carry out this discussion on the pages where all the other editors are editing, and instead keeps recreating a redundant (and POV fork) page, <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_Fascism_ff36.html" title="Islamic Fascism">Islamic Fascism</a>, where 80% of the text is already on the other pages, and declaring all of us have to move over to that page for the discussion. But this page was a redirect, and most of the text had already been moved to <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a> or <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neofascism_and_religion.html" title="Neofascism and religion">Neofascism and religion</a>. These text move and the turning of <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_Fascism_ff36.html" title="Islamic Fascism">Islamic Fascism</a> into a redirect was a compromise produced after a huge, contentious, and lenghty dispute. Even so, these decisions can all be changed through editor discussion and constructive consensus, but that is not what is happening.</dd>
<dd>This is not a merger issue, it is either a page name change issue (which has been repeatedly rejected) or a text content issue (in which <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Schonken_676e.html" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> so far has been unable to convince other editors that certain edits should be retained). So I asked for the page <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_Fascism_ff36.html" title="Islamic Fascism">Islamic Fascism</a> be locked as a disambiguation page, and came here to seek help in getting <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Schonken_676e.html" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> to discuss these issues on <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a> or <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neofascism_and_religion.html" title="Neofascism and religion">Neofascism and religion</a>. This is a question of increasingly disruptive activity that I think is in part due to the fact that, in this case, a page merger mechanism about a redirect page (now a disambiguation page) is not a constructive way to find a consensus among editors for possible changes--and in any case, the merger idea never received any clear support. --<a href="../../../c/b/e/User%7ECberlet_c009.html" title="User:Cberlet">Cberlet</a> 13:18, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>Islamic fascism</i> is best as a disambiguation page, or a redirect of that's not needed.

<p>Everyone should research and discover the truth as recorded in history--not by opinion. According to Wikepedia employee RJensen,the following fact must remain buried: "As a matter of record, when Kennedy was a senator from Massachusetts, he had an opportunity to vote on the 1957 Civil Rights Act pushed by Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson. Instead, he voted to send it to the conservative Senate Judiciary Committee, where it would have been pigeonholed...Kennedy outlined civil rights legislation only after most of the country was behind it and ready for him to act...When Kennedy did act in June 1963 to propose a civil rights bill, it was because the climate of opinion and the political situation forced him to act." The following link is just one of many archives where truth does confirm the truth about Civil Rights leading up to and after 1964.</p>
<p>Remember that the Republicans were the minority party at the time. Nonetheless, H.R.7152 passed the House on Feb. 10, 1964. Of the 420 members who voted, 290 supported the civil rights bill and 130 opposed it.</p>
<p>Republicans favored the bill 138 to 34; Democrats supported it 152-96. <b>Republicans supported it in higher proportions than Democrats</b>. Why would you not say that truth in a true Encyclopedia? Even though those Democrats were Southern segregationists, without Republicans the bill would have failed. Republicans were the other much-needed leg of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</p>
<p><b>Why would you not tell the world that the man who wrote the 1964 civil Rights bill was a REPUBLICAN named Dirksen and after the civil rights bill was passed, Dirksen was asked why he had done it. What could possibly be in it for him given the fact that the African-Americans in his own state had not voted for him? Why should he champion a bill that would be in their interest? Why should he offer himself as a crusader in this cause?</b></p>
<p>Dirksen's reply speaks well for the man, for Republicans and for conservatives like him: "I am involved in mankind, and whatever the skin, we are all included in mankind."</p>
<p>The bill was signed into law by President Johnson on July 2, 1964.</p>
<p>THIS IS FACT. THIS IS HISTORICALLY ACCURATE. Research it before you delete the truth or are you just a bunch of Propagandists.</p>

<p>The information I have added to the webpages is all correct and verifiable. I have provided documentation for what I write, in sharp contrast to AKMask's edits. AKMask doesn't want wikipedia to be neutral. This person has an a pro-Iditarod, pro-musher agenda that he or she only wants the public to know. If wikipedia wants to be held in high regard, it will ban administrators and editors like AKMask who act like dictators to keep facts from being told. I certainly don't deserve to be banned. Here's an example of what I've added and what has been repeatedly deleted by AKMask: (removed due to enormity)</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I don't know all the rules or procedures of Wikipedia, for that I apologize. However I have attempted to edit the page for "The Rockets" with some but not total satisfaction. One of the definitions you have posted reads as follows:</p>
<p>"Crazy Horse (band) — An American rock and roll band which was originally named "The Rockets".</p>
<p>In fact the Crazy Horse band was only one of at least two bands that have used the name the rockets The Detroit band mentioned was probably more well known as "The Rockets" than The crazy horse band was. While Crazy Horse is certainly notable, They used that name for a year or so, The Detroit Rockets used the name for 10+ years. and can still be heard frequently on Detroit FM stations.</p>
<p><br />
The second, as one of your own admins pointed out, was a well known Band from Detroit. They put out 6 albums total, had several songs that charted and were formed by two of the former members of the "Detroit Wheels" Their singer sang for a period with Ted Nugent. They were the opening act for major bands of the period such as Kiss, ZZ Top, amungst many others. They had some but primarily local Detroit sucess with such hits as "Turn Up The Radio", "OH Well", "Takin it back" and others. They deserve more than a "See also, Detroit Wheels" I would be happy to attempt to do them better justice but I'm not sure I would be the best person to do so given my inexperience of WIKI and all the ins and outs, formatting ect. I will probably never find a reply so it may be better to send replies to crider.john@comcast.net</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

I suggest a one month ban from editing any pseudoscience article. The ban can be enforced by any administrator with a 31 hour block. Mccready is <b>encouraged</b> to use the talk pages of these articles to make suggestions about ways to improve the article. Many editors of these articles recognize his knowledge on the topics but can not deal with his insistence on editing the article precisely his way. This includes many editors that share his skeptical view about these topics. The other alternatives are a longer block to try and make him understand the need for consensus editing or an arbitration case. The community needs to act now because these articles are losing good editors out of frustration with having to deal with Mccready. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3APseudoscience&amp;diff=75261995&amp;oldid=75253272" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3APseudoscience&amp;diff=75261995&amp;oldid=75253272" rel="nofollow">[78]</a> I'm encouraging Mccready and the editors of these articles to comment here.

<dd>I've been somewhat involved in the article and while I agree with a fair bit of Mccready is trying to do he has been stubborn and uncivil. However the article that is the focus of this (<a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudoscience.html" title="Pseudoscience">Pseudoscience</a>) as a whole is such a complete mess with so much edit warring that I'm not sure Mccready is any worse than many others.

<dd>Can someone please ask him, if no penalty is laid out, to stop using popups for reverting. Its creating a page where it looks like he is just reverting to revert, there are no edit summaries in most cases stating what he is objecting to, that kind of reverting may bother other users. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">User:Zer0faults</a> 16:22, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There has been a lot of reverting on all the <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudoscience.html" title="Pseudoscience">pseudoscience</a> and related articles for a long time now. Lots of disputed tagging of Category:Psudoscience on various articles, see for example <a href="../../../a/l/t/Category%7EAlternative_medicine_6932.html" title="Category:Alternative medicine">Category:Alternative medicine</a>. This is one of those simmering disputes and I don't think a block of one editor will resolve it.

<dd>That's not the point. It's the question, whether <a href="../../../t/o/o/Wikipedia%7ETools_Navigation_popups_4b08.html" title="Wikipedia:Tools/Navigation popups">popups</a> reverting should be restricted to vandalism reverts, as are admin button reverts. --<a href="../../../p/j/a/User%7EPjacobi_dff5.html" title="User:Pjacobi">Pjacobi</a> 18:23, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I understand. My point is that reverting is generally discouraged except in the case of vandalism (see also <a href="../../../r/e/v/Help%7EReverting_1fd5.html" title="Help:Reverting">Help:Reverting</a>), so the specific case of popups is no different. <a href="../../../e/s/_/WP%7EES_f020.html" title="WP:ES">WP:ES</a> talks about the need for leaving some sort of edit summary that's helpful to other editors. <a href="../../../t/o/o/Wikipedia%7ETools_Navigation_popups_4b08.html" title="Wikipedia:Tools/Navigation popups">Wikipedia:Tools/Navigation_popups</a> describes an option that lets the user be prompted to add an edit summary under <i>popupRevertSummaryPrompt</i>. Mccready's edit history for 11 Sept. 2006 does show a number of reverts using popups, some (not all) of which closely follow discussion on the talk page; edit summaries in such cases would help casual readers understand that you are indeed discusssing. Mccready, if you adjust your monobook.js file you should be able to use popups and leave an informative edit summary, which will improve others' assumption of your good faith. --<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim_Butler_5a6c.html" title="User:Jim Butler">Jim Butler</a><sup>(<a href="../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJim_Butler_4c38.html" title="User talk:Jim Butler">talk</a>)</sup> 19:31, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I agree with this ban - I have tried to reason with Mccready in the past over pseudoscience categorisation and it is not easy to do, but since his previous ban he has not caused any conflict over this particular issue. I hope such a ban will help him to change his attitude to other editors. --<a href="../../../a/p/e/User%7EApers0n_d5e5.html" title="User:Apers0n">apers0n</a> 17:01, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I support the ban too. I had a similar problem with McCready some months ago, and I'm disappointed to see it has continued with other editors. People have been very patient with McCready, and FloNight and Friday have both tried to help him, so I feel we should trust their judgment about how to proceed. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 17:18, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Support.</b> I don't recall any personal run-in with McCready... I only know of him based on his edits, his comments and other people's comments about him. I just took the time to read through all of McCready's talk pages (including the archived ones). I see a lot of complaints lodged against him by a great deal of frustrated editors. I also took a look at his recent edits and took note of when he was recently blocked. In each recent instance of being blocked, McCready was warned against using pop-ups to do mass reverts. Despite these warnings, he went right back to doing mass reverts with the pop-up tool. He was also warned about making personal attacks or as we call them here <i>ad hominem</i>. Yet, McCready ignores these pleadings and continues to insult other editors and push his POV at the expense of civility. There have been many attempts to see if he would change his ways, but each time he disappoints us. I think we are done testing him to see if he will learn. It's time for the rest of us to learn. We can try this 10-day ban, but personally I don't think it's enough. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheDoctorIsIn_634b.html" title="User:TheDoctorIsIn">TheDoctorIsIn</a> 18:34, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Support with the chance for mediation.</b> Wikipedia is a collaborative environment and he has repeatedly decided not to collaborate. You can tell by his edit history that he trolls for places to tag his opinions, mostly by deletions or adding pseudoscience to the category section. I can’t recall anytime he has added to the quality of a topic. The way he uses WP is not constructive and is disruptive to the whole process. I don’t care what he adds or detracts from the topic pseudoscience. That page is nonsense and full of unneeded negativity. A ban from that page by itself would be counterproductive. If he isn’t willing to change his editing, by contributing instead of “trolling and tagging” than I suppose a ban from the site, and not just a topic, would be in order. The admin needs to also make sure there aren’t any sock puppets coming from his IP address.

<dd><b>Strong Support</b> One month. Is that all? His long history of polarizing articles and editors has wasted the time of many good editors.

<dd><b>Support</b>. Mccready is always spot on with his targeted edits and I appreciate the heads-up for a weak spot, but his correction edit is usually just as POV in the opposite direction. His POV is important as it keeps everythng honest, but having to continually revert is disruptive and we can spend days on one sentence to get consensus then Mccready will come back and start it all over again with the same edit. Again the process comes to a stop. As long as his talk page comments remain civil and he is able to avoid ad hominem language, I would apprectiate his help. Maybe this way he can actually develop a rapport with editors that will be constructive. --<a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDematt_b080.html" title="User:Dematt">Dematt</a> 17:32, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Support</b>. I find him to be stubborn, uncivil, uncooperative and a bully. Aside from attacking and stalking editors, he also makes wild claims such as he is the only one in all of Wikipedia who is responsible enough to decide what constitutes a good edit. Another editor frustrated with him said he has an intractable sense of Know-It-All-ism. I can't speak for all of his edits, but on the topics which I edit, I can certainly affirm that he doesn't know it all. None of us do. What he is good at is "wikilawyering" his way out of the many blocks and warnings which he has received in his short time here. I believe that he has insulted and bullied several Wikipedians and Admins to the point where they give up on WP entirely. I have pointed out to him that there are a great deal of editors who are annoyed with him... hoping that realizing this would cause him to reform his ways. It has not. I have gone through the trouble of listing out all of the pop up reverts that he did in one 24-hour period, hoping that laying it out for him would help he realize the havoc he creates. That didn't work apparently. I had also hoped that his 1, 3, and 5 day blocks would help him see the light. Clearly these haven't had any effect on him either. It's high time we send a much stronger message by way of much stonger penalty. A one month block from WP across the board seems entirely warranted here. Call me a bleeding-heart, but I think McCready is still capable of reform. <a href="../../../l/e/v/User%7ELevine2112_645e.html" title="User:Levine2112">Levine2112</a> 17:56, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The block reason was "POV pishing, removal of sourced information", neither of which are objective or valid block reasons. As far as I can ascertain ScienceApologist was simply editing an article on one of those fringe scientists to be more in line with mainstream scientific thought; rather than being "POV-pushing", this appears to me to be more "NPOV-pushing". As for "removal of sourced information", just because something is sourced doesn't automatically mean that it indefinitely merits inclusion in an article. Articles grow too long, they need to be trimmed, or maybe better information can be found ... regardless, removing some information is a natural part of the editing process, and does not appear to me to be a reason why someone should be blocked. <s>Unless there are some objections I would like to go ahead and unblock ScienceApologist, as it appears to me that this block was inappropriate. I would also caution Shell Kinney to use more care in the future with her admin tools rather than simply blocking someone because she disagrees with him.</s> [<i>apparently there's more to this than it first appears</i>] Your thoughts? --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 17:54, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A <a href="../../../r/e/p/Report.html" title="Report">Wikipedia:Personal_attack_intervention_noticeboard#ScienceApologist_.28talk_.E2.80.A2_contribs.29</a> came through the personal attack intervention noticeboard - it wasn't really in the right place, but after a day of looking into the issue it appeared there was a real problem with ScienceApologist pushing a POV on the article, up to and including removed sourced info and even replacing it with negative information from a dubious source. He's continued to edit war insisting on these changes and talk page discussion hasn't done much to help - in addition to incivil edit summaries, gems like <i>Just because something is verifiable does not mean that we must include it</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AEric_Lerner&amp;diff=74951238&amp;oldid=74950864" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AEric_Lerner&amp;diff=74951238&amp;oldid=74950864" rel="nofollow">[80]</a> when presented with information verifying the subject is a working "visting astronomer" at an observatory as opposed to his preferred "went on a visit to" said observatory. Unfortunately, the pattern outlined at the report, noted in the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Elerner_26e8.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Elerner">RfC</a> and evident on the discussion page is that ScienceApologist is after the truth and discarding verifiability in the process. I left a <a href="../../../s/c/i/User_talk%7EScienceApologist_d191.html#Eric_Lerner_2" title="User talk:ScienceApologist">note</a> asking him to stop the behavior - he responded with a straw man on <a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7EShell_Kinney_fbce.html#Personal_attacks" title="User talk:Shell Kinney">my talk</a> and promptly continued his crusade.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So, in short, I've blocked him for 24 hours for tendentious editing, disrupting the article to push a POV and consistently violating <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> on the article. His response was a fairly typical "heavy-handed" admin "ignorant" of the situation.... In any case, block here for review/adjustment/comment.

<dd>You should have put <i>that</i> in the block reason then. As I currently see it, we have some people with strong beliefs on either side of this issue, and they need to meet somewhere in the middle through discussion and consensus. That can't be done if we simply block one side. However, if ScienceApologist is repeatedly reverting back to his preferred version and refuses to discuss, that obviously is an issue, and that should have been in the block reason and if it continues it should go to arbitration. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 18:04, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I completely screwed the pooch on the blocking summary - I'll be more careful with it in the future. In my defense, I was writing this up here before the block was questioned, but that doens't excuse a sloppy summary.

Considering that the filing was made by an established pseudoscience POV pusher, I have to question it's validity. I've reviewed SA's recent edits presented there and though he's been blunt, I see no evidence of "blantant" POV pushing or personal attacks. I consider this block questionable and too late (over 24 hrs after reported at WP:) to be anything other than punitive (blocking is not meant as punishment) and therefore am unblocking him.

<dd>Specifically, the removal of sourced content he disagrees with and the addition of criticism based on a highly dubious <i>comment</i> on a blog entry - note that one of the statements he removed was from the Chicago Tribune of which he says "Chicago Tribune not a decent critical source." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eric_Lerner&amp;diff=64769237&amp;oldid=64767957" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eric_Lerner&amp;diff=64769237&amp;oldid=64767957" rel="nofollow">[81]</a>; you might also note the heading change. If this is pseudoscience, it should be easy to come up with reliable sources to dispute the theories; there shouldn't be any need for underhanded tactics.

<dd>Lerner doesn't look to be a mainstream scientist, I don't see the issue with saying as much. That the person who filed the report has a long history of promoting pseudoscience at the expense of actual science is relevant, particularly when WP processes are misused to gain the upper hand over his opponents in simple content disputes, as his subsequent comments indicate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AEric_Lerner&amp;diff=75275445&amp;oldid=75158406" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AEric_Lerner&amp;diff=75275445&amp;oldid=75158406" rel="nofollow">[84]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AEric_Lerner&amp;diff=75323264&amp;oldid=75300914" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AEric_Lerner&amp;diff=75323264&amp;oldid=75300914" rel="nofollow">[85]</a>. <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 19:17, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're skirting the issue - this isn't about whether or not someone is a mainstream scientist. Again, I ask that you read the information provided. I reviewed the dispute for 24 hours before issuing a warning on the situation - my response had nothing to do with who initiated the report and everything to do with the actual behavior involved. Both parties should be involved in more dispute resolution. Its worth noting that the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Elerner_26e8.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Elerner">RfC</a> I pointed out earlier had several people coming to the same conclusion about ScienceApologist's edits that I did. He pushes a mainstream POV and actively seeks to discredit those he considers fringe - in and of itself, not so much of a problem, but when it leads to constant reverting, removing verified information and being forced to support your opinion with some random comment on a blog, then it becomes an issue. Hopefully everyone involved can work on developing a consensus and remember that verifiability doens't equal truth. <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShell_Kinney_fd26.html" title="User:Shell Kinney">Shell</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7EShell_Kinney_fbce.html" title="User talk:Shell Kinney">babelfish</a></sup> 19:32, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd><a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> says "The task before us is not to describe disputes as though, for example, pseudoscience were on a par with science; rather, the task is to <b>represent the majority (scientific) view as the majority view and the minority (sometimes pseudoscientific) view as the minority view</b>; and, moreover, to explain how scientists have received pseudoscientific theories. This is all in the purview of the task of <i>describing a dispute fairly.</i>" Learner's work is viewed as pseudoscience.

<li>It is irrelevent whether Lerner is a mainstream scientists or not, he still deserves respect and an NPOV write-up.</li>

<p>A few points. First, Iantresman's history is not intrinsically relevant to the matter at hand. If there is a general problem with Ian's behavior an RfC should be filed or some similar behavior attempted. That said, from reading the above, the only thing I can see from SA's behavior that is at all problematic is including a blog entry. Note that in some cases we have considered blogs to be acceptable when they are written by people in the relevant field whose names and associations are clear and publically acknowledge the blogs as their's. While, I don't think the blog in question obviously meets that standard the attempted citation of a source which does not meet <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> hardly seems block worthy. Now as a separate matter-Ian's report- I don't see any strong issues of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attack problems</a>. Ian should bear in mind that <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> applies against Wikipedia editors. Calling the subject of an article a "woo-woo" does not as far as I can see even lead to a <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> problem. The only other issue here might therefore be some minor civility concerns. None of this however is block worthy. Furthermore, the only remaining matter of concern-the blog entry-is not a matter for a personal attack report. If FM is correct that Iantres has a history of these sorts of erroneous reports then I would strongly caution him not to do so again. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 20:20, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Trying to come back from very far afield and all the attempts to twist this around, the block was about completely discarding <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and sustained edit warring over a ridiculously long period of time. I asked very, very nicely for him to stop with the edit warring and was on my way to ask the same of the other major party (who, by the way, I would have blocked too if he wholesale reverted again). To clarify, there's no concern about mainstream POV being the prominent POV in the article. I can't see why ScienceApologist is insisting on a crap source just to get one more criticism in there (at 7, the article is hardly bankrupt of mainstream opinions). I don't understand why he's falling back on original research (his opinion of what a log means) to get a certain turn of phrase he wants. Above all, I'm not sure why this is worth constant edit warring instead of using the dispute resolution process. The aim, admirable - the methods, sloppy. If someone felt it wasn't block worthy, that's fine and why I offered other admins to change it at will but can we please stop pretending there's some moral high ground just because he has good intentions? <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShell_Kinney_fd26.html" title="User:Shell Kinney">Shell</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7EShell_Kinney_fbce.html" title="User talk:Shell Kinney">babelfish</a></sup> 21:22, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>JoshuaZ, I would humbly like to note the context. I agree that a blog-sourced entry by itself is no reason to block a user. This is about bias. To claim that a positive comment sourced to the Chicago Times is "not descent", AND, then to replace it with a negative comment which is either unsourced, or sourced to a blog, is surely more than just an issue of reliable sources.</li>
<li>In this context, of removing positive information (other examples <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eric_Lerner&amp;diff=64705524&amp;oldid=64705387" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eric_Lerner&amp;diff=64705524&amp;oldid=64705387" rel="nofollow">[91]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eric_Lerner&amp;diff=64707249&amp;oldid=64705524" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eric_Lerner&amp;diff=64707249&amp;oldid=64705524" rel="nofollow">[92]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eric_Lerner&amp;diff=64714267&amp;oldid=64714165" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eric_Lerner&amp;diff=64714267&amp;oldid=64714165" rel="nofollow">[93]</a>), to further remove the NASA-verifiable statement that Lerner was a "visiting astronomer" <a href="http://ecolloq.gsfc.nasa.gov/archive/2006-Spring/announce.lerner.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://ecolloq.gsfc.nasa.gov/archive/2006-Spring/announce.lerner.html" rel="nofollow">[94]</a> should be taken how?

<p>Agree with JoshuaZ and FeloniousMonk. Nothing warranting a block. Also I suggest that in the future when you plan to block well established editors that you note it on AN/I for review <b>before you block</b>. This gives the community a chance to provide background information and context before the block. <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFloNight_10cf.html" title="User:FloNight">FloNight</a> 21:58, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Flo, I did talk to other administrators about the issue - in fact, it came up twice in the past 24 hours. Even though other's felt that SAs behavior was getting a bit over the top, I still posted it here for even more opinions. You can look back through this board and see there's only been one other time I've blocked for disruption -- I don't use the tools lightly. I checked and cross-checked; people obviously disagree. It happens sometimes and its why I invite people to recind/change the block if they feel strongly different. Not once have I suggested SA should be reblocked or that FM can't view the situation differently, all I've said is that this was about breaking policies, not some arbitrary reasoning I pulled out of thing air. <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShell_Kinney_fd26.html" title="User:Shell Kinney">Shell</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7EShell_Kinney_fbce.html" title="User talk:Shell Kinney">babelfish</a></sup> 22:35, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Shell, blocking a well established editor with many good edits should be a very last resort. There needs to be wide community support. I'm suggesting that a full discussion with the community that includes the editor needs to occur <b>before the block</b>. Editors decide to leave the project or take prolonged breaks due to controversial blocks. If that happens in this case it will be a great loss to the project. <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFloNight_10cf.html" title="User:FloNight">FloNight</a> 23:20, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Several editors have pointed out a misunderstanding of my comments here, so I wanted to clear it up. I am <b>not</b> defending the block - other administrators felt it wasn't warranted and it was reversed - done deal. The <b>only</b> thing I have a problem with is being accused of blocking because of bias, to gain the upperhand in a content dispute or out of some kind of malice. I also disagree with some editor's interpretation of SA's edits - I don't believe that unsourced edits or original research should be used for the "good" of any article. But again, other administrators felt this wasn't block worthy and reversed it and I have absolutely no problem with that. <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShell_Kinney_fd26.html" title="User:Shell Kinney">Shell</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7EShell_Kinney_fbce.html" title="User talk:Shell Kinney">babelfish</a></sup> 10:09, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This dispute is created by the self-contradictory text of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> in lacking clear and useable definitions for "bias," POV, and NPOV. And in the absence of clear definitions of "bias," POV, and NPOV, packs of editors roam, ripping from Wikipedia whatever cited NPOV their dogma does not like. No administrator should have to justify blocking someone for deleting cited NPOV from a Wikipedia page. The explicit policy text of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> should state that deleting cited NPOV from a page is wrong without replacing that scholar's POV with some clearer, cited, and published statement of another similarly partial scholar. After all, our job here is to "represent all significant views fairly and without bias" against any significant view. The murky and self-contradictory text of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> must be rewritten to support NPOV--which is to "represent all significant views fairly and without bias." --<a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERednblu_9100.html" title="User:Rednblu">Rednblu</a> 22:26, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The self-contradictory text of the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> page supports both of the opposing actions of Shell and SA.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>On the one hand, the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> page requires that: To be NPOV, the <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Lerner_6ec2.html" title="Eric Lerner">Eric Lerner</a> page "must represent all significant views fairly and without bias." Shell supported this wording by preventing the bias against the POV of the cited <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eric_Lerner&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=75281099" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eric_Lerner&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=75281099" rel="nofollow">NASA announcement that SA deleted</a>. SA violated this wording by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eric_Lerner&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=75281099" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eric_Lerner&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=75281099" rel="nofollow">biasing the page by removing</a> the significant POV of the cited NASA announcement and inserting in its place the differing POV of the ESO list of visiting parties and inviters.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>On the other hand, the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> page also contains the wrongly worded statement that "When bias towards one particular point of view can be detected, the article needs to be fixed." SA supported this wording by removing the bias he detected in the NASA announcement and fixing it with the citation to the ESO visitor list. Shell violated this wording by preventing the fix that suited SA's detection of bias.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The underlying difficulty is that no significant portion of the Wikipedia community wants to clarify the definitions for "bias," POV, and NPOV in the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> page. This is like a community not wanting clear and self-consistent definitions for what red, yellow, and green mean on the traffic lights at the intersections; they would rather enforce their own definitions at their own favorite intersections. Consequently in the absence of clear and self-consistent definitions, at any intersection and Wikipedia page where there are extreme POV biases among the editors, there is an on-going power struggle among whoever is there at the time over what red, yellow, green, "bias," POV, and NPOV mean. In the ensuing mêlée, rather than good and clear encyclopedia pages, the results are pages in the unclear, mangled, and POV state of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_anti-semitism.html" title="New anti-semitism">New anti-semitism</a>, ..., .... In these early days, the <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Lerner_6ec2.html" title="Eric Lerner">Eric Lerner</a> page has not grown to the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_anti-semitism.html" title="New anti-semitism">New anti-semitism</a> length yet. But all the necessary power-struggles over the unclear and self-contradictory text in the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> page are there already with enough energy to make it blossom into another sorry page if every POV and bias does its duty under "When bias towards one particular point of view can be detected, the article needs to be fixed," which is the duty to fix the bias that bias detects. For all of the above, reasons, we need to work together to develop clear and self-consistent definitions for "bias," POV, and NPOV in the text of the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> page.

<p>There's a few things I'd like to get straight:</p>
<ol>
<li>Shell Kinney came into this situation very dictatorially and did not discuss her actions civilly with the other editors.</li>
<li>She did not try to ascertain what the conflict was and did no research into the history of the conflict.</li>
<li>She unilaterally blocked me for what she now admits was a different offense than the one in her blocking summary.</li>
<li>She did not follow the procedures outlined on the Wikipedia page that describes what to do if a block is controversial.</li>
<li>She did not get any input from any other editors or administrators before unilaterally blocking.</li>
<li>She did not warn me specifically that I was going to be blocked on my talkpage before she blocked me, despite my explanation on her talkpage regarding the matter.</li>
<li>She has made up false accusations about me (such as that I've been a consistent edit warrior in this article for a year)</li>
<li>Right now it seems that the entire issue is based on anger over a single sourced blog as a poor source? I'm not sure what blog in question we are dealing with, but if it is the preposterous universe blog, this is a well-respected blog by a rather prominent astronomer at the University of Chicago.</li>
</ol>
<p>Furthermore:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is no indication that she looked at talkpage/archives of the affected article.</li>
<li>There is no indication that she looked at the links I made on her talkpage about this conflict.</li>
<li>There is no indication that she considered whether or not this was a content dispute and whether it was appropriate to block over such a dispute.</li>
</ol>
<p>As such, I think that Shell Kinney needs to take a good hard look at her shoot-first-ask-questions-later administration tactics. This does not look to me like the actions of an administrator who is working to defuse conflicts. Right now I'm just about as upset as I was back in the Ed Poor days, and we're still dealing with the fallout of that nonsense nearly one year later. I feel very disrepsected by this Wikipedian.</p>
<p>I would like an apology from Shell Kinney for executing this action without doing the proper legwork or research to justify it. Or at the very least an explanation of the points I outlined above. I hope she understands the gravity of these issues.</p>

<li>I left a very civil message in which I explicitly stated that you might be blocked and pointed you to a list of the exact edits that were a concern.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AScienceApologist&amp;diff=75321240&amp;oldid=75211612" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AScienceApologist&amp;diff=75321240&amp;oldid=75211612" rel="nofollow">[95]</a></li>
<li>There were more than 12 hours from the initial report <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AScienceApologist&amp;diff=75321240&amp;oldid=75211612" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AScienceApologist&amp;diff=75321240&amp;oldid=75211612" rel="nofollow">[96]</a> erroneously filed on <a href="../../../p/a/i/WP%7EPAIN_2701.html" title="WP:PAIN">WP:PAIN</a> and my note on your talk page during which time I researched the dispute.</li>
<li>My fault on the block summary; I was trying to write a better explanation here and should have done better in the block summary. It was not different, just horribly unclear.</li>
<li>I'd like to know which of the points about controversial blocks I failed to follow.</li>
<li>Yes, actually, I talked to administrators about it last night and again this morning.</li>
<li>See answer to #1</li>
<li>You said it had been a year <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AShell_Kinney&amp;diff=75280011&amp;oldid=75274966" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AShell_Kinney&amp;diff=75280011&amp;oldid=75274966" rel="nofollow">[97]</a>. If you were referring to the extended dispute on other articles and not just this one, I apologize for misunderstanding the remark.</li>
<li>This is about the blog, the original research and the edit warring.</li>
</ol>
<p>You did leave me a note and yet 10 minutes later, you blanketly reverted yet again which forced the issue. You rightly pointed out that you were not guilty of personal attacks; I had already made this point when the report was originally made and the note I left you certainly wasn't about personal attacks but the policy problems in some of your changes. I understand where you're trying to get with the article and its an admirable goal. I've mentioned elsewhere that your work keeping junk from becoming respectable by virtue of being listed here is remarkable. However, all the good work in the world doesn't entitle you to take shortcuts - you shouldn't use poor sources, you shouldn't use original research to justify wording changings and edit warring never gets anyone anywhere. If it wasn't block worthy, then it wasn't - that's preceisly why I posted here with the request for other admins to review and change at will.</p>

<p>Since you didn't respond to my points in turn, I'll bullet the list with my response:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your "civil message" was responded by me in turn on your talkpage offering my opinion on the matter. The next correspondence I received from you was a block. No discussion, no attempt to figure out what my editting was about, you just simply blocked me. Warning that a user might be blocked should be accompanied by a reason. The reason you provided was incorrect as you later admitted and it is still nebulous yet as you will say on other points on this list.</li>
<li>Your actions leading up to the block amounted to you making a unilateral decision based on a list of links <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIantresman_3a2c.html" title="User:Iantresman">User:Iantresman</a> provided. If you had asked around about this user, you would have found a number of administrators who would have cautioned you against taking him at face-value. I even referred you to a mediation cabal case to illustrate the point. As far as I can ascertain you did not research this user at all, nor did you look for the context of the edits he wrote down on the wrong page.</li>
<li>You did not engage in discussion with me, nor, it seems, did you do your homework in regards to this conflict. You simply preached and made pronouncements. This is not conduct becoming of an administrator.</li>
<li>Please show me where you talked to administrators about this before the block and where another administrator looked at the controversy and recommended you block me.</li>
<li>The dispute with Iantresman was ongoing for more than a year, but it was not about the <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Lerner_6ec2.html" title="Eric Lerner">Eric Lerner</a> article. Check the links I made on your talkpage for more. This is illustrative of the problems I have with your advocacy. You are not careful in your characterizations of history. It's very easy to check because everything at Wikipedia is logged.</li>
<li>I reiterate that the blog in question is a perfectly legitimate source which you could have read about on the talkpage. The Preposterous Universe is written by a well-respected research astronomer at the University of Chicago. It is not an inappropriate inclusion <i>especially because</i> the scientific community basically ignores Eric otherwise (by his own admission according to a letter he signed).</li>
<li>There is no original research on Eric Lerner's page. Absolutely none. I challenge you to point to some.</li>
<li>If you wanted, I would have gladly provided you with the context for the links that Ian made. With context, none of the edits are evidence of POV-pushing, original research (I have no idea where that came from), nor edit-warring beyond the scope of this particular content dispute (see next bullet point).</li>
<li>For edit warring, there is a strict <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">3RR policy</a> meant to address it as well as dispute resolution processes. You did not refer the conflict to any of these before blocking. I take this to be a punative action then targetted specifically against me.</li>
<li>I believe that "Edit warring" is in this case, strongly in the eye of the beholder. The conflict between myself, <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIantresman_3a2c.html" title="User:Iantresman">User:Iantresman</a> and <a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElerner_3f7c.html" title="User:Elerner">User:Elerner</a> to me is a content dispute and I regard the edits by <a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElerner_3f7c.html" title="User:Elerner">User:Elerner</a> to be in conflict with <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> (an issue totally ignored by you). You'll also note that Iantresman hasn't offered an edit to the article since 19 July.</li>
<li>I see no attempt by you to discuss what the dispute was about on the talkpage of the article in question.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am saddened that you will not offer an apology. This is beginning to remind me a lot of the Ed Poor case.</p>

<dd>Hannes Alfvén is most certainly not the issue. Eric Lerner is the issue. I don't know where exactly El C is getting his sources from, but dark matter is a feature, not a problem to account for in the Big Bang. Most of the PC criticisms stem from the early 1990s (as outlined in the <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-standard_cosmology.html" title="Non-standard cosmology">non-standard cosmology</a> page) before precision measurements, redshift surveys, and supernovae observations honed us in on <a href="../../../%CE%BB/c/d/%CE%9BCDM_4362.html" title="ΛCDM">ΛCDM</a>. But this is hardly the point. Discrediting PC is only done using verifiable, well-cited, and reliable sources.

<dd>DM (cold or otherwise) appears to remain a pretty convinient presuppository <i>feature</i> of the Model, a feature which, since it dosen't interact with anything in the material universe, cannot (yet?) be conclusively proven to exist, but just happens to fit perfectly with HBBM, accounting for the vast majority of mass in the universe.

<p>Why is this thread about content? This is supposed to be about administrator actions on the basis of the information available at the time. Shell's actions were entirely reasonable when s/he had an editor (who it turns out is experienced enough to have known better) casting aside his/her express concerns and plunging on regardless.</p>
<p>As it happens, I <i>entirely agree</i> with ScienceApologist's arguments about why the blogger is worth listening to and why a generalist book review is not a guide to good science. And I can understand that he was heavily engaged in the article and annoyed by being asked to justify his actions. None of which makes it OK to blow off an admin trying to deal with a legitimate concern. If SA had paused in his editing while explaining to Shell: or, better, elucidated the arguments in the article for the benefit of Jo Reader (I follow the blog link and see "Posted by Sean". Great, who he?), we'd all be winners. In fact, maybe the article can still have such an elucidation. So can we all stop yelling and go home now? And have the content dispute on the article talk page? Y'all drive safely, now :-) <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackyR_8980.html" title="User:JackyR">JackyR</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/c/User_talk%7EJackyR_e6f9.html" title="User talk:JackyR">Talk</a> 15:33, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>As the subject of this attack by Science Apologist(Joshua Schroeder), I think I need to comment. I am also requesting that SA not only be blocked from my article, but that the article is again protected in the same version that it was formerly protected...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The issue here is that SA is accusing me of lying and using false information to do it. I was a Visiting Astronomer at ESO in February 2006. I have so stated in several places. Not a big deal, but a fact.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>SA has repeatedly reverted this fact on my wiki entry to state that I was invited by a friend to visit ESO, a completely different thing. If that were true, which someone relying on Wikipedia would believe, then my claiming that I was a Visiting Astronomer is a lie. In science, faking credentials is a particularly bad thing to do. But that is what anyone using Wikipedia will conclude about me, if SA’s edits are allowed to stand.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Of course this is just the most glaring example. As Shell points out, a lot of SA’s edits are extremely biased and, as on many, many other entries, he defends them by having seemingly unlimited time to revert continuously. This includes eliminating the views of James Van Allen, who I assume you all are familiar with.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>SA’s behavior toward me is not exceptional. If you look at his user page he has been involved in a vast number of revert wars, all with the aim of purging Wikipedia of anything he deems unorthodox, including the views of scientists as distinguished as Halton Arp. (If you don’t know who he is, just consult any galactic atlas and see all the galaxies named Arp220 or Arp- some- other- number).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Here is just one random example:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>'Comment by User:DavidRussell'</dd>
</dl>
<p>ScienceApologist consistently deletes any passages that refer to alternative interpretations of redshift. He then falsely claims that the redshift articles which already exist cover concepts that he has in fact deleted in previous attempts.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Another critique of cosmological redshift also came from Halton C. Arp, who continues to find empirical support in the existence of apparently connected objects with very different redshifts. Arp has interpreted these connections to mean that these objects are in fact physically connected. He has further hypothesized that the higher redshift objects are ejected from the lower redshift objects - which are usually active galactic nuclei (AGN)- and that the large observed redshifts of these "ejected" objects is dominated by a non-cosmological (intrinsic) component. Conventional cosmological models regard these as chance alignments and Arp's hypothesis has very few supporters within the research community."</dd>
<dd>ScienceApologist (as Joshua Schroeder) saw fit to delete this passage claiming that it was not NPOV.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>The infuriatingly stubborn and irrational behaviour of Joshua Schroeder is pretty much the principal reason I can't be bothered participating in Wikipedia much these days.</dd>

<dd>A couple of small edits have since been made by admins. I made one of them, on the basis that it was agreed by SA immediately prior to the protection and it helps Elerner's concerns slightly (even though he thinks it doesn't go far enough). I've been trying to help but am feeling my way here - too much admin interference could just inflame the situation. I think they need to find a way forward, whether it's mediation or something else.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I must support SA to this extent: the only thing he seems to have done that could merit any criticism was to describe the controversial appointment without using the words "visiting astronomer". However, he was prepared to compromise about that. I don't really think a block was justified here, but nor is criticism of the admin who did it - this is a volatile situation and we're all just trying our best. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 09:57, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>El_C, you have commented on this article earlier on this page as well, and on the value of the Plasma Model as compared to the Big Bang. You don't come across as having a NPOV here at all, since it is the second time that you feel the need to include references to the supposed "theistic", religious reason the BB is supported. This is a false argument used by opponents of the BB and has nothing to do with its scientific value. While there may be religious people that support the BB because it fits in some interpretation of a creation myth, you can't just use the reverse idea (that the BB is the mainstream theory among scientists <i>because</i> it supposedly supports a creation myth) to put it in a negative light. BB is supported by most scientists because it fits the observations best and beacuse it permits to make the best predictions. The plasma model, on the other hand, is mostly unquantified speculation with some anecdotical evidence. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 09:16, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The 'you don't come across as NPOV' is too reminiscent of the general believe-what-we-do HBBM line. Simply because a model has scientific applications does not mean it is correct. Speaking so confidently about the <i>origin</i> of the universe is scientifically un-humble at this stage of human development. Now, I find it unfortunate that I need to make reminders that the notion of cosmic origin, HBBM or Plasma, should not be treated as a mere casual observation. Sorry to throw a healthy dose of skepticism on both theories, but these "criticisms" (in the article) are potentially quite revealing: <i>So if I get to decide whether to allocate money or jobs to one of the bright graduate students working on some of the many fruitful issues raised by the Big Bang cosmology, or divert it to a crackpot who claims that the Big Bang has no empirical successes, it's an easy choice. Not censorship, just sensible allocation of resources in a finite world.</i> She, herself, would not get her grant money if her position would be any different, is the undeniable reality. I wonder what Nobel Prize recepient, <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hannes_Alfv%C3%A9n_e6a9.html" title="Hannes Alfvén">Hannes Alfvén</a>, would say to that. Denying funds may not be the <a href="../../../i/n/q/Inquisition.html" title="Inquisition">inquisition</a>, but it does seem to be a form of censorship. Now, if significant funds were to be allocated and nothing came of it, that is another matter. But this dosen't seem to be the case. To have powerful forces in society, such as the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic_Church_2beb.html" title="Catholic Church">Catholic Church</a>, officially support the HBBM, that is not a mere aside, nor is the false impression of would-be superhuman, wholly dispassionate and NPOV pro-HBBM scientists. Regardless, that section is remains far too quote-intensive. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 19:41, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for the reply, but that was not my point. It would help the discussion if you would leave out the constant linking of the BB to some theistic purpose or support, and try to discuss and compare the scientific value of both. Otherwise you give the impression of taking sides because of irrelevant side issues, and to make the BB "guilty by association". The claim that BB wins because it gets all the funds is very tired, and the conspiracy theory that it gets all the funds because it is supportive of a creation myth is even worse. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 20:33, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't subscribe to cospiracy theories, I adhere to institutional analysis. The fact is that HBBM proponents express far too much certainty that the model correctly depicts the origin of the universe, which is scientifically un-humble. I, on the other hand, adopt a more cautious but nonetheless critical position, whereby in the future, the HBBM may be deemed a correct basis, or PC will, or some synthesis between the two that will result in a new theory. In pure scientific terms, I'm not taking sides, but it also appears fairly clear to me that the HBBM's upper hand in the debate is not a product of entirely legitimate and purely scientific reasons. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 21:25, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Protecting the "wrong version", while common and normally to be expected, is completely unacceptable on wikipedia articles on living persons. In case of a genuine dispute concerning negative information, stubifying is prefered over a wrong version. Stubifying also fixes the problem of someone causing problems just so positive unchallenged information sits there for long lengths of time. This should not need to go to the living persons bio patrol, as the people involved here should be able to make sure relevant policy is adhered to. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 10:47, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Comment. All the criticism of Lerner is definitely sourced; looking at the talk page, the issue seems to be that Lerner wishes for there to be more praise of him in the article detailing exactly which prestigious institutions he's once spoken at/visited/praised him somehow/etc. I don't think this is reason enough to change the version protected. I'm certain an article on the Piltdown man can be made "balanced" by reciting an equal number of praises of the discovery as well as debunkings of it, but this would not be a true balance since it is recognized as a hoax now. I am not a physicist, so I can't say if plasma physics is true or false. However, if it is generally the consensus among academics that plasma physics, while a reasonable hypothesis in the 60's, is unlikely to be true in light of modern knowledge, it is entirely reasonable to have an "unbalanced" review of his theories. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowFire_df7e.html" title="User:SnowFire">SnowFire</a> 21:58, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plasma_physics.html" title="Plasma physics">plasma physics</a> is not an issue at all. <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plasma_cosmology.html" title="Plasma cosmology">Plasma cosmology</a> is both an issue (is it protoscience or merely formerly protoscience and now better descibed as psuedoscience?) and the general background for the wiki-conflict between <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> and a few others. But my comments referred specifically to the libel issue raised by Eric Lerner concerning the living person bio article <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Lerner_6ec2.html" title="Eric Lerner">Eric Lerner</a> at <a href="../../../e/r/i/Talk%7EEric_Lerner_01ed.html" title="Talk:Eric Lerner">Talk:Eric Lerner</a> as brought up in the initial comment in this subsection. For the future, for all living person bio articles, it should be clear to everyone that stubifying is preferred to freezing a version with significant issues. A threat to one's career expressed by the person defamed, such as for example "the way it is worded makes me out to be a liar in a field where credibility is everything" is a significant issue. In some cases a person might blow a small thing out of proportion to try to get a more positive bio frozen. Freezing a stub instead can create motivation to work towards a compromise in some cases. In this particular case, it looks like a compromise has already been worked out to everyone's satisfaction. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 07:33, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A group of Iranians collectively enforces a policy of censorship and ethnic cleansing, repeatedly removing under nefarious pretexts historical facts, classical citations, and important information from Wikipedia pages. My attempts to resolve the dispute and find a compromize did not succeed see, for example, <a href="../../../o/s/s/Talk%7EOssetic_language_6e87.html" title="Talk:Ossetic language">Talk:Ossetic language</a>. As a result, whole sections of articles were decimated, for example from <a href="../../../s/c/y/Scythia.html" title="Scythia">Scythia</a> were removed published data on C14 tests, section "Kurgans", section "Tamgas", pertinent citations of classical authors, etc. From the <a href="../../../o/s/s/Ossetic_language.html" title="Ossetic language">Ossetic language</a> were removed section on "Lexicon", as though the analysis of lexicon is not related to the language, section "Genetics", as though language does not reflect the composition of the people, etc. This <i>agenda editing</i> is designed to deprive the users of WP from ever knowing alternate views and counter-corroborative facts. In the course of this <i>agenda editing</i> were deleted articles "Scytho-Iranian theory" and "Masguts", voted out of existance by the same group, as conflicting with their racial concepts. Most of the accompaniing "discussions" focus on denigrating the contributors and the sources, many in the most vulgar form, and defamatory proclamations serve as justifications for removing contents and replacing them with proclamations of suppositions. The dispute involves both the wikiquette, contents and blanketing vandalism. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarefact_1f8e.html" title="User:Barefact">Barefact</a> 21:41, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
