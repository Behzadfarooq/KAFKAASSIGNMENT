<p><a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> has been a problematic editor of Scientology-related pages for quite some time now, deleting large portions of articles that are critical of Scientology and replacing them with illogical, poorly-written, non-neutral advertisements for Dianetics and Scientology. Since his edits are quickly reverted by many others, it hasn't been worth complaining about until recently: he has taken up the trolling tactic of attributing insulting statements to other editors that they did not make, especially myself. Today on the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Talk%7ESuppressive_Person_7ceb.html" title="Talk:Suppressive Person">Talk:Suppressive_Person</a> page, he claims I have stated "Scientology is bunk", which I have never said. A few weeks ago he stated on several different talk pages, "Wikipediatrix said 'Dianetics Kills'", which I also never said. There are at least three other incidents where Terryeo has done this, and when pressed on the matter each time, he simply ignores it and changes the subject. This constant lying about me is highly annoying and seems to be to proof of Terryeo's lack of good-faith editing and his desire to simply cause trouble on the Scientology pages, not to mention smear the reputations of editors who dare oppose him. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 17:40, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>One needs to show efforts to resolve the matter before escalating a dispute. If you can give a list of edits where you have attempted to resolve the dispute that would be useful. Then I can approach him too and see if we can't get some communication in progress without everything going apocalyptic - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 00:26, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, it occurs to me he's ignored several people's concerns in this matter. This is the sort of situation an <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">RFC</a> was made for - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 00:29, 4 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't really have the time to wade through the many edits on literally dozens of Scientology articles.... it's not something it occurred to me to keep records of till now. I was really expecting that some Scientology-watching admin would have already noticed his edit-warring which approaches vandalism at times (see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scientology_beliefs_and_practices&amp;diff=34968057&amp;oldid=34964668|" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scientology_beliefs_and_practices&amp;diff=34968057&amp;oldid=34964668|" rel="nofollow">diff on this article</a> where he typically inserts criticism of previous edits and their editors into the text of the article itself!), and his insufferable behavior on talk pages (<a href="../../../s/e/a/Talk%7ESea_Org_28a5.html" title="Talk:Sea Org">Talk:Sea_Org</a> and <a href="../../../c/l/e/Talk%7EClear_%28Scientology%29_5f91.html" title="Talk:Clear (Scientology)">Talk:Clear_(Scientology)</a>, for example). If anyone out there reading these words cares whether or not the many Scientology pages on Wikipedia are censored by Scientologists and turned into blatant POV commercials for Dianetics, I urge them to keep a CLOSE watch on <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> and his edits. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 05:32, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can verify what Wikipediatrix has said about Terryeo's smearing tactics; I've been the victim of them myself. When he resorts to just name-calling (such as the edit he made today where he called me "Beanbrain. Dogfood. Idiot."<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Dianetics:_The_Modern_Science_of_Mental_Health&amp;diff=38106145&amp;oldid=38105172" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Dianetics:_The_Modern_Science_of_Mental_Health&amp;diff=38106145&amp;oldid=38105172" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>) I can just shake it off. But in other cases he has deliberately accused people of things he knew to be false; in one case I remonstrated with him on his talk page for falsely claiming that he'd "caught" editors he disagreed with violating a guideline, <i>after</i> he was already made aware that no one had violated the guideline, only the mistaken interpretation <i>he</i> had of it, which was shown to be mistaken by the examples on the page, which clearly contradicted his assumptions. Terryeo's response to this?

Considering the parties involved looked to be administrators I wasn't confident that protecting it would have any effect...but when I looked at the block record of Netoholic and checked the directives given on enforcing his ArbCom decision I felt he was being disruptive so I decided to enforce the ban regarding 1RR. I didn't block either of the other two because neither party violated 3RR in my opinion.</p>
<p>As Netoholic has contacted me by email and requested that his block be lifted, I welcome comments on this matter here. I will admit I am still somewhat new to my adminship so perhaps my interpretation is wrong, and I wouldn't be opposed to a shortening or lifting of the ban based on comments. I have also offered him an immediate repeal of the ban if he will refrain from the revert war on that template. --<a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 18:04, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There appears to be an incipient <a href="../../../w/h/e/WP%7EWHEEL_fbcc.html" title="WP:WHEEL">wheel war</a> brewing on {{User admins ignoring policy}}. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=delete&amp;user=&amp;page=Template%3AUser+admins+ignoring+policy" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=delete&amp;user=&amp;page=Template%3AUser+admins+ignoring+policy" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> for the status so far. The template was nominated on <a href="../../../t/f/d/WP%7ETFD_eab7.html" title="WP:TFD">WP:TFD</a>, where the usual arguments ensued. Then, about a day after its listing, it was speedy deleted by <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">User:MarkSweep</a> with the summary "<i>trolling</i>". This is not a valid <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">criterion for speedy deletion</a>, and is very ill-defined; in practice, the term is often applied not only to disruption but also to good-faith disagreement. There was no consensus on <a href="../../../t/f/d/WP%7ETFD_eab7.html" title="WP:TFD">WP:TFD</a>, and at least one user asked for the template to be restored so he could see what he was discussing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion/Log/2006_February_2&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=38011338" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion/Log/2006_February_2&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=38011338" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist">User:Karmafist</a> then restored it since the original deletion was out of process and a debate was still ongoing. MarkSweep then deleted it again with this summary: "<i>out-of-process re-creation</i>". This, too, is spurious, since it was the original deletion that was out-of-process, and a discussion was still taking place on <a href="../../../t/f/d/WP%7ETFD_eab7.html" title="WP:TFD">WP:TFD</a>. I am re-creating (from memory, as I lack administrative powers) the userbox at this time. Apparently, the initial userbox contained a link to <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">User:Kelly Martin</a>'s RFC. This has been removed, and replaced with a link to <a href="../../../a/c/c/WP%7EACC_17c6.html" title="WP:ACC">WP:ACC</a>, which cannot possibly be construed as a personal attack against anyone. I strongly urge that the debate on <a href="../../../t/f/d/WP%7ETFD_eab7.html" title="WP:TFD">WP:TFD</a> be allowed to run its course. I have attempted to discuss the issue with MarkSweep on his home page, but have received no response (except an accusation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> on an unrelated TFD nomination). The irony is that by deleting this userbox, Mark is proving the point of his opponents. <tt><a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrotalus_horridus_5cc6.html" title="User:Crotalus horridus">Crotalus horridus</a> <small>(<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECrotalus_horridus_e0ed.html" title="User talk:Crotalus horridus">TALK</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Crotalus_horridus_e95d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Crotalus horridus">CONTRIBS</a>)</small></tt> 20:10, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I restored the history, although my connection is a bit dodgy at the moment so I cannot check that all is OK. Personally I think this template is about as much use to an encyclopedia as {{user OJ}}, and should be deleted accordingly. It's only saving grace is its irony, as users who place it on their talk page are ignoring <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">WP:DR</a> and instead making remarks which they do not <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verify</a>. <a href="../../../p/h/y/User%7EPhyschim62_966c.html" title="User:Physchim62">Physchim62</a> <a href="../../../p/h/y/User_talk%7EPhyschim62_05f3.html" title="User talk:Physchim62">(talk)</a> 20:34, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>There is no jutifaction for a speedy delete, much less repeated deletes on this tempalte. The current TfD seems to be heading towards delete, which I disagree with, but if that's what people want...

<li>You maybe didn't check the link. This is (was) a personal attack template against an individual editor.

<ul>
<li>It wasn't a personal attack. It was critical of a particular editor, though, in a possibly-inappropriate way. Isn't editing it a less invasive way to remove the alleged personal attack than deletion? <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 21:29, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>We don't need the kind of incessant needling and taunting expressed by this template. I've seen a number of trolls act that way: they whine and complain and taunt, and when someone tells them to cut it out, they whine even more about how they've now been wronged and attacked. We shouldn't let ourselves be bullied into keeping a template which serves no useful purpose, just because someone will construe its deletion as a confirmation of the template's message. If you have specific misgivings about specific admin actions, you're more than welcome to air them in the appropriate venues. But vague whining and passive-aggressive farting in the administrators' general direction as exemplified by this template is utterly pointless, it's poisoning the well, and it will not stand. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a>&#160;<small><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkSweep_9d72.html" title="User talk:MarkSweep">(call me collect)</a></small> 04:24, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Pointless, maybe. I wouldn't put that (or probably any other) user box on my page. But there's no reason to continually delete this. More than one editor has undeleted, and you continue to delete? As a huge supporter of IAR, it's offensive to me that you used that as justification for this. You're not ignoring the <i>rules</i>, you're ignoring <i>other editors</i> who disagree with you.

<p>I'd say that a notice created for the purpose of trolling comes under disruption and can (though not necessarily should) be deleted. It seems unkind to suggest that administrators restoring it are <i>necessarily</i> disrupting Wikipedia to make a point, but certainly nobody should hesitate to delete such a silly thing on sight, no matter how many times it may be recreated. This seems to be more of the same kind of community-versus-encyclopedia warring that has taken hold of Wikipedia in the past few weeks. The aspects of the community that threaten the encyclopedia will be destroyed, probably sooner rather than later. This is just a symptom of the general malaise, and isn't worth fussing over. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 23:41, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

Neto, fair use images are not allowed in the user space so that image should be removed but it's not his place to keep reverting your user page.

<dd>I'm concerned that by sanctioning Locke and not Netoholic (even though Netoholic was himself technically violating Wikipedia policy on fair use images) there are some concerns about evenhandedness. This is especially important because Netoholic has often been able to get away with pushing the rules very far, and in some cases, outright breaking them. He's under an Arbcom injunction that is basically a dead letter. He has gotten some admin support by spinning various developer comments into support for <a href="../../../a/u/m/WP%7EAUM_b93f.html" title="WP:AUM">WP:AUM</a>. I'm afraid that this block of Locke Cole will simply embolden him to further edit warring and disruptive behavior.

<p>Crotalus, nothing in AGF states that you also have to be completely ignorant and pretend that Locke and you for that matter have been warring with Neto all day and might be just a wee bit enticed to harass him about his user page and Locke to coincidentally visit a number of articles he's never edited before that Neto just coincidentally happened to edit recently. --<a href="../../../w/g/f/User%7EWgfinley_3fa2.html" title="User:Wgfinley">Wgfinley</a> 06:47, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Who said it was coincidence? If a user makes disruptive or unwise edits on one page, it's perfectly reasonable to go through his other edits and see whether they might have been unreasonable as well. I do this all the time when I catch someone vandalizing or POV-pushing. Neto may be a bit more ambiguous, but his penchant for trying to fly "policy" in under the radar makes it necessary to watch his actions. Why have a "user contributions" link if you're not supposed to use it? FWIW, I have no interest in revert warring with him on his user page.

<p>(3 edit conflicts later...)Crotalus, you are verging on wikilawyering, let me explain. First, there's a big difference between tracking a vandals edit and tracking the edits of someone you are having a disagreement with and so you follow him around to other pages where you don't agree with him, that's called <a href="../../../h/a/r/Wikipedia%7EHarassment_9843.html" title="Wikipedia:Harassment">wikistalking</a> and per prior <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Skyring_59ae.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Skyring">Arbcom decision</a> is an offense which can get you banned. Second, I'm well aware of the issue with the image and am addressing it with Neto. There is nothing wrong with a user deleting an image from another user's page that is in violation, when it's undone that's when an admin should be notified, you don't take the law into your own hands and edit war on someone else's user page. Finally, many of your comments towards Neto that I have noticed throughout the day are <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a> and speak of "imposing views" and "imposing policy" on people. He's not imposing anything by continuing to defend his position, he's doing it appropriately and maybe if you guys spent more time on the issues and less on personal attacks of each other on these articles/templates/etc in question there would be less of a problem. --<a href="../../../w/g/f/User%7EWgfinley_3fa2.html" title="User:Wgfinley">Wgfinley</a> 07:06, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You say that Locke Cole should have notified an admin.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Firstly, I disagree with that statement; admins have access to some extra buttons, but we do <i><b>not</b></i> possess a higher level of authority when it comes to policy enforcement (beyond the acts of which other users are technically incapable). Netoholic was patently wrong, and his persistent reversions didn't somehow change that. Locke didn't even violate the three-revert rule.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Secondly, Netoholic reverted <i>my</i> removal of the images too. (Though again, I don't see how the admin vs. non-admin issue is relevant.) —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 07:30, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>NOTHING justifies and edit war and that's exactly what he was doing on some other user's page! Look, I've seen lots of user pages that absolutely abhor me but I'm not going to go edit their page because I don't like it. Yes, he shouldn't have the fair use image on his page. How about leaving a message on his talk page asking him to remove it? No, neither you or Locke took the time to ask him on his talk page to remove it. So, yeah, if you came to MY user page and removed stuff and didn't bother to tell me why on talk (edit summaries are not a good method of communication) I would probably revert them. --<a href="../../../w/g/f/User%7EWgfinley_3fa2.html" title="User:Wgfinley">Wgfinley</a> 07:41, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Look, it doesn't matter if Jimbo came and removed it, the best way is to politely ask him to remove it and point out why. I did that. He then asked some questions, I then answered them. He now understands and look, the image is gone from the page and I didn't have to do a single revert, amazing! Regarding why an admin because, let me try one more time, there is never an excuse for edit warring! Reverting someone else's user page three times is just plain out of line and uncalled for. No one has said having the image there was right but the proper way to go about rectifying that is not by edit warring, it's by finding out what the issue is and addressing it. That's why I suggested he get an admin because clearly he wasn't getting anywhere and clearly the image is in violation of the fair use guidelines. --<a href="../../../w/g/f/User%7EWgfinley_3fa2.html" title="User:Wgfinley">Wgfinley</a> 08:50, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I agree with David Levy, and have unblocked Locke. I don't buy Neto's accusation of wikistalking, because he frequently jumps to such conclusions far too quickly. Fair use law is important, and we should not block people for following up on that, <i>especially</i> after Jimbo's recent request that we be really careful with legal issues. And if the problem here is edit warring, both parties are equally at fault, so blocking one is not appropriate. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 10:24, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Wow. I see the 'merry go round of aggravation' continues. Minor point which I didn't see above... Netoholic has been warned about this 'fair use images' issue <b>several</b> times by many different people over the course of a couple <b>months</b> now. He'll keep them off for a week or so, clear the explanations of why they aren't allowed from his talk page, and then put them back up again. I've seen that pattern repeat at least twice now, just in passing while discussing unrelated template issues with him. Wgfinley, you say that Locke Cole should have 'gotten an admin'. Ok, there are a few admins here. Why is the user who followed policy getting grief and the one who deliberately violated it (repeatedly) not? You were in an existing dispute over <a href="../../../a/u/m/WP%7EAUM_b93f.html" title="WP:AUM">WP:AUM</a> in which Netoholic agrees with you and Locke Cole takes the opposite side. You previously threatened Locke Cole with 'more serious action' over that issue. You should <b>not</b> have been the one placing a block on him - especially when he was, without question, acting in accordance with Wikipedia's 'fair use' policy. Knowingly using copyrighted images in ways which are not allowed is considered <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVAND_6593.html" title="WP:VAND">vandalism</a>. Removing such is therefor not even subject to 3RR.

What an astounding coincidence that these users are now all so suddenly concerned about fair use images in the user space and they want to start their great liberation efforts and protection of the entire project -- you guessed it, on Neto's page!</p>
<p>See, what I love about AGF is that so many who are willing to invoke it are oblivious to what the last line says:</p>

<p>Any person who has a smidgen of intellectual capability can take one look at the talk page on AUM and see the long history of personal attacks and edit warring going on there that has extended to various other templates, pages, articles, etc. It is clear that these folks all have no love lost for Neto and are present on his user page to bust his balls about something, plain and simple. --<a href="../../../w/g/f/User%7EWgfinley_3fa2.html" title="User:Wgfinley">Wgfinley</a> 17:08, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Poor Netoholic. May I give an explanation for those of us with a "smidgen of intellectual capability": It's called watchlist: if you have something to do with someone like Netoholic you shure want to put his talk page on your watchlist, right? And guess what: this implies that the user page itself is also watched. So what happens if you see something popping up on your radar? You take a look at it. This <i>is</i> a real kindergarten here. Everybody who opposes Neto on WP:AUM seems to be <i>your</i> bad guy. Please note that there are not many people who actually care about WP:AUM beause the average wikipedian silently tries to solve his technical problems on the articles and takes whatever falls out of such battles.

<dd>Wgfinley, as noted above, I have been aware of these off and on 'fair use' violations by Netoholic for months now... because every time I post something on his talk page someone new is there warning him about it. I mentioned it to Netoholic <i>once</i> a few weeks ago and that was all. I haven't been 'revert warring' on his user page, <a href="../../../i/n/f/Template%7EInfobox_a3dd.html" title="Template:Infobox">Template:Infobox</a>, or <a href="../../../a/u/m/WP%7EAUM_b93f.html" title="WP:AUM">WP:AUM</a> as claimed and I am not out to 'get' Netoholic here. My involvement in this discussion was to oppose abuse of powers by <b>you</b>. You were in a revert war with Locke Cole on <a href="../../../i/n/f/Template%7EInfobox_a3dd.html" title="Template:Infobox">Template:Infobox</a> the same day as your 'impartial' block of him. You reverted that page to your preferred version and protected it - in blatant violation of policy. You threatened people with admin action for disagreeing with you on that page - again against policy. And then you blocked Locke Cole for removing <b>deliberate</b> violations of 'fair use' policy which Netoholic has been repeating since at least <b>October</b>. Your insistence on extending the block to 48 hours, and continuing that duration even after your stated reason for doing so (a supposed prior block on Locke Cole the same day) was proven to be false, shows just how biased your actions have been in this regards. You should <b>never</b> block someone with whom you are in dispute. Least wise when you've been 'breaking the rules' and they were <i>following</i> them. 'Fair use' images in user space are <b>supposed</b> to be removed... by <i>everyone</i>. At <b>most</b> you should have suggested Locke Cole to get someone else to do it... though even that would be a stretch given the 7+ people who had done so previously. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><sub><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></sub></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 18:50, 4 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>2 of the 3 links you provided I found out about via posts that were made to pages <b>I have watchlisted</b>. Only one of those (<a href="../../../s/h/i/Template%7EShip_table_0f5a.html" title="Template:Ship table">Template:Ship table</a>) involved looking at your contribs, and that wasn't "wikistalking". (You must have a very wide view of what you consider "wikistalking"– I consider it being disruptive; as it was never my intent to be disruptive, merely corrective, it doesn't seem to me to be wikistalking at all). In the case of <a href="../../../s/h/i/Template%7EShip_table_0f5a.html" title="Template:Ship table">Template:Ship table</a>, you were still pushing a template fork (<a href="../../../i/n/f/Template%7EInfobox_Ship_441c.html" title="Template:Infobox Ship">Template:Infobox Ship</a>) that was (and still is) broken for the disabled (<i>hiddenStructure</i> does not work correctly with certain screen readers, and does not work with certain browsers (notably Lynx)).</dd>
<dd>And for what it's worth, I intend to continue going through your contribs to undo the damage you've done. Again, that's not disruptive, that's corrective. Somebody has to do it, just as when a vandal is identified, someone has to go trawling through that persons contribs and undo the damage that was done (yes, I am comparing you to a vandal; I believe the comparison fits). —Locke Cole • <a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocke_Cole_92ea.html" title="User talk:Locke Cole">t</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Locke_Cole_6f88.html" title="Special:Contributions/Locke Cole">c</a> 00:08, 5 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>I recently observed this user uploading an image previously deleted as a copyvio. I deleted it since it has already been through the copyvio process. This user has a habit of uploading copyvios and then claiming they are PD or fair use; see talk for a list of examples. I believe that substantially all of his image contribs should be deleted out of hand unless there is clear evidence that they comply with copyright law.

<dd>Upon notice of your death, the federal government publishes your SSN. I'm not sure why they do this, but if I had to guess it is probably to help reconcile banking and financial records which may be part of your estate. Regardless of the reason, the SSN of a deceased person is public record. In fact I just went and looked it up and I can verify that the name matches the SSN provided. The SSN is not something we need worry about. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 23:06, 2 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>The real issue with me on this now isn't the icons, but rather the thuggery of certain users, including some who posted in regards to this on my talk page. Is the Wikimedia Foundation really so frightened of one admin who disagrees with them that they have to sick a goon squad out to do their bidding? Or is it just some goons on a power trip looking to exert intimidation over someone, and "decrees" give them an excuse to do so? To me, it's a clear <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>, in this case <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> is broken to uphold <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">WP:FU</a>, cancelling each other out.</p>
<p>I can get a decent alternative on one of the userboxes i'm "edit warring" on, and I can likely get permission in regards to the Dem logo (I know several <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_National_Committee_458c.html" title="Democratic National Committee">Democratic National Committee</a> members), but I may conduct some civil disobedience just to stand up to those bullies even if I do go down that route, which i'd prefer. I haven't decided yet.</p>
<p>One thing's for sure -- if those <a href="../../../d/i/c/WP%7EDICK_0b34.html" title="WP:DICK">dicks</a> are able to rally up a mob and lynch me for standing up for what I believe in, Wikipedia will be a worse place for it. That's my only real concern. I'd much rather have free images in the place of potentially non-free ones, but coercion by force isn't the Wikipedian way to do it.<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist"><font color="#4682B4">Karm</font></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_03e8.html" title="WP:ESP"><font color="#00FF00">a</font></a><a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKarmafist_6c43.html" title="User talk:Karmafist"><font color="#E32636">fist</font></a> 12:46, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thuggery or no thuggery, I hope you understand WRT fair use, you were probably in the wrong (which is no big deal, as per Raul's law on copyrights -- many of us who think we understand copyright law really don't.

<p>Policies don't "cancel out." If one side is violating policy, that doesn't grant carte blanche to the other side to do the same. If people are being uncivil, then take it to dispute resolution, but don't use it as an excuse to act out against policy yourself; it is "sinking to thier level," seizing the lowest common denominator (in this case, all policy is thrown out the window). Also, it creates a never-ending cycle of policy violations: &lt;begin intellectual exercise&gt; They violate civil, cancelling out FU, you violate FU, cancelling out NPA, they violate NPA, cancelling out NPOV, you violate NPOV, cancelling out BLOCK, I block you indefinately, violating BLOCK and canceling out VANDALISM, you violate VANDALISM, cancelling out ADMIN, Jimbo promotes Willy on Wheels to administrator, signaling the beginning of apocalypse. &lt;end intellectual exercise&gt; The appropriate response is to remain safely within the bounds of policy (remember IAR includes the phrase "ignore all rules, including this one") and use the established dispute resolution proceedure to address the base issue, rather than retaliating with your own policy violations. Anytime you're invoking IAR to justify an action that is likely to (or is designed to) create more discord than good, then it's time to ignore IAR. <font color="#696969"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> <sup><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><i>Talk</i></a> • <i>Contact</i></sup></font> 16:02, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>As many here will have noticed, this article has received a mindblowing amount of user attention over the past few days. Because the article is still linked to from the main page, it cannot the protected or semi-protected. The result of that is that the cartoon is removed from the article on an almost minute-to-minute basis. This is being done despite a clear and overwhelming consensus on the talk page to keep the cartoon in the article (currently 161/21/12), and despite massive warnings surrounding the image, telling the user that the image should by no means be removed. I believe that these warnings are not enough, and that removers won't listen to talk page warnings, since Allah is more important to most of them than Wikipedia. I propose a drastic measure. It has probably never been done before, and I hope it will never be done again. I believe that it is necessary to immediately block anyone who removes the cartoon from the article for 24 hours for blanking vandalism. This should stop the influx of vandalism on the article, which would reduce the need for full-protection/semi-protection once the article is no longer linked to from the main page. This in turn would allow good-faith IP's to contribute valuable information to the article. I'm afraid that the situation on the article is getting out of hand. We currently need around-the-clock vigilantes on the article, which costs valuable editor time that could be spent much more effectively on other articles. <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis">Aecis</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aecis_c56c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aecis"><sup>Mr.</sup></a> <a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis"><sup>Mojo</sup></a> <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_Userboxes_0d05.html" title="User:Aecis/Userboxes"><sup>risin'</sup></a> 23:29, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think there should be an exemption from 3RR for people who restore the image. The IPs go through 8,9, 10 removals before being blocked, and all the conscientious users exhaust their three reverts. This should be regarded as simple vandalism, and we should be able to restore it as many times as necessary? Do people agree with that? The community consensus is well over a supermajority here. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 23:48, 3 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I understand what you're saying, and I've said before this may be the exceptional case where it makes sense to protect an article linked from the main page. However, consensus is not actually established by polls, it is also established by action, and going down the road of discounting the opinions of those people removing the image from the article in your definition of consensus is a dangerous one. It is a tempting thing to imagine that having the image missing for a while is a terrible consequence, but it isn't really, and the article will eventually stabilize on a good (accepted) version. In the meantime, many people will have learned they can edit Wikipedia, and a few of them, even if they might not be making such great edits to this particular article, may stay and do something useful. There is precedent for restoring consensus being exempted from the 3RR (Gdansk/Danzig) but that was very well-discussed for a long time, while we have actually not been discussing this for that long. <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemi_6641.html" title="User:Demi">Demi</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/e/m/User_talk%7EDemi_ab67.html" title="User talk:Demi">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Demi_a1b0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Demi">C</a></sub> 23:58, 3 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Okay, well at least three people have disagreed that exemption from 3RR is appropriate as of now: Anonymous Editor, Demi, and Theresa. So for now I think that's enough to conclude that there is no consensus for exempting restorers of the image from 3RR.

<dd>I second the idea that protection in this specific case is probably the best of the remedies available, if remedy we desparately need. Part of the notion of our attention to this is that we should not be changing our editorial rules to accommodate Muslims--and yet, here we are making up special warn-and-block schemes and 3RR violation exceptions we don't usually carry out. Protection is better, and might actually drive some objectors to the talk page or other discussion venues, which is what we want anyway (rather than an unstable article). In contrast, "requiring" people to keep reverting in the face of a wave of "attackers" will just make everyone a lot angrier. <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemi_6641.html" title="User:Demi">Demi</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/e/m/User_talk%7EDemi_ab67.html" title="User talk:Demi">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Demi_a1b0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Demi">C</a></sub> 17:40, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My problem is this. We do not protect articles linked from the main page. "Well it doesn't say it in the policy". Yes, it says it's "best not to protect". But you know, for those of us who actually protect pages, it's a rule we follow. I'm tired of those admins who have done 20-25 protections in their entire admin careers (if that) telling those of us who have done literally hundreds that we are just wrong. We're not. It's a convention we've been following for months and months. We follow it on all FA articles and on everything else linked from the main page. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">(cat scratches)</a></sup> 07:30, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think that's specifically telling people to use Wikipedia as a message board. I quite frequently will create a sub-page of my own user page to mock up a page I'm editing (this is generally during a rewrite or substantial copyedit). While I'm typically only involving myself, at least a few times, I've posted a link to my "scratch pad" on a talk page for an article in the main namespace. I think this is common practice, as I got the idea from somebody else. Anyways, giving people a space to mock up an article or to "hash out" differences is A Good Thing. It hopefully will prevent people from having "revert wars" on the main article. I think it provides an alternative to "harmful" behavior (eg revert wars).

<p>Not for nothing, since I've been a heavy target of this anonymous IP's ire, but I don't agree with how this is being handled. {{<a href="../../../s/p/r/Template%7ESprotect_0796.html" title="Template:Sprotect">sprotect</a>}} on a talk page for over 24 hours is ridiculous. This seems to run counter to everything that the policy at <a href="../../../s/e/m/Wikipedia%7ESemi-protection_306b.html" title="Wikipedia:Semi-protection">Wikipedia:Semi-protection</a> states. I've done the research and there are indeed multiple other valuable anon-IP contributors from the same ISP ranges, so a mass block is out of the question.</p>
<p>There's two options - return to the table and continue to talk it out, or write up the behavior for RfC and eventually RfArb. I felt that we were making some progress on discussing this topic on the talk page until about <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_1.html" title="February 1">February 1</a> when Brad or one of his cohorts started a revert war on the article, and it's been downhill since. I have no problem with the anon IP stating their viewpoint as long as they are not disruptive or make attacks.</p>
<p>Although I disagree completely with their tactics, the anonymous user does have an <i>iota</i> of a point in wanting to make sure that Abramoff is not portrayed as some sort of Jewish <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willie_Horton_c2c6.html" title="Willie Horton">Willie Horton</a>. I don't believe that they should get their wish that the word "Jewish" does not appear in the article, but the subject should be treated with dispassion. <i><a href="../../../k/w/h/User_talk%7EKwh_7c75.html" title="User talk:Kwh">KWH</a></i> 04:27, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I want to get everyone else's opinion on this image, Image:Dylan jams with campbell.jpg.

<dd>The above makes no sense to me. The user was blocked because they stated (and demonstrated) that they were determined to continually re-upload an unfree image without providing source or copyright status. Blocks are not punitive, so once the user agreed to abide by image use policy, they should be immediately unblocked. Blocking for a week sends the message that they are being punished for an arbitrary length of time for being a jerk.

<p>Indefinite blocks are an ArbCom matter. We're getting <i>way</i> to cavalier with these. If there is no proven case against a user, no matter how obnoxious, RFar. We do indefinite blocks for user names that are obviously inappropriate and for sockpuppets that are vandalizing and for vandalism-only accounts. Other than that.... I know this has been taken care of now, but I'd like to urge folks to watch out for the temptation to block indefinitely. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 16:53, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I posted this at the Help Desk and no one responded, so I'm putting it here. I'm having a rather strange problem. English Wikipedia seems to be blocked on my computer. I can't access it on any browser, including IE, firefox, and Opera (not that I can't edit Wikipedia, I can't even view the site at all, nor can I link to it from a google search). Firefox gives an error message saying that it can't establish a connection to the server. I can access any other website, including any other language wikipedia, but I can't get to English wikipedia. I'm writing from a public computer right now. No one else on the network in my dorm is blocked from Wikipedia, so I find this very strange. can anyone offer any help, or any possible reason why this could have happened? I'm sort of clueless right now, wondering if my computer got hacked by somebody who i blocked on wikipedia or something? I don't know, please help if you can.

<dd>"Obviously it should be deleted without mercy, no matter how many times it's created." I strongly disagree with this statement, applied to anything. <i>Nothing</i> trumps civility, and civility means engaging with other editors in discussion <i>instead of</i> reverting them. It means leaving Wikipedia in The Wrong Version while pursuing respectful dialogue.

<dd>But GTBacchus is defining reverting others instead of engaging in discussion as incivil (particularly in regards to deleting things, I think).

<dl>
<dd>Protecting the encyclopedia need never "trump" civility. There is no case in which it is necessary to be uncivil in order to protect the encyclopedia. If someone is adding illegal content, then you still should address that person via their talk page each time you revert them. Even then, doing it more than twice should immediately feel fatuous and silly. At that point, it's appropriate to get more Wikipedians involved. Just reverting is <i>never</i> the right way to go about things. This applies to deletions, content disputes, whatever. The main problem with just reverting is that <i>it doesn't work</i>. After two reverts (with no discussion), the problem is exactly as it was before two reverts. That's unproductive; don't do it. And making remarks in the edit summaries is no substitute for discussion. Why don't admins hold themselves to a <i>higher</i> standard of civility, and not the lowest that's technically within process. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 04:39, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Look, I mostly agree with you in the current case, but I caution you that your use of absolutes ("Reverting repeatedly without constantly attempting to discuss and build consensus is <i>always wrong</i>", "Just reverting is <i>never</i> the right way to go about things") is silly. If someone is defacing today's featured article with a large number of penis images, "just reverting" is perfectly appropriate for a while (though eventually a block becomes necessary). There's a fuzzy line somewhere where it becomes inappropriate, but things are not black or white and talking as if they are does nothing to further the conversation. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 04:51, 6 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, ok, I see where you're coming from, and every absolute claim has exceptions. Sometimes though, it's a very good idea to take an adage as non-negotiable. I'm attempting to describe an ideal, which, if all editors held themselves to it, would raise the bar around here considerably, regarding both how we treat each other and the quality of encyclopedia we end up with. An ideal has to be couched in terms of absolutes. In your example, by the way, it would be acceptable to warn the penis-image vandal once, and block them on the second offense. Only two reverts are necessary in that scenario, and communication takes place in between them. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 05:01, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

By Tony's reasoning I could revert war on any article and the only defense I would need is that I was right. It wouldn't even be a revert war.

<p>Phil, if you were reverting vandalism you could revert it until the cows come home with my blessing. We <i>do</i> allow reversion of damage to Wikipedia, and a template created avowedly for the purpose of trolling may well be classed as damage to Wikipedia.

<p>I ask the Wikipedia Community, are there no rules or regulations for administrators? Can administrators make unilateral decisions as to that what is “wrong or right?” How can any user know what is wrong or right? Were the actions of <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemi_6641.html" title="User:Demi">User:Demi</a> correct?</p>
<p>Can any user post false declarations in an RFC? -- 68.50.103.212 10:19, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I am not familiar with the history of the situation so I can't comment on whether any administrator was right or wrong, but I do know that you were wrong to remove comments from the RFC, especially when you were already told not to do so. If they are factually incorrect as you say, the correct thing to do would be to reply underneath the declaration, explaining why it was incorrect. Simply removing it gives the impression that you have something to hide. <a href="../../../r/a/v/User%7ERaven4x4x_5184.html" title="User:Raven4x4x">Raven4x4x</a> 09:31, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I think a block here would be less problematic than some others proposed (and done!) today for two reasons. First of all, we shouldn't have self-admitted vandals on Wikipedia. He should be given the option of either disclaiming his vandalhood and removing that message from his userpage, or being blocked until he does. Secondly, our purpose <i>is</i> to create an encyclopedia. I think people should have a lot of leeway in userspace to keep them happy and productive, just like I think that workers should be able to put pictures or comic strips up on their cubicles if they want to (and managers who try to stop this behavior generally find out that such restrictions aren't such a great idea due to their effects on morale and productivity). But this presupposes contributions to the encyclopedia, and so far there are <i>none</i>. This smacks of simply using Wikipedia as a homepage provider, which it is not. <tt><a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrotalus_horridus_5cc6.html" title="User:Crotalus horridus">Crotalus horridus</a> <small>(<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECrotalus_horridus_e0ed.html" title="User talk:Crotalus horridus">TALK</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Crotalus_horridus_e95d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Crotalus horridus">CONTRIBS</a>)</small></tt> 05:04, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The <a href="../../../n/a/k/Naked_short_selling.html" title="Naked short selling">naked short selling</a> page was semi-protected after vandalism. Users were requested to go to the talk page before making any changes.</p>
<p>Recently, a disgruntled user and others have engaged in POV Forking by creating an article entitled Failure to Deliver Stock. This article has not yet been Wikified, but can be located, via external link, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_To_Deliver_Shares_%28FTD%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_To_Deliver_Shares_%28FTD%29" rel="nofollow">here</a>. One of the principal authors of this article is User:Bobobrien, who is Bob O'Brien, head of the coalition against naked short selling (NCANS).</p>
<p>This article combs out one aspect of the naked shorting controversy and builds an entire article around it. Most of this article is a discussion of naked short-selling from the point of view of the anti-shorting camp. It is a textbook case of POV Forking, if ever there was one. --<a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMantanmoreland_c701.html" title="User:Mantanmoreland">Mantanmoreland</a> 22:13, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>That's because this is essentially a duplicate <a href="../../../n/a/k/Naked_short_selling.html" title="Naked short selling">naked short selling</a> page, substituting "FTD" for "naked short selling" and skewing the whole thing from an anti-shorting perspective.</p>
<p>I think this is such an egregious copycat that it might be a candidate for speedy deletion.

<p>I've recently been cleaning out the backlog at WP:3O. It finally got cleared a couple days ago. I noticed a new entry in there today, gave my 3rd Opinion and deleted it from the log, clearing the list. One of the two users did not agree with my intervention, saying that I was not neutral, as I had been in a dispute with that user before, and called them a vandal. The user reverted my deletion of the listing on WP:3O, and disputed my actual opinion that I gave. As I'm now a party to the dispute, there are now more than precisely two people involved, and thus the listing does not meet the guidelines for listing on WP:3O: specifically</p>
<p>"This page is meant only for disagreements involving precisely two people. If more are involved, try convincing—or coming to a compromise with—the other people. If that fails, try other Wikipedia dispute-solving procedures."</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>"If a third opinion has been provided in a disagreement, please remove it from the list below (regardless of whether you listed it in the first place). If you provide a third opinion in any disagreement below, please remove it from the list."</p>
<p>I cannot continue removing the listing without violating the 3 revert rule. Furthermore, I'm very upset with this users conduct. I was trying to help out, and I was treated with bad faith, and personally attacked. My wikistress level is very high right now from all this. I'm requesting that an adminstrator delete the listing at WP:3O, and furthermore come in as a mediator over the actual dispute on the page itself (<a href="../../../c/r/i/Talk%7ECrime_against_humanity_46f2.html" title="Talk:Crime against humanity">Talk:Crime against humanity</a>.) <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">⇒</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Iceland.svg_bd47.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/ce/Flag_of_Iceland.svg/18px-Flag_of_Iceland.svg.png" alt="" width="18" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Iceland.svg_bd47.html" /></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Swatjester_088b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Swatjester"><small><sup>Ready</sup></small></a> <a href="../../../r/s/t/RSTA_5dcc.html" title="RSTA"><small>Aim</small></a> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Terrorism_01a1.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Terrorism"><small><sub>Fire!</sub></small></a> 01:19, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is a heads up that I'd placed a sockpuppet tag on SeraphimXI's userpage, &amp; it was removed, probably acurately. Why I'd placed it there:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahabone_2e9b.html" title="User:Mahabone">User:Mahabone</a> was <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive73_bfde.html#User:Mahabone" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive73">blocked indefinately</a> by User:ALKIVAR on Feb 6th.</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>For some reason (actually, because I was using a library computer &amp; something was wrong, it appeared as though SeraphimXI's first edits were on the 7th) I'd thought [[<a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimXI_248e.html" title="User:SeraphimXI">User:SeraphimXI</a> appeared editing Feb 7th, but obviously that's not accurate.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Anyway, SeraphimXI is <b>highly</b> suspect. on 29 January 2006, SeraphimXI made <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Freemasonry&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=37192162" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Freemasonry&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=37192162" rel="nofollow">the following statement</a>: <i>"I came here randomly, not knowing anything about the masons..."</i></li>
<li>About 12 hours later, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Freemasonry&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=37256674" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Freemasonry&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=37256674" rel="nofollow">added added NPOV disputed and merge tags</a></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Why? &amp; How? How can someone <u>Possibly</u> learn enough about anything in 12 hours to add these tags? Unless is was rediculously POV, which it was not. This is pretty much vandalism, as far as I can tell.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>And then:</b> This user has been making POV comments, &amp; reverting Wiktionary tags on <a href="../../../j/a/h/Jahbulon.html" title="Jahbulon">Jahbulon</a>, &amp; will not listen to 2 words of reasoning. Very much like Mahabone, but even more so like another user, but I can't quite place 'em.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Really I didn't think it was Mahabone until I mistook that edit pattern, as this user has some clue to wikipedia editing etc, &amp; Mahabone didn't.</dd>

<dd>Jareth has now posted to my talk page <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilesD._6338.html" title="User:MilesD.">MilesD.</a> that this Admin Incident Board request for a user:check of Jareth and Dixen is "For the record, you're accusing <b>my husband</b> and I of being sockpuppets -- if you'd like, I can provide my phone number so you can personally verify." In referring to what she has written, I am assuming she is revealing "Dixen" to be her husband's Wiki account, since we had no idea who "Dixen" might be when we filed this Incident report. If this is the case and her husband's account (Dixen) was used to revert back a post with edit summary "too late to get self-righteous now", which contains numerous PAs and the revealing of Personal Info about an editor, this is really troubling. Also, the fact that this request was "archived" within hours of it being posted and before other admins had a chance to review or comment about it, is also troubling. Thank you. |||<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilesD._6338.html" title="User:MilesD."><font color="#56A5EC">Miles.D.</font></a><a href="../../../s/p/a/Image%7ESpace_buddy2.gif_066b.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/7/77/Space_buddy2.gif/31px-Space_buddy2.gif" alt="" width="31" height="34" longdesc="../../../s/p/a/Image%7ESpace_buddy2.gif_066b.html" /></a>||| <sup><i>02-12-2006 15:33 (UTC)</i></sup> 15:33, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see no evidence of any wrong-doing; partners in relationships often have vast differences in behaviour (compare arbitrator <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindspillage_87a5.html" title="User:Mindspillage">Mindspillage</a> (<a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMindspillage_c644.html" title="User talk:Mindspillage">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mindspillage_ded3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mindspillage">contribs</a>) and her partner, <a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> (<a href="../../../g/m/a/User_talk%7EGmaxwell_8678.html" title="User talk:Gmaxwell">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Gmaxwell_9833.html" title="Special:Contributions/Gmaxwell">contribs</a>)). It wouldn't be surprising if Dixen was in the wrong and Jareth had nothing to do with his actions. Your initial post is also lacking a lot of context, which makes it very difficult to probe. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 16:45, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Respectfully, I disagree. The questions don't involve "partners" opinions. The questions involve 1) a user "209.215.39.5", who posted the personal info about another user (definite evidence of Wiki wrong-doing), which has never been revealed by that targeted user on Wiki nor on his/her kennel website. 2)After removal, this post was rv'd in its entirety (including personal info) by a user (Dixen) who h</dd>

<p>as never posted to this talk page/article before. This editor's (Dixen's) only "tie" to this talk page/article is then revealed by the very administrator (Jareth), who is heavily and controversially involved in this talk page/article, and is the initiator of an RFA against other editors (including one whose personal info was revealed in the post), as being her "husband". 3)then, when removed again for violation of WP:Harrassment, that administrator (Jareth) refactors it, claiming no personal info was included and no personal attacks against editors are included. Please review: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Shiloh_Shepherd_Dog&amp;diff=39165545&amp;oldid=39089486" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Shiloh_Shepherd_Dog&amp;diff=39165545&amp;oldid=39089486" rel="nofollow">[57]</a></p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So, a post involving and revealing PA's/Personal Info about editors is rv'd/refactored twice, once by an editor (Dixen), who has never in any way posted/contributed before to this talk page/article and who Jareth has now identified as her "husband" and then once by an administrator (Jareth) who is pursuing an RFA she has filed against some of the very editors targeted by this post. It should also be noted that it appears the original poster 209.215.39.5 was neither warned nor blocked by admin Jareth for this post and the serious Wiki violation it committed with its WP:PA/WP:Harrassment content and this personal information is still visible for everyone to read in history.</dd>

<p>I'm not a sockpuppet, either. My contributions indicate my participation in the Shiloh Shepherd discussion since late Dec., '05. My apologies for the confusion. It's confusing to us, too. MilesD. was puzzled about why their message disappeared from this page only a few hours after it was posted. I found it in the most recent archive and put it back on this page, since this is an urgent matter, and Administrators had so little time to respond before it was archived.

<p>The participants in this dispute seem to be all involved in sustained disputes regarding the breeding and marketing of <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shiloh_Shepherd_b26b.html" title="Shiloh Shepherd">Shiloh Shepherds</a>. They know each other by name already. Use of first names on the talk page of the article is of minimal significance. When and if the Arbitration Commitee hears this case I will almost certainly advocate that no one involved in the current controversy over the breeding and selling of Shiloh Shepards should be allowed to edit the article.

<p>I was blocked a few days ago for 3RR violation. The admin who blocked me was directly involved in the disagreement. I was removing a statement that I believed to be a personal attack. --It was a comment about how certain groups of people would have trouble getting into heaven.</p>

<p>I'm happy to look into the situation. I see that you were removing another person's comments from a talk page. You violated the 3RR. An admin came along and restored the comments of another user that you removed - this does not make him involved in the disagreement. I agree with the admin's actions and would have also applied a block in the circumstances. My advice to you is to learn from the situation and never break the 3RR again. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> | <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">Taste the Korn</a> 00:00, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That is rather harsh. I want to know if that comment was a personal attack, and if so, if I was right in removing it. Also, I have heard many times from administrators that reverting in a revert war you are mediating constitutes being involved! <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AColle&amp;diff=39354965&amp;oldid=39318375" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AColle&amp;diff=39354965&amp;oldid=39318375" rel="nofollow">[60]</a> How can I "learn from the situation" when I still have questions? I don't appreciate being treated like dirt... I don't want to know how <i>wrong</i>, I was, I need to know why you "agree with the admins actions."

<dd>Looks fine to me. The comment was far from a personal attack, and you shouldn't be going around removing other peoples' comments anyway. <a href="../../../r/e/m/Wikipedia%7ERemove_personal_attacks_ff02.html" title="Wikipedia:Remove personal attacks">Wikipedia:Remove personal attacks</a> is an extremely disputed guideline, only generally acceptable in the most egregious of circumstances (one in which there would be no doubt about whether something was or was not a "personal attack.") · <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0"><b>Katefan0</b></a><sup><a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKatefan0_4566.html" title="User talk:Katefan0">(scribble)</a></sup>/<small><a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_Poll_b43b.html" title="User:Katefan0/Poll">poll</a></small> 00:22, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with the admin because removing other's comments is always considered controversial. That's not to say that you should never do it. I've done it myself many times. However you should do it very carefully. Revert warring over removing someone elses comments is very dodgy. Revert warring with an admin as well as the person who wrote the comments is disruptive. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> | <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">Taste the Korn</a> 00:24, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, you are free from the block now, so that's good. I don't think she means that as an attack; it's just rather impersonal because she may answer a lot of such questions. I'm sorry you feel hurt by the situation, but try to learn and let go of it. If someone is there strictly to mediate, they are not really involved. I have to admit I haven't read it all. But just shrug it off, and know that you've likely learned things here that will make you stronger and more prepared when you meet such situations in the future. Good luck. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielCD_4f74.html" title="User:DanielCD">DanielCD</a> 00:25, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
