<dd>I don't think I would. I'd like to hear what <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDeskana_5f27.html" title="User:Deskana">User:Deskana</a> has to say first. Simple vandalism even to a user page is best delt with by reverting. Blocking can be used in persistant and difficult cases. As for harassment - that's a bit extreme. Childish vandalism of a user page happens quite a lot on Wikipedia. It's not to be encoraged or condoned of course, but it's not what I would call harrassment if it hapens on this scale. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> | <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">Taste the Korn</a> 14:51, 28 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>well, 12 hours then; logging out to vandalize a userpage is pretty bad behaviour, we don't need to assume good faith to the point of surrealism, and being blocked for a few hours isn't exactly a cruel punishment. But if he stops vandalising without being blocked that's fine with me too. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 14:58, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's worth knowing some of the background. The Jesus page is currently locked and there are some pretty heated discussions going on at the moment on <a href="../../../j/e/s/Talk%7EJesus_56ae.html" title="Talk:Jesus">Talk:Jesus</a> of which Rob and Deskana are on opposite sides. Deskana is a regular contributor to the pages and has voted in current attempts at consensus. Rob was not a random victim - hence the accusations of harassment. I'm not out to lynch the guy but I do think anonymously editing someones user page <i>twice</i> shows at best a complete misunderstanding of the purpose of wikipedia. <a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESOPHIA_915a.html" title="User:SOPHIA">SOPHIA</a> 15:46, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Anselm College has quite a few students. One should not jump to the conclusion that, because an editor goes to school there, he or she <i>must</i> be the vandal. At the very least, a check of Deskana's IP address and that of the school should be done. In addition, before any admin takes action, they should read all the Deskana posts on the talk:Jesus page and its archives and on the talk:Robsteadman page and its archives. In comparison to other editors (this one included) he has been polite and only occaisonally involved in the discussion. --<a href="../../../c/t/s/User%7ECTSWyneken_8c3b.html" title="User:CTSWyneken">CTSWyneken</a> 17:00, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I agree that a check needs to occur. We don't want to assume that someone is violating policy merely because they may have a similar IP address as another user (SOPHIA can attest to the injustices that such assumptions can create), but suspicion here is warranted. I'm eager to see what Deskana has to say about this and silence will not be his friend.Gator (talk) 17:10, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm also with you. It's worth checking. But since it's only been four hours and the user appears to be a college student, his silence so far is not significant. --<a href="../../../c/t/s/User%7ECTSWyneken_8c3b.html" title="User:CTSWyneken">CTSWyneken</a> 17:25, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>

<p>That check has been done. It's gone now but earlier there was a special page for that IP address showing all users who had used it - Deskana was on that list - hence the admins saying above that it was a pretty clear case. <a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESOPHIA_915a.html" title="User:SOPHIA">SOPHIA</a> 18:03, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

I haven't worked with him <i>too</i> much, but it seems to me that he politely dealt with Robsteadman's continual violations of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">WP:CIV</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, and <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, longer than most before finally just giving up on Robsteadman. For that alone, he deserves the <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">benefit of the doubt</a>. That said, if he's guilty of vandalizing the userpage of Robsteadman, he should be blocked temporarily.

<dd>You're right, I attend Aquinas College, Stockport. I was talking to one of my friends about a user called robsteadman and how he is convinced that a cabal of editors are protecting the page on Jesus to not conform to a certain POV in violation of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. I pointed my friend towards the talk page for Jesus. He searched the page for Robsteadman, and proceeded to his user page. At this time I was called by my teacher (that was the reason I was in the IT room, I was demonstrating my computing project to my teacher). Once the interview was over, I logged off the PC and went to registration.</dd>
<dd>I was browsing Wikipedia later and was pointed to messages on <a href="../../../2/1/2/User_talk%7E212.219.123.32.html" title="User talk:212.219.123.32">User talk:212.219.123.32</a>. Checking the contributions I saw that when I was being interviewed Robsteadman's page was vandalised. I didn't actually have anything to do with the vandalism of Robsteadman's page.</dd>
<dd>I'm disgraced at my friend for doing what he did. I had logged on to check to see if I had messages, and was talking to my friend. I never actually vandalised any pages myself. Nor did I edit Robsteadman's page. I am somewhat frustrated that after attempting to offer guidance to Robsteadman (see the archives on his talk page) on matters such as dispute resolution, that I am being accused of this. Although I can see why the questions should be asked about my logging on using that IP address, I feel that attempting to get me blocked is somewhat unfair. If you want me to comment further, I will. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDeskana_5f27.html" title="User:Deskana">Deskana</a> <small><a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDeskana_208e.html" title="User talk:Deskana">(talk)</a></small> 18:36, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I feel that this may ruin my chances of becoming an admin one day, and for that I'm actually quite pissed off. I feel my reputation of months and over a thousand reliable edits has been vandalised for some edits not even from my account on an IP which I have to use sometimes, as much as Robsteadman's user page was vandalised by the IP! <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDeskana_5f27.html" title="User:Deskana">Deskana</a> <small><a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDeskana_208e.html" title="User talk:Deskana">(talk)</a></small> 18:56, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Could the admins with access to the special page I saw earlier confirm the time lag between Deskana logging off and the vandalism taking place. Since this vandalism was done twice and from what Deskana has said there should be no record of any registered user making edits immediately before or between the two incidents. <a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESOPHIA_915a.html" title="User:SOPHIA">SOPHIA</a> 19:05, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Let me weigh in with my opinion. Deskana has been one of the milder voices on the <a href="../../../j/e/s/Talk%7EJesus_56ae.html" title="Talk:Jesus">Talk:Jesus</a> page; milder than mine (I am, after all, the one who recently shouted "stop being binary!") I find Deskana's account to be reasonable, so I leave it to others to decide whether this matter should be pursued further. The anon IP who vandalized Rob's page went on to vandalize <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell">User:Ben_W_Bell</a>, who to my knowledge has not been involved on the Jesus page. I should also point out that <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarglebutt_ee27.html" title="User:Garglebutt">User:Garglebutt</a> was also vandalized, by a different IP, shortly after Garglebutt decided to leave the Jesus talk page. I submit this to point out that Rob is not the only one who has been vandalized. I have nothing more to say. <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArchola_35bb.html" title="User:Archola">Arch O.

<dd>Ok, the vandalism occurred in a 12 minute uninterrupted time period between 10:28 and 10:40 on the 28th (today). Deskana last edited (with his user name) on 07:10 and then not until 18:36 today when he began refuting the vandalism charge. I for one am skeptical and the story could easily be false, but we do need to AGF here and these edits do seem to be outside of the norm compared to Deskana's usually exemplary edits, so....I wouldn't block just yet, but would have no mercy if this were to happen again as it is not Rob's prblem that Deskana has friends who would do something like this (assuming that it's true). Just my two cents. Thanks to SOPHIA for catching this so that it can all come oput in the wash and we can, hopefully, move on.Gator (talk) 20:02, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A couple of points:</p>
<ul>
<li>If vandalism comes from a public IP (library, university, etc.), admins don't normally block unless the vandalism is very persistent. We don't want to affect innocent users.</li>
<li>If a respectable editor with no history of bad behaviour is known to edit from a public IP, and vandalism comes from that IP on one particular day, and the editor in question denies having carried it out, the matter should be closed. I have absolutely no doubt in my mind that Deskana is speaking the truth, and I see no reason to have a dozen more posts with "did he or didn't he?" speculation.</li>
<li>I noticed this morning that vandalism to Robsteadman's page had been reverted, and I posted a level 4 warning to the vandal.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:212.219.123.32&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=41594750" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:212.219.123.32&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=41594750" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> I used level four, because the vandal had already been warned by two other users shortly before. I kept an eye on the contributions, and there was nothing further, so there was no reason to block.</li>
<li>Anyone who has been around on Wikipedia for a while is going to have his or her user page vandalized a few times. It has happened to me several times (although I deleted some versions from the history, so some of the records are gone). It's not a big deal. It's certainly not harassment if it happens only twice.</li>
<li>Blocking on Wikipedia is <i>not</i> meant to be a punishment. It's meant to be used to put a stop to ongoing vandalism, when it's obvious that the vandal can't be persuaded to stop. That's why we have four different warnings. The idea of blocking a public IP address twelve hours later as a "punishment" for vandalism carried out by someone who probably isn't near the computer right now is against normal practice on Wikiepedia.</li>
<li>I'm concerned at the wording used by some people in this section, as if there's no doubt that Deskana, despite his record for civility, vandalized Rob's user page. I would hope that if vandalism were carried out from <i>my</i> work IP address, and reported here, most Wikipedians would say that they didn't believe I was responsible.</li>
<li>I don't know Deskana well enough to say whether or not I would support him in an RfA. I will say, however, that no memory of this speculation would cause me to hesitate for a second. He has a good record. He uses a public IP. He says he didn't do it. Let's move on.</li>

<dd>The page I saw seemed to be some sort of activity log of all the events associated with that IP address including login/out. I've not seen a page like that before and suspect it can be generated by admins for checks. It's certainly the sort of information I could have got from my security systems. It should show Deskana login to wikipedia then logout (as the posts were made anonymously) then a short time delay before the vandalism. If Deskana was away from the computer his wikipedia account should not show any activity (login or out) until after the two acts of vandalism occurred.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I am not pressing for any further action as I'm sure it won't happen again but it's worth looking at the IP log as it would confirm Deskana's account and settle the matter once and for all. The one thing I do know about is unfounded suspicion and in my case I wanted all the information to come out to corroborate my account of events. <a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESOPHIA_915a.html" title="User:SOPHIA">SOPHIA</a> 22:20, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Deskana's verison ofn events does NOT hold up - it is a total fabrication. I am amazed that he has not been blocked or banned permanently. This is outrageous. His behaviour has gradually been egetting worse on the "jesus" qarticle ober recent weeks and this is the worst example of it. I do hope this incident is noted when he asks for his wish to be an admin. Totally unsuitable. I cannot assume good faith when it is not deserved. Deskana SHOULD be banned.

<p>Mark Sweep has wheel warred with me over his deletion of [[Category:Pro-cannabis Wikipedians]] , a category that was one of the casualties in his latest deletion binge. I personally don't like this sort of category, but feel strongly that ad hoc deletion binges by admins are more damaging and disruptive to the community than the existence of the categories themselves. Until/unless the proposed policy is passed to delete this sort of user category, admins should not be implementing it. I have undeleted this user category only once, and have no interest in going past <a href="../../../1/r/r/WP%7E1RR_8afd.html" title="WP:1RR">WP:1RR</a>, but Mark doesn't share that compunction. Moreover, he violated 3RR at Template:User pro-cannabis, in the process repeatedly using his rollback function in a dispute over the content of the page. How much more of this sort of abysmal admin behavior from Mark Sweep must we tolerate? It is damaging the encyclopedia by pissing off hordes of users. Admins wield a mop, not a sceptre, and when we assume powers the community hasn't given us it disrupts project. Something must be done about Mark's behaviour. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 10:34, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've left a note for -Ril-. I explained to him why his request is unfounded, and encouraged him to withdraw it before someone gets around to blocking him for being a disruptive and vexatious litigant.

<dd>Actually, I'm going to block -Ril- now for being a vexatious litigant because it was conduct precisely like this that was part of the problem with -Ril-'s original incarnation, CheeseDreams. In the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_CheeseDreams_2_6ac2.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/CheeseDreams 2">second case against CheeseDreams</a>, the Arbitration Committee ruled that CheeseDreams was a "vexatious litigant" due to very similar frivolous and retaliatory requests for arbitration against her opponents. -Ril-/CheeseDreams is currently banned under that ruling. As additional support, I cite these similarities between the two as given by <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a>:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>At this point I am quite certain the -Ril- is the hard banned user CheeseDreams.</i></dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li><i>Both have the same twin interests in Christianity and Egyptian mythology</i></li>
<li><i>Both have a deeply held, and similar, opinions on Christianity and a seeming inability to work constructively with others in these areas</i></li>
<li><i>-Ril- first began editing soon after CheeseDreams was temporarily blocked in January 2005. When CheeseDreams returned for a period -Ril- immediately stopped editing. Only once the CheeseDreams account was permanently hardbanned did -Ril- begin editing again.</i></li>
<li><i>Both have claimed to be British and to be university lecturers.</i></li>
<li><i>Both have very similar writing styles, and similar techniques such as mass messaging users and persistent edit wars.</i></li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>When faced with this argument, it's worth noting that -Ril-'s response was the non-denial, "Who is CheeseDreams?" -Ril-'s habits in naming sockpuppet accounts also matched those of CheeseDreams, as I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=21579554" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=21579554" rel="nofollow">pointed out</a> back in August. It is not feasible to address the question by technical means, because both use BT and due to the passage of time, but I believe the evidence should be clearly convincing at this point to anyone who is seriously familiar with the actions of both accounts. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 19:56, 2 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>-Ril-'s original reaction was actually <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=37153880" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=37153880" rel="nofollow">who or what is CheeseDreams</a>, which was quite different from his vociferous denials of being Lir. An additional piece of evidence I noticed is that they share a number of stylistic quirks. For instance they both unusually put a period between the "r" and the "v" when using the abbreviation for revert.

Although she didn't need to state his name (or pseudonym, as the case may be), he (that is, the user whose personal details were posted) has identified that as his name/psuedonym at an off-site forum which Selina frequents.

<p>She obviously learned nothing from her month long block and took no time upon returning to continue to disrupt Wikipedia.

<li>Well, Grace Note has indicated he does not MSK blocked over this.

<li>Does 33 blocks in three months, a consistent history of edit warring, personal attacks, vandalism of policy pages, and infrequent valuable contributions indicate a valued editor? Is there a final straw? <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalber_d5cd.html" title="User:Malber">Malber</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMalber_7564.html" title="User talk:Malber">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Malber_b734.html" title="Special:Contributions/Malber">contribs</a>) 14:02, 2 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>MSK clearly has clearly made more than her fair share of disruption. Yes there is a final straw, and it probably passed some time ago, but if Grace Note doesn't want to be that final straw, there is no reason to force that upon him. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 14:06, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think this should not be a final straw because it's so minor and I don't think is significantly indicative of continued problematic behaviour. If MSK has not changed, something a bit more serious will show up and we can permablock, and if she has changed, we should give her one last chance. I do hope she's a bit more careful in the future though. I would've unblocked myself, but Grue already took the liberty (and, I think, went too far in called it an "abusive block" -- Grue, this is a matter of judgement and I don't think where reasonable people may disagree that it's kosher to call someone abusive). --<a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImprov_b282.html" title="User:Improv">Improv</a> 14:14, 2 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is not minor. Revealing a user's personal information without his or her consent is one of the worst things you could do. Posting personal details in an edit summary is not revertable except by deleting the related page. Grace Note may not want her to be banned because of this, indeed the information may even be bogus, but this shows what this editor is capable of. She's sysop of a site that is anti-Wikipedia. The site logs IP addresses. What's to stop her from doing this again to another editor using the information culled from that site against editors she has a personal grudge against? She has shown no contrition or repentance for her past actions, and shows no evidence of making an attempt to change her behavior. Bottom line is that she doesn't believe that she's done anything wrong and will continue to do so if she is allowed to continue to edit. And if you look at her block log, you'll see a lot of wheel warring and "last chances" have already been given. -- <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalber_d5cd.html" title="User:Malber">Malber</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMalber_7564.html" title="User talk:Malber">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Malber_b734.html" title="Special:Contributions/Malber">contribs</a>) 14:21, 2 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Eh, just to comment on this, Grace Note did create a thread on the old WR forum, specifically regarding his proposal for a new forum, identifying as Grace Note, and including in the text of the thread his gmail address, which includes his alleged name. (I think that this is one of the threads that was "censored" by Igor, however; it's not there anymore, in either case). She shouldn't have stated his name, but really, at this point, the damage it could cause is relatively minor.

<dd>MSK returned yesterday after a month's ban, which started life as an indefinite ban, imposed because she seemed to be here only to cause trouble, and since then, she has edit warred over a user box, recreated it while it was going through deletion review, accused me of vandalism, accused another admin of admin abuse, and posted what she believes are the personal details of an editor, an offense for which people are usually blocked indefinitely.

<p>I decided to go look at MSK's history to see just where things went wrong: About seven and a half hours after she joined.</p>
<p>Her first edit is at 14:19 eastern on December 17. By 15:05 - 46 minutes later - she had plunged head-first into the Londonderry/Derry fight, which is one of those things that is as close to settled law as you can get on Wikipedia, even removing the comment at the top of the page explaining this (first done at 15:08 - other edits were to pages which did not contain this notice). She did this without edit summaries, thus giving the notion of trolling or vandalism. She started dabbling in userboxes at 16:05, 57 minutes later.</p>
<p>In her first edit to her user page at 16:07, and in this first edit she added a box stating she was an administrator. (and a cute "merow" statement) At 21:36, after 5 hours 29 minutes, Sean Black removed it, with the summary "You are not an admin". Two minutes later - having begun editing or left the page before Sean did it - WAvegetarian informed her that it's not good for her to have that box. At 21:44, she responded to him saying "ok sorry&#160;:( removed" and "I doubt I could become an admin since it seems a bit biased towards those who spend nearly ALL THEIR LIFE on wikipedia but who knows, probably not even worth a try though, no?" Time elapsed: 7h25m.</p>
<p>She makes some legitimate edits (in fact, apart from the Derry stuff, all her mainspace edits that I've seen so far seem legitimate), then mentions her new World Citizen userbox on a hundred or so user talk pages. The few responses are all positive.</p>
<p>At 21:47, 3 minutes after her initial response on her talk page, she replies to Sean Black with "You could've at least had the common courtesy to let me do it myself, but the grumpy/oppositional tone "YOU ARE NOT AN ADMIN." suggests doesn't exactly give the impression that you have any, anyway."</p>
<p>7 minutes later, Sean responded apologizing for what could have been seen as a grumpy tone.</p>
<p>Now, before all of this, she had received several vandalism warnings, presumably (I could go through again and check) due to her Derry/Londonderry edits. While I think they should have explained to her the situation, it kind of already was in the comments on Derry. But still, they should have pointed her the way, they were biting a newbie.</p>
<p>MSK, the way I see it, got involved in a fight without reading up on it - forgiveable, as there can be lots and difficult to find documentation on such things. And they bit the newbie by not explaining this to her. However, when she deleted the comment explaining it, that was a bit far. Claiming she was an admin was a poor choice, and Sean did nothing wrong in removing it, and she decided - within 8 hours of joining - that apparently all admins are shutins who have a clique. Either she wasn't a newbie, or she easily resorts to insults. Based on her history since then it just seems like she hunts for fight, but I could be mistaken based on a small sample size.</p>
<p>If MSK truly wishes to contribute - and I do see many legitimate edits - perhaps she should come in with a new name. After all, even NoPuzzleStranger and Gzornenplatz were tolerated until they started exhibiting tell-tale signs of being Wik, which were not positive traits. If it's possible to spend a few months being a good quiet user, then pop up and say "Hi, I'm MSK, I decided to try a new beginning," I'm sure that they would welcome you with open arms. I certainly would. --<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolbez_ce9f.html" title="User:Golbez">Golbez</a> 22:52, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>While I understand that Karmafist believes that this is the only way to fix Wikipedia's ills, in my opinion this will serve to poison WikiPolitics further and give newbies the wrong idea of what we're about. It is a severe violation of <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a> and will undermine our core mission of <i>building an encyclopedia</i>.

<p>I propose to warn Karmafist to cease and desist, followed by a short block for disruption and newbie biting if he continues. This is the least drastic course of action I can think of.

Also, I rather strongly object to the concept of negotiating on this point in some manner. There is community consensus, as I see it, that this is damaging to Wikipedia. I'm not sure, for example, what an RfC would accomplish if he's set on ignoring the thoughtful requests users have already made.

<dd>I think the fact that this is all about <i>a petition</i> is key here. The very concept of a petition is to gather consensus in a structured form. The fact that he's doing a petition suggests that Karmafist has not forgotten about consensus, nor has he stopped caring about it. That's why I think an RfC might work. Once he sees that those disagreeing with his actions isn't a shadowy and mysterious "cabal" but the very heart of the Wikipedia community he cares about... reason will prevail. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 03:41, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm sorry but the opposition isn't shadowy or mysterious, there's been consistent disagreement to this everywhere it's been discussed. It's clear he's acting against the communities approval. I don't see why we should have to jump through another, larger hoop to get him to stop. If Karmafist is interested in consensus he'd respect it and stop. And in any case, gathering a bunch of signatures on a petition, many of which are from new users who don't have the background to make an informed decision, is not consensus making. It's a petition. I'll certainly consider blocking if he starts again. <a href="../../../r/x/_/User%7ERx_StrangeLove_2537.html" title="User:Rx StrangeLove">Rx StrangeLove</a> 04:26, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is <b>not</b> a violation of <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a>, which has to do with responding aggressively (or overly sternly) to newbie mistakes. I'm really sick of people misquoting policies. Calling this "biting the newbies" is like saying:</p>
<ul>
<li>"I get to rewrite policy pages to say that I'm the king, because I'm supposed to <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">be bold</a>."</li>
<li>"I'm allowed to ignore bans and circumvent blocks, because I'm supposed to <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">ignore all rules</a>."</li>
<li>"Anyone who dislikes my edits and says so should be banned, because they're not allowed to make <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a>."</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all well-known <i>abusive tactics</i> here. Accusing Karmafist of violating <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a> when he communicates his views in a friendly way to newbies is the same sort of abusive argumentation. It's either a serious misunderstanding of policy, or a deliberate twisting thereof.</p>
<p>That said, there is a legitimate concern that newbies may believe that Karmafist is speaking for Wikipedia as a whole. People tend to assume (however wrongly) that form letters represent some sort of official recognition. (This thought may come from the same underlying error as "It must be true, it's in the newspaper" but it is still common.)</p>
<p>Out of respect for the independence of editors who <i>don't</i> agree with his positions, Karmafist might consider revising his form letter to explain what he's about ... and that he doesn't purport to represent a known majority. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 04:53, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Saying it violates WP:BITE perhaps goes to far, but perhaps it's not. He's setting up these users to be bitten by thrusting them into his personal battle before they've learned enough about the community to avoid trouble. So while he may not be biting them himself, I think the end result will be the same. It is very important the a users early interaction with the community is positive and cooperative, if it's any other way it will taint their entire involvement with the project. --<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 05:58, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This may not be "letter of the law" WP:BITE, but it's newbie-abuse of a fairly clear and unfortunate sort, and distinctly in the scope of WP:POINT.

<p>Per an <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Netoholic_2_dbb6.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Netoholic 2">ArbCom ruling</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> is serving a 12-month parole, during which time he "is banned from editing in the Wikipedia and template namespaces ... and [is] restricted to one revert per page per day."</p>
<p>Late last year, it was believed that there was a developer mandate to eliminate as many meta-templates as possible, and Netoholic volunteered to rewrite them. As he possessed a level of technical expertise and motivation that others lacked, several arbitrators indicated that the terms of his parole should not be enforced to the letter. Instead, admins were to permit productive edits, enforcing the terms only if Netoholic edited in a manner that we deemed "disruptive."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Netoholic interpreted this as a de facto termination of the parole. He soon began editing (and revert warring on) templates and articles that had nothing to do with the meta-template situation, all the while citing the ArbCom clarification as a license to behave however he pleased. This was largely tolerated (including by me), due to the perceived importance of his work.</p>
<p>Now that we've learned that the great meta-template purge was <i>not</i> developer-mandated or backed by policy, the situation has changed. Nonetheless, Netoholic constantly reminds everyone that the literal terms of his parole remain inapplicable. I'm more than willing to accept that, as I have no desire to block a productive editor on a technicality. The problem is that Netoholic is engaging in precisely the sort of behavior that led to his sanctions in the first place, but he insists that none of his edits rise to the level of "disruption."</p>
<p>Last night (UTC), it came to my attention that Netoholic was revert warring on the article entitled <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Amazing_Race_9_b08f.html" title="The Amazing Race 9">The Amazing Race 9</a>, <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Madchester&amp;diff=41958186" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Madchester&amp;diff=41958186" rel="nofollow">insisting</a></span> that the onus was on the other editor to initiate discussion and justify edits contrary to Netoholic's personal preference. This, in my assessment, was disruptive, so I blocked Netoholic for 24 hours. Netoholic protested the block, and I provided a detailed explanation of my rationale on <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html#Blocked_for_24_hours" title="User talk:Netoholic">his talk page</a>. As I noted, aside from the fact that Netoholic violated his one-revert restriction (in what I deemed a disruptive manner), <i><b>any</b></i> editor can be blocked for repeatedly revert warring, even if the 3RR (which is not an entitlement) isn't violated.</p>

<p>Snowspinner did not address any of my comments on the matter, nor did he make any attempt to contact me or discuss the situation. Instead, he immediately assumed bad faith on my part and "overturned" my decision. I feel that this was extremely inappropriate—not merely because it's a breach of decorum, but mainly because it further undermines all efforts to enforce the spirit of Netoholic's parole (and reinforces his apparent belief that he possesses some sort of immunity).</p>
<p>This is extremely frustrating, as it appeared at one time that Netoholic actually was beginning to reform. I honestly believe that he has the potential to become one of our most valuable contributors. By tolerating his misdeeds, we actively encourage his recidivism, and that's a shame. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 06:39, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You violated consensus on the page David blocked you for edit warring. According to Finding of Fact #7, this is one of the forms of misbehavior that led to the prior case. And, whatever the arbitrators "intended", the actual decision does indeed set not only a 1RR, but a blanket ban on editing in certain namespaces: "<i>Netoholic is banned from editing in the Wikipedia and template namespaces for twelve months, and restricted to one revert per page per day.</i>" Given that the offensive behavior continues, and that Netoholic has very few such contributions that do <i>not</i> involve troublemaking or edit warring, I see no reason why this should not be fully enforced. <tt><a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrotalus_horridus_5cc6.html" title="User:Crotalus horridus">Crotalus horridus</a> <small>(<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECrotalus_horridus_e0ed.html" title="User talk:Crotalus horridus">TALK</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Crotalus_horridus_e95d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Crotalus horridus">CONTRIBS</a>)</small></tt> 07:32, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(ec)On the face of it, it appears to me that it would have been preferable if a) the 1RR vio had been reported, and enforced by a neutral admin, and not by someone who is, or even could be accused of being, "involved"; and b) the block had not been reversed without prior communication (which is in fact WWing by the definition the arbcom have on at least one occasion used).

<dd>Netoholic has stepped on quite a few toes, and I don't believe that it's reasonable to expect all admins with whom he's ever engaged in a conflict to recuse themselves. If I'd been looking for an excuse to block him, it certainly wouldn't have taken me this long. But in fact, this was something that I've gone out of my way to avoid doing until now.

<p>To be clear, my objection to the block is that it is unbecoming of an administrator with a history of conflict with a user to start using their administrative powers to enforce rulings on users, particularly rulings that the arbcom has indicated are in a relatively narrow class where tehy should only be enforced when Netoholic is being disruptive. To treat any time he gets into a revert war as blockable disruption is to construe the ruling, to my mind, very broadly and harshly - something that may be fair, but should be done by someone more uninvolved than I consider David to be. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Phil Sandifer</a> 07:42, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you actually read the comments in question (linked from Netoholic's talk page), it's clear that the arbitrators created a narrow <i>exception</i> (to enable the template rewrites that were considered very important at that time). I'm more than willing to apply that exception to <i><b>any</b></i> productive editing, but revert warring doesn't fit that description. It <i>is</i> disruptive, and an admin doesn't even need an ArbCom ruling to block over this type of behavior pattern.</dd>

<dd>OK. I've left a message for both of them. Afshar's legal threats were quite strongly worded, so I made it clear that he now has the choice of withdrawing them or being blocked.

<dd>My original block of Rose-mary was intended to be 24h. It would have expired by now, but the issue of the socks confuses it; as said above, R-M has routinely evaded the block with a new IP.

<dd>on AOL IPs, maybe. This particular ISP does not have much activity on en:. In any case, sprotection will be for days and weeks, rangeblocks will be in half-hour intervals for as long as Rose-mary keeps reconnecting.

<dd><b>No sysop powers were used</b> in the edits described. I removed discussion to the Talk page where it belonged, and struck two endorsements with reasons given (for example, users with no edit history who admit to using multiple accounts and who have taken no part in attempting to resolve a dispute (other than personal abuse against its subject) are not normally accepted as appropriate to endorse an RfC). These actions can be reviewed and revised by the community if they see fit, in the ususal way. The RfC is vexatious and quite likely a violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> but some of us at least are trying to ensure process is followed.</dd>

<dd>Oh, <i>that</i>. That, too, is visible to anyone who cares to look, open to scrutiny and reversal by other admins.

The best one was when he used one of his sock puppets to send me a Wikipedia email protesting innocence and asking for it to be unblocked, <i>from an address on his own domain!</i> It has been asserted that some new users go for weeks or even months without attempting to whitewash a single article on a Southern Baptist or unaccredited school, but they are not much in evidence hereabouts. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 23:15, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I have tried to reason with him in <a href="../../../g/m/a/User_talk%7EGmaxwell_8678.html" title="User talk:Gmaxwell">User talk:Gmaxwell</a>, but his response is that since I don't look kindly upon his vandalism, he's going to continue vandalizing my userpage. I have shown that there's no Wikipedia policy to justify his vandalism, but he won't listen. He has been harassing me constantly, and vandalizing my userpage minutes after I've fixed it. He then disregarded the final warning vandalism template, saying that basically he does't care, and believes that he can vandalize my page. It's my page and he cannot fiddle around with it as if it was a Wikipedia article.

I'd really like to discuss his userpage with him, and I've made a polite attempt. MSTCrow continues to respond with hostility. I honestly believe his userpage is harmful, and I'd really like him to explain why it isn't. It isn't a typical userpage, so please read the complete discussion between him and I before passing judgment. Because MSTCrow was refusing to even consider making some changes, it left me no choice but to make changes in the hope of either causing an improvement or starting a real discussion. I'm not trying to prevent him from having userboxes, although I think that whatever he does have should be presented in a way which makes them secondary to the purpose of his userpage. I'm willing, and even eager to discuss and compromise with him... but ultimately there is nothing special about the user namespace which excludes it from the normal editing process. No one gets the right to unilateral set the content of any page on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 15:56, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's not vandalism, (athough be careful about the 3RR) but why do you care so much what one person does with their user page? I can see where you're coming from and understand your oppostion, but is this realy worth disrupting peace between users? It's not lke Deeceevoice's page or something. Just leave him alone and all will be well. Why fight this battle?Gator (talk) 19:54, 1 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's not about any one particular user... I've cleaned up a great many 'user pages' which were created by people who have never edited the encyclopedia (i.e. they showed up, threw up some links to their website and never used their account again). I completed the backlog of those some time ago. After having discussions with a number of people, it became clear to me that highly unprofessional userpages by active users have a potential to be harmful to the project... so I plan on having a conversation with the user attached to each one I encounter. Because of the effort required to carefully discuss and consider each situation I intend to only talk to one person at a time. I believe User:MSTCrow is special to some extent (although it is not unique) because in addition to the high level of unprofessional looking and potentially offensive content it had no balancing content related to MSTCrow's work on the project. I hope that, in the future, my interactions on this subject will be completely friendly and non-disruptive... and I intend to work hard on ensuring that, but there will still be some users who respond to a polite, compassionate, and well considered request to consider altering or accepting alterations to their userpage with contempt and incivility. In such, hopefully rare, cases we may have to ask ourselves, ultimately, "Is this the sort of person we want contributing to our project?". ... but that is a question that goes far beyond me, all I can do is try to cooperate with people to improve things. --<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 20:46, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've tried to tidy up the page a little, and I've made the Jenna Orkin link and quote invisible (which is the quote Walter is objecting to) in part because I couldn't find that actual quote in the article she wrote, but also because it's not clear that, as the parent of a 9/11 victim, she would count as a reliable published third-party source within the terms of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>.

<dd>Probably never. Wikipedia is still the encyclopedia that anyone can edit. Requiring people to register doesn't do anything to prevent plagiarism. On the other hand, I'm starting to think that AOL proxy IPs should be blocked.

At the time, it contained only three names, each a red link. I deleted it under A1 and heard from Jooler right away.

<p>I'd like a couple things. First, a sanity check on my actions (was I a dick?), and second, a brief discussion about peerage articles. Do we really have flocks of essentially empty articles filled with nothing but red-links, and is that really kosher?

<dd>The version that exists now is quite good. The version that you deleted was bloody worthless.

<dd>Generally speaking, the notability of an individual title is asserted in two ways: inclusion within a larger project, and because the notability of peers is asserted on the ground that they were members of a sovereign legislature. Jooler could have behaved better, but deleting this kind of article after five minutes, when its creator is an established editor isn't particularly friendly action. It would have been a good faith action on your part to communicate with him first. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 19:57, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If someone is an established editor, they should know what constitues a proper article- A list of three internal links to articles that don't exist is not a proper article, it has no context.

<p>&lt;edit conflict&gt; - Chairboy - answers - yes and yes. Golbez - "The version that you deleted was bloody worthless" - that version was a single edit and it was deleted less than 5 minutes after it was created. The rest of the information was being collated at the time that it was deleted. I apologise for my tone to Chairboy, but his action was out line line, if only for ignorance. As a long established editor, I don't like to be patronised and talked to as if I just stumbled across this site yesterday. &lt;added later&gt;. Sean I do not read Wikipedia policy documents for fun but I seem to recollect that there is some rule of thumb about allowing articles to develop before deleting them out of hand, and I don't seem to recall any ruling that says that an article should be created in a single edit. Thank you. Additionally the "claim" of "no context" is pure rot. The title of the article is Viscount Ranelagh and I listed three people who held that title, while I went off to research the rest of it. This bears no relation to the example on <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> on <b>A1</b> and clearly it DOES confirm to the part which says <i>Limited content is not in itself a reason to delete if there is enough context to allow expansion. A search engine may help in determining context and allow for the article's expansion.</i>.

<dd>Come on. It didn't even have a sentence explaining the significance to the article's title. There's no excuse for not writing something (anything! One sentence would suffice) explaining what the article is about.

If you care to google it you will discover that there is no single reliable source for this specific of information, and I had to go off and research it. What was the article about? it was about the title and the people who held it, like every other peerage page, it is self-evident. <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJooler_fb16.html" title="User:Jooler">Jooler</a> 21:28, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"That version was a single edit and it was deleted less than 5 minutes after it was created." I might be alone here, but I prefer that the first edit be self-sustainable. I don't know if I've ever created a CSD-worthy stub. Telling people "Just wait 10 more minutes for my next edit!" doesn't work for me - spend that extra ten minutes on the article <i>before</i> you click "submit". If you can't be bothered to do that, why should we be bothered to wait? Now, personally, I would have <i>probably</i> let it sit in a tab and come back to it a few minutes later to see if it had matured, and if not, then I would have probably deleted it. The title alone does not generate context. This might just be me, but to quote the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soup_Nazi_b05d.html" title="Soup Nazi">Soup Nazi</a>, I expect perfection of myself, why should I expect less of others?&#160;:) --<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolbez_ce9f.html" title="User:Golbez">Golbez</a> 21:07, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You're not alone, but as I noted above, not everyone does everything in the first edit. There's no need to delete something like this quickly. It's not doing any harm, has the potential to establish context, and did so quite quickly.

</dd>
<dd>If I'd known about the problem I'd have dealt with it? How am I to know of a stub needing attention when it gets speedied five minutes after creation? I think a better solution might have been listing it on <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">WP:PROD</a>. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 21:55, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Indeed a simple assumption of good faith and a quick Google (as per WP:CSD) would have shown that the article had potential. I might also argue that the incident has been an education for Chairboy as to the significance of the <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peerage.html" title="Peerage">peerage</a>.

<dd>"Us" is the key word here. There's no way someone who doesn't know as much about the peerage as you do could at all comprehend the article.--<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESean_Black_d709.html" title="User:Sean Black">Sean Black</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/e/a/User_talk%7ESean_Black_aa92.html" title="User talk:Sean Black"><font color="#FC0FC0">(talk)</font></a></sup> 21:50, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So it's okay to delete something because you know nothing about it? Okay of course it isn't and it isn't what you meant. British history is part of your history aswell.

<dd>No, that has a sentence explaining what the article is. That's context.

<dd>"wouldn't make any sort of sense to those who don't have a detailed knowledge of the peerage" - <i>and should therefore be deleted!? because of the administrator's ignorance of his own history</i> - perhaps that is what you are saying! In any case - Sentence what sentence? I see nothing more than a repetition of the title of the article and "since statehood" - so you say perhaps that if I had put "Since creation" and repeated "Viscount Ranelagh" - I would have been safe? Because that would have "given context". Am I correct? &lt;added later&gt; - BTW you are looking at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Governors_of_Hawaii&amp;oldid=1183636" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Governors_of_Hawaii&amp;oldid=1183636" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Governors_of_Hawaii&amp;oldid=1183636</a> rather than the current version arn't you? <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJooler_fb16.html" title="User:Jooler">Jooler</a> 22:27, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>Danmeister posts prolifically on various anime-related articles and <a href="../../../m/a/i/Talk%7EMain_Page_649b.html" title="Talk:Main Page">Talk:Main Page</a> in the form of orders that people MUST write about certain fictional junk for him, with lots of exclamation points. If you read these messages, it seems that they aren't even addressed to Wikipedians -- they're <i>addressed to fictional characters</i>. Danmeister doesn't just not understand what Wikipedia is, he seems to not understand what the real world is.</p>
<p>He pays no attention to messages left on his talk page, or the fact that his messages get reverted for being off-topic. Is it appropriate for him to be blocked for spamming talk pages with off-topic messages? <a href="../../../r/s/p/User%7ERspeer_418c.html" title="User:Rspeer"><b><span style="color: #63f;">r</span><span style="color: #555;">speer</span></b></a> / <a href="../../../r/s/p/User_talk%7ERspeer_a656.html" title="User talk:Rspeer"><span style="color: #555;">ɹəəds</span><span style="color: #63f;">ɹ</span></a> 21:25, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is the sort of thing that makes me sad. He's probably just an enthusiastic kid who doesn't quite understand what's going on here. Oh well.

<p>I recently reported <a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELaszloWalrus_c9d2.html" title="User:LaszloWalrus">LaszloWalrus</a> for a 3RR violation caused by edit-warring on <a href="../../../a/y/n/Ayn_Rand_c548.html" title="Ayn Rand">Ayn Rand</a>. As a result, he got banned, the page was Protected, and I was banned, too. He moved the edit war to <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objectivism_and_homosexuality.html" title="Objectivism and homosexuality">Objectivism and homosexuality</a>, which I got Protected before anyone got banned. The Protection from <a href="../../../a/y/n/Ayn_Rand_c548.html" title="Ayn Rand">Ayn Rand</a> was lifted just now, with a suggestion from <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> that I took as a ruling on the initial issue. Unfortunately, Lazslo's immediate response was to ignore it and edit war some more. It hasn't gotten to 3RR yet and I don't want it to.</p>
<p>As per the suggestion on top, I won't rant on, but if you need links to relevant areas, just ask. My request is that he be banned for a substantial period of time. A one-day ban did nothing to slow him down. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a> 01:42, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm dealing with this case. It's just a silly edit war and I'll block both parties if they persist. And I've told them this. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 02:01, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Great, you're dealing with it. What do you recommend now?</p>
<p>He won't Talk, he won't leave the category alone. Should I let him get his way or should I try to fix the category and get us both banned? I think there's a third solution, and it's up to an admin to implement it. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a> 02:07, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Both of these editors are playing silly buggers so I've blocked them for three hours to give them a chance to contemplate the effect that their intransigence has had on the three articles they're edit warring over.</p>
<p>As is my custom, I subject this block to review. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 02:58, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To clarify, these two editors were warring on <a href="../../../a/y/n/Ayn_Rand_c548.html" title="Ayn Rand">Ayn Rand</a>, <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objectivism_and_homosexuality.html" title="Objectivism and homosexuality">Objectivism and homosexuality</a>, and a completely unconnected article <a href="../../../r/o/d/Rodeo_Drive_ab72.html" title="Rodeo Drive">Rodeo Drive</a>. It was clear therefore that the problem lay with two editors who seem to believe that they have an intrinsic right to edit war. Asking them clearly to stop edit warring, warning them both of the consequences of continuing, had no effect at all. These three hour blocks are to stop the immediate bad behavior, and to show that I'm not bluffing about consequences. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 14:37, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
