<dd>BernardL (and the IP addresses) haven't edited <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noam_Chomsky_7341.html" title="Noam Chomsky">Noam Chomsky</a> since the request was made here. Since he stopped edit warring more than two days ago, there's little point in blocking. The 3RR is meant to throw cold water on edit wars in progress, not to punish afterwards.</dd>
<dd>It is also customary to warn users on their talk pages that a 3RR violation has been posted here—particularly new users who may not be familiar with the policy. (I have now done this.) I consider the matter closed. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 04:36, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I have no involvement in this, but it is has been showing up on my watchlist all day. Boothy kept trying to redirect his talk page, which was seen as hostile. --<a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 02:29, July 22, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think it's proper for Boothy to redirect his talk page to another page, but since he has stopped doing that I don't see any problem here. Not a blockable violation, anyway. It's his talk page, he can revert it as many times as he likes. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 03:10, July 22, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Gads. Poor behaviour all around here, really. Wikipedia:Sheep vote for a while <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Sheep_vote&amp;diff=15384014&amp;oldid=15366897" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Sheep_vote&amp;diff=15384014&amp;oldid=15366897" rel="nofollow">incorporated a section</a> that might be taken as an attack on Boothy443. Boothy443–instead of editing or VfDing Wikipedia:Sheep vote–redirected his User Talk page there, which led to the edit war over his redirection.</dd>
<dd>I'm not sure what point Boothy443 is trying to make. I would suggest that we cut him some slack since a) he was made fun of, and b) it's in his userspace. That said, he should be strongly cautioned <i>not</i> to redirect his User Talk page, as it makes it very difficult for other users to communicate with him.</dd>
<dd>I also wish that he would at least explain what point he's trying to make with his votes at <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFA_4c83.html" title="WP:RFA">WP:RFA</a>; it might reduce some of the bad feelings that surround him. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 03:09, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Pastorrussell has been persistently removing any dispute tag from the article. I've been holding off on reporting in the hopes that talk-page discussion would resolve the issue, but the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Charles_Taze_Russell&amp;diff=19359101&amp;oldid=19358469" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Charles_Taze_Russell&amp;diff=19359101&amp;oldid=19358469" rel="nofollow">most recent edit</a> by Pastorrussell indicates that would be futile.</li>

<p>He reveted more then three times without taking part of the discussion. I told him to take part of the discussion but he ignored. When I send him a message to his talk page he erased my message <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ATheathenae&amp;diff=19330806&amp;oldid=19330646" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ATheathenae&amp;diff=19330806&amp;oldid=19330646" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, this is also clearly a violation and trying to total ignore discussion and revert articles in his own way. He was made aware about this later that it is against policy to delate others message they send to him. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ATheathenae&amp;diff=19334418&amp;oldid=19330806" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ATheathenae&amp;diff=19334418&amp;oldid=19330806" rel="nofollow">User talk:MacGyverMagic</a> gaved him a warning.

As far as blocking, the 3RR policy states, <b>In the cases where multiple parties violate the rule, administrators should treat all sides equally.</b> You all seem to be having an edit war, and may want to try the dispute resolution process.</dd>

<dd>Hi Phil, the diffs don't seem to show evidence of three or more reverts to a previous version.

<dd>Three are marked as "revert" in the edit summary while the fourth is marked as "correcting thumbnail" (but in effect reverts content previously reverted if you see the other diffs). The policy states "do not revert any single page more than three times in any 24 hour period", and that is what Copperchair did. — <b><a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Phil</a></b> <i><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">Welch</a></i> 00:00, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>This is a ridiculous nomination. Those four edits reverts instantnood cited were punctured by small edits he made, so I dont think it constitutes a continous case of reverts by both parties. Secondly, while this revert war was sparked when he attempted to add a contentious line <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_companies_in_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China&amp;diff=19153954&amp;oldid=19151992" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_companies_in_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China&amp;diff=19153954&amp;oldid=19151992" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>, he subsequently tried to do a roll back to a "prior to the dispute"...which was way before the offending edit...and a version he prefers. That version, however, is erroneous, as it was the state of the article before it was subsequently renamed. I therefore found it neccesary to bring it back to the state which was accepted by <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbinder_d348.html" title="User:Dbinder">User:Dbinder</a> and me, but not by him.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 08:54, 24 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The notice I added is not contentious. Similar notices exist on other articles and lists on mainland China-related topics. This list should not be an exception. The discussion was not sparked off but that edit, but rather, was a continuation of previous discussions. The title of the list was changed, but the change itself has never been justified. It should not be taken as an opportunity to push a point of view to change the limits of the content of the list, claiming to be editing according to the new title. Further, the edits to the list I made were not small edits, and Huaiwei did make 4 reverts within a 24-hour period. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 09:46, July 24, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is certainly contentious, and you know that full well. You added the notice out of spite and to express unhappiness that the page title was changed, so you are using that as an excuse and a cover up for your disruptive behavior. If the page title refers to the PRC, then the page should address it. The notice is only needed if this is contrary to that. Since the various editors has hence tweaked the page to better reflect its title, I do not see why this should be reverted? As a matter of fact, you are the one "limiting" the scope of the article to only refer to Mainland China, and not others. As for small edits, mind telling us what this edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_companies_in_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China&amp;diff=19494057&amp;oldid=19494017" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_companies_in_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China&amp;diff=19494057&amp;oldid=19494017" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> is for? My four reverts you refer all involve a revert of a different version, which I was forced to make because you kept trying to use the 3RR rule to manipulate the situation.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 10:39, 24 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Your accusations are speculative. You know very well what are the similar notices I mentioned, and what articles have such notices. I was not the one to limit the scope. Please be reminded what the list was created for. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 10:50, July 24, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And ditto to your accusations against me. You know full well about the content disputes with regards to the usage of the words <a href="../../../m/a/i/Mainland_China_7f88.html" title="Mainland China">Mainland China</a>, and you have had 2 arbcoms (or was it 3?) against you related to your persistent attempts in pushing your POV, of which the issues over Mainland China was one of them. I dont think you are adding them merely to follow some kind of "template" in other pages, because the entire usage of it was under dispute. By calling a PRC article a Mainland Chinese one, you are indeed limiting its scope...there is no way around that. And I dont quite understand what you mean by "Please be reminded what the list was created for."? So what was it for besides what it is for now?--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 11:07, 24 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am not pushing my POV in editing this list. Rather, I was reverting to what the list was intended for before the disputes took place, which may or may not be representing my point of view (as a matter of fact I do the same for other articles, no matter it's related to the mainland China debate or not). I do not limit its scope, but rolling back to what it was like before the dispute. The notice I added is similar to other articles.<br />
The ArbCom cases are irrelevant here. The first one was not opened against anybody. It was a case that a few parties were involved. The second case was a continuation of the first. It was reopened because the first case was closed without following the standard procedures, and therefore has to be reopened due to technical reasons.<br />
The issue here on this noticeboard remains, that is, Huaiwei made four reverts within a 24-hour period. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 11:48, July 24, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Reported by: --gbambino 23:45, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Gbambino seems to have falsified the times above as they do not actually correspond to the edit history. Several of the "reversions" he notes above are not reversions but consecutive edits (unless it is gbambino's contention that I reverted myself.) If there is a penalty for making a false report, it should be applied to Gbambino. Homey 00:31, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>A look at the heading at the top of the right-hand column in each 'history' will reveal that the times are accurate. As for the distinction between a simple edit and a revert, the evidence speaks for itself. --gbambino 00:36, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>A look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Monarchy_in_Canada&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Monarchy_in_Canada&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">the article's edit history</a> will show that the times above do not correspond. As for the distinction between an edit and a revert, "revert 1" shows that I was the editor of both "before" and "after" versions hence it is not a reversion. Homey 00:42, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Whoops, while the times above are wrong and gbambino's first "revert" is not one a look at the actual history shows that I have reverted 4X in 24 hours. My apologies. I will revert to gbambino's last edit . Homey 00:46, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>If you look through "Bee Hive"'s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Bee_Hive" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Bee_Hive" rel="nofollow">contribution page</a> you will notice that the entirety of his content consists of a package of reversions and deletions of material which I have contributed. This goes back to yesterday, before which he had done nothing. Now if you go to the contribution page of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Ruy_Lopez" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Ruy_Lopez" rel="nofollow">Ruy Lopez</a> you can see the same general sets of reverts for the 22nd and before. So essentially it is simply that mass reverts are being used to attempt to confound any contributions I make by one user. However, he has clearly crossed another line here and knows better. --<a href="../../../t/j/i/User%7ETJive_a615.html" title="User:TJive">TJive</a> 02:17, July 25, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Was originally an anonymous user who would keep on reverting then made an account calling him/herself the "Truth Comission [sic]." He continues to revert to a version that is inaccurate about actual Filipino ethnicity. The source he uses to back up his argument is from 1916. I have given him more recent sources, but he keeps pressing on. Any action would be appreciated.

<p>I've unblocked Jay. I looked at other edits when I was checking Zen-master's block. What you're calling a fourth revert was not a revert to a previous version of the page, or anything like it. Jay wanted there to be no tag on the article. In tagging it and linking to the discussion (which is what Zen-master wanted), yet making it clear there had been a consensus, it seems to me that Jay came up with a compromise text.</p>

<p>I've already been unblocked, and commented on your talk: page; I'll reproduce it here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi Cburnett. Regarding your note on my page, no-one is "compelled to revert", and there is no such policy as "being in line with the spirit of the 3RR". Moreover, I was dead set against there being any notice at the top of the page; however, when Zen Master insisted on there being a notice, I felt a reasonable compromise was to leave a notice indicating that there was a conflict, but at least an accurate one indicating the true state of affairs. I appreciate that you were only attempting to enforce policy, but it's best to enforce pre-existing policies rather than creating new ones on the fly, and especially (as happened in this case) when the facts are prone to misinterpretation. Still, no hard feelings, keep up the good work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I pointed out, my position is there should be no notice at the top; a compromise is a notice indicating there is a conflict, but an accurate one. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 02:11, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Oh, and if one could block based on the "spirit of edit wars", then one could block a person who does even one revert in a day, if it represented a revert in a longstanding edit war. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 02:13, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Cburnett, Zen-master violated 3RR, but Jayjg did not, so there's no reason the latter should stay blocked. Jayjg's fourth edit was an attempt to reach a compromise. He added the tag that Zen-master wanted (which Jayjg didn't want). He included a link to the poll on conspiracy theory, which Zen-master also wanted (and Jayjg didn't want). Jayjg modified the tag Zen-master wanted by making it clear that a consensus on the term conspiracy theory had been reached, which is accurate. It's not a revert to any previous version of the page, in whole or in part, in letter or in spirit. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 02:16, July 26, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Accurate is a POV thing and zen-master clearly disagrees.

<p>Zen-master's reversions of attempted compromises is his own issue, not mine, and I can't believe you fail to grasp the fact that when you start making up "spirit of the policy" rules based on dubious interpretations of evidence, you open up the rule for blocks on just about any grounds. The 3RR is fairly narrow and mechanistic precisely to avoid this sort of admin abuse. And I must say, getting involved in this dispute on your own, by blocking me and restoring Zen-master's version, is actually a far clearer violation of policy than your allegations that I violated the "spirit" of 3RR. I'm still trying to maintain the view that you made the block in good faith, but it's getting increasingly difficult. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 02:27, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Cburnett, the 3RR rule is clear. It doesn't matter whether Jay's edit was accurate or not (that's just an added bonus). We're not allowed to revert to a previous version of the page more than three times in 24 hours, in whole or in part. The quality of the edit is irrelevant, except where it's vandalism.</dd>

There may be some confusion over whether a majority vote equals consensus, over 10 users voted on <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConspiracy_theory_5aa7.html" title="Wikipedia:Conspiracy theory">Wikipedia:Conspiracy theory</a> that "conspiracy theory" titled articles are a problem, this is more than enough to signify the basis of an {NPOV} dispute. And cburnett noted, as I have, on <a href="../../../a/i/d/Talk%7EAIDS_conspiracy_theories_0821.html" title="Talk:AIDS conspiracy theories">Talk:AIDS conspiracy theories</a> or to me on irc that he read the talk page and coulnd't find an alleged consensus for the removal of the disputed header. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 02:30, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You put the notice on the page 2 1/2 months ago, attempted to get the name changed, and could get no consensus for that. The vote was 32 to 12 in favour of keeping "conspiracy theory". You've since held the page hostage with an ugly notice on the top, despite having it removed by half a dozen editors. Notices aren't forever, and the consensus was to keep the name. This is an encyclopedia, not a forum where individual editors can permantely disfigure articles because they don't like the name and can't accept consensus. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 02:38, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Dispute headers are not removed when there is simply a majority (or else they would always be removed), they are removed when there are no arguably legitimate neutrality disputes in existence. Did you catch my response to willmcw's similar holding the page "hostage" point on the talk page? That is precisely why i created the nice looking "Notice: there is a neutrality dispute involving this article's title" header, to avoid charges of "ugly" header, it looks exactly the same as a disambig notice. When you say "consensus" I think you mean "majority"? <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 02:47, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dispute headers aren't forever, POV summaries masquerating as disambig notices are ugly. You've repeated your claim that headers are only removed when there is no "legitimate dispute", but this is clearly completely bogus, as everyone thinks their dispute is legitimate, yet individuals cannot hold pages hostage. As for consensus, yes, on Wikipedia consensus is measured by a significant majority, which this has. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 03:14, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The lack of discussion by the "pro" side is not evidence there is no dispute. How is headers are only removed when there is no legitimate neutrality dispute "completely bogus"? It is a de facto wikipedia policy that the {NPOV} header is only removed when there is unanimous consensus to do so, why shouldn't that extend to other dispute headers/notices? The removal of disputed headers from articles is certainly not measured by a majority on wikipedia. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 03:24, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Should I now block you for, based on, as you put it, the "spirit" and "purpose" of the 3RR: <i>...the 3RR is intended as a means to stop edit wars...</i>, since, as you've said above, your edits did not (clearly) have the intention of quelling the edit war, and your "compromise" was no compromise at all, but merely stated your side of the edit war?

<dd>Blocking zen-master keeps him from participating in the discussion about his blockage since it is not being held on his talk page. If blocked users could respond where the request was made, here, then I wholly wouldn't have unblocked him. His promise to me continues the penalty for violating the 3RR so the punishment hasn't been stayed, only removing the censoring of defending himself where the discussion is taking place. By all means, if he edits an article for not honoring his promise to me...then block him. I'm willing to assume good faith so that he may discuss being blocked. (or this entire conversation can be moved to his talk page, where discussion will remain, and then blocked again less the time since he was blocked) <a href="../../../c/b/u/User%7ECburnett_adfd.html" title="User:Cburnett">Cburnett</a> 02:49, July 26, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You're out of line here, Cburnett.</p>

<li>You got involved in a violation report I was dealing with without discussing it with me, though if you'd checked, you'd have seen I was online.</li>
<li>You blocked an editor (and fellow admin) for a 3RR violation which the diffs show clearly he did not make.</li>
<li>Though you blocked the reporting editor for a non-existent violation, you then <i>unblocked</i> the other editor, who has a history of violations, blocks, and aggressive revert-warring, even though the diffs show a violation.</li>
<li>You've chastised the reporting editor for wasting time bothering with the violation report, even though it was a legitimate report.</li>
<li>You've now involved yourself in the content dispute by reverting back to your preferred version.</li>

<dd>In regards to slimvirgin's points:
<ul>
<li>Only because he can't be heard. Users have been granted posting rights to there talk pages to address being blocked. He did and nothing happened. He sent 4 emails to admins trying to get discussion: including one to you SlimVirgin. Nothing happened. Clearly you, the one dealing with it wasn't paying attention to your email nor his talk page.</li>
<li>Blocking involves admin discretion and I exercised it on jayjg. "discretion", by definition, does not guarantee everyone will agree.</li>
<li>I explained this: I am assuming good faith on zen-master's part and, so far, he has upheld his promise of not editing articles.</li>
<li>I "chastised" (to use your word) not because he made the report, but he failed to address my points at <a href="../../../a/i/d/Talk%7EAIDS_conspiracy_theories_0821.html" title="Talk:AIDS conspiracy theories">Talk:AIDS conspiracy theories</a> despite having viewed the page; seeing <i>I</i> put the tag back; and either not bothering to look at the talk page or not caring to answer me.</li>
<li>I have only done one revert to an anonymous user taking pot shots at me (which is all I intend on doing) and have called for Calton to join the discussion on the talk page after he reverted my compromise notice (which by your's and jayjg's isn't anything resembling a revert).</li>

<p>Particularly the admins among you—all of you know better than to make <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a>, engage in <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlock_war_90ed.html" title="Wikipedia:Block war">block wars</a>, <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume bad faith</a>, violate the <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">three-revert rule</a>, and in general engage in poor <a href="../../../d/i/c/WP%7EDICK_0b34.html" title="WP:DICK">behaviour</a> all around.</p>
<p>Zen-master was obviously reverting. The net result of each cited edit was to add a neutrality warning regarding the title. Regardless of the slightly different phrasing each time, his intent was clear. Even if we were to be picky about the letter of the 3RR, I would still count it as disruption—gaming the system isn't to be rewarded.</p>
<p>Jayjg was also reverting. Cleverly restating the template to nullify its meaning is obviously an intended revert. As an admin, he should know not to try to bend the rules that way. The ugly tone he's taking with Cburnett isn't helping; in fact it's probably inflamed things much more than necessary.</p>
<p>Cburnett, next time try to directly contact SlimVirgin yourself. You <i>know</i> that Zen-master had been participating in an edit war (you may not know he's also before the ArbCom), and it would have been courteous to drop SV a note before undoing the block.</p>
<p>SlimVirgin, it probably would have made sense to try to contact Cburnett before undoing Jayjg's block (my apologies if you did do so). Jayjg <i>was</i> engaged in naughty behaviour and shouldn't have been edit warring.</p>

In addition, if I'd brought Zen-master to WP:AN/3RR for his first four edits, <b>nobody</b> would have blocked him for "disrupting" or "gaming the spirit of the rule". That includes you, and Cburnett.

Using different dissputed tags is a fairly standard way of gameing the 3RR however it can also be a legit attempt to compramise (eg "ok I conside that there are not factual errors in the article but I still don't think it is NPOV"). In the case of zen master I feel that TitleDisputed and NPOV-title are close enogh to warrent a block. Jayjg has 3 reverts followed by a clasic edit waring technique (in a more typical POV disspute it involves creating an ultra POV version of the page that your oponent is pretty much forced to revert then you simply produce your closer to NPOV version 3 times). I think that counts as gameing the rule.

<p>I have a new question, it's wikipedia policy that dispute headers are added to articles if there is an in good faith neutrality dispute. Does this policy supersede "revert" considerations? Has there been any evidence presented by the pro remove dispute header folks that there is not a good faith neutrality dispute in this case (rhetoric doesn't count)? It should also be noted that the {TitleDisputed} template was in the article for 2 months with numerous users agreeing there is a neutrality dispute:</p>

</ul>
<p>Willmcw and Jayjg briefly argued that dispute headers are ugly and shouldn't be left in an article indefinitely (apparently they give no consideration for the possibility that the neutrality dispute continues) so I switched to simple text similiar to a disambig notice that describes the exact nature of the dispute, it can even be reworded to something like "Notice: a minority of editors allege the phrase 'conspiracy theory' biases the presentation of this subject, see the talk page for details".

<dd>By what policy are neutrality dispute headers added and removed from articles? If there is no clear policy for their removal then all we have to work from is the clear policy for their addition. There are three editors listed right above that agree with my complaint, and many more on the talk page historically. The <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConspiracy_theory_5aa7.html" title="Wikipedia:Conspiracy theory">Wikipedia:Conspiracy theory</a> policy proposal was only to remove "conspiracy theory" titles (which received greater than 25% support, so there was no consensus either way by some metrics). But more importantly no where in the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConspiracy_theory_5aa7.html" title="Wikipedia:Conspiracy theory">Wikipedia:Conspiracy theory</a> counter proposal was it noted that was an opposite policy proposal for "conspiracy theory" to be considered perfect in every title situation going forward. A negative vote against one policy proposal does not automatically create an opposite policy, especially when not explicitly noted. After the vote we simply returned to the status quo before the policy was proposed, i.e. neutrality considerations are still used to determine titles and content on a case by case basis. Going forward, perhaps we should jointly write up a new policy proposal (and request voting) on whether or not "majority" equals "consensus" when it comes to neutrality disputes? And separately exactly what concerns do you see with merely signifying, using NPOV language, the existence of a minority view as far as presenting a controversial issue goes? For example the following simple text at the top: "Notice: a minority of editors allege the phrase 'conspiracy theory" biases the presentation of this subject, see the talk page for details"? <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 17:01, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your statement seems to contradict the use of {NPOV} and other dispute headers generally, wikipedia is a freely accessible community encyclopedia, not just an encyclopedia. In your view what is the point of {NPOV} and other headers? it seems to me they were designed to signify the minority disputes some aspect of an article, do you agree? Currently {NPOV} headers point to an ever changing talk page everywhere they are used so I don't understand your point there, the key metric in my mind is the in good faith status of the dispute. If the point with the generic headers is to signify some sort of dispute then why not instead mention, using NPOV language, the specific details of the dispute rather than use an "ugly" header as you've noted previously? <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 18:23, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But by what policy are dispute headers removed even assuming there is a time based limitation? There is in fact no exact policy or process on removal, but there is a clear policy that headers are added if there is an in good faith dispute by the minority, and there is clearly one in this case. That is the core point of having {NPOV} headers -- you do realize they are rarely ever removed (without controversy) from an article if the article remains largely the same or continues to present the issue the same way over the course of two months or however long? Time doesn't magically make in good faith allegations of neutrality violations go away, you have to actually prove the header was added or even re-added in bad faith, that is the current policy. I am not proposing a permanent header be added, I am proposing a specific minority allegation header be added to note the exact details of the dispute to encourage discussion on the talk page to reach true 100% consensus. Do I interpret correctly you are not interested in going ahead with a community proposal to officially determine whether majority equals consensus in header dispute cases despite the numerous times you've errantly claimed such a policy already exists? FYI: the majority also doesn't get to decide time based limitations on in good faith header dispute cases either. Length of time of header placement is irrelevant if an in good faith dispute still exists. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 19:55, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I'm not satisfied with the text of the warning, as it says "you are just about ok" while the above links show evidence of 4 reverts within a roughly 18-hour period. This, together with leaving <i>his</i> version of the article alone, does make it hard for me not to do a fourth revert myself. I also doubt that it achieves the goal of enforcing the 3RR next time.&#160;:(( <a href="../../../k/i/s/User%7EKissl_4f16.html" title="User:Kissl">Kiss</a><a href="../../../k/i/s/User_talk%7EKissl_a765.html" title="User talk:Kissl">L</a> 14:57, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>There are diffences between each "revision" some of them are of about equal in size to the text being "reverted". The user does not have any past history that I know of gameing the rule. There is simply no way I can block him under the rule. As such I have no choice other than to admit that yes his just about within the rule this time around. What has happened greatly assists in inforceing the rule in future since it remove the "user wasn't warned" defence. Furthermore if the user continuse to act in there current way it will show that they are gameing the rule. If however they do not then I fail to see an issue. See <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Wikipedia:Assume good faith</a>. If you want somone to decide what to do about the current version I would suggest contacting User:Mihnea Tudoreanu, <a href="../../../g/u/b/User%7EGubbubu_93d7.html" title="User:Gubbubu">User:Gubbubu</a> and/or <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMax_rspct_e7d2.html" title="User:Max rspct">User:Max rspct</a> all of whom have edited the article in the past and therfore probably have some knowage of the suject area.<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 15:15, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>As stated together with the initial report, I did not and do not want the user blocked (this is because I <i>am</i> assuming good faith). However, according to <a href="../../../r/e/v/Wikipedia%7ERevert_d321.html" title="Wikipedia:Revert">Wikipedia:Revert</a>, <i>"A revert is a change or an edit made to a page that has the effect of undoing an earlier change or edit on the same page."</i> This somewhat ambiguous definition is further clarified by the fact that <i>"reverting to an earlier version"</i> is referred to as <i>"a kind of revert"</i> only. So the user, by reverting four times within 18 hours to <i>"The Hungarian offensive in Transylvania was repulsed by the Romanian army"</i> in place of the previous <i>"At the same time, the Romanians attacked from the South-East"</i>, did clearly violate the rule, and the warning should therefore have read something like <i>"You have violated the rule, this time you are only warned, but next time you may get blocked"</i> instead of <i>"you are just about ok"</i>. (Mihnea Tudoreanu has, however, restored the correct version in the meantime, making all this a lot less important.) <a href="../../../k/i/s/User%7EKissl_4f16.html" title="User:Kissl">Kiss</a><a href="../../../k/i/s/User_talk%7EKissl_a765.html" title="User talk:Kissl">L</a> 11:23, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>the problem with the aproach you are takeing is that it pretty much modifies the 3RR to "do not edit and contiversal article more than 3 times in a 24 hour peroid" (don't belive me look at the early history of this page). If Criztu had a history of gameing the rule I would probably have viewed the above as a blockable offence. However they do not. I can't tell someone that they have broken the rules when I don't think think they have.<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 11:32, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I have also reverted more than three times in twenty-four hours, because I am (as discussed on the <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_feeb.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard">Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard</a> and various Talk pages) reverting what counts simply as vandalism. This is just one sample of a great number of insistent reverts by OmegaWikipedia, involving my corrections of Wikilinks, bringing articles into MoS style (removing excess capitals from headers, etc.), and so on. He has also insisted on reverting a page move by cutting and pasting (despite my warnings and explanations), and has made a number of other related reverts of page moves involving the naming conventions (see, for example, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_number-one_hits_%28United_States%29_4798.html" title="List of number-one hits (United States)">List of number-one hits (United States)</a> and <a href="../../../s/i/n/Single_certification.html" title="Single certification">Single certification</a>). He has no interest in the MoS, and treats the pop-music articles as a fan-section of Wikipedia, to be treated differently from other articles, under the control of a number of fan-editors, including himself.--<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 22:05, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Correct. The links originally posted by Ultramarine (and appended with times by me) show the version that was reverted <i>to</i>. This is different from the diffs that are usually posted on this page, which show the previous version (the one that was reverted). 172's third revert was to a previous version by himself. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stalin&amp;diff=19750574&amp;oldid=19750270" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stalin&amp;diff=19750574&amp;oldid=19750270" rel="nofollow">[58]</a>. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 03:05, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that the original diffs are somewhat confusing, although they do serve the purpose of showing the version that was reverted <i>to</i>. In this case, there is no one version that was reverted to each time. However, the 3RR is based on reverts per article, not per topic within the article. The included diffs clearly show that 172 made 4 reverts within four hours, which seems like a clear case for a block to me. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 03:09, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(edit conflict) I've checked the history, and I don't see a violation here. There are edits at 20:47 and 21:31 on July 27, then 00:08, 00:16, and 00:30 on July 28. But they're concerned with separate sections. There's some repetition but not much, and I don't see what the previous version is that has been reverted to.

<dd>Thanks for doing that, Carbonite. I know it's a pain to have to search for those things. Regarding the fourth edit/revert, 172 deleted a sentence, which so far as I can see had just been added (I could be wrong about that). By definition, a deletion will almost always be a revert to a previous version (a version that didn't have the additional sentence).</dd>
<dd>Apart from that, my worry is that, if this is a violation, it's very borderline, with different sections being edited, and the fourth revert perhaps only an edit.

I always do research before blocking and I get somewhat defensive when someone makes the accusation of bad block. In addition, 172's rather confrontational e-mails to me have not helped his case one bit. I'm not going to unblock, but I also won't re-block.

<dd>There's an ambiguity here that I have not seen firmly resolved in any 3RR case that I have witnessed. The policy page doesn't seem to help. It seems to me the intent, and usual practice, of 3RR violation enforcement centers around the fact of a particular text being reverted in four edits, hence there being a "previous version reverted to". However, in this case 172 is deleting two separate instances; one deals with agriculture and famine, and the other three deal with the characterization of general repression and deaths under Stalin. If I was looking at this myself, I would say that the first edit has nothing to do with the other three and that there is a separate revert war going on within those for which another revert in the same time period would warrant a block on 172. Otherwise editing multiple instances of ostensibly bad contributions <i>at all</i> is being said to constitute <i>reverts</i> to already uncertain, indefinite material. And as of now there is not even a previous version referenced that justifies calling all of those reverts--as for what that is I do not know; the edits there are so labyrinthine as to defy brief resolution of the question. --<a href="../../../t/j/i/User%7ETJive_a615.html" title="User:TJive">TJive</a> 04:45, July 28, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>We're running out of page.&#160;:-) I agree. I don't block when the reverting is to different versions, because I think it becomes hard to tell reverting from editing, but the 3RR page does allow those blocks, so Carbonite has not acted inapproriately. My argument is that, if it's labyrinthine for us to work it out, it might also have confused the editor who's blocked and we should assume good faith. On the other hand, the opposite argument is that even one revert is bad, and the 3RR rule doesn't mean we're entitled to three reverts, so as soon as we have to start counting our reverts, it means the spirt of the rule is broken. There are good points on both sides here, I'd say. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 05:04, July 28, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Having reviewed the diffs I'd have to agree with what's been said above. If we can't tell (or agree) whether or not the 3RR has been violated then 172 probably couldn't either, and it seems to me that a block ought to be reserved for obvious and egregious edit-warring. Besides, it doesn't help the article to block on a technicality. Unblocked per above. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 10:17, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm glad this is over, but I feel it's necessary to explain my reasoning a bit more. The fact is that the 3RR <i>was</i> violated, both in letter and in spirit. The 3RR states <i>Don't revert any single page more than three times within a period of 24 hours.</i>. This is pretty simple and clear to me. It doesn't say "don't revert the same text" or "don't revert the same section". In this case, there were four true reverts (not complex or partials). It can be argued that this was "borderline" violation in the same way that travelling a few miles over the speed limit might be a borderline infraction. However, there were a few factors that led me to block (and not to unblock):</p>
<ul>
<li>172 has a history of violating the 3RR <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3A172" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3A172" rel="nofollow">[60]</a>. This wasn't a case of a newbie not being aware of the rule.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The reverts occurred in less than a four hour period. I'm reluctant to block if the reverts are spread over 20 hours or so, but three of these were within 22 minutes of each other.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There were additional reverts mere minutes outside of the 24 hour period, at 00:16, 27 July 2005<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stalin&amp;diff=19679448&amp;oldid=19679151" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stalin&amp;diff=19679448&amp;oldid=19679151" rel="nofollow">[61]</a> 00:09, 27 July 2005 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stalin&amp;diff=19678907&amp;oldid=19678648" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stalin&amp;diff=19678907&amp;oldid=19678648" rel="nofollow">[62]</a>, and 23:36, 26 July 2005 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stalin&amp;diff=19676980&amp;oldid=19676845" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stalin&amp;diff=19676980&amp;oldid=19676845" rel="nofollow">[63]</a>. This shows a pattern of reverts and possible gaming of the system.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>172's emails to me were confrontational ("What is your problem with me?"), rude ("Then block Agiantman and Ultramarine, or be a hypocrite") and somewhat threatening ("Otherwise, I will inform other administrators of your hypocritical application of policy.") At no point did 172 give any assurance that he would cease reverting the Stalin article if I unblocked him. Given that he had reverted the article 6 or 7 times in the previous 25 hour period, such assurances would have been very helpful.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we're going to have rules, they need to be enforced. I have no problem with Mackensen's unblocking and have no ill will toward 172. I believe I was justified in my block and I wanted to make my reasoning as transparent as possible. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 12:06, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've taken a look at the record, and it does seem to me that 172 and Agiantman were doing pretty much the same thing. (I will be filing a formal statement in this page as well.) 172 was in fact blocked for 8 hours, and has not yet begun to edit again, which suggests that he may not know. Does the guideline of evenhandedness apply here? <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 19:56, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The way Carbonite is going about applying his 'if we are going to have rules, they need to be enforced' attitude is harmful to the project. The job of administrators is to protect serious editors who from disruptive editors. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a community where 'equal justice before the law' applies to both legitimate editors and illegitimate editors. Administrators have the discretion to-- and should be expected to--apply 'the rules' unevenly in the interests of the encyclopedia.</p>

<p>Actually I often use talk pages for explanation and discussion of edits, it is you who refuses to do so. In addition, you should have provided links to the diffs so that we could have some sort of idea what you were talking about. I do not believe that those are all reversions, although I have no way of easily telling. For that matter, neither does any admin. — <b><a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Phil</a></b> <i><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">Welch</a></i> 02:58, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>For the record, #1 is a reversion. #2 and #3 are reversions of simple vandalism, which is not covered under the policy,. #4 is not a reversion: a reversion goes back to a previous version of the article by definition. #4 does not match that definition, because I allowed another intervening edit within the same time period to stand unaltered. The same is true of #5. As for #6, that's a self-reversion, which is also excepted from the policy.</p>
<p>I have attempted to rationally discuss all these content disputes with Copperchair before, but he refuses, often deleting comments from his talk page without responding to them. — <b><a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Phil</a></b> <i><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">Welch</a></i> 03:08, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>That's not true. I have always responded before deleting comments from my talk page. Also, I have provided proofs to back my arguments, while you have just given opinions. Check out <a href="../../../d/a/r/Talk%7EDarth_Vader_a508.html#Copperchair..." title="Talk:Darth Vader">Talk:Darth_Vader#Copperchair...</a> and give PROOFS, not opinios.<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECopperchair_c839.html" title="User:Copperchair">Copperchair</a> 01:17, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Since you can't give more than an opinion, and are too proud to accept that you are mistaken, I request for an third-party to decide on this matter. I will hear notifications on my talk page. <a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECopperchair_c839.html" title="User:Copperchair">Copperchair</a> 01:26, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Three other exact reverts, the day before: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stalin&amp;diff=19668061&amp;oldid=19633316" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stalin&amp;diff=19668061&amp;oldid=19633316" rel="nofollow">21:17, 26 July 2005</a> /<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stalin&amp;diff=19676845&amp;oldid=19668061" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stalin&amp;diff=19676845&amp;oldid=19668061" rel="nofollow">23:34, 26 July 2005</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stalin&amp;diff=19678648&amp;oldid=19676845" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stalin&amp;diff=19678648&amp;oldid=19676845" rel="nofollow">00:05 27 July 2005</a></li>
<li>As with <a href="#User:172" title="">#User:172</a>, above, these are not all to the same text.
<ul>
<li>The earliest five were part of two editors attempting to maintain an NPOV tag, against a consensus of several other editors.</li>
<li>the latest two were reverts to Agiantman's previous edits, to preserve Agiantman's text for the intro. In one case, there were small intervening edits lost. This was again apparently against consensus; Golbez's edit summary in undoing Agiantman's text was: <i>oh god how did i end up agreeing with 172</i>. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stalin&amp;action=history&amp;offset=0&amp;limit=100" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stalin&amp;action=history&amp;offset=0&amp;limit=100" rel="nofollow">page history</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I think Agiantman and 172 equally at fault, on opposite sides. [This refers to <b>the actual reverts</b>; not to the wider dispute, which should be settled elsewhere. 21:40, 28 July 2005 (UTC)] What's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 20:33, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>---</p>
<p>I am not equally at fault, and it is an insult to me put me on the same level with this editor. Agiantman insults fellow editors who modify his changes and drags fellow editors into one circular argument after another on talk pages. When he fails to weigh his arguments and counterarguments on talk pages with evidence from sources, he simply chooses to ignore the substance of the discussion and respond with ad hominems. When disruptive editors refuse to engage in reasonable discussion on talk, the only way left to deal with them is to revert.</p>
<p>The following is just a sample of what Mikka, other editors, and I have had to put up with on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Joseph_Stalin" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Joseph_Stalin" rel="nofollow">Stalin talk page</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Your response represents a bizarre revisionist view of history, reminiscent of Hitler apologists who deny the holocaust occurred. You refer to "the only genocide Stalin committed." The "only genocide?" As if committing genocide once was no big deal. And somehow party genocide or class genocide is a less serious form of genocide. How sick. And as for the number of Stalin's genocides, you forget the Great Terror of 1937 where he systematically exterminated his political enemies. And people here don't think it should appear prominently in the introduction. Bizarro. --Agiantman 12:37, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</i></li>
<li><i>If you don't understand my objections by this stage, I strongly encourage you to ask a friend or a parent to help explain them to you. --Agiantman 00:41, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</i></li>
<li><i>So you want a political Pro-Stalin(read:POV) definition of genocide that doesn't apply to Stalin's genocide? No wonder you didn't want the neutral Merriam-Webster definition! LOL! mikka, you are clearly too much of a Stalin fan to be editing this article.--Agiantman 03:27, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</i></li>
<li><i>Is it a personal attack to refer to someone as a "Stalin fan?" LOL! (Plus, Mikka has since admitted that he has a Stalin tattoo on his posterior).--Agiantman 12:11, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</i> [needless to say, a distortion of Mikka's comments]</li>
<li><i>Your fellow traveler, mikka, deleted those references within 5 minutes [4]. Hopefully this is not part of your criteria to become "one of Wikipedia's most respected editors." --Agiantman 12:11, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</i></li>
<li><i>It is mikka's point of view that using the terms mass murderer and/or genocide "is not an information about facts, but an emotional evaluation of these facts expressed in terms of loaded words." That is nonsense and I strongly disagree.</i> [needless to say, another distortion of Mikka's position]</li>
<li><i>I have to laugh at 172's offer to write a neutral article. As anyone who reads the discussion history here can see, he is the ringleader in the effort to maintain a revisionist Stalin article and bully anyone who introduces mainstream material. Tauger et al are a tiny minority of Stalin revisionists and negationists but strangely they are the only sources ever mentioned by 172.</i></li>
<li><i>mikka says that "Pope is the greatest killer of all times and epochs, since catholics, whom he leads, killed most of Europe." Is this the reason that I should trust him on maintaining a neutral POV here? Maybe its the reason 172 refers to mikka "as one of Wikipedia's most respected editors." If this is not testament of the bizarre viewpoint of the POV bullies on this page, I don't know what is.--Agiantman 00:30, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</i> [needless to say again, yet another distortion of Mikka's comments]</li>
<li><i>What a distortion! mikka attacks my religion with an outrageous offensive remark, and I am to blame? If any one is cruising for a Wikipedia block, it's you and mikka. (You have officially been warned.) I am unsure of what substantive points you think need to be addressed. You appear hellbent against placing responsibility on Stalin for the murder of millions of innocent people, especially in the introductory paragraph, even when it is linked to source material. Your latest reason is because authors disagree on how many millions were killed by Stalin. Am I correct? That's the substantive point I would like addressed. Waiting . . . --Agiantman 00:54, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</i> [Mikka wasn't attacking any religion.]</li>

<dd>I've just read the first revert, and it's not a diff. We need four diffs showing four reverts, and a link to the previous version, as it says below. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 23:35, July 28, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've taken a look at the history and nothing is jumping out as being a 3RR violation. He twice reverted to the NPOV tag, once at 20:11 and again at 20:32 on July 27, and there was a previous version of that at 20:00 but I can't see him doing it another twice. There are other reverts, but unconnected. The personal attacks cited aren't bad enough to block for. We're not allowed to block for personal attacks <i>per se</i>. We can block for disruption, but the attacks have to be continuous for it to amount to disruption (or particularly offensive) and usually blocks for this will only apply to editors who have made few, or no, useful edits. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 23:47, July 28, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm going to sit this one out, but it does look like a 3RR violation to me. I know admins are used to seeing the diffs presented in a different manner, but these do seem to clearly show 4 reverts. I've never seen it stated that a violation must consist of four reverts all to one older version. I don't really agree with that interpretation since it leaves far too much room for abuse. Anyway, I'm not in the mood for another debate, but there's enough evidence here in my opinion. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 00:02, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Could someone at least warn him to pay attention to civility policies? Having administrators is useless if in practice Wikipedia content is determined by deference to the editor who can spew the worst ad hominems, not reasonable compromise based on the sources and evidence. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> | <a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.html" title="User talk:172">Talk</a> 00:11, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Holy cow! I had no idea that I was the topic of discussion on an Administrators' noticeboard! I wish someone had given me a heads up so that I could have defended myself. (BTW, thank you to those who did defend me.) I have only been a Wikipedia editor for a few weeks and I stumbled onto the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stalin.html" title="Stalin">Stalin</a> article only 2 days ago. One only has to read the full discussion on <a href="../../../j/o/s/Talk%7EJoseph_Stalin_9256.html" title="Talk:Joseph Stalin">Talk:Joseph_Stalin</a> to see what I have gone through (please don't limit yourself to the sliced and diced version that <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> supplied above). It appears that some here have a problem with my attempts to maintain an NPOV tag. It doesn't seem like it should be a revert violation to simply maintain an NPOV tag on a clearly disputed article, but I will certainly heed your warning. P.S. In reading the earlier section here, I was surprised to learn that <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> has a long history of violating the rules <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3A172" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3A172" rel="nofollow">[79]</a>. That should say something about his credibility. --<a href="../../../a/g/i/User%7EAgiantman_8e43.html" title="User:Agiantman">Agiantman</a> 01:48, 29 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>There was no dispute before you came in and started talking about "genocide," after which I and several other editors explained to you why the term was not applicable. The "NPOV dispute" is generally limited to you and <a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltramarine_4c33.html" title="User:Ultramarine">Ultramarine</a>, the latter of whom seems to make a habit of dumping human rights issues into communist-related articles without paying attention to article structure or flow. The reason the NPOV dispute tag kept being removed is because the primary person disputing the text (you) was incorrect and didn't help your point on talk. It'd have been different if you'd contested the version with fact-based arguments rather than accusing me and other editors of fronting for Stalin.</dd>

<li>Amin123, who also edits as 154.20.105.198, has, for three months now, been continually asserting that Zoroastrianism is the origin of the theology of Christianity, and has spent his entire time on Wikipedia trying to edit that belief into articles. In this article he keeps inserting a section which theoretically supports that thesis (while actually being about Zoroastrianism's alleged influence on Judaism), while simultaneously deleting a cited sentence which argues against a relationship between Christianity and Mithraism. The diffs aren't 100% identical because he edits the information in/out by hand each time, so the spacing is a bit off, and he messed up the footnotes a few times. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 15:19, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

So, for example, your first diff should be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ancient_Macedonian_language&amp;diff=19868763&amp;oldid=19867337" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ancient_Macedonian_language&amp;diff=19868763&amp;oldid=19867337" rel="nofollow">18:12, 29 July 2005</a>. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 19:48, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>

<dd>So, the diff links should show that the alleged reverter's edits are identical four times in a row? <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChronographos_daa5.html" title="User:Chronographos">Chronographos</a> 19:55, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>This is a self reporting. I believe that the <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> needs to be taken seriously and I apologize for breaching it.--<a href="../../../t/z/n/User%7ETznkai_3625.html" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a> 17:03, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Considering this is self-reporting, if you self-revert yourself now, I'll be happy to just go with a warning. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 17:26, 30 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Before I do so I feel compelled to be honest. As soon as the 24 hour mark passes, I will be doing that exact same reversion. If you feel that is counter productive I'll let it stand and take my lumps here.--<a href="../../../t/z/n/User%7ETznkai_3625.html" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a> 17:30, 30 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Thanks, I appreciate that, but my decision stands. Once the 24 hour period expires, it will be within your right to reinsert that version. But I <i>am</i> hoping that by forgoing a block, you will be able (and encouraged) to engage in consensus-building with other editors on this issue, and enter into dialogue toward compromises with the respective disputants. Goodluck. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 17:58, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>But you mightn't need to do the same reversion. Doesn't the 3RR page say that if something really needs to be reverted, someone else will probably do it? . . . Ann Heneghan 17:47, 30 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>I admit to near fanatical protectionism over that article. I think the choice is either to do an act of <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_disobedience.html" title="Civil disobedience">Civil disobedience</a>/<a href="../../../v/i/g/Vigilantism.html" title="Vigilantism">vigilantism</a> or to trust in the self healing nature of Wikipedia.

<li>Two edit conflicts (pushed myself up the line). Ann Heneghan makes a good point, which ties into my response above. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 17:58, 30 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>An admin recently gave excellent advice on the talk page of an article I'm interested in - if you feel you're getting too protective of a particular article, go off and edit a few different ones. That's what brought <i>me</i> to the page where I first came across Tznkai last night. (And apologies if I'm clogging up this notice board with comments that don't really belong here!)

<p>Zeno is a reasonably new user and he might, as indicated on the talkpage, have misunderstood the sometimes quite complicated rules regarding these issues. If an admin find that he has indeed violated Wikipedias rules regarding 3rr, my personal opinion is that a warning should be enough for now. -- <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarl_Meier_d697.html" title="User:Karl Meier">Karl Meier</a> 22:53, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I don't feel that I reverted four times, as the fourth change was substantially different from the first third and was aimed at achieving a compromise. Heraclius has not given good reason for why he has spent several days deleting the cresent moon symbol and Jihad link from the Islam template. In my fourth edit I tried to compromise by leaving out the Jihad link and keeping the cresent symbol. I note that instead of discussing the subject rationally, Heraclius is only engaging in reverting and making a lot of noise about a supposed 3RR violation. Personally, I think this should either be dismissed or taken to RFC/RFA. --<a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZeno_of_Elea_061f.html" title="User:Zeno of Elea">Zeno of Elea</a> 22:50, 30 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>First of all, template and content disputes aren't taken to RFA. Second of all, I have made no less than 4 comments on the talkpage of the template describing why the crescent shouldn't be included, so your accusation of "not discussing the subject" is false. The crescent hasn't been there for the majority of the existence of this template and you are the one who has engaged in "reverting and making a lot of noise".<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHeraclius_a3ac.html" title="User:Heraclius">Heraclius</a> 22:53, 30 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A look at the template talk page will reveal that you have abandoned discussing the issue of the cresent symbol, despite ongoing discussion, and have stated in places that you are indifferent to whether or not the symbol is included. --<a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZeno_of_Elea_061f.html" title="User:Zeno of Elea">Zeno of Elea</a> 23:00, 30 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The reason I abandoned discussing the issue with you is because we would have continued to repeat the same arguments over and over. I did us both a favor so we wouldn't waste any more time.<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHeraclius_a3ac.html" title="User:Heraclius">Heraclius</a> 23:05, 30 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As I see it, the only reasonable conclusion you abandoned discussions because you had no rational argument. You are clearly not interested in discussion, compromise, or good faith debate. This is why I think this should be taken to RFC or RFA. --<a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZeno_of_Elea_061f.html" title="User:Zeno of Elea">Zeno of Elea</a> 23:12, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Zeno, you seem to have misunderstood the <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> policy, the fourth change had the crescent. Two choices: I can block you for 24 hours, or we can go with a warning provided you won't insert crescent moon <i>anywhere</i>, and do not edit the template specifically, for 24 hours. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 23:17, 30 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>That's fair enough. It doesn't solve the cresent moon dispute, but I suppose that's not the purpose of this page. --<a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZeno_of_Elea_061f.html" title="User:Zeno of Elea">Zeno of Elea</a> 23:21, 30 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Nope, it isn't, and at any rate I doubt it can be solved immediately, but it does provide you with the ability and maneuverability to bring it up with other editors (esp. hitherto uninvolved ones) and try to build consensus for or work toward a compromise to this dispute. Goodluck. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 23:32, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>This was done after Halibutt falsely accused me of violating 3RR many times, so he/she should be well aware of rule. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 15:19, 31 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Well, it appears you are removing a {{disptuted}} tag. I am not sure if this would not fall under vandalism. As Halibutt notes, <a href="../../../a/c/c/Wikipedia%7EAccuracy_dispute_97fa.html" title="Wikipedia:Accuracy dispute">Wikipedia:Accuracy dispute</a> states <i>don't remove the warning simply because the material looks reasonable: please take the time to properly verify it</i>. Also, judging from timezones, Halibutt has reverted twice a day. --<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus">Talk</a></sup> 16:07, 31 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>I will recuse myself from this. I can see both sides of the argument. I have tried to come up with a compromise which I hope both parties will be satisfied with until the naming dispute is over. May I note, however, that Gene Nygaard has broken the spirit of the 3RR but not missed out on the letter by 8 minutes. <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 16:11, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>It has nothing to do with time zones. Halibutt has reverted four times in 16 hours and 50 minutes, which is less than 24 hours. That's the way the rule is written; it has nothing whatsoever to do with any one person's calendar day. It is explicity expressed in terms of a span of 24 hours for exactly that reason, to avoid questions of what a "day" means. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 16:52, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Indeed, the whole fuzz was about a disputed tag, which was constantly being removed by Gene against the <a href="../../../a/d/_/WP%7EAD_5bbf.html" title="WP:AD">WP:AD</a> rules. Interestingly enough, Gene didn't have time to provide sources on the respective talk page or even take part in the dispute, but at the same time he had a time to list me here or remove the tag over and over again... Anyway, if the community decides that WP:3RR is more important than WP:AD, then please punish me. However, I don't believe I violated the 3RR here. Oh, and last but not least, as Gene says, this all happened after I falsely accused Gene of breaking the 3RR, but also after I apologised for that. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 16:33, July 31, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm involved, and haven't seen any actual violations, but these two articles are seeing a lot of reversion and need an eye kept on them.

<dd>There was extensive discussion on the talk page, but unfortunately the person who created the section said straight out he was going to undo any edit I made (including removal of images violating copyright) and did not try to justify his actions. Gabrielsimon jumped in as an editor <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Gabrielsimon_9319.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Gabrielsimon">well known</a> for trying to undo pretty much all of my edits. The other person involved was banned as a sockpuppet of an editor who has been previous banned something like four times for sockpuppetry and edit warring and looks like he's back with yet another alias, <s>currently being investigated on the Admin noticeboard</s> already blocked. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 21:13, July 31, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, so... everyone who was reverting it back when I edited it is blocked now. With two of them (or rather one person with two accounts) the block period is a full year. If we have to wait for them to agree on what to do, this could be a while... And the guy blocked for 24 hours is still in denial that he did a 3RR despite the evidence, so I doubt he'll agree with me on anything when he does get back. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 07:34, August 1, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comments:</b> The paragraph is one in a list of discretionary powers. It only needs a few lines to describe the power and how it operates. Having two translations of the same Irish wording is superfluous in this context, though it may be appropriate in a discussion of the Irish constitution itself.

<li>This looks more like a case of Skyring removing something which Jtdirl has made a reasonable argument to suggest that it belongs in the article. The talk page suggests that there has been discussion.

<li>The first revert was against an IP that later revealed itself to be Skyring. Its pretty common for editors to revert text deletions without edit summaries from IPs, thats why I didn't block.--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 06:28, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

<li><i>an IP that later revealed itself to be Skyring</i>. You obviously haven't checked, nixie. Feel free to ask someone with sockpuppet-checking powers, because I'm definitely not guilty. <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkyring_afb0.html" title="User:Skyring">Pete</a> 06:33, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>Whether the ip that introduced the edit was or was not Skyring, as per the 3RR violation of the addition, is impertinent. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 06:50, 1 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Of course it's not. Reversion of vandalism isn't covered by the 3RR (and the deletion of text by an anonymous IP with no explanation other than "English" certainly seems to be vandalism to me), and so the first reversion is immune to the 3RR. The fact that Skyring later tried to explain away the vandalism (which from his past behaviour would seem most likely to be either yet another attempt to rewrite Jtdirl's contributions out of sheer spite, with no knowledge of the subject area whatsoever, or simply disagreeing with Jtdirl for the sake of it, depending on whether the IP was him or not) does not stop the first edit being vandalism.

<p><b>Comments</b></p>
<p>Note that last revert was split into two separate changes to add up to the same change as in earlier reverts, not quite a 5th revert, so I labeled it 4 1/2. Please be aware that Gabrielsimon is a frequent abuser of the 3RR and has had it explained to him several times, especially that simply labeling something "vandalism" when it is a POV dispute does not justify violating the 3RR. As far as I know, he has been blocked at least 8 times in the last four months for violating 3RR and had a couple of close calls on top of that. It is also significant that as part of a <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Gabrielsimon_9319.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Gabrielsimon">RfC</a> concerning his edit warring and other conflicts, he agreed to follow a <b>1RR</b> (see: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_comment/Gabrielsimon&amp;diff=19740697&amp;oldid=19740455" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_comment/Gabrielsimon&amp;diff=19740697&amp;oldid=19740455" rel="nofollow">[126]</a>). Violating the 3RR under these circumstances is quite substantial. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 01:59, August 1, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Can't we simply delete the article and undelete all revisions but these three? I thought the ability to selectively undelete only some revisions exists for exactly these kinds of situations.

<dd>As I've said on the VfD, Ril is in need of a sound spanking. I don't care who says what, no matter how much Ril might think his actions are supported by WP policy, they simply are NOT. He is acting apparently according to what he perceives as "boldness" (I said long ago this was going to cause trouble), when in fact his boldness is CLEARLY within the realm of "vandalism". What's positively repulsive is that the admins who normally patrol this sort of subject have stood silently by, permitting Ril to attempt to beat all opposition into submission. It's positively appalling. While there are certainly valid allegations of sockpuppetry, Ril's actions are in CLEAR violation of several CORE WP policies, including <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECivility_3fb1.html" title="WP:Civility">WP:Civility</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>.

<p>Further, the only things I have moved are (a) restoring brief comments where they were originally, including evidence of certain voters being sockpuppets, which were removed by the said sockpuppets (b) an <i>instruction</i> not to delete the article whatever the vote outcome, because this instruction violated VFD policy, and required an injunction from the arbitration committee to stand, which simply did not exist (c) a vast "rebuttal" section, which policy does not include for, and which was far too extensive to be considered merely a comment.

Can we delete it automatically as previously vfd'd material, or does that not apply as it was a different wiki project? -- <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancs2000_6420.html" title="User:Francs2000">Francs2000</a> | <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Francs2000&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Francs2000&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">Talk</a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> 18:22, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think it should be deleted as useless junk. This is the EN-wiki, not the german wiki, so pasting text in a foreign language, particularly previously VfD'd information, should be treated as vandalism. -- <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> · <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay">Talk</a> 18:27, July 21, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're welcome. I'm off out soon, but I took a quick look at noticed that you'd deleted <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nasalis_muscle.html" title="Nasalis muscle">Nasalis muscle</a>, a perfectly good encyclopedia article needing a bit of cleanup. I've restored and cleaned it up as a demonstration of the standard of work I would expect an administrator to produce. I'd suggest that if you don't understand an article it doesn't mean that you have to delete it. Usually a minute or two on Google will bring enlightenment. Also remember to look at "What links here". I hope you agree that as administrators we should be trying to make articles better whenever that is reasonably possible. Deleting good material is never a sensible option. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 19:10, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Plagiarism isn't the correct word to use here. We are not--or should not--be here to produce anything creative, but to state facts, so the word would be inappropriate. Referencing Gray would certainly be de rigueur here, because Gray is an authority and your average Wikipedian is not (and even when he is he must still cite an external authority). --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 04:04, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also beware of deleting articles for unorthodox reasons such as "gamecruft". If an article relates to an aspect of a game that you think is too trivial for an article, you should consider merging content and, unless there is a good reason to delete, replace by a redirect. If for some reason you think the article should still be deleted (for instance for lack of a candidate article to which to merge the information) list it on VfD. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 19:17, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm pretty sure I've never deleted anything as "gamecruft" for two reasons: 1) I hate the term "cruft," and 2) the only two times I've ever typed the word are in this sentence.

<p>Hello all! Time to face the firing squad I see!&#160;:)</p>
<p>First of all, I am <b>very displeased</b> with this incident notice. Why? If there is any sort of statement being made against someone, <i>at least have the decency to inform them</i>. I only found this out by happening to check for responses to some of the thanks messages I left. Not a good start I can tell you.</p>
<p>OK, I will admit it, <i><b>YES, DUH, I -SCREWED- UP BIIIG TIIIME!!!!!</b></i> There, that's what you wanted isn't it? OK? Done? Yes? If I'm making mistakes, tell me, I can take it, but you don't have to word it so... nastily as has been done on my talk page.</p>
<p>Everything I did I did in good faith. I deleted dozens of "ashiagniaw" and linkspam articles. I cleared out the speedy catogory backlog. I trawled through <a href="../../../n/e/w/Special%7ENewpages_26cd.html" title="Special:Newpages">Special:Newpages</a> looking for all manner of things to start Vfds on sometime this morning.</p>
<p>And what do I get in return? "Hey, great job, but, um, be careful with X, Y and Z next time"? Well, yes... and no.</p>
<p>Some of the warnings I've gotten have been very kind and forgiving, explaining precisely what was wrong and what was right and what to do in future... but some have been brief and barbed and evidently written after sucking multiple lemons. Yes you know who you are.</p>
<p>In closing, yes I overstepped myself and misunderstood the new criteria... but I expected better treatment from you-know-who. If I was weak and insecure I'd probably be quietly sobbing in the corner right now. Oh, yes, good job there.</p>
<p>--Just to clarify, no I'm not angry, no I'm not hurt, just... quite, quite disappointed. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Garrett</a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_0893.html" title="User talk:Master Thief Garrett">Talk</a></sup> 01:08, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Wiki software renders dates put within linking brackets according the user's set preferences. For example:</p>

</ul>
<p>The two should be rendered identically. Note that for the Americans, even the proper comma is introduced.</p>

<li>There is no consensus to delete the article. However, given the amount of 'delete' or 'merge' votes, it sounds like a good idea to do <i>something</i> with the article - copyediting, rewriting, merging and discussing on the talk page are all good possibilities. None of those requires any kind of vote, just be <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">WP:BOLD</a>.</li>
<li>To answer Guettarda's question, VFD consensus is up to the discretion of the closing admin. It is generally agreed upon to lie between 67% and 75%, but can differ depending on vote comments, alleged sockpuppetry, changes to the article halfway past, etc. It's an art rather than a science. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 23:12, July 23, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Please, read the discussion at VfD page carefully. The article was created by an anon as extremely POV. Therefore all votes to <b>merge</b> meant to <b>delete</b> the article but not to abandon topics related to anti-Semitism in Poland. All the topics already exist in much expanded form in articles like <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Jews_in_Poland_5757.html" title="History of the Jews in Poland">History of the Jews in Poland</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html" title="Anti-Semitism">Anti-Semitism</a> There are <b>28</b> votes to <b>delete</b>. <b>8</b> to <b>merge</b>, what in this case mean <b>not to keep</b> a separate article under this name, so should be treated as <b>delete</b> as well. <b>16</b> votes to <b>keep</b>. Over <b>69%</b> of people <b>didn’t want to keep</b> the article. The article even now, after some cleaning is still very POV and offensive. It should be deleted. If you think there is anything in the article, what is lacking in the two others and should be merged, please, point it out, otherwise delete the article. --<a href="../../../s/y/l/User%7ESylwiaS_ce3b.html" title="User:SylwiaS">SylwiaS</a> 18:53, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Good. Since the content seems to be a subset of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html" title="Anti-Semitism">Anti-Semitism</a>, I'm trying to merge it there. Hopefully this will end the discussion as the spirit of the discussion was to merge anyway. Most of those who voted "delete" did so because they did not consider anything there being worth merging.

<p>Tabulation of vote results <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Anti-Semitism_in_Poland_d630.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Anti-Semitism in Poland">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Anti-Semitism in Poland</a> by admins <a href="../../../a/b/c/User%7EABCD_d6a3.html" title="User:ABCD">User:ABCD</a>, <a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty">User:Woohookitty</a> have exposed the weakness of the VfD process. IMO, the process, designed to weed out garbage, has failed while dealing with a legitimate topic by leaving too much room for personal interpretations of the VfD rules, especially while counting the <b>Merge</b> votes. The intention of majority voters casting <b><a href="../../../m/e/r/Merge.html" title="Merge">Merge</a></b> vote was clearly defined as to incorporate the article’s material with the existing <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Jews_in_Poland_5757.html" title="History of the Jews in Poland">History of the Jews in Poland</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html" title="Anti-Semitism">Anti-Semitism</a> thus deleting article in question. Yet, in the Orwellian (<a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Orwell_0bc4.html" title="George Orwell">George Orwell</a>) tradition, admins have tabulated their votes as <b>Keep</b>. Additionally, article’s subject has a significant presence in <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html" title="Anti-Semitism">Anti-Semitism</a> under <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html#Anti-Semitism_in_Poland_until_Partitions" title="Anti-Semitism">Anti-Semitism#Anti-Semitism_in_Poland_until_Partitions</a> (1,841 words as of 7/24/05) and <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html#Poland" title="Anti-Semitism">Anti-Semitism#Poland</a> (308 words as of 7/24/05) subsections as well as in <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Jews_in_Poland_5757.html" title="History of the Jews in Poland">History of the Jews in Poland</a>. What is a purpose of creating a redundant, and in this case, POV’ed version of this content? <a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">User:Piotrus</a>, in his vote, has proposed splitting the content of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html" title="Anti-Semitism">Anti-Semitism</a> into Anti-Semitism+specific country articles.

<p>Furthermore, 4 votes by <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppet_9d8b.html" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppet">Wikipedia:Sock puppet</a> and users with a minimal contributions to the English wiki should have been nullified according to <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> and a precedence of the <a href="../../../g/d/a/Talk%7EGdansk_Vote_6c4c.html" title="Talk:Gdansk/Vote">Talk:Gdansk/Vote</a> (when votes from users with less than 20 contribution were invalidated).</p>

<li>Personally, I wouldn't have combined anything. A vote to delete is different than a vote to merge (which, as was pointed out, is more like a keep than a delete). In that case, you then have 28 to delete vs 14 to keep vs 8 to merge. No consensus. --<a href="../../../k/b/d/User%7EKbdank71_f952.html" title="User:Kbdank71">Kbdank71</a> 17:57, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>IMO, VfD only has final say in the disposition of an article when the outcome is "delete". <i>Consensus</i> to delete requires just that (granted, the definition of consensus is pretty nebulous in practice), not just "more people wanted to delete than wanted any other option chosen". A consensus to delete is binding; the article is deleted and that's the end of it (barring the relatively rare VfU). Any other position is shorthand for "do not delete, and this is what I would like to see done with the material". Merges and redirects are actions that can be done and reverted by any editor; consensus for those actions <i>can</i> be established on VfD, but also on the Talk page, or anywhere else. If an admin closing a VfD interprets consensus to merge, as an admin s/he makes the call not to delete, and as an editor decides to merge it based on expressed consensus. I see here 28 "delete" and 21 "do something else"; looks like "no consensus to delete", and in fact no consensus to do anything else either. (I have no comment on the article itself.) <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindspillage_87a5.html" title="User:Mindspillage">Mindspillage</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMindspillage_c644.html" title="User talk:Mindspillage">(spill yours?)</a> 19:01, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>It does appear the problem has been solved by a merger.

<dd>Indeed, Molobo's contribution history <i>doesn't</i> look like a sockpuppet (some of his earliest edits were on these VfDs, and that had originally aroused my suspicion); I hadn't looked at his contribs for a while.

<dd>Yeah, that's fine, I don't give a frog's fat ass if you block people that deserve it. But I (the original GrandCru) didn't create the fake Bobby or Derksen accounts. I was innocent, and got blocked anyway. If you look at Bobbybuilder's history, you will see that his profanity and vandalisms were far greater than mine ever were. He was the truly abusive one, but you guys keep overlooking it. Why was he not blocked? Go ahead, look up all the IP addresses, you will see that prior to today I had nothing to do with any of the Jiang bullshit. But, you know what? Since you guys blocked me permanently and put to waste all my effort and contributions, I will spend the same amount of time vandalising Bobbybuilder. (And Jiang, only because Jiang's group of vandals are going to help me get Bobby). One of these days, the vandals will rise up against the communists. You can prohibit freedom of speech in mainland China, but not in the rest of the world. Wikipedia was created so that everyone can contribute, but as it turns out, the people that have power (admins, beaurocrats, etc.) will abuse it to support their own POVs, etc. Fuck you all, I'm going to the dark side of wiki! --<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandCruTwo_ea42.html" title="User:GrandCruTwo">GrandCruTwo</a> 03:41, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Finally, an admin who reads what has happened. As anyone can see by looking at the relevant talk pages and article histories, Albanau has been systematically rude to anyone who disagrees with him, to the extent of calling a fellow Albanian of his "very unintelligent", just because they disagreed. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbanau_cdb4.html" title="User:Albanau">Albanau</a> has also violated the 3RR rule multiple times (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arvanitic_language&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arvanitic_language&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">he even did 4 reverts within 51 minutes</a>), yet he has consistently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arvanitic_language&amp;diff=19264314&amp;oldid=19263841" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arvanitic_language&amp;diff=19264314&amp;oldid=19263841" rel="nofollow">taunted other editors to revert and break the 3RR</a>. If they take the bait, he immediately reports them. He has been very cunning in that he first edits in his own POV, and then creates a revert war, according to plan. He has also repeatedly given <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Arvanites&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=19311904" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Arvanites&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=19311904" rel="nofollow">provocative titles to his edit summaries</a>, and when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arvanitic_language&amp;diff=19369144&amp;oldid=19338308" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arvanitic_language&amp;diff=19369144&amp;oldid=19338308" rel="nofollow">offered neutral phrasings</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arvanitic_language&amp;diff=19265562&amp;oldid=19265255" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arvanitic_language&amp;diff=19265562&amp;oldid=19265255" rel="nofollow">he ignores them</a>.

<p>Indeed.

These are his words, not mine.

<p>Albanau has been causing nothing but trouble with his untenable edits and style. How people react to him is a matter of taste, but hardly unprovoked; last time I checked, personal attacks per se were not blockable, only if it is "disruptive", so the complaint is pointless here, it should go to rfc, and then to the arbcom, and I do not think Albanau is likely to find much favour with the arbcom, in the light of his own behaviour. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 19:30, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's not homophobia, that was the impression that he gave me at the time: a <b>deranged</b> homosexual. I was not disparaging him for being a deranged homosexual, just giving a description. In those instances where I was using "faggot" and "fag", they were referring to the lack of balls that he was displaying (e.g., talking a lot of trash but not stating his name; whining like a bitch, etc.).

<dd>I don't think that's anons editing the page, but just one anon, with so far two IPs in the same range (editing from Switzerland, it seems). OK, so, an anon with no contribs except to a userpage for an account—if there is an account by the name—which also has no contribs? I'm quite tempted to incur my first administrative action shitstorm by speedy deleting this page. "Nothing to do with creating an encyclopedia" isn't a speedy criterion, agreed, but isn't it kind of implied?

<p>It isn't a user page at all. At best, it's an IP editor's misunderstanding of the term "user page." I think he or she has come to the conclusion that one's private sandbox page is created at "user:" plus the name of the page you want. Given what this page is, it will, upon publication, be immediately VfD'd. It's a collection of Bible prophecy coming true in the newspapers sort of thing, it seems to me. Properly, one would send it to VfD, but the problem there is that the current group of VfD voters seems congenitally incapable of reading a nomination. If you said, "This is not a user page," they'd vote "Keep! It's a user page! Leave it alone!"

<dd>Update on Christ is the daily newspapers: a third IP has edited the page, 80.218.237.225, which is in a different range but resolves to the same Swiss ISP. Nobody has commented on my talk page message. Step two today: an explicit statement on the "userpage" itself (I doubt that they know from talk pages, and I don't think they're ever logged in, to get a "you have new messages" message) that I'm planning to delete.

<dd>I don't agree that it should be up to a single admin. Such a block could be hotly controversial. So it should be discussed here first. If I went around acting according to <i>my</i> subjective judgment about these things, I'd be before the ArbCom in a week. But the hardliners are supposed to get a free pass to ban somebody based on their own judgment? No, that's senseless. We have this forum here for discussion about admin actions; let's use it.

<dd>It doesn't really matter if you don't agree it should be up to a single administrator. That is the judgment that was passed.

<p>Hey, I just did some looking around and noticed something: Irate is already blocked! He was blocked by Snowspinner on July 25, the same day this was originally posted here. Yet Snowspinner has said nothing to justify his actions, much less engage in the reaching the kind of admin consensus I proposed above. Was he hoping to keep it a secret? I put heavy odds on Gerard also knowing about it and failing to mention it. Wikipedia is supposed to prioritize consensus, in case these two (the arb and his enforcer) haven't noticed. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 04:16, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, Snowspinner isn't the only admin who thought Irate should be have been blocked. Have you researched the background on this user? He was banned for three months for personal attacks, and then when he came back it didn't take long for him to fall back into his old habits. So he was placed on personal attack parole. He made the choice to persist, so he was blocked. (Oh, and did I mention he's been banned from everywhere from IRC to the mailing lists to meta?). Posting a note here is, of course, an option worth bearing in mind for admins, but Irate's case is fairly straightforward. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 18:26, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Everyking, if you had had any experience with Irate, you would know that he is a thoroughly disruptive, unpleasant user, who delights in causing other users headaches. Why should we all have to wait for the ArbComm to get through the lengthy process of banning him for a year? He's been banned once already, and that did no good. Jimbo has the ultimate sanction, and he used it well within his rights. He is perfectly entitled to do this, and he has my full support. <a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmoddy_2381.html" title="User:Smoddy">[[smoddy]]</a> 10:42, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Because megabytes of reason, argument, analogies, peer pressure, commentaries, advice, RFCs, and TWO ArbCom sanctions haven't put the tiniest <i>dent</i> in his sense of entitlement or proclamations of persecution: it's as if George Bush suddenly became a Wikipedia editor.

<dd>I'm just curious to know: Is there any discussion of Jimbo's decisions? Isn't the policy that once Jimbo speaks, there is no appeal? Isn't the ArbCom subject to him? (I'm remembering something about reserving the right to dissolve the ArbCom if it doesn't work and to overrule them if he sees fit.) The discussion here seems to suggest that perhaps Jimbo is also subject to community consensus, and I'd just like to know: Is He or is He not the final word? -- <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> · <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay">Talk</a> 06:48, August 3, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Jimbo is the (not always so benevolent) dictator, so there's nothing we can do to override one of his decisions forcibly, although he certainly has a moral obligation to account for his decisions and act responsibly, and we have every right to question and discuss his decisions (and I know someone is reading this right now and thinking "We'll see about that..."). <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 07:06, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That was what I thought; I was confused because the discussion seemed to suggest he might be subject to an overrule. The idea of the WikiGod having a moral obligation is an interesting thought, and I shall now go off to consider whether the pious is pious because it is loved by the Jimbo, or if it is loved by the Jimbo because it is pious.

<p><br /></p>
<p>Hello everybody. I am a user from Spain who has tried to do useful contributions in the article <a href="../../../j/o/s/Jos%C3%A9_Luis_Rodr%C3%ADguez_Zapatero_5f9d.html" title="José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero">José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero</a>. SqueakBox has harassed me repeatedly. He insulted me explicitly in my user page as it is found here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zapatancas&amp;direction=prev&amp;oldid=18901058" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zapatancas&amp;direction=prev&amp;oldid=18901058" rel="nofollow">[164]</a> (in any case, it is the version of my talk page of 17:16, 15 July 2005 by SqueakBox). He said "Fuck off Nazi scum".</p>
<p>I have described the harassment I suffer in the 14:59 26 July 2005 version of my user page, which has been vandalized by him <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Zapatancas&amp;oldid=19645437" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Zapatancas&amp;oldid=19645437" rel="nofollow">[165]</a>. He claims that I am abusing him and that <i>a [user] page is not an excuse for a vicious and unjustified personal attack</i>. The reason I included the description of his attacks on me in my user page is that he vandalized it when I have not created it, as can be checked in the history page, identifying me with a blocked vandal I have no relation to as I have said him once and again.</p>
<p>I have always tried to be polite with everybody. I simply believe that SqueakBox could have some mental problem because of how he behaves (for example, he once talked about supposed death threats from other users in his user page what I considered absurd after reading it). I have not tried to be hard on nobody and much less on a sick person (if that is the case), I have simply tried to express what I consider to be the source of the problem.</p>
<p>Thank you for your attention. <a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZapatancas_8ec3.html" title="User:Zapatancas">Zapatancas</a> 16:03, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
How exactly is <b>This user seems to suffer from a mental disorder (I am talking totally seriously)</b> not a vicious personal attack, the latest in a long, long line. Calling me a sick person is out of order, and I want Zapatancas to stop. Also SWquealingPig made his vicious attacks moments after Zapatancas and I had an edit war. His denial of being SquealingPig is not credible. RexJudica\ta has been permanently blocked for death threats by CesarB, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 16:38, July 26, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I am from Spain and my English is not perfect. I believe SqueakBox suffers a mental disorder because, among other reasons, he has included in his user page passages expressing he was receiving death threats from other users what I considered totally absurd. If I sounded rude in English I am sorry but I do not master the language and I have only tried to express my opinion honestly.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Effectively SqueakBox tried to start an edit war after destroying some articles I have contributed to without giving any logical reason. There was not edit war because I did not try to recover them after he destroyed them for a second time. <a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZapatancas_8ec3.html" title="User:Zapatancas">Zapatancas</a> 16:40, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>SqueakBox has just removed the following text from the article <a href="../../../j/o/s/Jos%C3%A9_Luis_Rodr%C3%ADguez_Zapatero_5f9d.html" title="José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero">José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero</a> some minutes after I introduced it:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Zapatero has been accused of telling the Spanish media in the aftermath of the attacks that suicidal bombers had been found among the victims (something discarded by all the specialists). When he was asked in December 2004 about the issue by the Parliamentary Investigative Committee created to find the truth about the attacks he declared that he did not "remember" what he had said. <a href="http://www.libertaddigital.com/php3/noticia.php3?cpn=1276239580" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.libertaddigital.com/php3/noticia.php3?cpn=1276239580" rel="nofollow">[166]</a></i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I have tried to describe an objective fact related to Zapatero's biography. I have included a source to an article in Spanish I spent some time to find for those who may not have previous information about the fact to help them contrast the information. However, my contribution has been removed providing no reason only because I added it.</p>
<p>The article has not been updated since SqueakBox accessed it for the first time some months ago and removed everything he pleased. He continues removing everything usually giving no reasons at all.</p>
<p>Is that the kind of behavior encouraged in the Wikipedia? <a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZapatancas_8ec3.html" title="User:Zapatancas">Zapatancas</a> 16:40, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think this user should not acuse me of having mental problems. He is viciously attackoing me. Why should I tolerate his abuse. I don't have amy illnesses. I just want Zapatancas to cease attacking me and gegt over the fact that I edited his work months ago. is he incapable of not attacking m,e. CesarB permanently blocked RexJudicata for death threats. So it is Zapatancas who trivialises other trolls and his own vicious attacks, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 17:09, July 26, 2005 (UTC)</p>

At 10.23am on May 5 Zapatancas reverts my edits <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jos%C3%A9_Luis_Rodr%C3%ADguez_Zapatero&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=13271202" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jos%C3%A9_Luis_Rodr%C3%ADguez_Zapatero&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=13271202" rel="nofollow">here</a>. At 10.47 SquealingPig appears, complaining about me on the Zapatero talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Jos%C3%A9_Luis_Rodr%C3%ADguez_Zapatero&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=13271374" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Jos%C3%A9_Luis_Rodr%C3%ADguez_Zapatero&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=13271374" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I revert him at 10.50 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jos%C3%A9_Luis_Rodr%C3%ADguez_Zapatero&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=13373517" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jos%C3%A9_Luis_Rodr%C3%ADguez_Zapatero&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=13373517" rel="nofollow">here</a>. He then gets in a rage and attacks me as SquealingPig many timesw in a below the belt fashion, starting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:SqueakBox&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=13273682" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:SqueakBox&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=13273682" rel="nofollow">here</a>, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 17:19, July 26, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>He then insults me saying <b>A question, do you live in Honduras because your family could not stand you any longer?</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Jos%C3%A9_Luis_Rodr%C3%ADguez_Zapatero&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=18899823" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Jos%C3%A9_Luis_Rodr%C3%ADguez_Zapatero&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=18899823" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I reacted to this by telling him to <b>fuck off you Nazi troll</b>, mild in comparison. He is now using his personal page to accuse me of being mentally ill. I have not attacked other than this one time. I think I am being very patient and tolerant to a nasty interne t troll, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 17:23, July 26, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I advise to search in Google for SqueakBox and vandalism (Click <a href="http://www.google.es/search?hl=es&amp;q=SqueakBox+vandalism" class="external text" title="http://www.google.es/search?hl=es&amp;q=SqueakBox+vandalism" rel="nofollow">here</a> for example). I got 678 results. SqueakBox is getting in continuous problems with everybody and he is always accusing others. I have taken a look at his "contributions" and it is clear he always provokes other users on purpose. He never tries to explain his deletions. And that is difficult to justify. He has a huge experience here and knows others can get angry if they are not told why their effort (usually evidently honest) are removed. He really looks for the excitement of arguing and humiliating other people. And, of course, a lot of times his page has been vandalized. Of course, that only adds to his fun as he used every attack to fuel his continuous harassment.</p>
<p>It is not true he has attacked me only once. He harasses me continuously. Today he vandalized my user page eliminating all the text in it, he has added a lot of obscene comments in my talk page, he has reverted my edit in the <a href="../../../z/a/p/Zapatero.html" title="Zapatero">Zapatero</a>'s article as I have already reported, he has accused me of being unable to write a NPOV article (this can be found in the <a href="../../../j/o/s/Talk%7EJos%C3%A9_Luis_Rodr%C3%ADguez_Zapatero_966f.html" title="Talk:José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero">Talk</a> page of Zapatero), he has said I hate Zapatero (what is completely absurd as I do not know him personally), he has used improper language in a comment addressed to me (he has used the word bulls**t), he has called me a troll and he has removed the headline User:SqueakBox I added to report his mistreatment. And that only for today. <a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZapatancas_8ec3.html" title="User:Zapatancas">Zapatancas</a> 18:10, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Excuse me but it was you who made those obscene commenbts, I was reminding you of what you are really like. Yes, you are not the only troll here. So whatr dioes that prove. That I don't like POV warriors,. and they get angry when I remove their POV. If you can't handle your work being mercilessly edited don't contribute. It was not fun for me when yopu attacked me and my dog as squealingPig. Maybe you were having fun, but I wasn't. I have not vandalised your user page, I have removed your deeply offensive personal attack against me. Wikipedia do not give you that page to launch persobnal attacks against users you don\'t like. You have used endless insults against me. just take responsibility for your actions and stop trolling. As I have elucidated above, you are SquealingPig, and you have deeply insulted me on many occassions, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 18:19, July 26, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>RickK and vandalism brought up 954 pages, while with SlimVirgin it was 779. I am in good company. Zapatancas needs to differentiate between vandalisers and those who fight the vandalism of users like SquealingPig, who only got 5 google hits, substantially less than the number of vandalsims he did, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 18:34, July 26, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>From what I've seen, I'm more inclined to side with the user in question. This looks more like a case of a confused newbie than a delibrate vandal. The user in question has created a new account, and claims to have been harrassed by Fawcett5. I don't know whether or not that's actually the case, but the notes left on the above account's talkpage seem to bear that out. I think that if there is fault here, it isn't all just on one side of the incident. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChanting_Fox_262d.html" title="User:Chanting Fox">Chanting Fox</a> 03:14, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>An INFINITE block? Snowspinner, I'm no admin, but an infinite block for copyvios seems a bit harsh. Are you sure that was warranted? --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChanting_Fox_262d.html" title="User:Chanting Fox">Chanting Fox</a> 03:24, 27 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>If an account appears to have been set up only for policy violations, indefinite blocks are entirely in order - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 18:33, 27 July 2005 (UTC)

</ul>
</li>
<li>I'm afraid that I'm going with the blocked user on this one, despite the copyvios. The infinite block is a clear violation of blocking policy and if not bad-faith is almost certaintly far too severe a punishment. The user in question appears to have been here for less than a month, and is almost certainly NOT doing this to cause trouble for people. In fact, she seems more confused than disruptive to me. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChanting_Fox_262d.html" title="User:Chanting Fox">Chanting Fox</a> 03:35, 27 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Was that really necessary, Everyking? For what it's worth, I agree that the indefinite block is too heavy given the circumstances, but I'm sure that Snowspinner will review his decision based on Fawcett5's polite note on Snowspinner's talk page. File an RFC on Snowspinner if you want to, but keep your snide remarks to yourself. I might suggest that you examine Fawcett5's comments to Snowspinner as an example of how to phrase <i>constructive</i> criticism. You're an excellent editor and admin in virtually all other regards—why can't you maintain at least a veneer of civility (or just remain stolidly silent) here? <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 04:23, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I also want to add that the idea that Mikkalai is a Stalin fan is a joke. On the contrary, he has filled Wikipedia with documents, testimony and so forth that reflect poorly on Stalin, and the CPSU during the time Stalin was the general secretary of it. Mikkalai is not pro-Stalin, he is anti-Stalin. Unlike Agiantman however, he does not make personal attacks and he is not disruptive. While msot of his material is anti-Stalin, he makes sure all of it he puts in is referenced and factual, and in neutral language, letting facts speak for themselves. He is also willing to compromise. A look over Mikkalai's edit history over the past year will show most of what he has done is fill Wikipedia with evidence about Stalin's misdeeds. But at least he uses references, sources, facts and so forth. People like Agiantman just hysterically rant that a page which consensus was reached very carefully is POV. I myself think the page is too anti-Stalin, I don't agree with this in the opening: "collectivization triggered a bitter struggle of peasants against the authorities in many areas, which significantly contributed to famine and millions of peasant casualties, particularly in Ukraine." I know the consensus-building is a delicate balancing act, so I am waiting for everyone to work other issues out before I come in and point out my problems with this sentence. AGiantman walks in on day one and starts disrupting this article which it took a long time to reach consensus on, a consensus which is ongoing. He thinks he is more important than the dozen or so people trying to achieve consensus, he is even attacking his allies like Mikkalai, who is on the anti-Stalin side but is neutral, a consensus builder and does not do original research. <a href="../../../r/u/y/User%7ERuy_Lopez_187d.html" title="User:Ruy Lopez">Ruy Lopez</a> 20:30, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, in the interest of accuracy, it's not just living people. Try Aristotle, Malthus, Locke, Galileo, Newton, Adam Smith, Kant, Hegel, Russel, and on and on.

<dd>A) All Wikipedians should not use their userpage to host philosophical manifestos having nothing to do with Wikipedia. B) I am considerably more offended by the comments about Kant and Aristotle than about the bit on Lieberman.

<p>(I'm not a lawyer, so don't take this as a legal opinion) It's also perhaps worth noting that the US and UK libel laws are significantly different. Wikipedia's servers are hosted in the US, so if there's any suing to be done I'd image it would have to be under US law. In the US, you can say pretty much anything you want about a public figure and, I gather, this is not the case in the UK. This difference might be behind some of the different views on this issue. -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_f5f2.html" title="User:Rick Block">Rick Block</a> <small>(<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERick_Block_ba04.html" title="User talk:Rick Block">talk</a>)</small> 01:50, July 28, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wikipedia can hope - and can even try to assure -- that it is sued where it is hosted, but there's no guarantee it won't be sued wherever it's distributed. Ask Vanity Fair, a U.S. magazine sued for libel -- successfully -- in Britain by a Polish director residing in France and unwilling to enter England for fear of extradition...

<p>Even if Wikipedia was sued in Britan and the British courts awarded Jimbo's house to the plaintiff, they'd have to get a US court to enforce it, and that's quite unlikely. A British court decision has no force in the United States without a US court decision to enforce it.

<p>I think just about every Wikipedian who has created a userpage with content that expresses their own views, if one finds them offensive, then don't visit the page. Unless they are making direct attacks against a user or specific racial comments, then there is no harm. There is no difference in these comments then that of the Opinion cartoons. As far as Vanity fair getting sued, they are a corporate magazine expressing its or the editors views, and not a personal userpage. Especially since a <i>Polish director</i> not a <i>public figure</i> sued them (yes I think some directors can be considered public figures, but not the majority of them). <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Who_d857.html" title="Special:Contributions/Who"><font color="#FF0033">∞</font></a><a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho_d957.html" title="User:Who">Who</a><a href="../../../w/h/o/User_talk%7EWho_fe12.html" title="User talk:Who"><font color="#00FF00">?</font><font color="#FF00FF">¿</font><font color="#0033FF">?</font></a> 04:32, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The suggestion that anyone could be sued over opinions expressed on a member's user page is preposterous. The practice of editing other members' user pages is nothing more than sophomoric vandalism, the more reprehensible when cloaked in the guise of administrative propriety.</p>
<p>Cognition ought to be commended for disclosing his POV with such candor. Would that others would be as forthcoming, particularly those surreptitious types who routinely abuse adminstrative authority by selective banning members, or protecting particular versions of articles, in the service of their POV allies. The manner in which some conduct POV warfare using administrative intrigues, shunning honest debate, is a form of corruption which has hurt Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerschelkrustofsky_0973.html" title="User:Herschelkrustofsky">HK</a> 20:50, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Just a quick comment on libel issues. It would be libelous for me to say for instance "Hamster Sandwich is a donkey molesting drug dealer" whereas to say "<i>I think</i> Hamster Sandwich is a donkey molesting drug dealer" is legally acceptable. People are legally allowed to voice an opinion, but they have to make it perfectly clear that it is an opinion. The content in question is on a personal user page; this would tend to negate Wikipedias responsibility regarding the page. Also, I am certain that if Jimbo is half as smart as I think he must be, there is a disclaimer in here somewhere that defers legal responsibility away from Wikipedia and places the onus on the individual editor. We are here voluntarily, after all. The difference betwen a user page being libelous and citing a case vis a vis Liberace vs. The Evening Standard is that the author who wrote the Liberace article was paid for professional services rendered. The paper has paid fact checkers and frankly, they got screwed in that judgement against them in that case. That being said, I am not yet a lawyer, but I have played one on television. Now I have to go and find that damn donkey, he keeps hiding all my drugs. <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHamster_Sandwich_8577.html" title="User:Hamster Sandwich">Hamster Sandwich</a> 21:01, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If he goes back to doing the same things that got him blocked the last time, then it strikes me as reasonable for an admin to block him–for short periods, up to say 24 hours–for disruption. In the interest of keeping the peace here, I'd suggest placing a block request here and allowing a second admin to actually block (in the absence of clear vandalism or outright destruction). <i>If</i> he accumulates more than one or two such blocks, I imagine that it would be very easy to persuade the ArbCom to impose a temporary injunction against editing.

<dd>There are less than 500 active and semi-active admins on Wikipeida. That's a scant number for such a huge project, perhaps if admins didn't waste so much time worrying about petty criticism of them on users talk pages that really don't ammount to much then they'd have more time to do the really important things and thereby attract less criticism. Which is more imporatant? Making sure there are no petty criticisms of admins on talk pages or making this into a real respectable encyclopedia. I fear that stamping out all dissent will only lead to more disent or more bannings of editors who would make useful contributions instead of arguing with the admins if the admins whould just loosen up and not be so sensative.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I freely admit that I've lost my cool recently, and I don't blame anyone for that but myself, but now I still have an admin hounding me who even blocked my for 12 hours for violating a rule he made up, and I'm not getting any support from the other admins below. So perhaps my opinion of the adminstrators is unfairly tarnished right now, but admins need to keep in mind that while there are rules in place to help easily address problems with editors, it's very hard to do anything when an admin becomes abusive and that's going to frustrate a lot of people. Admins can take the hard line in those cases if they want, but I doubt any good will come from it. I certainly doubt it will make this into a respected encyclopedia.--<a href="../../../1/9/8/User%7E198.93.113.49.html" title="User:198.93.113.49">198.93.113.49</a> 19:36, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I always thought that when a block was placed, it would replace any existing block. Am I just wrong now or have I always been wrong about this? Maybe this behavior changed with MediaWiki 1.5.

<dd>I asked the devs recently and was told that "no one really understands the blocking code". I <b>think</b> that blocks act independently of each other. So if I block user X for 5 hours, and then 1 minute later another admin blocks him indefinitely, in 5 hours my block will expire, the software will unlock user X, which causes both blocks disappear from the block list. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">→Raul654</a> 16:34, July 29, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmm, completely spurious and ridiculous conspiracy theory. Could Plautus be hounding us again? I would like to note that I made the second infinite block, as a good-faith reversion to the most recently-instated one, which was cancelled for technical reasons.

<p>I don't agree with the block; I think we need procedure. Plautus' behavior since his return, and I'm not saying it wasn't abhorrent before, seems more along the lines of harmless rambling and mild mischief. Really I don't think an open and shut case can be made for "banned by the community". I would support having a community vote over it, though, with an agreed upon threshold in advance, followed by an ArbCom case if that fails.

<dd>I support some kind of process - right now Plautus is being mildly disruptive, but not overly so (most of his edits seem to have been in the Talk areas).

<p>Please help me. I was blocked yesterday for this edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:209.86.128.192&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=19720370" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:209.86.128.192&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=19720370" rel="nofollow">[179]</a> by <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">User:Gamaliel</a>.</p>
<p>There is a long discussion of it here: <a href="../../../1/9/8/User_talk%7E198.93.113.49.html" title="User talk:198.93.113.49">User talk:198.93.113.49</a>. I know it is long, but please read everything under <b>12 hour block</b>. I think it will show that I am being delt with unfairly. Now Gamaliel has started list of greviances against me here <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_todo_bc76.html" title="User:Gamaliel/todo">User:Gamaliel/todo</a>. I'm embarrassed to admit that some of these things are true. I have viloated the 3RR rule in the past and did handle the John Byrne edit war badly, but I am a good editor and no troll. I'm paticularly pround of the cleanup I did of <a href="../../../o/a/k/Oak_Island_4702.html" title="Oak Island">Oak Island</a>: [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Oak_Island&amp;diff=14322374&amp;oldid=13794062" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Oak_Island&amp;diff=14322374&amp;oldid=13794062" rel="nofollow">[180]</a>], but most of what Gamaliel says about me on his page is just a personal attack.

<dd>That seems like a very random and irrelevant place to leave a comment. I can see no plausible explanation other than it being an attack on Gamaliel, intended to be read by Gamaliel.

<dd>I had no reason to think Gamaliel would read it and was surprised that he did read it. What exactly is the blockable offense here. Gamaliel has said many things far worse about me and yet my attempt to discuss the situation on Roy Lichtenstein with a user who had had similar problems with Gamaliel is considered an attack. Is it now Wiki policy that admins can block users for anything if they think is inapporiate even if it does not violate any policy?

They're either old issues that have already been delt with, things which violate no policy, alledgedly trollish behavior that he himself engages in, or simply innacurate accusations against me. --<a href="../../../1/9/8/User%7E198.93.113.49.html" title="User:198.93.113.49">198.93.113.49</a> 17:28, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The talk pages of new users should not be forums to air unrelated grievances. They should be for greeting new users and informing them of Wikipedia policies and customs, not for drawing them into preexisiting conflicts. I feel very strongly about this matter, and in light of the anon's previous history, I feel my actions were warranted. My to do list was merely a personal record/memory refresher of my interatctions with other users (as well as a list of articles I wanted to get around to editing) not meant for public consumption or as a public attack, but I suppose everything on Wikipedia is for public consumption in the end. Initially I reverted his comments to my subpage and locked it, but I decided to let them remain for the time being. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 16:25, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am a gunuine user and this is nothing more than a personal attack. Yes, I was involved in an edit war on Rob Liefeld and yes I lost my temper when a different standard was applied to other users than the one being applied to me. That has no baring on the issue here which is Gamaliel's blocking me 12 hours for a compleately unrelated comment on another page or the fact that he just today deleted a perfectly reason comment I made to the Rob Leifeld talk page which is still in the history for any one to see that it should not have been deleted.--<a href="../../../1/9/8/User%7E198.93.113.49.html" title="User:198.93.113.49">198.93.113.49</a> 19:25, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

The sole purpose for an article talk page is for productive discussion of the content of that article.

Those useless comments do not add anything to the productive discussion of an encyclopedia article, nor does a long discussion of the worth of comments like those contribute anything of worth to the article. You have recieved clear, repeated warnings from both User:Francs2000 and myself about your behavior on that page. For the last and final time, keep your comments on the topic of the article and nothing else.

I cannot win. This much is clear.

<dd>Irrelevet comment?! Three of my own comments were removed and they were completely relevent. Some of the comments made by others may ahve been questionable, but even then I think that when in doubt it's best to avoid deleting comments in a discussion. I think that this is a very valid point of discussion. I'm sorry that you and Gamaliel disagree, but we will just have to have a difference of opinion on that. However, just because you and Gamaliel don't find an issue worth discussing does not mean that those comments should be deleted. Gamaliel is at it again by the way. He's made it very clear on his talk page that he intends to revert edits to <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Scarborough_6f36.html" title="Joe Scarborough">Joe Scarborough</a> no matter how many people oppose his version and made a wildly unfounded accuasation about sock puppets (even though he's taken me to task for accusing some of being a sock puppet once) and when I tried to comment on the matter (I'm a part of the group who opposes his POV pushing on Scarboroug) he deleted my comment and left a nasty note on mt talk page.<a href="../../../1/9/8/User_talk%7E198.93.113.49.html" title="User talk:198.93.113.49">User talk:198.93.113.49</a>--<a href="../../../1/9/8/User%7E198.93.113.49.html" title="User:198.93.113.49">198.93.113.49</a> 19:48, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I asked him to take it down, as I felt it was inappropriate content. To his credit, he did so, although he did label be a "fascist", and accuse me of double standards, since I have some slightly irrelevant stuff on my user page. I do, however, marvel at the comment, <i>And anyway I wasn't "calling" you a fascist, you are a fascist, so I was merely stating fact.</i> Now, having deleted the article, all should be fine and dandy, right? Wrong. He now creates User:Wikipedia Username/Facist Beating (sic) with exactly the same content. Firstly, is the content appropriate for Wikipedia? My reaction was no, although I concede that I may be wrong. Secondly, with the letter actually being written by <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlie_Daniels_92ac.html" title="Charlie Daniels">Charlie Daniels</a>, is the letter copyvio?

<dd>I just want to say for the first part of him writing a letter to stars, that's perfectly allowable, its his own user page and its his own subpage. Saying he's not allowed to is like saying that we can't write about how old we are, etc. at our page.

<dd>I had that debate with him.

From <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUser_page_1e96.html" title="Wikipedia:User page">Wikipedia:User page</a>, section "What should I avoid": <i>Generally, you should avoid any substantial content that is unrelated to Wikipedia</i> and <i>Opinion pieces not related to Wikipedia or other non-encyclopedic material</i>.

<dd>I'm going to have to agree with Smoddy; stating your interests is relevant, because it helps other editors find you. For example, listing my Ph.D. on my page helps others realize that I am a good source of information with regard to theology. However, an open letter to Benedict XVI in my user space wouldn't be relevant to my work here. If WU wants to write an open letter, he should do it on his hard drive or on a free hosting site, like Yahoo!. If it's a copyvio, then that just makes it worse. The user should be warned to avoid personal attacks, and blocked for 24 hours for disruption if the letter-posting and/or attacks continue. -- <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> · <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay">Talk</a> 22:40, July 29, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm inclined to agree with Essjay. Some unrelated content, like the pictures people have on their user page are, IMO, fine. An open letter of complaint to the Wikipedia community is fine. Even Cognition's man-beasts, while distasteful, are useful in identifying him/her as a LaRouchie. But open letters to celebrities are not connected to Wikipedia. Of course, if it's a copyvio there's no excuse for it to be there at all. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 23:26, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If I came across this chap's edits in the normal course of events I might summarily block him for having an inappropriate username for Wikipedia, or at least have a word with him about engaging in political advocacy (his userpage). However he has made an apparently good faith VfD and this is being taken seriously, and I have taken part in the discussion, so I don't feel comfortable dealing with him as an administrator. But it does seem to me that he probably intends to use Wikipedia as part of some campaign. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 05:38, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Er... good faith nomination? In the nomination, he directly accuses <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> and others of being "racists" (I would block him for that personal attack). His userpage, which I wish you hadn't forced me to read, ew, verifies my worst fears about his motives. The irony is that he is most certainly the racist. Oh well, I guess we're not all Jews this week, maybe we'll be Muslims. --<a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 05:48, July 30, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think Dmcdevit captured my feeling exactly. I don't know if you could call it a good faith VfD, but if nothing else, someone needs to remove the personal attacks on Mustaafa. I won't do anything, since I don't want to be accused of taking racism personally (again), and I have edited his VfD. But I advise any uninvolved admin to take a look at this. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 06:07, 30 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>(I'll warn you I just had a run-in with sockpuppets on VfD today, so I may be on high-alert.) <i>But</i>, any account that is created with a throwaway username, makes its first few edits to VfD a contoversial topic and make racist personal attacks, and then makes allusions to Wikipedia's past and familiarity with an established Wikipedian ("it has been established time and time again on wikipedia that Mustafaa is biased against Whites and Jews") reeks of sockpuppetry. I don't know what conflicts Mustafaa's been in, but this is no newbie. --<a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 06:32, July 30, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Absolutely. This guy was obviously a sock puppet. I don't have a problem with socks per se, only abusive socks. The reason I listed this case here is that I'm involved in the VfD discussion so I don't feel that it would be appropriate to deal with this chap myself. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 07:51, 30 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Plus, sorry to jump in, I think a username change could also be in order.

<ul>
<li>That question is a <a href="../../../f/a/l/False_dichotomy.html" title="False dichotomy">false dichotomy</a>. ProudWHITEIsraeli is mostly only disruptive in the context of his racist user page, personal attacks and sockpuppetry, not the username. If the hypothetical ProudBLACKIsraeli acted the same, then the same would apply to him. And by the way, ProudWHITEIsraeli is also not accused of racism because of his name, but because of his own words (read the user page, he thiks all Blacks should go back to Africa!). I think either proudWHITEIsraeli (or BLACK) would be an acceptable name if it were in the context of a history of valuable contributions. --<a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 00:35, July 31, 2005 (UTC)</li>
