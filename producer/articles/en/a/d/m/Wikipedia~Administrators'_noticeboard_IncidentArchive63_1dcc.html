<p>Does this apply? I don't really know what to think - being incivil is unacceptable, but can one be blocked for it after being asked not to do it? We should hear FayssalF's side of the story before jumping to conclusions though. Izehar 17:03, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To me, it depends on whether the person is being a) blatant enough and b) disruptive enough with their incivility. Is it beginning to affect discussions or editing negatively? If so, block. Even a short-term block can be effective (3-4 hours, long enough for a cooling off). Otherwise ...... probably not. · <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0"><b>Katefan0</b></a><sup><a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKatefan0_4566.html" title="User talk:Katefan0">(scribble)</a></sup>/<small><a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_Poll_b43b.html" title="User:Katefan0/Poll">mrp</a></small> 17:08, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Admins have to use their judgement. I wouldn't block for a statement such as "Wikipedia is f--king cool." That's not a personal attack, nor disruptive.

<dd>In that instance, the profanity is being used to add emphasis to what is already a personal attack, so certainly WP:NPA applies, strongly, regardless of one's position of profanity.

<dd>Not that I disagree with what everone's saying about profanity, but what's everyone getting so worked up about? As far as I can see, all FayssalF said was "<i>Next time, I'll start blocking any user disrespecting others</i>" and then "<i>If words like f**k are acceptable here than I must remind the offenders that applying policies is the rule</i>." A threat to apply policies and block disrespectful editors is not earth-shattering. In fact it sounds fine to me; he was trying to address a <i>real</i> incivility problem, after all. If you ask me, Hipocrite is being deliberately provocative, and got what he wanted: a bunch of random people, admins included, to go criticize FayssalF, accusing him of censorship, abusing admin powers, and um, being a redneck housewife. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 21:03, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Fucking Wikipedia is not fucking censored for the fucking protection of minors; why the fuck should it be fucking censored for fucking prudes? Yes, fucking avoid fucking personal attacks, but simply fucking using fucking language that someone else finds fucking offensive is not a fucking personal attack. (By way of example, I know full well some people find blasphemy offensive, but if I want to interject "god" or "jesus h. christ" into a conversation, or if I want to insult the Prophet on a talk page, I kinda think that's within the limits of generally accepted civility.) --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 20:58, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi guys! I am very amazed by all this <a href="../../../s/o/u/Souk.html" title="Souk">souk</a>! First of all, have I blocked anyone?! It sounds like I did block people! I did not! No! So what's the problem? Threatening? Mmmmm! Yes! I did! Why? Because of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECivility_3fb1.html" title="WP:Civility">WP:Civility</a>. As Sean Black put it, depends on the context!</p>
<p>Too much of swearing, too much of f**k, too much of s**t, too much of p**s, etc... Aren't that threatening itself?! This is an encyclopaedia and and not a market place! And that's why wikipedians put thier faith on me!</p>
<p>Second thing! Why are you relating this to a religious matter????! Why not relate it to civility and stop there?!!!!</p>
<p>Anyway, (a message to <a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnittas_0872.html" title="User:Anittas">Anittas</a>), please don't judge situations as being <i>religious fanatics that try to impose their conservative stuff</i>. This is in itself a personal attack. So refrain from such declarations. I don't care if someone calls me a <i>housewive</i> anyway. My GF would love that! However, isn't <i>housewive</i> a personal attack itself? Some people are for the slogan <i>No censorship</i> in Wiki!!! C'mon! What about <i>f**k</i>? So, do I have to accept the <i>f**k</i> stuff? Respect is the key! Wherever you go! Including your own <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home.html" title="Home">home</a>!</p>
<p>Third of all, please have a time to read this at <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECivility_3fb1.html" title="WP:Civility">WP:Civility</a>. And please avoid doing the same if you are in a classroom! -- Cheers <i><a href="../../../f/a/y/User%7EFayssalF_b498.html" title="User:FayssalF">Szvest</a> 22:27, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</i> <small><a href="../../../f/a/y/User_talk%7EFayssalF_f604.html" title="User talk:FayssalF"><font style="background: orange"><sup><i>Wiki me up</i></sup></font></a></small></p>

<dd>"Some people are for the slogan No censorship in Wiki!!! C'mon! What about f**k? So, do I have to accept the f**k stuff?" Fayssal, I think the consensus is yes, unless the word <i>fuck</i> is employed as a part of a personal attack, then we must tolerate it. Some people use <i>fuck</i> lightly (JPGordon would be an example) and do not find it offensive or necessarily intend offense when using it. We don't have to share their "beliefs", as it were, but we have to tolerate them. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 22:53, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My take, for whatever it may be worth: If I say 'snot', and Doris Biggles claims to be offended by it, must I refrain from the usage? Then if Doris says 'geranium' and I claim to be offended by it, must she refrain from the usage? Surely the criterion must be whether offence was intended, rather than that offence was taken. If I know that Doris is offended by the usage of the word 'snot' and continue to use it gratuitously, specifically to offend her, I would be in error; if I use the term as I normally would, I am not in error. Similarly Doris in re 'geranium'. Similarly anyone in re 'fuck', 'hell', etc. Sbz5809 23:05, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Great job guys! Keep on filling wikipedia with whatever you want as long as <i>it is not offending anyone</i>! If you take a look at the page where that happened you'd realize that it offended many users. Anyway, I am sure most of the users who are participating in thi sdiscussion forget about this:</dd>
<dd><b>Fuck is a strong and generally provocative (and offensive) swear word in the English language. It is one of the best-known vulgarisms in the English-speaking world, and it is often considered the most impolite curse word in the English language. However, today it is used more freely.</b></dd>

<dd><b>It is unclear whether the word has always been considered impolite and, if not, when it was initially considered to be profane. Some evidence indicates that in some English-speaking locales it was considered acceptable as late as the 17th century meaning "to strike" or "to penetrate" [1]. Other evidence indicates that it may have become vulgar as early as the 16th century in England; thus other reputable sources such as the Oxford English Dictionary contend the true etymology is still uncertain, but appears to point to an Anglo-Saxon origin that in later times spread to the British colonies and worldwide.</b> -- Cheers <i><a href="../../../f/a/y/User%7EFayssalF_b498.html" title="User:FayssalF">Szvest</a> 23:18, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</i> <small><a href="../../../f/a/y/User_talk%7EFayssalF_f604.html" title="User talk:FayssalF"><font style="background: orange"><sup><i>Wiki me up</i></sup></font></a></small></dd>

<li>Hi again(?), Fayssal. I say fuck all the time, conversationally, just not on Wikipedia (I did that once whilst on free drugs, and never heard the end of it – but this isn't about Sam Spade); I don't think it makes sense to actually prohibit it explicitly as policy (we already have WP:CIV/NPA/NOT/WQT/etc). Generally, people tend aim to minimize the use of the word here, it just looks unprofessional, inter-editorially. So if you see someone say fuck, and someone else objects to it, and fuck continues to be repeated, then you can block for <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">disruption</a>. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 23:49, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>So if Doris says 'geranium' and I object, then Doris says 'geranium' again; what then? Sbz5809 00:18, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>So if someone says "Fuck me with a geranium" which bit is offensive? BTW Hiberno-English has such variants. One is "Fuck me with a handle and call me Shirley", and Irish people often say "Jaysus Fucking Christ" and "Mother of Divine Fuck". Bill Clinton and George W. Bush are notorious for their use of "fuck". Can that be mentioned? <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:#006666; background-color:orange"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 00:31, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, neither bit would offend me, but my point is that if some term were to be used <i>specifically</i> to cause offence, that would be wrong; if the same term were to be used because the user generally tends to use that term, that would not be wrong. I'm only responsible for what I mean, not for what you think I mean. Sbz5809 01:03, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fayssal, I think more people were offended by your claim that certain words are intrinsically "not suitable for Wikipedia" than were offended by any particular words. So if offensiveness is what we're striving to avoid, I think you should avoid telling people not to swear. Otherwise, I say people should just talk as is their natural habit, but not make a special effort to offend. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 00:37, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Cherish the innocent free drugs days many indentations ago.&#160;:) Babajobu, it's invariably a double-edge sword: there are ways of conveying that, too, without causing offence; or without stupid references to cats, and so on. Yikes, I'm circling far too close to the proverbial edge. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 02:07, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think anyone should have the right to block others for using swearwords unless they are used as part of a personal attack, in which case they can make that personal attack seem more insulting. However, people use "fuck" and "hell" all the time without a necessarily insulting context, and for that reason, I think the suggestion to block such users is quite absurd. <a href="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/6/6d/European_flag.svg/20px-European_flag.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" /></a><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/7/73/Flag_of_Romania.svg/20px-Flag_of_Romania.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" /></a> <b><a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonline_b297.html" title="User:Ronline">Ronline</a></b> <a href="../../../r/o/n/User_talk%7ERonline_969f.html" title="User talk:Ronline">✉</a> 07:11, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Kelly, thanks for all the good work hunting down vandals. I think its a great job you have been doing. I do have one question though: Should you be posting these in such a way as to associate the IP and usernames? I'm sure in most cases these are proxies with neglible chance of tracking down the real user using them, but that can't always be the case can it? For example one might pick off a legitimate user who had the misfortunate of using a compromised machine. As I said, I think you've been doing good work, and this is just a quibble from someone with a touch of privacy paranoia. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 19:21, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First, all of the above are vandals; their right to privacy was waived when they vandalized Wikipedia, per the <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/privacy_policy" class="extiw" title="m:privacy_policy">privacy policy</a>. Second, since I'm blocking people who are using an open proxy, presumably their identity is already protected by the mere fact that they're using an open proxy. (All of the above accounts were "throwaway accounts" created for the sole purpose of vandalizing Wikipedia. All but two of them were already blocked for one reason or another.) <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 19:30, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well technically, the relevant clause is <i>Where the user has been vandalising articles or persistently behaving in a disruptive way, data may be released to assist in the targeting of IP blocks, or to assist in the formulation of a complaint to relevant Internet Service Providers</i>, which gives two reasons for releasing a vandal's IP. As you already blocked the IP, I don't see how telling us the names using it assists with that block, and as far as I know there is no one planning a complaint to their ISP. I also note that the <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/CheckUser_Policy" class="extiw" title="m:CheckUser_Policy">CheckUser Policy</a> discourages releasing IPs as much as possible even when there has been abuse. I agree there is probably very little risk here, but I can also recall at least one posting you made where you identified two apparently legitimate users editing through one of the IPs you shut down. The paranoid guy in me just thinks that one shouldn't identify an IP address unless there is some good to come from it, and while I'm grateful that you are hunting down and blocking these, I'm not sure what additional benefit is to be had by listing the names and IPs. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 19:57, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It often helps other admins engaged in vandalism management to note patterns in the usernames used by vandals, or to correlate vandalism events. More than once I've gotten useful feedback from posting one of these notices. And since I've effectively revealed the information anyway through the block log and talk page notices, the announcement here does not further spread such information. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 20:29, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Posting known vandals' names is certainly a helpful thing, however patterns in user names can be viewed without associating the names with an IP. That argument for lisitng with an IP has no merit.

<dd>Jtkieffer, just curious what the precipitating factor was for the block. From his contributions he doesn't seem to have edited in two days, since you and he interacted regarding the sockpuppetry issue. Is he being blocked for the problems that occurred prior to the sockpuppetry concerns? I'm not disagreeing with the block; it's only that he told me he doesn't understand the timing, and I promised him I would find out.

<p>I'm not entirely sure where to discuss this, so I'm going to put it here.

Obviously this was intended in good fun, but because it provides a false sense of endorsement from <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_%28magazine%29.html" title="Time (magazine)">Time</a> it could be interpreted as a <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trademark.html" title="Trademark">trademark</a> infringment.

<dd>Yeah, there is a lot of Fair use photos there. As for the time cover itself, I am borderline on it. While we used a GFDL photo of Jimbo for the cover, the format itself was taken from an older issue, and the format of the image crediting is the same as Time Magazine, so I think we should get rid of it.

<dd>I'd put this squarely under parody - this is not a copyright concern at all, (Time magazine can neither copyright the word "Time" or the color red), but rather a trademark issue, and the rules for parodying trademarks are much looser: there is no commercial use; no possible negative effect on the sale of the trademark-holder's goods; and precious little likelihood that this will be interpreted as a Time Magazine endorsement of Wikipedia. No legal problems arise here unless we fairly clearly make some false claims of sponsorship, endorsement, or affiliation. <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_a828.html" title="User:BD2412"><font style="background:gold"><i><b>BD2412</b></i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_4cc0.html" title="User talk:BD2412"><b>T</b></a> 05:53, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>When I first saw this image I assumed that it was a genuine Time front page and might qualify when used appropriately under fair use.

<dd>From what I know of various copyright laws - is it not legal and perfectly normal to be able to use a company's logo in a parody? You don't have to state it is specifically a parody though and in the context that it has been placed it is apparent that it is a parody. -<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">localzuk</a> 10:51, 10 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I sort of recused myself from talking to him, as he stopped listening to me. I know that there is active policy to block users involved in legal cases from further editing until legal issues are resolved. I do not think that this is what the user wants, and I'm reasonably sure that if he were made aware of that policy, he would stop. Again, I post this here because Bumpusmills1 thinks of me as a "lad" and therefore brushes off anything I say to him. — <a href="../../../s/c/m/User%7EScm83x_dc0d.html" title="User:Scm83x">Scm83x</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/m/User_talk%7EScm83x_0490.html" title="User talk:Scm83x">talk</a></sup> <a href="../../../h/o/o/Image%7EHookem_hand.gif_47a3.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/b/b9/Hookem_hand.gif/18px-Hookem_hand.gif" alt="" width="18" height="18" longdesc="../../../h/o/o/Image%7EHookem_hand.gif_47a3.html" /></a> 15:39, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>Bumpusmills1 thinks of me as a "lad" and therefore brushes off anything I say to him</i>. There may be a reason for this that is unforseen by Scm83x. In the ways of my people one must earn respect. Respect nor trust is handed out freely. I do not think I've earned his respect nor the respect of anyone else here since my arrival. He feels unappreciated due to my calling him a "lad". Well his photo attests that he is a mere "lad" compared to some of us, right? I am not calling him "lad" out of spite or being mean spirited. It is a mere fact. One day he'll appreciate being called a "lad". I know when someone calls me a "lad", and it is usually somebody over age fifty, it makes me feel good inside. As one grows older perceptions change and things of this nature do not carry the same weight they once did. We all have too learn. An elder family friend said too me when I was a mere "lad" of sixteen, "A fellow never gets too old too learn something new. When you get too old to learn then it's time to die." It seemed confusing to me way back then, but now I find it profoundly true. So I'll overlook these comments by Scm83x and attribute them too his being a fine "lad". He does a great job as an editor. I'm sincerely glad he caught my seemingly threatening statements so I can eliminate them from my userpage. It is most appreciated. Wado, --Bumpusmills1 22:25, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No need to over-react about this. Bumpusmills1 is merely a newbie who is still learning Wikipedia guidelines and manners. He was targeted for some threatening actions over the last week and is a little freaked by it so has possibly overreacted himself. However, when I looked at his user page I didn't see the comment you refered to. Perhaps he already removed it. Anyway, I'd let it go and not sweat it. He's also made vast improvements in how he relates to other editors and I imagine if people would stop threatening him he'd mellow out even more.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlabamaboy_1073.html" title="User:Alabamaboy">Alabamaboy</a> 17:10, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>How many times do we let a new user break the rules under the guise of "he didn't know"? He has been warned about all of these things before. This has become a repeating pattern. The problem lies in his views that he owns any article that he edits, so he attacks those who make changes adverse to his vision for the article. Some of these users bite back. Neither is warranted in their actions, but I think if we could stop the root cause, Bumpus's views on article ownership, then the attacks would stop. The threats are still on his user page under "Bogus Users" and "My Userboxes".

I now see the comments you refer to on his user page and will mention them to him. Odds are once he is aware that this is not permitted, he will remove them. He admits to being new and is working to learn things. An RfC is overkill for a situation like this.

<dd>Well, I feel the spirit of the policy is better than the actual <i>words</i> of the policy sometimes, but we have to remember that blocking people that you are involved with in a disagreement can be a serious problem. I don't doubt he is a sock, I just think that since other Admins are around, it wouldn't have hurt to just give one of them a holler to do the dirty work. Oh well, what's done is done.

<dd>I agree with you in general, but I do think there's a significant difference between blocking for behavior and blocking a sockpuppet of an already banned user. In this case the actual identification was trivial (Fred Veraxamin was first spotted by Christopher Parham and I concurred that it was Jamal/Zephram) and thus it wasn't really much of a judgement call. But you make a good point that, when possible, neutral admins should block. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 04:03, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey... over at the Batman page, we're having to revert the same changes being made from an anonymous user changing his IP several times a day. It's not vandalism, although the page gets a reasonable amount of that; it's just bad content, and the editor is being REALLY insistent about putting it in.</p>
<p>Not sure if this is the appropriate remedy to request, or the appropriate place to request it. Simnel 10:55, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've looked at the history of this page, and the contributions from anonymous editors seem substantial. I have not found any effort to discuss the recent versions that have been reverted. Semi-protection is a drastic step. I'm hoping some dialogue can happen first, and it won't be necessary. -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuelWantman_9090.html" title="User:SamuelWantman">Samuel Wantman</a> 11:26, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There are a few users who are highly concerned that I'm not learning wiki-ways or learning "<i>how</i>" to be in compliance with wiki-procedures, rules, etc. I am learning "<i>how</i>" to be in compliance. I've been here a month now and I've endured harassment, vandalism, and nit-picking; some of which I brought upon myself. However, some of it was not provoked in any way. There are some users who'd really like too throw me out the door and slam it shut behind me. Many of these same users I've had absolutely no contact with whatsoever until the last couple of days. I only contacted these same users in the form of a rebuttal. I realize few here have "<i>any</i>" respect for me as a person and I'm getting fairly accustomed too it. Do I like it? I don't like it at all, but there isn't anything I can do about it either. I have my own standard of beliefs, opinions, and views; as we all do, and I've learned too do my best too keep them out of the loop here at wikipedia. It isn't at all easy for a person as opinionated as myself too curb this. I feel I'm handling it and learning diplomacy, which I've admitted has eluded me all of my life. Some have over-reacted and are in the worry mode. Stop worrying about me for a while. I'm getting the knack of things.

<p>See Talk:Paula Rizzuto. This is the guy under 1000 sock names who I've been tracking several months. His MO is to make slanderous additions to Australian politics articles. In this case, he's created an entire article about a minor Australian political figure and edited it as <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephenBengHo_1ec8.html" title="User:StephenBengHo">User:StephenBengHo</a>, which is the name of her husband. Of course, checkuser shows it to be the usual sock of 1000 heads.</p>
<p>I have a name for the sockpuppeteer, but won't reveal it until confirmed. But he's seriously trying to use Wikipedia as an arena for particularly stupid political games. His contributions are bad enough that I locked Paula Rizzuto blank with <a href="../../../d/e/l/Template%7EDeletedpage_0567.html" title="Template:Deletedpage">template:deletedpage</a>; I strongly suggest this for other examples of his work, and to keep a <i>very</i> close eye on <i>any</i> pages about current Australian political figures, major or minor.</p>
<p>I previously made a range block on the IP, but the current one is a new range (same geographical area). Dealing with these one at a time.

<p>Given the many comments in the RFC about the degree to which KM has or has not retained the community-wide trust needed to be an arbitrator, I don't see a <b>neutral</b> link indicating that she is a candidate in the current arbcom elections and telling people where to go to vote on her candidacy inappropriate. Since the official format of the arbcom elections includes oppose votes (although many have argued against this) it isobviously thought important when people disapprove of a particualr person as a candidate for arbitrator. And people who approve of KM's actions (and ther are quite a number) can just as esily follow the link. This is not the same IMO as a msg sent sepecifically to presumed opponents of a particualr candidate, urging them to vote agaisnt that candidate. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 15:16, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>In the end, Jimbo chooses the arbitrators, taking input from the community. He is, as is well known, a remarkably intelligent man, and I'm sure that he's capable of following edit histories and whatnot.

That is the exact point of <a href="../../../p/i/_/WP%7EPI_8430.html" title="WP:PI">WP:PI</a>. And when you say "fuck process" IMO you also hurt the project, even if you intend it as a joke.

<dd>Since it doesn't really incluide a rule of action it is perhaps not suitable for policy status.

Reply to DESiegal: I'm sure that it says lots of useful things, but getting policy consensus out of a situation like this tends to require boldness. Not recklessness, just enough balls to take actions that focus attention on the issues at hand. Parts of our bureacracy have been clogged in recent days by some rather determined vote packing, but things are beginning to thaw and a consensus is beginning to form on what kinds of template, at least, are so unacceptable that they can be speedied. It's far from complete but it was significantly jump-started by the speedying of an anti-scientology template, quite outside process, followed by the out-of-process speedying of 15 more templates and an associated redirect, which have been discussed in some depth on <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a> and in outline principle on the talk page of <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a>. So we've got a bold proto-process in place, with an approval mechanism in operation and some embryonic policy formation on the back burner. Plenty of consultation going on, no reason for anybody feel left out. In my opinion, this is a pretty good way to cook. Where else do you think our original processes came from, if not by these darwinian methods? --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 19:11, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It has nothing to do with darwin. What it does have to do with, is that templates such as that are harmful and need to be kept in userspace (if that). Making templates for userboxes in that capcity is unneeded, and you can just as easily make userboxes that are confined to your own userspace. -<a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegamanZero_5c06.html" title="User:MegamanZero">MegamanZero</a>|<a href="../../../m/e/g/User_talk%7EMegamanZero_9677.html" title="User talk:MegamanZero">Talk</a> 19:17, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It is sometimes true that reasoanble policy consensus can come out of "act out-of-process; descuss; formulate and codify resulting views" it is also true that much of current wikipedia policy arose in something like this way. It is my view that the act out-of-process step is not needed, adn is ultimately more harmful than helpful -- and that this is more tue the larger the scope of the action -- doing this to a single widely noticed template may get discussion going, while doing it to every trmplate to which the final policy might apply seems like an attempt to win the debate by forstalling it. So does re-deleting after undeletion, IMO, particualrly when the undeltion was accompanied by multiple comments indicating why users felt the deletion to be a bad idea. i accept that Tony had no intent to forstall the debatge, and he is pusing policy proposals, for which i applaud him. I wish he weren't quite so ready to be <b>bold</b> on deletion issues, <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">WP:BOLD</a> by its terms refers to editing issues. Perhaps I am wrong, but I disagree with this approach, and i think in the long run it will hurt us if it becomes common -- indeed unless it becomes rather rarer than it has been. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 19:27, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>There is a growing suspicion that the page has been infiltrated by right wing <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_Republic_0fa6.html" title="Free Republic">Free Republic</a> activists. FR had already named the article as one to target for alleged liberal bias. A Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual/Transexual category was added to the page unilaterally though there was no consensus. (Now in a vote the insistence of those responsible is that a super consensus is used to overturn the addition, even though questions arise not just over accuracy but whether it fits the categorisation guidelines. One user appeared and edited no other articles until the fact that he curiously <i>appeared</i> and focused on no other article, at which point he <i>suddenly</i> developed interests elsewhere. The particular user had engaged in a series of homophobic attacks on the talk page.</p>
<p>An attack has no appeared on <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1549132/posts#46" class="external text" title="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1549132/posts#46" rel="nofollow">their</a> page and followed through <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1549132/replies?c=46" class="external text" title="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1549132/replies?c=46" rel="nofollow">here</a> attacking someone they claimed is "a pro-homosexual administrator who guards the NAMBLA article to hide the fact that this group of pedophiles is homosexual."</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Attraction to sexually mature teens under the age of consent just makes one a "Fag with Good Taste," not a pedophile.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Two users seem to have appeared in or around the date of the Free Republic stuff and in one case primarily edit the NAMBLA page, one almost exclusively do so, using extreme and provocative comments. The first edit by one of the two, at least using a usernic, was curiously to the name of the admin <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1549132/replies?c=46" class="external text" title="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1549132/replies?c=46" rel="nofollow">this page had attacked</a>.

<dd>Sorry to reject your, uh, interesting conspiracy theory here, Jtdirl, but I'm not conservative, I'm not a homophobe, and I've never seen those pages you linked until now. In fact, I argued against the category at first, but then I was (rightly) put in my place by Corax and Freakofnurture.</dd>
<dd>I also find it ridiculous that you could even fathom Hermitian's "Fag with Good Taste" comment as an insult. <code>// <b><a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParoxysm_2155.html" title="User:Paroxysm">paroxysm</a></b> <a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParoxysm_da02.html" title="User talk:Paroxysm">(n)</a></code> 21:44, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Believe it or not, not everybody who disagrees with you is a part of some large conspiracy. I've been editing the article in question for over a year. The article in question remained peacefully classifed in Category:LGBT organizations for over eight months before this ordeal, contrary to your characterization that it was recently "added unilaterally." Quite frankly, I am tired of the insinuations and outright accusations that I have setup sock puppets, that I am not making my contributions in good faith, and that I am a part of some conservative cabal seeking to attack gays. In fact, I am gay. But I suppose these are the kinds of low tactics to which one must stoop if one does not have tenable arguments to propose in support of one's positions. <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorax_e152.html" title="User:Corax">Corax</a> 06:10, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm reporting this here because I just blocked <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnakinskywalker_2a3a.html" title="User:Anakinskywalker">Anakinskywalker</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> 24 hours for violating 3RR and editing disruptively. Hipocrite is dissatisfied with his block and I wanted to submit it for others' review.</p>
<p>Anakinskywalker and Hipocrite both violated 3RR on the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Ottawa_588d.html" title="University of Ottawa">University of Ottawa</a> article, however Hipocrite reverted himself on his last edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=University_of_Ottawa&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=34664560" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=University_of_Ottawa&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=34664560" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>. I blocked him anyway because I don't believe the revert was done in good faith; his edit summary read "oops, one might argue I just violated 3rr. I'll wait for AS to get blocked then fix the article again." Anakinskywalker is a relatively new user and as I have watched their dispute, it's my opinion that Hipocrite has taken aggressively uncompromising stances <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AUniversity_of_Ottawa&amp;diff=34492818&amp;oldid=34475100" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AUniversity_of_Ottawa&amp;diff=34492818&amp;oldid=34475100" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AUniversity_of_Ottawa&amp;diff=34292932&amp;oldid=34285729" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AUniversity_of_Ottawa&amp;diff=34292932&amp;oldid=34285729" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>, skirted the boundaries of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">incivility</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AUniversity_of_Ottawa&amp;diff=34292932&amp;oldid=34285729" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AUniversity_of_Ottawa&amp;diff=34292932&amp;oldid=34285729" rel="nofollow">[25]</a> and, in this case, baited Anakinskywalker into taking actions Hipocrite knew would get him blocked. Anakinskywalker has not been an angel either <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:University_of_Ottawa&amp;diff=34451449&amp;oldid=34451206" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:University_of_Ottawa&amp;diff=34451449&amp;oldid=34451206" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>, but my impression is he's significantly newer than Hipocrite.</p>
<p>I welcome other administrators' review. For the record, I've offered to lift both of their blocks if they agree to avoid editing the UO article for the time period in which they would've otherwise been blocked; Hipocrite has yet to respond to this, but has posted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AHipocrite&amp;diff=34666086&amp;oldid=34665980" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AHipocrite&amp;diff=34666086&amp;oldid=34665980" rel="nofollow">this</a> on his talk page. · <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0"><b>Katefan0</b></a><sup><a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKatefan0_4566.html" title="User talk:Katefan0">(scribble)</a></sup>/<small><a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_Poll_b43b.html" title="User:Katefan0/Poll">mrp</a></small> 22:24, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just wanted to give people a heads-up on <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorton_devonshire_9599.html" title="User:Morton devonshire">User:Morton devonshire</a>. Makes some good edits, but also others, usually with political POV, that border on vandalism. Has been repeatedly warned about the latter, but simply removes warnings from his user talk page. I figured I should mention here, since if you have an issue with him and go to his user talk page you'll have to look at the history to see that he has been warned repeatedly. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Morton_devonshire&amp;diff=33433843&amp;oldid=32928536" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Morton_devonshire&amp;diff=33433843&amp;oldid=32928536" rel="nofollow">warning from me</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Morton_devonshire&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=33433843" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Morton_devonshire&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=33433843" rel="nofollow">warning</a> from <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchuminweb_da4b.html" title="User:Schuminweb">Schuminweb</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Morton_devonshire&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=33434231" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Morton_devonshire&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=33434231" rel="nofollow">removal of latter</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Morton_devonshire&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=33438307" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Morton_devonshire&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=33438307" rel="nofollow">removal of former</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Morton_devonshire&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=33515406" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Morton_devonshire&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=33515406" rel="nofollow">Schuminweb restores both warnings</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Morton_devonshire&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=33810875" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Morton_devonshire&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=33810875" rel="nofollow">Morton accuses Schuminweb of being my sockpuppet</a>.

Since campaigning in RFA's is generally frowned upon, and SEWilco is on probation for regarding to disruptive behaviour (stemming, in part, from his previous campaigning against WMC), I believe that SEWilco has violated the terms of his revert parole. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 08:03, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I had already voted when I got SEWilco's message (for the record, I voted support this time around). Letting people know about an RFA is one thing, letting only the people who voted oppose last time is another thing entirely, and quite inappropriate. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">D</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><b>e</b></a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">ath</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 08:16, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As I had stated on my Talk page, I misread part of the list and notified some who had already voted.

<dd>I think you're letting your voting POV show. You're only mentioning an Oppose vote and not the two Support votes from two others notified, Calton and Carnildo. I'm not the one interfering with an RFA, as I'm trying to notify everyone equally in the previous RFA who has not participated (and thus does not need notification), and complete notification is what is required for it to not be spamming. El C already has interefered by removing some of the notifications. (<a href="../../../s/e/w/User%7ESEWilco_ba0d.html" title="User:SEWilco">SEWilco</a> 08:37, 11 January 2006 (UTC))

<dd>The question is whether Calton and Carnildo knew about WMC's 2nd RFA before they were notified, even if they didn't vote until after they were. In this case I doubt many of the opposers did until you mentioned it. <a href="../../../n/s/l/User%7ENSLE_4a42.html" title="User:NSLE">NSL</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">E</font></a> <sub>(<a href="../../../n/s/l/User_talk%7ENSLE_f7ec.html" title="User talk:NSLE">T</a>+<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_NSLE_ad4c.html" title="Special:Contributions/NSLE">C</a>)</sub> 08:40, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For the record, I didn't know about the RFA before the Talk Page note. I also voted "Support" in the first one, so if SEWilco was trawling for "Oppose" votes he was doing a bad job of it. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 14:23, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That is your opinion. I have no idea how who would have voted.

<dd>Try acting upon the facts rather than incorrect interpretations. Guettarda is incorrect. I am notifying everyone who participated in the first RFA but not yet in the second RFA. I edited the list before extracting the names in a way that I can't tell who voted for or against in either RFA. Dunc changed his signature between the two RFAs so "User:Duncharris" does not match between the two RFAs.

<dd>I, for one, don't always follow RFAr, and was not aware of WMC's candidacy until I saw SEWilco's posts appearing on my watchlist.

<p>I don't see how it's disrupting Wikipedia to let me know that someone whose RfA I opposed is asking for the mop again. I welcome it. I'd have been annoyed to miss the vote. I welcome the notification of anything another editor thinks I might be interested in. If I don't want to know, I can just ignore it. What's disrupted?</p>
<p>This notion that votes should be semisecret, with only those who happen to stumble on them (or who are emailed or telephoned by interested parties of course) able to vote on them, is bonkers. I've never seen anything even approaching a decent rationale for it. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 08:56, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I request that <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">User:El C</a>'s rollback of my notifications be rolled back so the required full notification is restored. You'll note that this discussion has also interefered with my notifications, and should not consider the current partial notifications as a factor. When I have time to continue I'll complete the required full notification. Below is the list.

<p>The notification on my talk page was removed. I have reverted the removal. I resent anyone removing <b>any</b> msg from my talk page (other than myself). It is also quite ineffective since I tend to look at the diff of the last msg sent, which obviouly highlights the removal. I also do not see that a general announcement to those who might be interested, as evidenced by their former participation, is in any way a bad idea, particualrly when name changes are involved. Indeed it might be a good idea to routinely post the names of nominees with a link to the RfA page to the Village pump, for greater visibility and hence greater tranparency. Targeting announcements to presumed suporters or opponents is a bad idea, but a neutral msg (which the one on my talk page was) to a neurally selected list (which <a href="../../../s/e/w/User%7ESEWilco_ba0d.html" title="User:SEWilco">User:SEWilco</a> says this was, and no one has offered any evidnce to the contrary in this thread) does not seem undesireable to me. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 16:09, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

Most attempts in making a discussion with this user results in personal attacks and name-calling from him/her (and continued reverts) as if Wikipedia were some kind of personal battleground on who's right and who's wrong.</p>
<p>The origin of the problem stemmed from the <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gothic_Metal_c57b.html" title="Gothic Metal">Gothic Metal</a> article, involving a revert war that included myself, other users (for one version) and Leyasu (his/her version); there was no concensus on this discussion, and Leyasu eventually posted his/her version without said concensus. Rather than flare another revert war, I placed a (((verify))) tag at the top of the article, and like the beginning, the user has still failed to provide sources for the points argued in the discussion board for their article. The same goes for the <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symphonic_metal.html" title="Symphonic metal">Symphonic metal</a> article, and now the <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_metal.html" title="Dark metal">Dark metal</a> article.

<p>I ran across User:Jim Apple advertising this betting pool on when deeceevoice would leave Wikipedia. My immediate inclination was to speedy it and block the user for disruption, however, I decided to give him the benefit of the doubt, assume good faith, and give him the opportunity to llist it for speedy deletion himself. I left a note to that effect on the user's talk page, further indicating that if he chose not to, I would list it on MFD and bring the issue here to discuss whether a disruption block was in order. He did indeed choose not to have it deleted, and true to my word, I have listed it on Mfd (<a href="../../../m/i/s/Wikipedia%7EMiscellany_for_deletion_User_talk%7EJim_Apple_deeceevoice_departure_1145.html" title="Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/User talk:Jim Apple/deeceevoice departure">Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/User talk:Jim Apple/deeceevoice departure</a>) and am now raising the issue here to get input from other admins as to whether a disruption block is in order. Given the controversey surrounding deeceevoice's RfAr, I am astounded that a user would do this, but further, I'm astounded that a user would disregard two administrators (Jmable also spoke up against it) protesting against it and pushing for him to have it speedy deleted. I have been online since 6AM this morning (it is 1:30AM now) so I am going home to bed, but I leave this situation in the capable hands of my fellow administrators and rest assured that you will see it solved. -- — <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> · <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay">Talk</a> 06:32, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>well, I agree with the deletion, but give the guy a break. What he did was not "POINT" since he didn't disrupt anything. What he did was not a PA, it amounted to saying "I don't like you" I suppose, and there are many ways of saying that, many of them frequently seen on talkpages. What he did was poor wikiquette. We tell him we consider it poor wikiquette and delete or blank the page. Dcv is not exactly an unproblematic user herself, what with the insistence on keeping the Nazi vandalism featured on her page. Again, well done deleting the page, but making a "disruption" case out of this is a little over the top imho. I would be grateful if the disruptive editors I have to deal with would confine themselves to their own userspace :) <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 13:19, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I (and many other users) have been in a content dispute with Nixer where he has been conducting some magnificently bold revert wars. He knows that he has violated the 3RR and yet proceeds, I can't imagine what is going on in his brain while he is doing these things. He recently <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Comparative_military_ranks_of_World_War_II_0409.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Comparative military ranks of World War II">nominated</a> one of the disputed article for deletion.

<p>He has been pushing an extremely odd POV on these articles and has been opposed by many editors. He revert wars consistently and he knows he is doing it. He continued to revert after the compaint had been filed. I have no idea what he thinks he's doing, perhaps he can't understand the 3RR, but I think he is a very problematic user.

<p>Nixer is extremely difficult. Most of the time he doesn't even appear enough sense for me to understand what he wants.

<p>Sorry to bring this up again everyone, but I feel this is important. There's been a lot of public vitriol between us lately and it's spilled over into a number of pages and unfortunately a number of people have been drawn into what was originally a legitimate disagreement of opinion but escalated out of hand. I take my share of the blame and I would like to apologise to everyone but most importantly Sarah for my attitude, my comments towards her, and how this has affected her and those also involved. I've apologised to her privately but I thought I needed to apologise to a number of other people too and I thought this was the best way to do so.

<li>These Fair use and other copywrite issues are confusing to many people. Megamanzero is a fairly new user, but he shouldn't have replaced the images under a new proported license. Is a one week block a bit long in light of the fact that he is still fairly new and seems to be quite youthful?--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 22:19, 7 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>He's not all that new, having been here for at least a couple of months, and deliberately applied an inappropriate copyright tag, implying he knows precisely how copyright tags work. I imagine if he establishes by email with Kelly Martin that it absolutely won't happen again, and Kelly is satisfied of that fact, that the block can be shortened or lifted. But that's up to Kelly. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 22:25, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I suggest that a user savvy enough to alter the copyright template on an image in an attempt to get away with copyright infringement doesn't get the benefit of claiming a lack of experience with how we deal with copyright issues.

<p>Megaman Zero appointed me voluntarily as his mentor a couple of weeks ago. As there are enough eyes on this case and he should know not to do anything like this again, I propose that the block remain as forty-eight hours. If he doesn't take copyright very seriously thereafter , then a one-month block would be deserved. I know that an indefinite block may be considered in circumstances where someone has knowingly tried to fiddle the copyright policy (this would apply if he did it again, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMegamanZero&amp;diff=34360505&amp;oldid=34349616" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMegamanZero&amp;diff=34360505&amp;oldid=34349616" rel="nofollow">this</a>), but this is a user who genuinely wants to help Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 09:23, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This seems very petty for a copyright issue. Just delete the picture and be done with it. Is a block really necessary? Let alone threats of an indefinite block for what, listing a picture without appropriate copyright? There's so many pictures on here without proper copyright that it's not funny. Whilst that is an issue in itself, I don't think that someone should be blocked over something like this.

<dd>Given the location of this artist, there is pronbably few times that the artist might even email, so I will suggest this: SlimVirgin launches an email explaining about the Permissions/GFDL and all of that good ol' fun stuff and explain about where the email should be sent to to grant permissions. Until we get a response back from permissions, I respectfully ask SlimVirgin to remove that photo for that duration. Once we get the email and the artist give us the green light, then SlimVirgin can put it back.

<dd>I hope you're not accusing me of doing anything wrong. I'm adding a POV tag to an obviously opinionated section, and attempting to engage in dialogue with Gibby. If Gibby wants, he can revert my attempts to fix the section, that's fine. But I'm not going to let him remove the POV tag as well. POV tags function as a "release valve" for edit wars - the party that is unwilling to revert war (me) can instead add the tag and engage in discussion. They are meaningless if we allow anyone to remove them. The general protocol on Wikipedia is that nobody should remove a POV tag until there is consensus that the dispute is resolved. Most admins frown upon removing valid POV tags. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 07:18, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I frown on it as well, I'm simply stating that its not vandalism, and edit wars are bad, whatever they are over. For what its worth, you are correct that it is original research, but thats a verifaibility dispute, not a pov one, but thats semantics.

<p>I may be the wrong person to do this but I haven't seen anyone else step up to the plate. Since I'm user banning both of them from this category page I'm hoping I won't be accused of bias. If one simply reviews the edit history of the cat you will see these two going back and forth over the same issue from their ArbCom case that resulted in <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProbation_b453.html" title="Wikipedia:Probation">probation</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Instantnood_2#Instantnood_placed_on_probation" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Instantnood_2#Instantnood_placed_on_probation" rel="nofollow">[40]</a>. The warring on this cat has been going on for more than a month. Per that decision I placed the ban notice on the talk page and notified them both. I am <b>sincerely hoping</b> that this ends here, the edit warring has to stop as if another Arb motion<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration#Motion_to_extend_Instantnood_and_Huaiwei_probation_.284.2F0.2F0.2F0.29" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration#Motion_to_extend_Instantnood_and_Huaiwei_probation_.284.2F0.2F0.2F0.29" rel="nofollow">[41]</a> wasn't enough to stop them already.</p>

<dd>It looks to me like a good shoot, and indeed exactly like their Usual Revert War. Of course, I still have the niggle that, as I pointed out when the decision was being finalised, much of this dispute was over <i>catgeories</i>, and those aren't expressly included in the probation (though at least on arbiter has expressed the view that it covers them regardless, by what seems to me some Mysterious Method). <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 09:28, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I apologise, but I noticed this post (and linked from the one in my talkpage) only after doing my "routine" of going up my watchlist and basically scrutinising every instantnood edit and making reverts/edits where neccesary. Meanwhile, may I point out, that the revert warring is much more widespread then otherwise suggested above. I even posted a list of "current hotspots" several times before (including in this very page), with little intervention from admins so far.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 23:52, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

My suggestion to <b>both of you</b> is to quit following the edits of the other around, this is how this keeps occurring. Also, I would cease the POV-pushing into just about any article that has anything to do with China, the dispute is the same carried from page to page to page as shown below. I'm well aware it was going on, I chose this one to make the point and apparently it didn't take because today you two have been at it again. I'm not the only one following this now and I strongly suggest you guys try something to work out your differences before it gets one or both of you banned. --<a href="../../../w/g/f/User%7EWgfinley_3fa2.html" title="User:Wgfinley">Wgfinley</a> 02:06, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you all.. Thanks so much for help bringing the issues towards resolution. While I understand that sysops have to respond accordingly as mandated by the ArbCom decision, I'd like to emphasise that it's much more important to help Wikipedia to solve the trouble through discussions, with the inputs from the broad community who're familiar with the issues. Only by doing so can we get out of the trouble by mechanisms of consensus building. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 19:17, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A consensus is not required; the imposition of this restriction is pursuant to an order of the Arbitration Committee. The Arbitration Committee has determined that such regulation would, when applied by the agreement of three administrators, be in the interest of furthering the development of the encyclopedia. Wikipedia is not a "vehicle for free speech" or a soapbox; it is an encyclopedia, and speech which does not further the development of the encyclopedia can be curtailed, especially when it becomes disruptive. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 15:28, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I think it has now been misused. I quite agree that "speech which does not further the development of the encyclopedia can be curtailed". But apparently we disagree as to where this starts. Disallowing comments on someone who currently stands for office (and whom I very much support, BTW) is a very strong and, in my opinion, very much anti-productive restriction.--<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephan_Schulz_3024.html" title="User:Stephan Schulz">Stephan Schulz</a> 15:44, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Second, we are a private foundation running a private website; we can ban who we want, block who we want, and restrict the contributions of who we want, and the only things that we have to answer to are our own policies, which we can change at our discretion, and Jimbo Wales, who formed the ArbCom and gave them the power to issue orders like the one against SEWilco.

I don't claim there is a <i>right</i> to free speech on Wikipedia (altough I do hope there is a strong community consensus for a reasonable right to it), I claim we should have and allow (reaonable) free speech.

<dd>there is no "free speech on Wikipedia" any more than there is "free speech on Britannica" or "free speech on Stephan's cellphone". "Free speech" means that you are free to speak, using your mouth, or media in your possession, without fear of punishment. It does not mean that you may use media paid for by others. Where do people get the idea that there is anything like a principle of "free speech" on Wikipedia?? What you do have, on Wikipedia unlike Britannica or Stephan's cellphone, is the right to speak, <i>at all</i>, within strict bounds known as <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicy_66bd.html" title="Wikipedia:Policy">Wikipedia:Policy</a>, as long as you are not banned.

<p>I think this action is probably a mistake. I have seen no evidence supporting it, and I see no reason to cooperate in enforcing it. I urge its reconsideration. It is apparently within the letter of the current ArbCom ruling, but I think the admins imposing this block ought to lay out their ressons in detail, either here or on some page to which the provide a link here. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 16:14, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As to "free speech" the legal protections of free speech in the US Constitution apply to govermental action and do not apply on a privately owned forum such as this, as others have said above. But I hope that free communication is an important value on wikipedia, and that we would tend not to block speech unless it is positively disruptive to the goal of building an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 16:53, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That is by no means as clear as some people seem to think. To quote from <b>Marsh v. Alabama</b>: "the more an owner, for his advantage, opens up his property for use by the public in general, the more do his rights become circumscribed by the statutory and constitutional rights of those who use it." Wikipedia is about as open fot the public as possible, and it is certainly for the advantage of the owner (who wants us to build an encyclopedia). But I'm not arguing for a legal right to free speech under US or other law. Wikipedia is not primarily a number of files on a hard disk. Our goal is to make a great encyclopedia. But our tool for doing this is the Wikipedia community. And I think that we as a community, essentially making our own rules (under Jimbo's benevolent, but remote dictatorship) should recognize a reasonable right to free speech. As I wrote above, that does not extend to massive vandalism or similar. But commenting on the actions of someone who runs for office is one of the most elementary, most protected form of expression in any society. If SEWilco uses spamming for that, we should censure him. But a reasonable way to do this would be a revert and a limited block (for, say. 24 or 48 hours). --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephan_Schulz_3024.html" title="User:Stephan Schulz">Stephan Schulz</a> 23:12, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I request that "three or more Administrators" remove the above "block" on my "commenting". I note that my recent comments on WMC have been within his RFA. It is not clear if "commenting" includes the neutral "you may be interested" phrasing in my incomplete WMC RFA notifications. I'll note that the above block gives no indication of how many Administrators opposed such action, and only says there were three who supported it.

We could, if it were warranted, tell the 3 in question that we think they were wrong; but this strawpoll wouldn't be binding in any case. – <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadell_cd19.html" title="User:Quadell">Quadell</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuadell_8ab2.html" title="User talk:Quadell">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../b/o/u/Wikipedia%7EBounty_board_8f83.html" title="Wikipedia:Bounty board">bounties</a>)</sup> 21:18, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So, as I recall from the enforcement requested blurb, this particular strawpoll is pointless?</dd>

</li>
<li>Having spent considerable time dealing with SEWilco's previous efforts regarding WMC (the 3RR/parole episode), I nonetheless find it hard to understand this decision. Possibly the failure to explain the rationale is a factor here... On the face of it, SEWilco has had a difficult-to-enforce restriction imposed without terribly good reason (per DESiegel above). Furthermore, Wikipedia sanctions are, in my understanding, largely preventative, not punitive: since WMC is unlikely to go through an RFA any time soon (since this would require desysopping first, barring the unlikely failure of the current RFA), what <i>purpose</i> does this restriction serve? (If the restriction relates to other behaviour, why isn't it mentioned in the remark that begins this section?) Note also that this restriction does not merely place a burden on SEWilco, but potentially also on others who may have to deal with the fallout from it. If his actions deserved a temporary block (for disruption, say), fine. Just because the Arbcom made this restriction possible does not mean it was the right thing to do at this time, in this way. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/d/2/User_talk%7ERd232_56da.html" title="User talk:Rd232">talk</a></sup> 00:05, 12 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It <i>is</i> preventative. SEWilco has been harrassing WMC for months with all means at his disposal (not just his RfA, but things like wikistalking and bringing up repeated frivolous requests for sanction). WMC needs a break, and it was precisely this sort of behaviour that the arbitration probation was meant to cover. This shouldn't effect SEWilco's editing in the slightest, and should he behave himself, will likely prevent him from getting a more serious ban for the same reason. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 02:18, 12 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>As I indicated, I'm aware of SEWilco's past behaviour, having been involved with dealing with some of it. I just don't think this particular behaviour alone warrants this sanction - it seems disproportionate (1 year, blanket no-commenting), if you take into account that he was being relatively neutral in terms of who he was contacting. It also seems to require a fairly liberal interpretation of the ArbCom decision: "If in the opinion of any three administrators, for good cause, he is responsible for disrupting the functioning of Wikipedia..." This, in my view, does not qualify, especially as in the ArbCom context it relates most obviously to the use of a bot. Has there been other recent behaviour that could reasonably be considered harassment of WMC? That would make all the difference to my view of this sanction. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/d/2/User_talk%7ERd232_56da.html" title="User talk:Rd232">talk</a></sup> 11:34, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>This "poll" is a horrible idea from start to finish. It miscontrues the nature of the arbcom remedy, but more to the point, while it'd be one thing if some large number of admins spontaneously opposed such a measure (for the record, I support it), for the <i>subject</i> of it to immediately start initiating "appeals" and other made-up-on-the-spot processes is entirely another. A good-faith attempt to comply with these restrictions really would be the best way to "circumvent" them, in the longer run. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 19:24, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<p>I have to saw, SEW, this is not good behaviour. It is not for you to decide how admins are to decide their consensus. Your restrictions were validly invoked under the ArbCom ruling. If you want the admins' decision overturned, you should contact the Arbitration Committee. Admins, other than those who initially imposed the ban, are not able to revoke it. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Korn_fe1c.html" title="User:Sam Korn">[[Sam Korn]]</a> 00:13, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>First of all, this poll is crazy. Second of all, the use of this measure is straightforward - simply put, most of the case regarding SEWilco regarded his harassment of WMC. This brings that to a halt.</p>
<p>Thirdly, regarding SEWilco's questions about the limits of this, allow me to be clear, though speaking strictly for myself. The purpose of this injunction is to prevent SEWilco from causing WMC the slightest bit of distress, irritation, or difficulty. The clear message is not "moderate your conduct" or "only be impartial," but rather "leave him the hell alone." Should SEWilco find bold new ways of being a problem for WMC, he should expect these bold new ways to be forbidden as well. Should he focus his attention on other people instead of WMC, he should expect to be pried off of them by force as well. There are no rules here to game. We are playing Calvinball. If we do not like how the game is turning out, we will simply change the rules until it turns out right. It is thus far more important for SEWilco to understand the goal than the rules. For that, there is no literal phrasing to parse - there is only common sense and basic decency. If he lacks those, there is nothing that can be done for him. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Phil Sandifer</a> 02:37, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is some ambiguity over whether click-through licensing is actually legally binding.

<p>If the text at the bottom is legally binding (and Wikipedia seems to assume it is), then when a user enters text into Wikipedia the user <i>does</i> agree to license it under the GFDL, whether the user later denies it or not. A similar case would be if a person went to an Apple software store and asked to purchase some Apple software, but stated out loud that he does <i>not</i> agree to the terms of conditions, even though he will click "yes" in order to install it. Since such a case has never appeared before the U.S. court system, no one knows how that would play out - it would be up to Apple to decide whether to sell it to him or not.</p>
<p>But it doesn't sound like she's really obstinant about it; it just sounds like she wasn't aware of what she agreed to. Someone should simply notify DC in as non-confrontational a manner as possible that all text she entered is explicitly licensed under the GFDL, as specified in the not-so-fine print at the bottom of each edit page, and move on. (Unless she comes back with an unambiguous denial of some sort.) I wouldn't elevate this unless there's no way around it, and though DC can be reactionary and uncivil sometimes, she usually responds to friendly reasonableness with reasonableness. – <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadell_cd19.html" title="User:Quadell">Quadell</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuadell_8ab2.html" title="User talk:Quadell">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../b/o/u/Wikipedia%7EBounty_board_8f83.html" title="Wikipedia:Bounty board">bounties</a>)</sup> 14:50, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I agree with Guettarda. She is essentially signing her name to the agreement much as one does when downloadingg software so if she doesn't agree with GFDL she shouldn't sign. But whatever she claims, she is legally making the agreement in signing and wouldn't have a hope in hell of preventing anyone using her published work because she has signed. it could be pointed out to her that regardless of what she thinks she has signed a legal agreement every time she edits and as she is not above the law she cannot negate the reality of having signed, and that if she doesn't want anything else released under GFDL she must herself stop editing because if she continues she is putting her legal agreement to release it under copyright. If I sign a contract and then claim I didn't mean to my declaration would have zero value in court so she shouldn't be blocked merely for blowing off steam and showing a poor understanding of her actions (ie that she has signed all her works over to GFDL). Wikipedia has done all it needs to in forcing people to agree to the GFDL and doesn't need to act further (but I am no lawyer) <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a></p>

<dd>this is obvious. but we have a precedent of blocking a user who said they didn't agree with GFDLing their contributions. Since we don't know what "diddly squat" means precisely, we may not assume that dcv is actually refusing to honour the GFDL. In any case, dcv is behaving increasingly abrasive, even considering she was provoked by vandals or stalkers or whatever, and is in my impression rather close to risking a community block <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 15:22, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>H-m-m. This is interesting. Frankly, I just put that blurb on my user page, prompted by something another user (I consider him a stalker) said about seeing something elsewhere on the Internet that read like me. So, you're telling me I could press this and prevent Wiki from disseminating my ish if I so chose? And if consent is automatic with editing, why do people go around <i>asking</i> people to put a blurb on their user page stating that they consent? If it were automatic, and unambiguously/bindingly so, why bother? What's the real deal here? Dragons flight? Anyone? (Just curious. This has piqued my interest.) <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 15:16, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The only blurb worth putting on the userpage is the one where you agree to multi-license your contributions with both GFDL and Creative Commons. If you don't declare that you are multi-licensing with CC in some way, then you haven't licensed it with CC here. As long as you agree to licensing everything under GFDL there is no problem. :-) <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 15:24, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Maybe when a new user account is set up, it could be required that the user activate a check box that says, "I know that contributions to Wikipedia are licensed under the GFDL". --<a href="../../../j/w/s/User%7EJWSchmidt_1173.html" title="User:JWSchmidt">JWSchmidt</a> 15:25, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is my view, and that of a number of lawyers who have studied the matter, that the "contracts of adhesion" created by "click-through licensisn" as well as the older "By opening this box and using the software, youa agree to..." are not legally binding. if so no such sign-up check box would be binding either. In copyright matters particualrly, there has been a tendancy not to accpet adhisive or implied licenses in the face of contrary explict statemetns. There has not, so fr as I know, yet been a case testing click-through software licenses. All that said, i see no reason to press this at the moment. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 15:44, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In the past I have, without controversy, indefinitely blocked one user who claimed an exception to the licensing terms of the GFDL, on the grounds that they were in a <i>de facto</i> legal dispute with Wikimedia (I think this was the pioneer-12 case mentioned above). I am reluctant to do this here because Deeceevoice is a party to arbitration proceedings, but I think that the situation should be considered by the arbitrators, so I'll make an application for an injunction. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 16:19, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I genuinely didn't notice that I'd adjusted a signed comment. My apologies. Tony, I haven't been banned under any user name. That's an untruth and I ask you to retract it. I could edit under the old user name tomorrow if I chose but I don't want to. Please retract the personal attack, remove it from this page and notify me at my talkpage that you have done so.</p>
<p>Dave, if you have a problem with something I do, the first thing to do is leave a message at my talkpage. I'm very approachable. Bar one stupid drunken incident, which I apologised to the person concerned for unreservedly, I've adhered to the policies of Wikipedia throughout my time here. What I'd suggest is not a good approach is running to teacher to try to get me blocked over something that could <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">could be and in fact was entirely innocent</a>.

<dd>Tony has left his personal attack suggesting I'm a sock of a banned user on the page, and used the word "banned" again. I am not a sock. This is the ID I use to edit Wikipedia. Under my former ID, I was prohibited from removing an image by Tony's clique after we disagreed about it. In line with <a href="../../../r/e/m/Wikipedia%7ERemove_personal_attacks_ff02.html" title="Wikipedia:Remove personal attacks">this guideline</a>, which Tony himself has often followed, I have removed the personal attack and I have noted his comment to remove a further suggestion that I was banned from editing, which I was not. If Tony has a problem with the editing, I know he'll be in touch. It's not becoming for admins to make personal attacks against unempowered users, and even less so for another to support it.
