<p>Yesterday and today I have been subjected to personal abuse in connection with the article <a href="../../../p/o/t/Pottery.html" title="Pottery">Pottery</a>. It does not seem to be random vandalism. The users have been anonymous, but their ip addresses are 200.26.145.155 and 66.59.107.230. This identifies them as being in Fort Lauderdale and Pennsylvania. I would like advice on:</p>

<li>If this is normal on Wikipedia</li>

<p>I happen to be neither Zelig33 nor Benio76, and I also know for a fact that they too are two different real-life people. We are three different and independent contributors, and I have neither dictated to them their contributions nor have they dictated mine.</p>
<p>If Essjay had chosen to do his work correctly, it would have been easy for him to determine those facts up to a high degree of certainty. He could have done it even without contacting any of the parties; and even more clearly by contacting them, which he has not done.</p>
<p>I am writing to Essjay to give him the relevant facts. I am expecting a reversal of his decision and an apology.</p>

<dd>I don't agree that this is original research. Had he drawn his own conception of what MJ would look like today, you would be right. But, if he is using a commercial product, then his contribution is limited to moving the output of the program into Wikipedia. This should be thought of as similar to using a computer to change the format of a picture; that's isn't "original research", either, just a type of processing applied to an existing photo. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 01:39, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree; if you look <a href="../../../o/r/_/Wp%7Eor.html#Original_images" title="Wp:or">here</a> there is a section on original images. The sentence "Images that constitute original research in any other way are not allowed, such as a diagram of a hydrogen atom showing extra particles in the nucleus as theorized by the uploader" I think it analogous to this. The user is theorising what Michael Jackson would look like without plastic surgery and creating an image from it (the fact that it's a commercial product is immaterial, in my eyes). Particularly given Jackson's attribution of his change in appearance to a skin condition, any theories at what he might look like need to have been made by someone outside of Wikipedia. The image with the caption "What Michael Jackson would look like today without surgery" is far too assertive and must be removed, but I think including the image at all is a violation of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 01:46, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There's a more pressing concern.

<p>To clarify, I created this image myself, using age progression software that I came across. This is not my personal rendering, this is a computer-generated image with no influence from myself at all. I think this image is important and should be included in the article.

<dd>Agreed, you didn't do any OR. If anyone did, it was the people who made the software. The copyright status is interesting, though, how much does a pic need to be changed to lose it's copyright status&#160;? Is one common pixel enough to make it protected&#160;? I would think this issue must have already been decided based on artists which manipulate photos of others, like the <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Warhol_b973.html" title="Andy Warhol">Andy Warhol</a> pics of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marilyn_Monroe_4162.html" title="Marilyn Monroe">Marilyn Monroe</a>. 17:26, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Knowpedia had his VandalProof access removed after Beta and I, acting as VandalProof moderators, recieved a report about a user using VandalProof to disrupt wikipedia, improperly tagging articles. This was reviewed by a few third parties and consensus was reached that he had been disrupted, so Betacommand revoked his access. I fully endorse and stand behind Beta's decision in the matter. It appears this rash of disruption is "revenge" for us revoking his access, and I'm glad to know that they have been blocked for their disruption.

<p>There has been a concerted, long term campaign against Ayn Rand and Objectivism on many of the pages in the philosophy area. It is at the heart of a long-running edit war. It involves POV violations and deleting validly sourced material. Most recently User Simoes deleted every entry on the page and posted the article AfD. Then he withdrew his AfD nomination and resumed deleting entries. Recently anon IP users have begun swooping in and deleting entries. No source is ever deemed adequate and the policies of WP are not observed. I request that an admin take a look and place a block on anon IP edits till the article leaves AfD and until a concensus is reached. It is also important to stop all deletion of sourced entries.

<p>Questions from an admin rather unfamiliar with the mechanisms of bot operation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where A4bot and DHN-bot approved for adding links to this controversial wiki?</li>
<li>Were the operators of these bots and those responsible for bot approval aware of its controversial status?</li>
<li>What is the criterion for VoABot to reject links to ru-sib?</li>
<li>Independent of bots, is there a policy on whether or not to wikilink to controversial projects like the "Siberian" one? Have we got a consensus to exlude links to ru-sib? (I'd recommend we should.)</li>

I am tired to explain that <a href="../../../i/n/t/Wikipedia%7EInterlanguage_links_c114.html" title="Wikipedia:Interlanguage links">interwiki</a> is a common thing for wikipedia projects. You could find a lot interwiki links in the page Ingria. And you could find a lot of interwiki links to siberian wikipedia in another english articles. Note that interwiki link is not the external link, but it is an internal links to approved wikipedia projects.</p>
<p>All discussion about interwiki to the article Ingria you could find here [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ingria#Ru-Sib|here" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ingria#Ru-Sib|here" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>]. Also you could find that the dessision about ru-sib wiki was permitted quiet long ago, so <b>ru-sib wiki is legitimate</b> in Wikipedia projects. So there is no any reason for deleting the interwiki link. --<a href="../../../a/4/_/User%7EA4_9cfd.html" title="User:A4">A4</a> 23:17, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>For a unknown reason my js extensions (based on VoA's tools) does not show A4bot's edits as bot's. According to the logs A4bot received its bot flag fair and square so this is just a software glitch on my side. I am apologizing to A4 for the block. On the other hand I am strongly support Mets in his urging for the A4 not to insert or delete ru-sib links by bot until the closing of the vote on Meta. Ru-sib links should be added only manually on case by case basis only if the have any <a href="../../../e/n/c/WP%7EENC_e8ee.html" title="WP:ENC">encyclopedic</a> value. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">Alex Bakharev</a> 02:18, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>...But this is a wiki, and even policy is made and changed at a regular rate.

<dd>The bot was not specifically approved to add su-sub links just interwikilinks in general. I think the issue is a little out of hand though. The discussion at meta has been going on for several month now and when I first became aware of it I was told, it would be closed shortly. While I personally&#160;!voted to delete I feel that we should not preempt the outcome of the debate.

<p>Very Good! The article is protected now, and it doesn't include ru-sib interwiki! I hadn't some doubts.

<p>Please see edit history and talkpage, and warning I have given Milo at his talkpage. He is repeatedly blanking a section after consensus among disputing parties to allow the section to remain with fact tags while a source was discussed. (One of the items in the section he keeps deleting is not even under dispute.) He has continued to blank the section without discussion now that there is consensus that the source is ok.-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 21:31, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Indeed, see the history and talkpage. The claim "without discussion" is patently false, the talkpage is overflowing with discussion about this. The "consensus" Cindery refers to is one other editor who has insisted that WP:V doesn't apply to the article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Barrington_Hall&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=101479325" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Barrington_Hall&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=101479325" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> and asserted <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">ownership over the article</a>. Earlier statements on this talk page: "Both Cindery and I are, by virture of our personal histories at Barrington Hall, "experts" on the topic." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Barrington_Hall&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=95590075" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Barrington_Hall&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=95590075" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> The material I removed is info that has no reliable source, the only source provided is a blog of unconfirmed authorship which doesn't provide any real documentation of the material. Cindery has admitted to being in contact with the owner of said blog, and the only entry on this blog appeared shortly after a source was requested on this article - while I'd like to AGF, it seems questionable and possible that the blog was only posted at Cindery's request. And as for "One of the items in the section he keeps deleting is not even under dispute", I asked Cindery which item that was and she refused to answer me - if there is an item that isn't controversial, I have no objection to including it, but that's not really possible if she won't share that information. Side issues aside, Cindery simply doesn't have consensus to add her unsourced material and is revert warring over it. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> 21:47, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

The WP:STALK evidence is very clear in your case, and I think you have gambled that I would not report you because you know I don't want to have anything to do with you, not even an ANI case reporting you for wikistalking. But I would do it at this point, and ask any admins who are paying attention to bar Mastcell from stalking me.

Cindery, the "sockpuppet" situation you're referring to was reported (by me) at AN/I and received admin attention <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;oldid=96457056#Reporting_myself_for_scrutiny_of_sock_account_use" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;oldid=96457056#Reporting_myself_for_scrutiny_of_sock_account_use" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<dd>I lurk here (AN/I is on my watchlist, usually just so I can watch and learn), but the cited edits show YOU claiming to converse directly with people. Although that may mean something to those particular people, they already knwo you're on Wikipedia. No one else could possibly draw any conclusions, and it's your own words. There's no vio of BLP if the information is volunteered. Perhaps under the 'right to disappear', but that's a far different situation than your own attempts at citation being brought up again. Further, are you alleging that MastCell is a sock of Milo? <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 22:26, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(edit conflict, a number of edits/attempts back) I'm not sure what I'm being warned about. Cindery herself has made comments that she is personally in touch with the owner of the blog, for example: "They're all ok, and anyone who recalls other significant/particularly memorable graffiti can email it to me to pass on to Jane Dark, or email it to Jane Dark directly. It will be added to bonus sugar, if it was in fact a significant/particularly memorable graffito." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Barrington_Hall&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=101185270" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Barrington_Hall&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=101185270" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>. Or the even more direct "Because I know Jane" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Reliable_sources&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=101166093" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Reliable_sources&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=101166093" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>. If Cindery or the blog author have lost any privacy, she's the one that caused it - I'm just repeating her comments. Since we just happen to be at ANI, any admins want to take action to get Cindery to stop repeatedly removing my comments? --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> 22:28, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>comment</b>: I did a lot of early work on the Capella article (among many for-profit college articles which I've started) and I've noticed that they sometimes (on rare but noticeable occasions) get re-written by anons with IPs matching the school itself. Capella has had some incidents like this, previously, once every few months and by an anonymous IP that would track on a WHOIS to the Capella Education Corporation (owner company). Things have become far, far more active in the past few months since the for-profit university went public on the US stock market. Please keep these facts in mind. I have a suspicion that some of the new user accounts are Capella anon IPs that have registered, but that's purely speculation. --<a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobak_55e4.html" title="User:Bobak">Bobak</a> 15:44, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

It appears as if anon users from Capella University are using Wikipedia as a forum to obtain free advertising and to create link farms back to their own web sites. A prime example concerns edits to the Capella article that were made yesterday in which a Capella user posted numerous links back to a large number of "articles" that were, quite literally, nothing more than press releases created by Capella University.</dd>

<dd>There's only so many namespaces, if you catch my drift. Although it may be extreme now, it's verging on the point that a full community ban may become needed. Generally, users need user talk pages to communicate effectively; I wouldn't object to a community-endorsed (concensus) setup where any user talk page this user disrupts he/she is banned from for two weeks, at a concensus of three administrators. A blanket-ban on a whole namepsace seems extreme, and a setup where this user is banned without much fuss (three admins) from the problem pages, in my opinion, would work better.

<p>First of all, this user isn't blocked or banned at all. That AN/I discussion linked above appears to only include users involved in the content dispute on <a href="../../../t/o/k/Tokusatsu.html" title="Tokusatsu">Tokusatsu</a> (and its talk page), so I would say that it is completely invalid. However, I do find the user's behavior, including his continued claim that Nacontari's block was "malicious" (it was justified, and I only reverted under <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> because the user hadn't been properly warned).

<dd><b>This is emphatically not a content dispute</b>. FP's edits consist solely of incivility, edit warring, bad-faith disruption, impersonation, personal attacks, and defamation. He is not here to improve the encyclopaedia. All he has accomplished is disruption. The number of outside users who supported the ban outnumbered the users who are involved. Elaragirl, bbatsell, Johntex, Cla68, and Rickyrab are all outside users. Interestingly enough, the one person who mentioned an indef block (as opposed to a topic ban) was an outside user. <a href="../../../j/g/p/User%7EJgp_2d0c.html" title="User:Jgp"><font color="#9005E0">jgp</font></a><a href="../../../j/g/p/User_talk%7EJgp_a553.html" title="User talk:Jgp"><font color="darkgreen">T</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jgp_810b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jgp"><font color="darkgreen">C</font></a> 05:04, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>No, this is most definitely a content dispute at its heart. FPWH's behavior may be the issue requiring admin attention, but he's making a content-based argument (that appears to be incorrect, but that's another matter). He's been warned now about his actions. Jumping from a single block that was rescinded to a ban would be ridiculous, given how limited his actions have been. And while we're on the topic, removing his content as you did on the Wikiproject page by calling him a "banned user" was completely improper, as he is most definitely not banned at this time. | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">Mr. Darcy</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a></small> 16:34, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Do you have any proof that he is using this nickname specifically to disparage your religion? Keep in mind also that using the name of the God "flippantly" is common practice in English.

<p>Grandmaster is using this Administrators' noticeboard as a device for his content dispute issues when it is strongly adviced to not do that as can be seen on his above introduction. I will not defend my incivility, the way he defend his edit warrings and 3RR blocks. But just to place things in context Grandmaster explaination of the situation in his introduction being an accusation, he keep claiming innacurate things on the reasons of my reverts, as if he knows better than I why I reverted, I considered his answers as manipulation for those reasons. I edited the article he was refering to only once. Since Grandmaster uses my prior blocks, I will stress out that Grandmaster has leveled similar charges against various editors during his edit warrings and multiple blocks for those edit warring, while I never was blocked for 3RR or things involved with article content. <i>Fad</i> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 17:28, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Endorse Rob's decision. Both users had apparently been breaking 3RR for the n-th time again (see mutual reports on <a href="../../../a/n/3/WP%7EAN3_1491.html" title="WP:AN3">WP:AN3</a>), and I agree that sometimes it's better to block left and right so as to not punish uninvolved outside editors who might actually work constructively on an article. Reacting to all big revert-wars with protection is not always good because it gives the edit-warrers too much prominence. Incidentally, I made a similar decision on <a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghanistan.html" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> just today, blocking three instead of protecting. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 18:09, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't know if this is the appropriate place to report conflicts of interest in Admin actions. If not, please move this section and include a link here so we can find the new location. Friday is a member of a group I will call "Ref Desks deletionists", who favor unilateral, or at least nonconsensus, deletions of questions, responses, or entire threads, from the Reference Desk, if they don't personally approve of them. Unfortunately, he also engages in blocks against "Ref Desk inclusionists", those who believe a consensus must first be reached on the Ref Desk talk page before taking such actions. This alone is a conflict of interest. However, he follows a much stricter standard and applies the maximum penalty to inclusionists while imposing no penalty at all, and a warning at best, to fellow deletionists who engage in similar, or even far worse, behavior. I have mentioned this on his talk page several times, but he has not responded favorably. His recent block of Ref Desk inclusionist <a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELight_current_29d4.html" title="User:Light current">User:light current</a> for calling someone a "Freshman" is a good example. He does not block Ref Desk deletionists for far worse behavior, such as these comments by an anon with a dynamic I/P:</p>

<dd>I'll point the readers of this thread to the relevant one further up this same page, where this block is already being discussed. See <a href="#Civility_block_for_review" title="">#Civility block for review</a>. I blocked Light current a couple of days ago for persistent incivility; he returned to the same behaviour immediately after that block expired, prompting Friday to block him again. Light current has been spinning his wheels on his talk page ever since (just shy of <i>one hundred</i> talk page edits since the block began), and I'm very concerned he's going to self-destruct completely if he doesn't calm down.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

He is the subject of two recent user conduct RfCs (<a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_StuRat_88d0.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/StuRat">one</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_StuRat_2_516d.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/StuRat 2">two</a>) the second of which I started because of his ongoing insistence on namecalling.

<p>I think part of the problem here might be that there is a group of regular Ref Desk editors involved here. What you guys probably need is for one or two uninvolved admins or respected editors who have never been anywhere near the Ref Desks to come along and mediate. Let all the regulars go back to editing and answering questions, and when a dispute blows up, the uninvolved editors will step in and handle things objectively. Try this for a month or so, and then retreat and see if the Ref Desk disputes start up again (hopefully not). I'm not saying that things haven't been handled objectively so far, but at least having someone totally uninvolved handling things might make both sides realise how things look to an outsider, and then adjust their own behaviour accordingly. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 01:06, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are two problems with this good idea: First is that several of the ref desk regulars (maybe not 'several', but one or two at least) have expressed derision towards the contributions and attempts at intervention of those without a history on the desks (and use the 'intrusion' of such editors as evidence of cabalism and cronyism); and Second, it's been tried already, and several (maybe not 'several', but one or two at least) of the editors who are posting to this and the other thread about Light current <i>were</i>, at one time, uninvolved editors who'd had nothing to do with the ref desks. <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnchoress_3b7f.html" title="User:Anchoress">Anchoress</a> 01:10, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Anchoress hit the nail on the head. Every time someone gets sucked into this debate (e.g., myself, who's never touched reference desk), it becomes obvious that incivility on the part of several pro-ref desk people is awful; thus we are labeled "involved" (keep in mind, I'm <i>pro</i>-RD, at least at the moment; I think it's a great idea). This has happened many times over, and we just get more and more admins sucked into the problem. To be blunt (I know this will get LC furious with me, but it must be said): this is not at all a reference desk issue. This is an issue of Light Current's (and sometimes StuRat)'s deep incivility issues. A perusal of the block log and the talk pages of LC (which I encourage any uninvolved admins to do) will show that this is extremely obvious. -<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatstuart_7fbf.html" title="User:Patstuart">Patstuart</a><sup><a href="../../../p/a/t/User_talk%7EPatstuart_e8fd.html" title="User talk:Patstuart">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Patstuart_a3f0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Patstuart">edits</a></sup> 01:15, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem is, because they edit heavily there, it becomes the Ref Desk's problem. I still think the best thing to do is to try one more time with another set of uninvolved editors, and see if that helps.

<dd><a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a>, I agree with your suggestion that Ref Desk deletionists should recuse themselves from blocking Ref Desk inclusionists (and vice-versa, incidentally). New Admins are absolutely welcomed to come in and give their opinions on blocks, etc., <b>so long as they don't pick sides and start promoting one side of the debate over the other, they need to remain neutral</b>. When new Admins come in, decide they believe in the deletionist POV, then start blocking inclusionists, then absolutely they are no longer viewed as neutral outsiders, does this surprise anyone&#160;? <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 03:28, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If an Admin came in, joined the inclusionist side of the debate, then started blocking deletionists for the slightest offense, while ignoring all transgressions from the inclusionist side, don't you think that would be a problem&#160;? On the other hand, maybe that's the only hope of getting any balance in actions from Admins (hoping we get an equal number which are highly biased towards each side), since it seems it may be impossible to get any truly unbiased Admins involved. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 02:06, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Say one group of editors, including Admins, says that there were blue <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tribble.html" title="Tribble">tribbles</a> in Star Trek, and the other disagrees. They get into vicious battles over this issue. Then, the side that says there were blue tribbles starts blocking only those on the anti-blue-tribble side, completely ignoring the same, or much worse, behavior on their side of the battle. Would these be proper Admin actions, in your opinion&#160;? <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 17:49, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is the absolute crux of the issue. I am only a sometime RD contributor with no interest (or stated opinion) in the "deletionist/inclusionist" issue. Noting the disruptive tendency of labeling - against their stated will - other editors into arbitrary groups, I independently warned LC, StuRat and THB <i>et al</i> as an outside administrator. Over a week later I and I have been accused of being among a "lump of administrators" working against the "inclusionists", a "freshmen admin lacking judgment" and a "shrill deletionist". To paraphrase a great statesman, THB, StuRat and Light current appear to share the belief you are either with them or against them. Since I can imagine no administrator will endorse their recent rash of incivility, I don't see how any outside admin will remain neutral in the eyes of these editors for long. Nevertheless, I fully endorse this attempt by Durova and brenneman to step in. I guess it will either work, or the we should make more room for a few more admins <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pressgang.html" title="Pressgang">pressganged</a> onto the good ship <i>deletionism</i>. <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockpocket_2e94.html" title="User:Rockpocket"><font color="green">Rockpock</font></a><font color="black">e</font><a href="../../../r/o/c/User_talk%7ERockpocket_62af.html" title="User talk:Rockpocket"><font color="green">t</font></a> 08:20, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Don't focus this whole debate on Light current or StuRat. There is actually a triad of editors on ref desk that seem to be causing all the antagonism that includes <a href="../../../t/h/b/User%7ETHB_9e7b.html" title="User:THB">THB</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/b/User_talk%7ETHB_2123.html" title="User talk:THB">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_THB_23b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/THB">contribs</a>) (see <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_StuRat_2_516d.html#Response_by_User:StuRat" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/StuRat 2">User:StuRat RfC</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/u/User_talk%7EStuRat_56ce.html#Leaving" title="User talk:StuRat">StuRat talk 1</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/u/User_talk%7EStuRat_56ce.html#Use_of_the_term_.27deletionist.27" title="User talk:StuRat">StuRat talk 2</a> for examples). While there are other users sympathetic to their "deletionist" opinions (refers to those that disagree with them) the others do not disrupt discussions in the same manner. A theme appears to be 1) a lot of editing to make a point, 2) a lot of incivility both of which are apparently to dare admins to block. The response to this tendentious editing is then used as a foil for them to cry persecution. The real shame in this dispute is that all these editors make excellent contributions to the encyclopedia. However, there a problems on ref desk that include extensive debates, off topic chat, jokes bordering on offensive and responding to trolls. It is these latter things that they refuse to acknowlledge as a problem. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_D._77aa.html" title="User:David D.">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_D._d1e6.html" title="User talk:David D.">(Talk)</a> 04:35, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for replying. You are one of the few who did. I wanted to be blocked from those pages to remove any temptation but, using <b>tremendous</b> effort, I am going to attempt to leave alone the RD talk <b>and</b> the RD pages themselves until the end of this month (Jan 07).</dd>
<dd>I may still edit the RD guidelines though, as it is generally agreed that I have made positive contributions there.--<a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELight_current_29d4.html" title="User:Light current">Light current</a> 15:26, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We cannot block anyone from editing a particular page. It is simply not possible in the current implementation of the software. While the <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Page_restrictions_table" class="extiw" title="mw:Page_restrictions_table">Page restrictions table</a> has a field for future support for that, it is not coded yet (and may not be ever coded), so the restriction has to be voluntary. The other alternative is an ArbCom restriction on editing the RD pages, but I think that is unnecessary, as any violation would remove your editing privileges of the entire site for a short period of time. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito<span style="color:#008000;">xd</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a>)</sup> 21:43, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>We could go to ArbCom, or we could go for a community ban for a specified (does not need to be long) period. If we were to ban the worst one or two offenders from the ref desk for, say, a fortnight, to cool off and regain perspective, while allowing (encouraging) them to keep editing elsewhere, would that help at all? I don't think we can let this ride. At present StuRat aggressively asserts that he will not even admit the possibility that those he disagrees with have a right to dispute his position. Shades of <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> apart, this does not augur well for any kind of resolution of the issue. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 22:41, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are misrepresenting my position. I absolutely accept consensus rule. If those who disagree with me are in the clear majority, then I would accept what they want.

<dd>I don't think a temporary ban will do anything but give the boards a temporary respite after which those users will return and continue to behave in the same fashion as before. I'm not being overly cynical here, because that's exactly what has happened with the blocks of LC and StuRat and THB. (Though to give LC credit, he has shown ability to reform when StuRat isn't around.) What is needed here is a long term solution to what has been a long term issue. So far the fact that every admin or other editor who has attempted to mediate with these three has ended up blocking them or being added to their enemy list doesn't bode well for solutions other than 1. An arbcom case or 2. A standard of behaviour written by the greater community. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 23:06, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Keesiewonder's analysis of the situation. This new user account is acting disruptively, and is obviously not a new user account. I agree with this new user that the article requires across-the-board condensation, and also that in the past things have gotten talked to death.

<dd>If anybody is paying any attention to this stuff, would somebody please tell "Keesiewonder" to stop harassing me? She has now taken to Wikistalking me and continues to accuse me of this, that and another thing. She launched this contining attack on me on this admin page without even notifying me or following any of the procedures stipulated in WP guidelines. A friend told me about the <a href="../../../h/a/r/WP%7EHarassment_adc0.html" title="WP:Harassment">WP:Harassment</a> guideline and it sure looks to me like this user is violating it with her harping on anything I do that she doesn't like and her conspiracy theories about my identity. I've posted a request to her discussion page asking her stop harrassing me. Can an admin take this up with her? It's just plain creepy. She's a fairly new user at Wikipedia and probably doesn't understand things like she needs to, but this behavior is just getting really out of hand and is weird stuff. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustas_Jonas_f531.html" title="User:Justas Jonas">Justas Jonas</a> 15:59, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

Because the treaty concerned Finnish territory and the <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finnish_people.html" title="Finnish people">Finnish people</a> and because it was the first time when a border between realms was determined in Finland and because it separated the Finns under the Western, Catholic, influence and under the Eastern, Orthodox influence, its importance has been great in Finnish history. And as I already said, the people who were influenced by the treaty were all Finns. This is why it is natural for the Finnish name of the treaty, <i>Pähkinäsaaren rauha</i>, to be mentioned in the article together with the Swedish and Russian names. It used to be, but then user Drieakko removed it on non-logical and poorly argumented grounds. I naturally reinserted the mention in the form of one sentence in brackets: (<i>Pähkinäsaaren rauha</i> in <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finnish_language.html" title="Finnish language">Finnish</a>). But KhoiKhoi keeps removing it for poor reasons or no reasons at all. He keeps saying that it was a treaty between Sweden and Novgorod - yeah, so what? As I said the people who were primarily affected were Finns and it was an important event in the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Finland_55b6.html" title="History of Finland">history of Finland</a>. Also, it is normal to mention many names in articles: in <a href="../../../r/i/g/Riga.html" title="Riga">Riga</a> the Latvian, the Estonian and the Russian names are mentioned although it is a unilingually Latvian city in Latvia. There are many examples more, of treaties too. Still KhoiKhoi keeps revert warring which makes me ponder whether his motivation is racism. I know content issues should be discussed in the article's talk page and I have tried that, but KhoiKhoi doesn't like explaining his actions so most of my arguments there have gone to deaf ears. P.S. I have already been blocked for the old personal attacks in the article's history so don't block me again for those. --<a href="../../../j/a/a/User%7EJaakko_Sivonen_2a5c.html" title="User:Jaakko Sivonen">Jaakko Sivonen</a> 19:49, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Allow me to laugh... That "consensus" is two (2) users: KhoiKhoi and Drieakko. They both seem to be more or less anti-Finnish so they are biased. They have failed to give proper arguments to those of mine. Wikipedia is not a democracy - just because two users think something should be in some way, it doesn't mean that they wouldn't be wrong about the matter. KhoiKhoi very likely knows nothing of Finland but still he thinks himself an expert compared to those who actually do. Check your facts and answer: why should the Finnish name not be shortly mentioned in brackets in an article concerning Finland and the people speaking Finnish? I will not be threatened and I will never give up when I am right. BTW, it takes more than one to wage a revert war... --<a href="../../../j/a/a/User%7EJaakko_Sivonen_2a5c.html" title="User:Jaakko Sivonen">Jaakko Sivonen</a> 20:12, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In an unrelated article, I made a dispute to the removal of the ru-sib: link for the <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germanic_Languages_b627.html" title="Germanic Languages">Germanic Languages</a> article <i>(PLEASE, I'm not trying to get into anything there... my concerns were purely procedural)</i>, and explained my reasoning on the Talk page, and returned the link with an edit summary that specifically said that I was contesting the removal.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Germanic_languages&amp;oldid=101704921" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Germanic_languages&amp;oldid=101704921" rel="nofollow">[65]</a> Khoikhoi then reverted this change just 30 minutes later, without any discussion or address of my concerns. In the interests of not starting an edit-war, I did not perform a revert, although I did place a message on Khoikhoi's Talk Page.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Khoikhoi&amp;oldid=101730000" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Khoikhoi&amp;oldid=101730000" rel="nofollow">[66]</a>, which has been by all appearances ignored. A number of users have already addressed my concerns, and my contention is no longer in place, so this is no longer an active issue, and this whole issue is really moot anyways. I just noticed a comment here about Khoikhoi making unjustified, or poorly justified edits over a contentious issue, and felt that I would add some context of an actual contested issue, where all Good Faith was given to other editors, and simply a request to get an explanation. To which, rather than spending any time on communicating, and resolving any controversy, Khoikhoi felt it was appropriate to simply just push ahead, and continue to assert a particular edit instead of attempting even a little bit of dispute resolution. No complaint here, just context, and background. --<a href="../../../p/u/e/User%7EPuellanivis_b7b1.html" title="User:Puellanivis">Puellanivis</a> 02:39, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Forgive me, but if I was the first to make a change (after no response to my question in the discussion page) and later backed it up with reasoning (whether you agree with it or not), how can I be the one guilty of "3RR"? Surely it is John Reaves who has done the muliple reverting? I have been accused of the "3RR" - wrongly in my opinion; told I am a vandal (unjustifiably given I have replaced the text with a more clear and understandable definition); and falsely called a liar when I protested the "rvv" accusation. Aren't these uncivil personal attacks? Why hasn't Reaves been reported? What happened to "assume good faith" in relation to my edit? <a href="../../../8/6/2E/User%7E86.17.247.135.html" title="User:86.17.247.135">86.17.247.135</a> 07:04, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The text in dispute is unclear and cannot be accurately defined, so how can it conceivably alter the intent of the article to speak of Irish people as being those who, amongst other things, have actualli <i>lived</i> there? Is that contentious? "Adopts an Irish identity" - what does that mean?: no-one can tell me. Some of the examples given to justify that text only justify other text that was not deleted, and go into the issue of Irish ancestry which is covered by other articles (such as the "Irish-American" list). I thought the "intent" of the article was to list Irish people (it is the title after all) not a list of people with Irish ancestry or people who just <i>call</i> themselves Irish (did you read the Kerry anecdote? it illustrates my point well). I argue my edit is MORE relevant to the point of the article (again, look at the title: no mention of ancestry or cultural links). And then there is an edit which says the list <i>is</i> for those with ancestry - so why have an "Irish-American" list separate to this? <a href="../../../8/6/2E/User%7E86.17.247.135.html" title="User:86.17.247.135">86.17.247.135</a> 07:13, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

The "vandal" comment was explained to this user a few times already, I'm not sure why he keeps ignoring my explanation - it was a simple issue of an accidental extra 'v' (i.e. "rvv" instead of "rv").

<dd>I would have take the explanation if you were not so quick to call me a liar and did not post such an extremely arrogant, rude and condescending response to my politely worded initial question: you should have investigated first and been more civil - you are the experienced account holder who keeps quoting the rules to me (I know of some rules because I click the links and read the articles just like you expect when you post them to me, simple as that, so you can't then accuse me of being more experienced). I'm afraid I do not believe your explanation: that is my right a san individual. Why do you expect higher standards from non-account holders than you do of yourself? You were uncivil to me, made a personal attack, and then cheerled a report about me doing those things and are trying to get me blocked.

<li>The anonymous user has approximately a two-month long contribution history <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=500&amp;target=86.17.247.135" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=500&amp;target=86.17.247.135" rel="nofollow">[71]</a>, and hundreds of edits. I'm not sure how knowledge is "suspiciously comprehensive" for such a user, I imagine I knew things decently well after that amount of experience. The statement that such knowledge is "suspiciously comprehensive" in an anonymous editor seems to rule out the possibility that an anon could ever be a long-term contributor, which is simply false.</li>
<li>The anonymous editor is not necessarily the very model of civility, some of h(is|er) edit summaries have been quite combative, as are some of the messages (s)he left today. ("What is wrong with you?!" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Irish_people&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=101934640" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Irish_people&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=101934640" rel="nofollow">[72]</a>, "Very silly" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Irish_people&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=101925377" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Irish_people&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=101925377" rel="nofollow">[73]</a>.) However...</li>
<li>The anon did not violate 3RR, that I can see. An initial change was made, followed by three reverts to it (not even exactly it, though things similar enough that all three likely would be counted reverts). Pushing the bounds, but unless I missed something, not crossing them.</li>
<li>John Reaves claims to have inadvertently hit an extra "v" while reverting, resulting in an accidental edit summary of "rvv". In presuming good faith, I'll presume this true. However, he did subsequently issue a warning intended for vandals <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3A86.17.247.135&amp;diff=101925703&amp;oldid=93363010" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3A86.17.247.135&amp;diff=101925703&amp;oldid=93363010" rel="nofollow">[74]</a>, declined to "explain anything" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3A86.17.247.135&amp;diff=101927888&amp;oldid=101927134" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3A86.17.247.135&amp;diff=101927888&amp;oldid=101927134" rel="nofollow">[75]</a>, and in general seems to presume that anonymous contributors can do little or nothing valid. (In all truth, the anon has a pretty good point, though (s)he could've done better at getting it across.) In general, I would encourage everyone involved here to examine h(is|er) behavior, and not just the anon. The anonymous user certainly was frustrated and less than civil at some points, but I'm very disappointed to see the way experienced editors reacted to that. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 08:33, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That warning was just to alert the user that I reverted, which is more than most editors do for IPs. If you'll read the various conversations (and above) you'll see my reason for not immediately explaining. I have also stated above that I believe that IPs can contribute constructively/long term, so don't twist my words. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Reaves_5821.html" title="User:John Reaves">John Reaves</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Reaves_aeb9.html" title="User talk:John Reaves">(talk)</a></small> 08:42, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Seraphimblade</b> - thank you, I am grateful for this fair and objective analysis and accept your conclusions without argument. At times I should have chosen my words more carefully and I should have ignored certain things rather than reacted to them. (Incidentally, I am using a shared computer so some of the IP history is not mine - I live in a house with several fellow students.) 86.17.247.135 08:54, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agred with Seraphim. It's very grating when two users in an edit dispute template each other and refer to each other's edits as vandalism, and when one side of a conflict refuses to engage the other. What's more, responding with comments like "I don't need to respond to your allegations" is not at all helpful. However, to the IP: knock it off, you can't get away with being rude just because you're anonymous, any more than you shouldn't be ignored in an edit dispute because you're anonymous. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatstuart_7fbf.html" title="User:Patstuart">Patstuart</a><sup><a href="../../../p/a/t/User_talk%7EPatstuart_e8fd.html" title="User talk:Patstuart">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Patstuart_a3f0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Patstuart">edits</a></sup> 23:38, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

This is not the first time this user has had issues with their approach to editing (at least 1 mediation, 1 arbcom decision, numerous blocks and unblocks) and while I respect their veracity, I don't think they respect opinions that do not agree with their own and continually edit war when they don't get their way.

<li>I agree with your assessment. What concerns me is the manner in which he handles these situations and the continual pinballing between 3RR, incivility, unfounded arguments, and user blocks because he chooses to put the bee inside his bonnet in the first place. He seems to step into race-related articles looking for an NPOV fight and then loses civility.

If you want to do a longer-term block on the IP, you should probably ask on <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_checkuser_3b77.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser">requests for checkuser</a> to ensure that they are the same person. --<a href="../../../n/e/2/User%7ENE2_ab1c.html" title="User:NE2">NE2</a> 23:21, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>One account that was blocked a few minutes ago did at least ten today. In general, I agree that preemptive protection is nothing to do lightly ... but that's to make sure that anyone can edit. Why would that apply to <i>move</i>-protecting a <i>user</i>page? If an editor isn't changing his or her username, what possible valid purpose could someone else have for moving that editor's userpage or talkpage? The <i>only</i> reason that would occur would be vandalism. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 01:33, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Here is a question: when is it ever necessary to move a user page (barring subpages) unless the user has changed his or her username, which is done automatically when the bureaucrat working the <a href="../../../c/h/u/WP%7ECHU_759d.html" title="WP:CHU">WP:CHU</a> board changes that user's name (which will be unaffected by the move protection, as all crats are admins and all admins can move moveprotected pages)?—<a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong"><font color="blue">Ryūlóng</font></a> (<a href="../../../r/y/u/User_talk%7ERyulong_923f.html" title="User talk:Ryulong"><font color="orange">竜</font><font color="green">龍</font></a>) 19:42, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's not, but if your account is around long enough to trigger the move button, you can move any page. Which means sleeper accounts can do en-mass userpage moves using a bot, tool, manually, or just a couple for fun. (edit: I know I answered, but I do assume that Ryulong was being rhetorical and didn't need to be answered. Replying for those unfamiliar).</dd>
<dd>I don't think move protection of userspace is inappropriate at request because it is a threat. Protecting userspace does not hurt the encyclopedia, userspace vandalism is an annoyance. Pagemove vandalism can be extraordinarily subtle in subpages. <a href="../../../t/e/k/User%7ETeke_11ee.html" title="User:Teke"><font color="maroon">Teke</font></a><sup><small>(<a href="../../../t/e/k/User_talk%7ETeke_b34c.html" title="User talk:Teke"><font color="gray">talk</font></a>)</small></sup> 02:25, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Blocked one month. That's his 12th block overall and at least his fourth for NPA violations.

<p>I'm not sure if this is the right place for this or not, but... These two minors have been the subject of various national news stories after allegedly being abducted by <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_J._Devlin_a8b0.html" title="Michael J. Devlin">Michael J. Devlin</a>. There has been a slow moving edit war involving how much personal information should be included in these articles. The Hornbeck article recently survived an AFD and is currently protected. There are definite concerns about <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, and I think some administrative input would really help formulate the future of these articles and help keep the participants calm. As it is, I'm not sure if these boys even warrant having articles written about them, and think the utmost care should be involved in handling them. <a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAniMate_73bc.html" title="User:AniMate">AniMate</a> 22:12, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>These articles should be merged into a single article about the incident. They are only notable in relation to that incident, and there are not enough reliable sources to make a separate encyclopedia article about the persons themselves. This would also solve a lot of BLP problems, aggregating the contributors into a single article and refocusing the article. If a living child is independently notable, multiple reliable sources have already disclosed any contested information. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 22:22, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I couldn't agree more, but some other editors are very strident about including any and all information about the boys. I've requested page protection on the Ben Ownby article, but I really think some administrator guidance would be helpful. Outside of the abduction, neither of these kids have done anything notable yet. While I'd like to see these merged, I'm more concerned about the edit war and accusations of vandalism right now. <a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAniMate_73bc.html" title="User:AniMate">AniMate</a> 23:57, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Perhaps combining the lot in a single article and redirecting all the names is the way to go. Deleting them as I saw suggested probably isn't. Even if a source mentions it, I would recommend not to include information that risks them getting kidnapped again (School name, name of town of residence if it's a relatively small place, stuff like that). - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 00:43, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
