<p><i>14:58, 28 May 2006 Linuxbeak unblocked Blu Aardvark (contribs) (Unblocking, being mentored)</i> --Was this discussed anywhere? Seems unwise considering Blu Aardvark's use of socks and agitating for disruption of wikipedia at WikipediaReview. Will Linuxbeak be mentoring his sockpuppets too? <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 22:15, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We have discussed the sockpuppet issue. He has acknowledged that yes, sockpuppets are not how you go doing things here. He acknowledges that he has made mistakes and he is apologetic. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinuxbeak_c86a.html" title="User:Linuxbeak">Linuxbeak</a> (drop me a <a href="../../../l/i/n/User_talk%7ELinuxbeak_c40b.html" title="User talk:Linuxbeak">line</a>) 22:18, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Has he said he won't use socks? Has he disclosed all his other socks? Really this fellow has really relished pissing on other Wikipedians in the past. It would be nice to see if he has acknowledged this and resolved not to do it again. You know, <i>publicly</i>. I don't want to go three months down the line and see him chortling all over Wikipedia about being let back despite all the crap he unloaded on us. Most important, does he recognise the authority of the arbitration committee? --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 22:24, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>But has the community discussed it? I suspect that there's not many who are familiar with his recent sentiments posted at WikipediaReview advocating disruption here that share your optimism. This should have been discussed first. <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 22:27, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I understand and totally accept your take on this. Yes, this was not a community decision, but I have worked with previously hostile users in the past. I am asking you to trust me. You don't have to accept this, but I am asking for a grace period of one week. This has worked in the past, and I've produced favorable results. I understand your rationally guarded and skeptical stance, but I'm just asking for one week. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinuxbeak_c86a.html" title="User:Linuxbeak">Linuxbeak</a> (drop me a <a href="../../../l/i/n/User_talk%7ELinuxbeak_c40b.html" title="User talk:Linuxbeak">line</a>) 22:33, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It would be easier to grant you that were his unblocking done with the community's knowledge and input beforehand. The way this was handled, and knowing his history, makes this all very suspect. <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 22:38, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"Community" is a weasel-word here, he was blocked, the involved parties agreed, and nobody outside complained. It's not like everyone got together and said "we will never ever let this guy come back".

<p>While I won't say that we should -not- use off-wiki material for on-wiki actions, we need to apply it everywhere or nowhere. Blu Aardvark's account on WikipediaReview could have been compromised, it could be a impersonator, we have no way of knowing because it is not tied to Wikipedia by technical or legal means. We need to look at his history on Wikipedia and the history of his <i><b>confirmed</b></i> sockpuppets (via CheckUser) and decide on that. If his socks are disruptive by no other means than the fact they exist to allow a banned user to return (IE: No voterigging, vandalism, etc), and some time has passed... Let's let him back. --<a href="../../../a/v/i/User%7EAvillia_e750.html" title="User:Avillia"><font color="#228B22">Avillia</font></a> <a href="../../../a/v/i/User_talk%7EAvillia_20cb.html" title="User talk:Avillia"><sup><font color="#228B22">(Avillia me!)</font></sup></a> 22:46, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I question the "success rate" that <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinuxbeak_c86a.html" title="User:Linuxbeak">Linuxbeak</a> mentions. A similar case is that of <a href="../../../j/a/r/User%7EJarlaxleArtemis_f75f.html" title="User:JarlaxleArtemis">user:JarlaxleArtemis</a> (JA). He had been in the middle of a second ArbCom case when he lashed out so horribly that he was immediately and permanently banned. Subsequently he contacted Linuxbeak and pleaded for a second chance, promising to do a number of things if allowed back. Linuxbeak (who had borne the brunt of JA's anger) generously allowed him back under a strict mentorship and based on JA's completion of several steps, including apologizing, undoing previous vandalism, etc. Once back, JA did none of the things required of him and after a short period of good behavior went back to behaviors that had led to his previous ArbCom cases. Linuxbeak had gotten busy with Wikimani, and two other appointed mentors had lost interest, which left JA unsupervised and he took advantage of it. Eventually I noticed the trouble, asked Linuxbeak for help, but he was still too busy to do anything, so I intervened, which took considerable time. I'd like to ask Linuxbeak how this mentorship will be handled differently from JA's in order to prevent a similar problem. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 23:04, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As one of the administrators involved with Blu Aardvark, I think it is a good idea that we offer him a shot at being a good Wikipedian again. I don't believe he is intrinsically a bad person, because he has shown some evidence in his Wikipedia career of being a decent Wikipedian; he has just made a series of recent bad judgements, and undertaken less-than-acceptable actions as a consequence. I don't believe that should make him persona non grata as regards Wikipedia, and thus I think we should offer him another go. So long as we watch his account carefully, and expeditiously block him again if he partakes in unacceptable behaviour, I see not a scrap of harm that could be caused by allowing him another chance provided his behaviour is watched assiduously. Yes, it is true this wasn't arrived at by direct consensus, but the present ban was in fact only arrived at via de facto consensus - as in, no dispute, versus a prior decision that a ban was necessary. After all, bans are meant to be merely a necessary mechanical means versus a punitive action, and so I see no reason why a last crack of redemption would be inappropriate. So as a consequence, I call on all Wikipedians to give this a go, as Linuxbeak suggests, and evaluate the results. We may well, of course, gain a possibly good Wikipedian as a consequence. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicholasTurnbull_9d8a.html" title="User:NicholasTurnbull">Nicholas<b>Turnbull</b></a> | <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENicholasTurnbull_45f8.html" title="User talk:NicholasTurnbull">(talk)</a> 23:08, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Linuxbeak is completely trustworthy. He's one of our best people and I am sure he'll make a great job of this. Best of luck. Nothing I've said here is intended to she doubt on his judgement. It would be nice to see a bit more publicly what is going on, but in the end if Linuxbeak is prepared to block his protege in a case of serious problems, or at least not get in the way of normal administrative action without giving a full account of his interventions, that's okay. I'd love to see Blu Aardvark back again and not doing the troll thing. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 23:13, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Would also like to point out that the other user previously unblocked and mentored, MARMOT, ended up exploiting vulnerabilities in the Mediawiki software and had to be banned, personally, by Jimbo Wales. I wish LB all the luck in the world with these two, but I sure hope they are watched more carefully than the others were, because neither of the two previous mentorships worked in the least. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <font color="#7B68EE">(<small><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">Talk</font></a> • <font color="#7B68EE">Connect</font></small>)</font></span> 23:16, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have reblocked MSK because she was highly disruptive and made no good contributions. Linuxbeak, it's inappropriate of you to unblock such controversial users without discussion, and in particular given what's happened to Katefan0. These two users are staff members of Wikipedia Review, not ordinary posters. They have shaped the way the website has developed, and both have the power to make sure that the material that damages individuals isn't posted. It seems bizarre to respond to the recent serious attacks on Kelly, Phil, Tony, and Katefan0 by allowing the people in charge to post here again. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 23:35, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>WikipediaReview is not Wikipedia.

Unless anyone has claimed that they are different then there's really no reason to assume that they aren't the same people. I assume that Linuxbeak, being a responsible person, has already discussed this with the users before he unblocked them, so he should be able to tell us if they deny being involved with WR. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 23:47, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>SlimVirgin, I'm asking that you please trust me. Selina has made plenty of good contributions. Also, while I grieve what has happened to Katefan0 (I went into a mini-rage earlier today over it, which is something that never happens to me), that wasn't Wikipedia Review as a whole. That was Daniel Brandt. Selina has plenty of good edits, as well: see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Mistress_Selina_Kyle?oldid=47363392#A_list_of_some_positive_contributions:" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Mistress_Selina_Kyle?oldid=47363392#A_list_of_some_positive_contributions:" rel="nofollow">this</a>. Also, Selina has asked to reply to this, so I would like to unblock her so that she can do so. I know that this might seem totally whacked, but you know me. I'm not going to do something if I don't think good can't come out of it. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinuxbeak_c86a.html" title="User:Linuxbeak">Linuxbeak</a> (drop me a <a href="../../../l/i/n/User_talk%7ELinuxbeak_c40b.html" title="User talk:Linuxbeak">line</a>) 23:58, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It wasn't the good edits that were the problem. Can you describe your conversations with these users? Did they acknowledge that what they did previously was wrong? What did they say thet led you to believe that their future behavior would be different from their past behavior? These two editors are owners/operators/moderators of WR, so they are responsible for its content. Have they made any comments about the realtionship of WR and WP? If we had more informaiton it'd be easier to understand this proposed arrangement. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 00:07, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, absolutely. I talked to Blu Aardvark on IRC this afternoon. I approached him, saying that I know that there are problems with Wikipedia, and I'd like to help find solutions, etc. He and I had a very civil and intellegent conversation, and the subject of him being blocked came up. I mentioned that we have a mentorship process to handle things such as this. Blu Aardvark acknowledged that he had violated our policies and rules and that it was not appropriate for him to act as such. He also apologized. His acknowledgement and repentance for what he had done in the past is a sign that there's a possibility of being an active part of the community again. We have done this in the past (remember <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_03fe.html" title="User:Michael">User:Michael</a>?) and it has worked. Blu Aardvark has agreed to be civil. As far as Mistress Selina is concerned, I would like to direct your attention to <a href="../../../m/i/s/User_talk%7EMistress_Selina_Kyle_04f4.html#Welcome_back" title="User talk:Mistress Selina Kyle">User_talk:Mistress_Selina_Kyle#Welcome_back</a>. I would also like to make note that I informed Jimbo of this decision, to which he did not have any problems (he told me "good luck"). If I am given the chance to prove to you that these people can be let back in, I won't let you down. Just give me the chance. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinuxbeak_c86a.html" title="User:Linuxbeak">Linuxbeak</a> (drop me a <a href="../../../l/i/n/User_talk%7ELinuxbeak_c40b.html" title="User talk:Linuxbeak">line</a>) 00:17, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Blu Aardvark should have been making those representations to the community, not just one well-placed person. I'd want to see a comprehensive mea culpa from BA in which he lists all his sockpuppets and publicly renounces his contempt for our policies and values before I'd even consider giving him a chance. Too many intentional disruptions and hurtful personal attacks have come from a site he's significantly responsible for while under his watch. We lost one of our better admins last week due to harassment in real world because some of his friends on his site contacted her employer, and he did not even bother to speak up, much less intervene. He needs to account for that. We need more than your word here. <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 00:32, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>LB, look, it has started already. See below: "what SlimVirgin is saying is blatantly false and just an attempt to smear me as some kind of vandal." These people don't acknowledge that they have done anything wrong. MSK has posted on WR that I pretend to be a Jew on Wikipedia because I am really a neo-Nazi trying to compile accurate lists of Jews to attack, or something (forgive me if I have it slightly wrong, but it's hard to paraphrase craziness). She has referred to that conspiracy theory very recently, so this isn't old news. How can you let someone like back onto Wikipedia? If she had been a great editor, and you were asking me to overlook eccentricity, then maybe I'd consider it. But she was never a good editor either, so how does this benefit Wikipedia or any of its editors? <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 00:51, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't like the impression among its users that IRC is a substitute for Wikipedia community involvement. One IRC user apologizing to another IRC user has nothing to do with Wikipedia. If a user wants to make amends, let him or her do it in Wikipedia space, or else let us not count it (but by the same logic, let's also not count off-site comments at WR against them). -<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_sig_226e.html" title="User:Lethe/sig">lethe</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_sig_fced.html" title="User talk:Lethe/sig">talk</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" rel="nofollow">+</a></sup> 01:13, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>&lt;Linuxbeak&gt; Well, it's really not that big of a deal.<br />
&lt;Linuxbeak&gt; I just find it kind of immature<br />
&lt;rabbit2&gt; the only real way to control what people say is to ban them or start censoring stuff<br />
&lt;rabbit2&gt; people act as tho just cos its on my forum its my opinion<br />
&lt;rabbit2&gt; not true, anyones allowed to post there<br />
&lt;rabbit2&gt; its just the people that post most make the forum basically, without the people it would just be me and an empty website o-o<br />
&lt;Linuxbeak&gt; Well, sure. I don't think that you necessarily hold any of those opinions except the ones that you post</p>
<p>&lt;rabbit2&gt; --<br />
&lt;rabbit2&gt; Amorrow<br />
&lt;rabbit2&gt; I've been recieving a number of complaints about the apparent sexist tone of many of your posts. Now, it is not my desire to censor anyone, regardless of how distasteful I may find their beliefs or opinions to be, but I would like to ask you to consider toning it down a bit.<br />
&lt;rabbit2&gt; If we continue to recieve complaints of this nature, I may have to take other action, such as requiring you to post into a moderated queue. I really don't want to do this, so please try and watch what you post.<br />

<p>I think this is a bad, bad idea, and we're going to regret it soon enough. Do you guys even remember what Blu Aardvark <i>did</i>? I can't think of many things to do that would've made it worse. He was using a combination of personal attacks, sockpuppetry, disruption, and oh yeah, anti-semitism. Why do we think that every user can be rehabilitated? Even assuming they can, why should we?

This all strikes me as very weird, and I have a few questions. Does anyone have valid statistics on how much time (how many edits?) admins spend actually creating encyclopedic content versus other activities? I get the impression (maybe in error) that vandal fighting has replaced encyclopedia creation as the number one task of admins. Is Wikipedia becoming one third encyclopedia making, one third free blog, one third free first person shooter game ("blocked a vandal; woohoo"). Does letting loose the caged fox make the fox hunt fun? Are people let back in because of it is good for building the encyclopedia or other reasons? Can't banned people make suggestions for improvements via e-mail to concerned persons who then implement them? What's the rush? Will waiting six months be a problem?

<p>This unblocking is outrageous. These are the creators of WR, who could easily have used their power to end the harassment of Katefan0, and all of the misongynistic etc. conversations on that board, yet they instead <i>at best</i> did nothing, and often egged the main miscreants on. I see no hint that they are in way reformed, nor deserving of being unblocked; nor do I see any sign that there is a consensus on Wikipedia for this unblocking.

<dd>I do trust Linuxbeak. But I distrust Blu Aardvark even more. We shouldn't be wasting our time trying to rehabilitate users who were banned for some pretty serious infractions (Blu Aardvark, for instance, made over a dozen sockpuppets and went on an unmitigated spree of vandalism, in <i>addition</i> to all of the anti-semitic remarks). We're an encyclopedia, not a rehabilitation clinic. When someone has proven that their presence is not in the best interest of writing the encyclopedia they need to be gotten rid of, not given endless chances to reform themselves, in the mean time pissing off lots of productive users (who may end up leaving) and wasting lots of time. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><span style="color:#ff66ff;cursor:w-resize;"><b>Cyde↔Weys</b></span></a> 01:39, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

What's next, are we going to give Rgulerdem a <i>third</i> chance? Unblock Willy on Wheels?

<p>We shouldn't pretend to ourselves (or some people shouldn't pretend to <i>them</i>selves) that these two editors are suddenly transformed into good company by banning a couple of other trolls or clearing a few posts from a board. That doesn't change the fact that both have been a time, resource and emotion and editor sink for a long time, particularly MSK, and that they have a nearly-uncontrollable disposition to making such comments and taking such actions in the first place. There is often the possibility of rehabilitating poor editors: but some people, like people in jail for life without parole, are simply unfixable, and unwanted. They tried editing here, couldn't cut it, many of our finest people tried to help them, and couldn't do it, because they simply didn't want to be helped. Wikipedia is not therapy, is not a rehabilitation clinic, is not infinitely forgiving, does not need every last one of their carefully-placed 'good' edits, and is not a suicide pact. To allow either of these users back without an extensive period of near-sainthood, would require Wikipedia to be all those things at once. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 02:01, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Also, it doesn't make sense to grant editing privileges back in response to administrative actions on another site which we have no control over. What would happen if, a week from now, MSK unblocked AMorrow, or if he started editing from another account name and that one wasn't blocked? Would we reinstate MSK's block here? It just doesn't seem workable to me. Blocking users on external sites can't be a condition for editing privileges here: only the user's own actions can be. And I haven't seen anything from these two editors that leads me to believe they're suddenly magically reformed. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><span style="color:#ff66ff;cursor:w-resize;"><b>Cyde↔Weys</b></span></a> 02:15, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm in favour, <i>in principle</i>, of letting sane banned users back onto the site. Someone like amorrow is utterly unwelcome and must never be allowed back here; but those with some semblance of sanity (Selina, Blu Aardvark, Lir, perhaps) are theoretically capable of being good users. The question is, are they <i>willing</i> to do so? Selina wasn't so bad, before she was blocked, that I'd be unwilling to countenance her return. Blu Aardvark ... eee ... I'll leave <i>that</i> question to the ones he was antagonising. However, I suspect they aren't quite ready to be civil and behave themselves here. Selina's note, pasted above, is I think a good example of what we can expect from her and BA: nonsensical abuse and a complete unwillingness to work <i>with</i> us. I'd like to see some evidence that they won't behave as they have done on Wikipedia Review before they're allowed to return. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">befuddle me!</a>) 02:34, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Looking over the history - neither of these users was banned by the ArbCom, Jimbo, or other 'binding' resolution. They were indefinitely blocked by individual admins and nobody chose to dispute that... until now. The only basis in blocking policy for an indefinite block <i>without</i> action by some sort of official party is the 'community ban'... which to date has meant that their actions were so bad that no admin is willing to unblock them. Since an admin <i>is</i> willing to unblock these two a community ban is <b>not</b> in place and reblocking them is inappropriate wheel-warring. If you want these people gone the proper course is appeal to the ArbCom or Jimbo.</dd>
<dd>As to the actual individuals - I don't know much about Blu Aardvark so I won't comment. MSK was always a handful... we first met when I reverted a picture she added to the <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Wales_abf5.html" title="Jimmy Wales">Jimmy Wales</a> page, not of Jimbo, and she made disparaging remarks about my appearance... naturally we became fast friends.&#160;:] However, she also made some useful contributions and received some... questionable treatment from others. On this page, in the comments above, several admins have clearly violated civility and personal attack standards - as some did prior to her banishment. It becomes difficult to blame users for bad behaviour when those of us who are supposed to represent the best sometimes fall well short of the goal. Few people respond well to any sort of provocation... and MSK definitely isn't one of them. Do I expect all sunshine and flowers if she is let back? No... but if that were the standard there are some admins who'd be perma-banned too. I suspect that if MSK were given one 'free' incivil remark / personal attack / rule bending for every one directed <i>at</i> her she could never be blocked again... and that's a problem. We're not supposed to be harassing people to the point that they set up anti-Wiki sites. It may be 'easier' to kick 'problem' users around, but it is still wrong and we all end up paying for it. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBDunkerson</a> 03:15, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>What happens on WikipediaReview <b>stays</b> on WikipediaReview.</i> I must say that the pure sophistry of this statement is mind-boggling: WikipediaReview isn't some J. Random BulletinBoard that happens to have some Wikipedia editors on it, its <b>very reason for existence</b> is Wikipedia, the alleged monitoring (snort) of what goes on here. And their track record (institutionally and of its members) is, to put it mildly, sufficiently disgusting to put them beyond granting them the slightest sliver of the benefit of the doubt. MSK and Blu Aardvark can't edit on Wikipedia? Too bad, so sad, actions have consequences. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 04:24, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What happens on WikipediaReview most definitely does not stay on WikipediaReview. I've had complete strangers contact me, offwiki, in a highly unpleasant manner, who could only possibly have "discovered" me through Wikipedia Review. My sins, apparantly, are that I am a Wikipedia administrator and a woman (horrors!) who took a strong stand against a disruptive user. Said disruptive user, after being blocked here, was welcomed with open arms at Wikipedia Review and allowed to spread toxic comments and lies to his heart's content. Nobody questioned any of his statements there: as long as he was virulently opposed to Wikipedia, he was embraced, and I was demonized. I am a person of some public stature in my country, and I make my living on my reputation. People who run a Google search on my real name, seeking professional credentials, will now find toxic comments and lies spread about me, under my real name, at various random-seeming websites across the web, solely because of the vengance of a disgruntled banned user. This is real world damage, and Wikipedia Review had a hand in it. If we block people for legal threats because legal threats deter people from editing and getting involved in Wikipedia, we should block people for other forms of real, offwiki damage. I do not stand for the opinion that the right to edit Wikipedia is an inalienable human right. --<a href="../../../w/o/g/User%7EWoggly_b7b8.html" title="User:Woggly">woggly</a> 07:54, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Allow me to weigh in on this one. It seems MSK has given a negative impression on the Wikipedia community, however, I feel some people are not looking at both sides of the story. To begin with here, I don't recall there ever being an RFAr or a mentorship against MSK, it just started with Sean Black's indef block of her stating she was a <i>"troll, virtually no positive contribs, etc. etc."</i> Not to pick on Sean here, but that is just not true (as he is probably aware of at this point), and if I remember correctly his block went through a series of unblockings/re-lenghthenings/so on and so forth. I feel it could have been handled differently, as I'm sure others do too. I would like to direct your attention to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Pilotguy/Archive1#Welcome" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Pilotguy/Archive1#Welcome" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. If this helps <i>at all</i>, it proves that MSK has made some positve contributions, and can show friendliness at times. Also to note MSK does have <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asperger%27s_Syndrome_18a6.html" title="Asperger's Syndrome">AS</a> although the general agreement between us is that AS is to not interfere with editing Wikipedia. Those points being said, I'm afraid it's too late for a mentorship to be done on this user. MSK is unique in that she tends to be a bit more bold than usual when it comes to editing which is an issue. I would also ask ALL admins to remain civil as best you can as I have sat behind and watched the aforementioned admins (I won't name names) try to deal with her, and I feel the civily line was crossed too many times. As for WR; as it relates directly to Wikipedia it does affect us. I would recommend further talks with MSK about your concerns and I'm sure she'll comply if at all she wants back in on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilotguy_59e8.html" title="User:Pilotguy"><font color="#000000"><b>Pil</b></font></a><a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilotguy_Esperanza_42a9.html" title="User:Pilotguy/Esperanza"><font color="green"><b>o</b></font></a><a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilotguy_59e8.html" title="User:Pilotguy"><font color="#000000"><b>t|</b></font></a><a href="../../../p/i/l/User_talk%7EPilotguy_51fb.html" title="User talk:Pilotguy"><font color="#0000FF"><b>guy</b></font></a> 13:25, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's nice to see that so many think Linux is a "trustworthy" editor and I note that I have no reason to believe otherwise. It's also nice to see that he has decided to set himself up as Mother Teresa, the Messiah or Betty Ford or whatever holy or not so holy redeemer one can think of. If such a mission lights his internal spirit-fire then, soibeit. But as Cyde noted -- this is an encyclopedia not a rehab clinic.</dd>
<dd>In any case, Linux showed himself to have one significant flaw: He did not exhibit the level of judgment that is expected from Wikipedia's administrators, in fact he appears to have given little though to the past actions of Blu or MSK and absolutely zero thought to how unblocking them would effect the community as a whole.</dd>

<dd>I'm going to have to ditto FloNight here ... Wikipedia needs to choose which to value more: its contributors or banned users. We're not some damn experiment in rehabilitation, we're an encyclopedia. Giving rightfully banned editors unlimited chances to "rehabilitate" is just causing lots of disruption. Has rehabilitation ever actually worked? Let's look at some previous cases ... MARMOT, Jaraxle, Shultz ... this is not a good track record. It's not worth losing actually valuable contributors due to harrassment from returning indefinitely banned users. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><span style="color:#ff66ff;cursor:w-resize;"><b>Cyde↔Weys</b></span></a> 04:57, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yep. This whole debate is a microcosm of a much wider debate on justice and crime. Why do criminals get punished? To avenge their crimes? To discourage others from committing the same crime? To rehabilitate them? To protect the community from them? How should we balance the rights and welfare of the criminal against the rights and welfare of the victim? How should we determine that a criminal has been punished enough? People have been grappling with these questions for thousands of years. The probability of Wikipedia resolving them here is zero. We must abandon this arrogant quest to be the perfect rehabilitative justice system, and just do whatever will best get the encyclopaedia written. All things considered, it seems to me mind-numbingly obvious that the encyclopaedia will be better off if these people remain blocked. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnottygobble_915d.html" title="User talk:Snottygobble">Snottygobble</a> 06:08, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I abhor wheel warring but absent an explicit order from Jimbo that came out and said exactly what the circumstances of their return was, I would reblock them both. Yes I trust linuxbeak but I think he's been bamboozled. This whole thing of what happens in one place doesn't affect another place has come up in other communities and it can destroy them.

FloNight, SlimVirgin, KateFan0, Phaedriel... these are some of our very best. The cost is too high. Keep them banned. Whether there is cause to seek legal action against WR or whether that is a good idea is a different matter, but editing here is a privilege, not a right. This community has no need of the contributions of disruptive editors who agitate, foment trouble and trash good editors on other sites.

<dd>Yes, Linuxbeak claims he did the approaching, though his wording is extremely vague. See his explanation much much earlier in this thread
<blockquote>
<p>"Yes, absolutely. I talked to Blu Aardvark on IRC this afternoon. I approached him, saying that I know that there are problems with Wikipedia, and I'd like to help find solutions, etc. He and I had a very civil and intellegent conversation, and the subject of him being blocked came up. I mentioned that we have a mentorship process to handle things such as this." -Linuxbeak</p>

I'd be much more comfortable with this whole thing if it had taken place on Wikipedia instead of IRC, so that we could see exactly what the candidates for unblocking have said. It does affect all of us, after all. -<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_sig_226e.html" title="User:Lethe/sig">lethe</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_sig_fced.html" title="User talk:Lethe/sig">talk</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" rel="nofollow">+</a></sup> 07:06, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Just as a response to what Blu Aardvark said on IRC ... I think Linuxbeak has been misled. Yeah, Blu Aardvark <i>is</i> capable of being civil in short doses. Once he gets into protracted discussions he just reverts to his same-old, same-old, though. I've interacted with Blu Aardvark before ... it started off civil and it ended with him getting kicked from #wikipedia after various anti-semitic remarks. Just because he says a few sentences that aren't incivil doesn't mean that he has rehabilitated. To stretch an analogy a bit ... we don't let murderers off scot-free just for saying they're sorry. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><span style="color:#ff66ff;cursor:w-resize;"><b>Cyde↔Weys</b></span></a> 07:13, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Linuxbeak, I don't doubt that you intended to do something positive, and that you did not intend SlimVirgin to leave, but using language like "left in a huff" to describe the departure of a valuable and conscientious admininstrator who was subjected to some horrifying abuse while the two people you have welcomed back stood by and watched when they had the power to do something about it is not helping the situation. SlimVirgin is, of course, responsible for her own decisions in whether she goes or stays; but you must certainly carry some responsibility for the fact that she felt undermined by your unilateral decision to unblock people who had enabled the posting of such filth about her and about people that she tried hard to help. And the timing of this unblock, when many of us are not just angry, but <i>grieving</i> about what happened to Kate can at best be described as insensitive. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 08:47, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

In this thread alone, I see support for Linuxbeak's actions from NicolasTurnbull, Ashibaka, Avillia, Ral315, bainer, Jaranda, Jareth, wikipediatrix, CBDunkerson Pilotguy, and A Man in Black, plus the second-hand rumors of support from Jimbo himself. Were I a victim of harrassment from these people, I don't think I'd see wide condemnation here. For the record, I join the voices of those who say this was just a dumb thing to do. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 23:54, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I originally supported Linuxbeak's mentoring because from my personal experience with MSK and Blu, I thought they had a good prospect of rehabilitation. It seems that my personal experience with MSK was nowhere near the full picture, and I withdrew my support for unblocking him/her. I still think that with mentorship, rehabilitation would be possible for Blu. Note that rehabilitation for either user would probably include abandoning WR, or at least disavowing and blocking the worst users. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 06:50, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Linuxbeak, I don't doubt you meant well; this can't be the outcome you intended. You hoped to eliminate enemies by making friends. I'm sure you still mean well; What do you hope to accomplish this time, with your "sincere and humble" non-apology? Is it supposed to make it easier for FloNight or SlimVirgin to come back, or to reassure others who are on the fence, or get some part of the encyclopedia written, or what? Sure, you are not solely responsible for their leaving. Others have left recently as well. It's not all on you that the project has trouble retaining good volunteers, and trouble getting rid of jerks. But your actions aggravated both problems, and some here support your actions. That probably won't reassure those who have been victims of harassment. I can't see what blaming SlimVirgin for leaving is supposed to do. You screwed up big time, and you, and a chunk of the community, seem oblivious to it. I would have hoped you would recognize your mistake, and work to correct it. It's unfortunate that you made self-justification a priority, and doubly unfortunate that you chose to blame others. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 00:09, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was not going to get involved in this, but Slim's reaction makes it necessary. If for no better reason than keeping Slim here, I strongly favor indef blocks of Selina and Ardvark. Even if Selina and Arvark's only edits were their few productive ones, Slim would still be orders of magnitude more useful to the project. Unblocking these two users is simply ridiculous.

<p>I am rather saddened by the display of poor faith here relating to Linuxbeak's mentorship attempt of Blu Aardvark and MSK; especially since I was, technically, the blocking administrator of Blu Aardvark and have voiced my support towards mentorship - although, in actuality, it was Kelly Martin who was the blocking admin. The point is that nobody has yet explained how placing these users on mentorship probation could be dangerous to Wikipedia provided the users' contributions are watched with adequate assiduity. I cannot emphasise this enough, why cannot we just show some compassion and common amicability and assume good faith that these users are willing to reform? Has <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> been neglected in the great stampede that is the onslaught of expediency over consideration? To hell with policy. Policy is not gospel. It is negotiable; Wikipedia is not some rule-ridden mechanism that operates solely according to the rules - which would, after all, be untenable since the block was applied in the first place with only <i>de facto</i> consensus. I don't think Linuxbeak was at fault over the matter; sure, perhaps more talk page messages would have helped... but that is no reason why the idea of rehabilitiating these users is out of the question. The day Wikipedia becomes hell-bent on creating enemies, and refusing reform, is the day the ethos that drives our project rots to a horrible inferno of self-immolation. Cultivating enemies is suicide for any project. I would please implore you, ladies and gentlemen, to look at the bigger picture. This isn't anything to do with compassion: it is to do with the willingless to permit change. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicholasTurnbull_9d8a.html" title="User:NicholasTurnbull">Nicholas<b>Turnbull</b></a> | <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENicholasTurnbull_45f8.html" title="User talk:NicholasTurnbull">(talk)</a> 02:03, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Nichoals, you can't ignore common sense and you can't ignore the harm that WR inflicted on valued editors. I'm saddned that you go on at such length without touching on these crucial point (as you failed to on IRC, before and after you kicked me), instead you appear to centre on rather legalistic arguments regarding AGF. This <i>is</i> saddening.

<dd>ElC: Please inform me of how I am ignoring common sense. The issue over the actions of Wikipedia Review editors is entirely separate to the matter of the behaviour of people on Wikipedia. The point is those editors might as well edit as anon IPs, but would they still be a "harm" to Wikipedia? We cannot go around judging people's actions outside Wikipedia in order to determine whether they are banned or not here - else we would have an endless witch-hunt of people dredging up each other's private lives in a justification of the other party being blocked (as we get on many RfCs/RfArs). People's activities outside of Wikipedia are frankly immaterial. With regard to "the harm that WR inflicted on valued editors" - WR has been trollish, I agree; but not intrinsically harmful, and as I describe above, external activities are not within our purview - and neither, I might point out, is IRC activity. Regarding "legalistic" arguments, it is the exact opposite that I wished to convey - that policies are negotiable - but when it comes to matter such as good faith I see no reason why it should be suspended. The double standard you refer to in relation to Talrias eludes me; please elaborate further. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicholasTurnbull_9d8a.html" title="User:NicholasTurnbull">Nicholas<b>Turnbull</b></a> | <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENicholasTurnbull_45f8.html" title="User talk:NicholasTurnbull">(talk)</a> 02:18, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Have you <i>seen</i> how many chances both editors have had in their block logs, MSK most particularly? What suggests that this time things will be different? Editors have spent vast quantities of time and emotional resource on these two trolls before, to absolutely no avail. We certainly can take account of actions outside of Wikipedia when the very existence of those actions is conditioned on what happens on Wikipedia.

<dd>I feel it doesn't really matter whether this time the editors behave differently, provided they're properly watched and hastily rebanned if they renege upon their promise to behave. I see nothing to be lost in so doing, since the moment they misbehave they can be banned again, and any bad contribs rolled back. That's the glorious thing about a wiki: everything, including bans, can be changed on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. Whether events happen as a consequence of Wikipedia or not really makes no difference - it is still not within our sphere of operation. We could otherwise claim that any action relating to Wikipedia that occurred elsewhere could be scrutinised towards a ban, which is frankly incorrect. Wikipedia Review does, in fact, have nothing to do with Wikipedia - the Foundation doesn't run it, and frankly their own little exercise of mutual trollish stimulation on their message board is their own business. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicholasTurnbull_9d8a.html" title="User:NicholasTurnbull">Nicholas<b>Turnbull</b></a> | <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENicholasTurnbull_45f8.html" title="User talk:NicholasTurnbull">(talk)</a> 02:29, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What is lost, clearly, is the time and energy that will, we can presume with near certainty, be spent on watching them, and having to justify to certain groups of people why a troll has been re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-blocked (and that's probably not enough re-s for MSK). What has already been lost is vast quantities of such time and energy (perhaps not yours, thus your enthusiasm to have them around again). If these editors have suddenly become loving little pussycats, they should have absolutely no trouble getting themselves some new usernames. If nothing else, this would demonstrate, quietly and without fanfare, that they are miraculously now dedicated to Wikipedia. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 02:45, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Incidents_Blu_Aardvark_and_Mistress_Selina_Kyle_7d4c.html" title="Edit section: Regarding SlimVirgin">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Regarding SlimVirgin</span></h3>
<p>Recently, I have come under considerable controversy for the temporary unblocking of two previously blocked users: Mistress_Selina_Kyle and Blu_Aardvark. This action was supported by some and strongly opposed by others. I will address this issue first.</p>
<p>While I believe that both users are in fact redeemable and able to be brought back into the community, there are those who strongly disagree with me. Some include some of the people that I put the utmost respect in. Others that I have the utmost respect for have supported my efforts. Still more people that I respect have stated that they are indifferent to the situation but wish me the best of luck.</p>
<p>The recent discussion on the admin noticeboard has been one of typical drama. This was expected, although the specific outcome of said drama wasn't totally expected. I feel that there has been some shifting of focus from the discussions of the blocks to SlimVirgin leaving. Before I continue, I will say this right now: I apologize for acting in such a way as to offend people. I'm sorry that my actions have caused harm, however slight, to people. It wasn't my goal or purpose, but apparently it was an unpleasent side effect.</p>
<p>SlimVirgin decided to leave about 7 hours after I posted my intent. Several people have placed responsibility on me, citing my actions as a direct result. To this, I strongly object. My actions were at the most a catalyst or the straw that broke the camel's back. It might have contributed towards her deciding to leave, but I was in no way responsible for her deciding to leave. As a matter of fact, I take no responsibility for her actual action of leaving. Some people have told me to apologize to her, but while I will do so, I feel that this is a matter of people wanting to place the explosion of the gunpowder magazine on a spark.</p>
<p>SlimVirgin: if my actions contributed to your decision to leave Wikipedia, I apologize that it was so, and please take comfort in the fact that I meant no harm. However, if it be your choice to leave, then I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors.</p>

<dd>Sure. These people were involved with Wikipedia Review and either directly or indirectly flung attacks at you. I know how it is to be harassed. As a matter of fact, I've been harassed over Wikipedia in real life. It's stressful, annoying and insulting. I've also been harassed online (an example: a ton of those usernames at Special:Listnames). My experience with being harassed is that when people who have harassed you are willing to make amends, it is in everyone's best interest to give them this chance. That was part of my logic, at least. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinuxbeak_c86a.html" title="User:Linuxbeak">Linuxbeak</a> (drop me a <a href="../../../l/i/n/User_talk%7ELinuxbeak_c40b.html" title="User talk:Linuxbeak">line</a>) 16:05, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>I just want to give Linuxbeak my strong support for being brave enough to be forgiving. None of us really knows whether these two users he unbanned can be remediated, but the only way we'll ever find out is by trying. I'm glad he was willing to try, even though nobody else was.</p>
<p>We all know that <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBLOCK_89b0.html" title="WP:BLOCK">WP:BLOCK</a> insists that blocking is not a punishment, but let's be honest and admit that it is often used as such. I'm very happy to see that at least one admin is willing to follow the spirit and letter of the rules by giving people a second chance.</p>
<p>I <i>am</i> sorry that <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">User:SlimVirgin</a> and <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFloNight_10cf.html" title="User:FloNight">User:FloNight</a> would rather leave than participate in such an effort, but with all due respect, maybe it's all for the the best. Wikipedia needs admins with thicker skins and a willingness not to harbor grudges. If these admins realize that they can't live up to that ideal, then their departure may well be a good thing. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Al</a> 17:27, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Al, I think your comments about SlimVirgin and FloNight are unnecessarily inflammatory and off-topic.

<p>I think you've misread my comments, then. I'm not saying that Slim and Flo are horrible people who need to go at any cost. I'm not even saying they're generally bad admins.</p>
<p>All I've said is that they were very wrong to take offense at Linuxbeak's efforts to show forgiveness. I would much rather that they understood and accepted what LB is trying to do. It bothers me very much that they have apparently decided they'd rather give up on the project than accept the fact that LB is acting in good faith and deserves a chance.</p>
<p>In short, if you think my comments are inflammatory, then I guess I wasn't clear enough initially, though I think I've clarified things now. As for being off-topic, I'm not sure how you mean that. As far I can tell, I spoke directly on the topic. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Al</a> 17:48, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have to agree with Alienus's sentiment. I really praise the actions of Linuxbeak. He acted in the true spirit as a bureaucrat to heal the problem and assume good faith, by personally mentoring and recuperate users who made mistakes in the past. If we allow previous good editors to have a try and edit on a contigency basis and it still fails, then they will be re-blocked, and any harm can be undone. So, there is no danger. Since there's little to be lost and much to be gained, there is no reason to oppose this logically--only emotionally and out of a sense of being vindictive. This is what we want to get away from. Indefinte bans mean without a time period set, it does not mean permanent, forever. No one should be banned forever. People change. If any trust was violated it was the trust we owe to Linuxbeak who asked that others trust him. We should do just that. Those who want to punish editors for being bad in the past and threaten to leave if they don't get their way are the ones who are wrong, not those who try to give people a chance to prove themsleves worthy of being a good wikipedian again. We should be an inclusive community that welcomes all potencial good contributors. The potencial is always there and specific acts of wrong doing should be taken care of only as a means to prevent their re-occurance. When there is reason to believe they will not re-occur, there is no reason keep the users banned. They shoould be tested out with a mentorship. This is about forgiving and forgetting and healing. Those who can't let go of the past are the ones that have the problem. I applaude Linuxbeak for his forward thinking and think we should not abandon trust, or hold him responsible for those who can't deal with what wikipedia is really about: writing an encylopedia, not forming a members only elite club of friends.</dd>

<dd>Btw, FloNight has already returned and its just a matter of time before SlimVirgin returns as well. I really don't think SlimVirgin is going away. She seems like a good editor and from my interactions I have no complaints. However, I've had very limited interaction with her so others complaints may be true. I don't know but they are not really relevant in this case. I truly believe that SV is only bluffing, that it's a bit of an emotional outburst, which is a rather rash. I think as soon as she cools down she will be back. This threat of leaving is a well-known phenomenon and it has served a purpose to make her protest known in the strongest terms, and help to get what she wants in the conflict she is having with other admins. I think this is a classic example of this: <a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?GoodBye" class="external free" title="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?GoodBye" rel="nofollow">http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?GoodBye</a> So, SV will be back after a break, and all this posturing blaming LB is not warranted.<a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">Giovanni33</a> 14:08, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Alienus, it sounds just lovely to talk about "being brave enough to be forgiving" and "giving people a second chance". However, there is nothing "brave" about "forgiving" someone who was abusive towards <i>someone else</i>. If I hear about a molested altar boy or his mother forgiving the offending priest, I might be impressed at the courage. If I hear about a bishop forgiving him and giving him another chance, without even consulting his former victims, I do not feel overwhelmed with admiration. And it is extremely inaccurate and misleading to talk about "a second chance" for people who have had second, third, fourth, and fifth chances. And it is nothing less than offensive to imply that the problem is that Slim and Flo are harbouring grudges and don't have thicker skins — <i>especially</i> coming from someone who has already shown (admins can see the deleted edits from KHM03's talk page and from Alienus's talk page as well as Alienus's comments on SimplePilgrim's talk page) that he doesn't have a problem with websites being set up to harass editors. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 09:24, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I support El C's line of reasoning. There is no bigger slap in the face of constructive editors than finding administrators willing to intervene against them, making themselves the tools of vandals like Mistress Selina Kyle. So long as admins act appropriately—protecting constructive editors and showing incompetent and disruptive editors the door—vandals are manageable nuisances. (Personally, I'm mildly amused by the attacks on my edits by the crackpots and LaRouche cultists at Wikipedia Review<a href="http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=924" class="external autonumber" title="http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=924" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>.) The problem only becomes unmanageable when admins fail to play their proper role. Some adminis intervene on behalf of vandals out of mere naivety; worse, others protect vandals because they truly have an affinity for them. As we saw with the lynchmob berating Kelly Martin and Snowspinner last year, there is a large contingent of admins, particularly the teenagers uninterested in content editing, who conceive of Wikipedia in exactly the same manner as users like Mistress Selina Kyle: as an <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_social_networking_websites.html" title="List of social networking websites">social networking site</a>, not an encyclopedia. In the end, these adminis probably cause far greater harm in the project than the vandals themselves. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> | <a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.html" title="User talk:172">Talk</a> 23:27, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<b>An outside opinion</b>. Maybe I should not have posted here – I am not an admin, and I do not have full knowledge of what these banned users had done. However it seems to me that the campaign against LunixBeak grew completely out of proportion to what he did. (Which, at worst, is a courtesy violation of not discussing his unblock with the blocking admin).</p>
<p>I have deep respect for what LunixBeak tried to accomplish. Whatever these banned users did, I believe it is never impossible to make amend (on their part) and forgive (on our part). If LB agreed to supervise/mentor them, I would have given him (and them) a chance. I do not see what big harm it could have done – but I see big potential benefits, including making WP Review a less hostile site.</p>
<p>Finding some offensive comments on WPR and blaming them on these users on the ground that they allegedly own WPR is the same as finding some offensive comments on WP (which I am sure can be found) and blaming them personally on Jimbo as WP site owner.</p>
<p>If I can make a slightly off-topic comment, it seems to me that while WP goes out of the way to give multiple chances to clear vandals (multiple warnings before even short blocks), for controversial editors (those who argue with admins, defend unpopular viewpoints etc), situation can escalate to full ban very quickly.

<p>SlimVirgin was probably a very efficient, “no-nonsense” administrator, but it seems to me she was rather eager to use her ‘Block” button.

<dd>#wikipedia is under the direct control of the Foundation, in theory. enwiki procedures are therefore largely irrelevant. You could complain to the Foundation (e.g., Jimbo), or perhaps one of the stewards (not sure about them). On a more technical level, the people who currently hold privileges sufficient to remove operator status from someone are: grunt, sannse, cyrius, Apple, Xirzon, karynn, Linuxbeak, James_F, Raul654, TimStarling, Mark_Ryan, FennecFoxen, DavidGerard, Angela, Essjay, JimboWales, Anthere, Snowspinner, and AdamBishop (all those being their IRC handles, of course, but most of their enwiki identities are pretty obvious). If you have trouble with the one who kicked you (I believe you've been made aware of his identity?), you could try asking one of them to remove his op status. —<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimetrical_0dc0.html" title="User:Simetrical">Simetrical</a> (<a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimetrical_7ff0.html" title="User talk:Simetrical">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simetrical_1b33.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simetrical">contribs</a>) 02:51, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That summarizes my reaction to those Wikipedia Review goons driving out Katefan0, Phaedriel, SlimVirgin, and FloNight, among others. I have to say, allowing those goons onto Wikipedia isn't worth losing those admins, which is why I'm glad that Selina and Blu Aardvark were blocked again. Wikipedia Review has always been a charming cauldron of simmering hatred and resentment, but they've crossed the line. I'm tempted to push for banning everyone on Wikipedia who posts on WR until they ban Brandt from their forum and formally apologize to the Wikipedia community. — <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Philwelch</a> <a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">t</a> 01:29, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I still refuse to accept the proposition that Selina should be punished for not <i>actively</i> suppressing such activities' occurrence on her website. Brandt happens to frequent WR, but he's targeted Wikipedians before he joined it and would continue if banned from it. Compelling editors to take feel-good measures against people on their own websites is too much.
<p>If you want to bring out things that Selina and Blu have actually done <i>themselves</i>, fine. Selina has insinuated that SV isn't actually Jewish and is really a neo-Nazi; when I confronted her (Selina) on IRC with the analogy of saying someone is Hitler because they're a vegetarian, she conceded that I did have a point there. Saying things like that is frankly stupid, but it's not so harmful that it mandates repercussions on Wikipedia itself; note how soundly <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>-offline got shot down. (MSK didn't call SV a cunt, by the way; that was <a href="http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=1536&amp;st=0&amp;p=8358&amp;#entry8358" class="external text" title="http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=1536&amp;st=0&amp;p=8358&amp;#entry8358" rel="nofollow">sgrayban</a>.)</p>
<p>Off-Wikipedia <i>insults</i> are not sufficient to merit action on Wikipedia itself; stalking, harrassment, sure, but not just insults or dubious accusations. Libel, too, might merit action, but do keep in mind that <i>libel</i> is defined quite narrowly: it must be demonstrably false, it can't be clearly cast as an opinion, it must be made either with knowledge that it was false or reckless disregard for whether it was false. Suggesting that SlimVirgin <i>might</i> be a neo-Nazi based on house-of-card logic is ridiculous, but unlikely to be libelous under US law. And frankly, SlimVirgin has made some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image_talk:Anime_by_nima.jpg&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=55687840" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image_talk:Anime_by_nima.jpg&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=55687840" rel="nofollow">rather dubious accusations</a> herself on occasion, to the tune of suggesting a conspiracy on the part of IRC users to support the illegal actions of certain posters at Wikipedia Review.</p>
<p>I would say: when it comes to off-site activity, only ban people for either illegal and Wikipedia-damaging activity, or lawsuits targeted against the Foundation or its contributors. When there's doubt about whether something's illegal, let the alleged perpetrator have the benefit of the doubt. Is this extremely forgiving? Sure. But I think it's the only way to avoid chilling valid criticism of the project and its members. Things like "libel" are, to laymen, far too vague to be applied without great care. —<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimetrical_0dc0.html" title="User:Simetrical">Simetrical</a> (<a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimetrical_7ff0.html" title="User talk:Simetrical">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simetrical_1b33.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simetrical">contribs</a>) 03:10, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Put it this way. A rational person <i>could</i> believe that banning the Wikipedia-haters (i.e., shutting down the forum) would have no effect, because it's plausible they'd go start another forum. That would, if anything, likely be worse than WR, which is run by comparative moderates (i.e., they don't really hate Wikipedia). Therefore, there's no reason to assume that MSK and Blu are in any way endorsing the views of various harrassers and defamers. They may (Blu Aardvark told me something to this effect) believe, in good faith, that banning these people is totally pointless and would accomplish nothing. If that's the case, is it reasonable to ban them indefinitely?
<p>But to be honest, we fundamentally disagree. I'm strongly in favor of free speech as a principle, and I'm strongly against holding people accountable for their associations alone. You object to (quasi-)defamatory statements more than I do, and you judge people by whom they associate with. I think you're being unjust and repressive, you think I'm supporting harrassment and defamation. We're not going to agree, and there's not really any point in continuing this vein. —<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimetrical_0dc0.html" title="User:Simetrical">Simetrical</a> (<a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimetrical_7ff0.html" title="User talk:Simetrical">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simetrical_1b33.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simetrical">contribs</a>) 07:12, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

Back when it was just banned users whining about their bans we could safely ignore them. But what they did to Katefan0 crosses the line. Katefan0 was never controversial, and never did anything to deserve what happened to her. She is the victim of a vindictive attempt to attack Wikipedia itself. So far, no one on Wikipedia Review (and I've read their forums) has denounced this action. At best, they've objected on tactical grounds. Instead, they encouraged Brandt, egging him on to interfere in Kate's life even after she left Wikipedia.</dd>

<dd>Up to a point, Alienus. When something outside Wikipedia becomes disruptive to the point where multiple of our most productive editors are leaving over it and many editors are being harrassed in real life, what happens outside does matter. Ultimately, we should act in the way that is best for Wikipedia. Keeping our heads in the sand and pretending that these events aren't harming the Wiki does not help matters. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 02:51, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can't believe that we've lost some of our best admins, including SlimVirgin, to this ridiculous situation- it saddens me beyond any measure of believe.</dd>
<dd>However, it doesn't surprise me. Wikipedia is huge- and its getting larger every day. Given the vast number of people that are involved in the project, it's to be expected that disgruntled and off-kilter individuals will create things like the Wikipedia review. That it hasn't happened sooner is a blessing, but now that it HAS happened, it's something that Wiki needs to address.</dd>
<dd>There are people who are advocating ignoring the events that have transpired, claiming the mantra "What happens outside of Wikipedia has no bearing here". However, that's not the case, as is clearly evident in the past few days. The actions of WR have without a doubt had a damaging effect here, and (given that Wiki will continue to grow) this is only the beginning. Unless we can find a way to protect Wiki from the actions of former disgruntled users, more sites like this will pop up, we'll keep losing more and more good admins and the project will suffer immensely. --<a href="../../../t/i/n/Image%7ETinyducksig.jpg_d58b.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/8/85/Tinyducksig.jpg/20px-Tinyducksig.jpg" alt="" width="20" height="17" longdesc="../../../t/i/n/Image%7ETinyducksig.jpg_d58b.html" /></a> <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoom127_c0b1.html" title="User:Doom127">Daniel Davis</a> 03:37, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Silencing critics won't help a thing; If WikipediaReview dies, another will spawn in it's place, until we die off or become the perfect project. However, there is something to be said for that mantra. We have always held the belief true and close that what happens off of Wikipedia (aside from foundation affairs) shouldn't have a bearing here. Many controversial decisions have been made because based on that belief. If there is consensus to extend evidence and such to Off-Wiki interaction (Which there clearly is /not/ at this time, judging by the poll relating to <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>), then let's apply that globally and re-examine major actions taken on these grounds. If not, then we should not use off-wiki information <b>period</b>.

<p>I can't respond directly to everything that was said, because there's just been too much of it, but I also can't ignore what people have said to me.</p>
<p>I think we have an obligation to distinguish between free speech (even when it involves cursing out admins and saying Wikipedia sucks donkey elbows) and harmful action (such as revealing the private information of admins). In short, we must distinguish between insult and injury. Once we draw this line, we must then <i>completely ignore</i> all actions that are allowed, no matter how much they offend us.</p>
<p>If we fail to do this, then Wikipedia admins will continue to punish people for their constructive (and, yes, sometimes not so constructive) criticisms, which will have a chilling effect on the voluntary contributions of visitors. Remember, we're not paying these editors (or admins), so we have to be gentle with them. People will contribute only to the extent that they believe the system is fair and reasonable. Yes, we can and should stop people from harming Wikipedia, but we can't stop them from criticizing it, however rightly or not.</p>
<p>I say that we must grow thick skins and focus on our true goal, which is to improve Wikipedia, not punish the infidels that dare insult us. More than that, we should filter out the nonsense and listen for valuable suggestions hidden inside the complaints. There is much we do wrong and much that we can do better. And remember, even the <i>perception</i> of unfairness by admins causes harm. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Al</a> 04:30, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Well, then, we're all hosed, because the world is full of people with authority issues (as well as people with a faulty understanding of the purpose of Wikipedia) that will automatically intepret any corrections of their behaviour on Wikipedia as unfair and will start crying like children deprived of their rattles no matter how carefully we try to handle things. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 04:47, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't think the problem lies in regard to Wikipedia critics, nor do I think anyone here is proposing that we "silence the critics". In any kind of an organization or "coming together" of the minds, the words of a critic can be oftentimes crucial in lending an ear to things that need improvement and change. Using that information can lead to improvements and fixes that might otherwise go unheeded. In that way, a site's harshest critics can be one of its strongest assets. In reality problem lies in those who are hell-bent on the destruction of Wiki and/or the volunteers who work on it, and who are actively attempting to destroy the site via intimidation, personal information posting and other such things. And, as my previous post addressed, it needs to be addressed by the Wiki community before it gets worse. These aren't merely people who are critical of the site. --<a href="../../../t/i/n/Image%7ETinyducksig.jpg_d58b.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/8/85/Tinyducksig.jpg/20px-Tinyducksig.jpg" alt="" width="20" height="17" longdesc="../../../t/i/n/Image%7ETinyducksig.jpg_d58b.html" /></a> <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoom127_c0b1.html" title="User:Doom127">Daniel Davis</a> 04:51, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

All I think needs to be said is this: I am a critic of Wikipedia and some of the unpleasant powertripping that passes itself off as interaction here, but I've never felt it necessary to join Nazis in slagging off the Jewish editors nor have I engaged in campaigns of hatred against particular editors. As one of those editors though, I'd be willing to give Blu and Selina another chance on my behalf. I am pretty toughskinned and I know I helped wind them up. I believe Blu feels he is working for the best of Wikipedia and I think Selina's more silly than bad. I don't see why though an editor of the standing of SlimVirgin should be expected to AGF of people who have subjected her several times to abuse that she has found very distressing. This is not a question of "silencing critics" but of protecting good contributors from the depradations of not so good contributors.</p>
<p>I think though that at an absolute minimum Selina should remove posts from her trollboard that contain personal information or harassment of editors here. You cannot be a party to that and claim you want to be a member of this community in good faith. Selina should also consider more strictly moderating the abusive comments on her board. It's possible to criticise Wikipedia, and the contributors to it, constructively, without trying to hurt anybody. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 06:03, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm glad these issues are finally coming to a head as I felt the Gator1 incident passed without the outcry it deserved. We have a username policy that recomends people use their real names when editing here and yet on the other hand I know of admins who have changed their usernames to hide their identity and use g-mail as it doesn't give an originating IP address. There are problems here with nuts who resort to serious real life harrassment of people, their families, and places of work when they feel agrieved. Wikipedia is NOT therapy - these people waste everyone's time and I seriously doubt if the knowledge base of the encyclopedia suffers in the long run from their absence. I also believe in free speech but this is not a license to disrupt - with that freedom comes responsibility. If someone hosts a website that allows personal information or harassment to continue they do not deserve a chance here until they have gone away for a few years and grown up a bit even if they clean it up now. To expect established respected editors to happily work side by side with editors who have harassed them is naive and egalitarian to the point of stupidity. Wikipedia does have problems and criticizing anything - especially admin actions - is liable to cause the editor with the grievence more grief even if they have a valid point. That however is life and if the user is not prepared to work within the system to improve it and worse still resorts to real life hassle of the "offending parties" then they should be banned pure and simple. This is Jimbo's "baby" and real people are suffering for working for him for free - he needs to take the lead on this one. If as been claimed above he personally approved the unblocking of these accounts without consulting the victims of their harssment then I shall follow SV and Flo as I have no wish to be part of some social experiment. <a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESOPHIA_915a.html" title="User:SOPHIA"><font color="purple"><b>Sophia</b></font></a> 07:52, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Good way to put it -- I never really meant it to be exactly so precise when I coined "Wikipedia is not therapy", but in this case, it's quite accurate. Sophia -- Wikipedia has always been, to some degree, a social experiment; trying to get an encyclopedia "anyone can edit" created by a universe that includes a remarkably high number of nasty people is, whether intended or not, an experiment.

<p>Let's be pragmatic for a second. We're here to build an encyclopedia. And the encyclopedia isn't going to be built very well if abusive users are allowed to continue their harrassment of legitimate editors through various unblocks, "mentorships", and chances at rehabilitation.

In the long run, I doubt it will be <i>me</i> who looks like the silly one. <a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElectricRay_93ad.html" title="User:ElectricRay">ElectricRay</a> 00:01, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>And this is precisely where any dismissal of our intentions as part of some "Jesus complex" is exposed for the hypocrisy it is. The thought that a moral compass is being held by live people <b>who will take extraordinary steps to ruin our real lives over a</b> (real or perceived) <b>slight at Wikipedia supercedes all else</b>, even the encyclopedia itself. This no longer exists in the hypothetical, and no amount of pseudo-philosophy can change that. <tt><a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadioKirk_a5db.html" title="User:RadioKirk"><span style="color: #161;">Radio</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RadioKirk_8f39.html" title="Special:Contributions/RadioKirk"><span style="color: #161;">Kirk</span></a></tt> <tt><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadioKirk_dc7c.html" title="User talk:RadioKirk"><span style="font-size: 9px; color: #161;">talk to me</span></a></tt> 00:18, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Again, your moral absolutism is showing. You assume - you make the <i>judgment</i> - that four legs are good, two legs are bad (or better, or whatever). Those with four (or two, or whatever) legs respectfully (or disrespectufully, whatever) disagree. Like it or not, once you hit <i>that</i> point, your metaphysic has no means of resolving the dispute. So don't accuse <i>me</i> of pseudo-philosophy, much less hypocrisy (<i>how</i>, exactly, by the way?). At least I have a resolution: all it is, is that you don't <i>like</i> it. You're welcome to that opinion. <a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElectricRay_93ad.html" title="User:ElectricRay">ElectricRay</a> 00:01, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The interesting thing is that if someone is banned, they <i>can</i> come back, under a different name and agenda. That's what we expect people to do who have a shift in attitude and decide to be constructive. For example, if the guy/gal who originally created "Willy on Wheels" came back, and the first thing they posted was "I am the original Willy—sorry for all of the people I hurt" they would immediately recieve an indef. But if they quietly come back, and lie through the absence of statement, they recieve a welcome mat and everything. I'm wondering if there's a healthy in-between that can be worked out between those two options, because I never like shutting the door on someone forever, yet I don't like seeing people hurt. However, I don't like the idea of giving someone a chance while they still have connections to the WR and hivemind. There's too much of a chance that they are stormtroopers for these groups that have established themselves as malicious organizations out to destroy our free encyclopedia. I almost get the impression that they abused Linuxbeak's sympathy and compassion for others in order to create an oppourtunity for themselves.--<a href="../../../i/k/i/User%7EIkiroid_fe3b.html" title="User:Ikiroid"><tt><b><font style="background:green" color="white">&#160;The ikiroid&#160;</font></b></tt></a> 00:00, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't recall rules that say "links to WR and Hivemind are blockable offences", and whether something is "malicious" is clearly a personal frame of mind. I've been linked to WR - I have posted there. I post other places, too.

<dd>This has been discussed for several days. Most of the opposition I see amounts to (a) lumping Selina and Blu together (which is not fair), and the evidence against Blu himself is, frankly, not all that convincing.

<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>...I did not work with FloNight, although (s)he did raise a good question towards me on WP:ANI. I was not intending by that post to encourage Amorrow to continue to harrass MusicalLinguist or other admins. First of all, I had a misconception was that it was amorrow that was being harrassed. And I also have an interest, of a sort, in seeing whether or not admins look at what they are reverting before they revert it. In retrospect, however, I can see that first of all, Amorrow was rightfully banned from Wikipedia, for harrassing and bullying many users. And second of all, my comment was innappropriate to post in that form, and publicly. I do not see a problem with encouraging admins to look before they rollback, but I did not intend to encourage a troll to harras the admins.<a href="http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?s=&amp;showtopic=1550&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=9068" class="external autonumber" title="http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?s=&amp;showtopic=1550&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=9068" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>.</p>

<dd>I would say that that post, coming four posts after one in which Amorrow gloats about having FloNight "TRAPPED" and about having her "in the palm of [his] hand" condones Morrow's harassment in general, and not just that towards one editor.

<dd>Most normal decent people seeing a post like that would not start egging on the person who had posted it. And the very existence of that post, which Blu Aardvark had certainly seen as it's just four posts above his own post, casts severe doubt over his claim that he "had a misconception was that it was amorrow that was being harrassed" and that he "did not intend to encourage a troll to harras the admins" — a claim which he made <i>after</i> the question of unblocking him had come up, and after this post had been given as an objection. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 10:19, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>An indefinite block <b>does</b> equal an indefinite block. According to my dictionary, "indefinite" means "without fixed or exact limits".

<p>Oh, I'm sure Brandt is having a good laugh over this. And I don't give a damn. He's entirely irrelevant. He's reduced to putting a list of admins on a page with <i>*gasp*</i> real names and pictures! And then he tries to blackmail people with that info! Oh no! I'd rather do what is right in the long term for Wikipedia than worry about what some insignificant <i>external</i> factor like Brandt thinks. He doesn't run anything here. What we need to work on is a strict <b>No Quarter</b> policy for trolls. We should never be siding with banned trolls over our fellow administrators, and regrettably, that is sort of what this conflict is turning into. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><span style="color:#ff66ff;cursor:w-resize;"><b>Cyde↔Weys</b></span></a> 13:37, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Gotta agree with Guettarda. Linuxbeak brought this all upon us by <i><b>unilaterally</b></i> not only unblocking two well-deservedly-blocked vandals, POV editors and WR honchos, but has the <i>nerve</i> to mock those who are primarily effected by it, and then not only refuses to apologize and indicate that he won't do it again, but tries to come across like <i>he</i> is the victim. If Linuxbeak had come here first, and had suggested that he approach Selina and Blu to see if they had reformed, then he would have seen the level of opposition. But not only did he do this without discussion, he <i><b>approached them first</b></i>, as if, somehow, he is God and knows best how to "reform" these people.

<dd>Whether he intended to do any harm is irrelevent, that he was utterly incapable of thinking through his potential impact of his actions <i>is</i>. "Your Honour, I was just trying to get home fast, I didn't realize that blowing through a red light at 90 mph would cause the deaths of the people in those 3 cars I hit. Besides, Your Honour, they weren't wearing seatbelts so it's their own fault." Yeah, fuck that. (And don't tell me to be civil. Civility is more than not cursing, it is also taking into consideration the potential harm one's actions can cause to others). Quite frankly, Linux definitely needs to be booted as a bueaucrat, and possibly as an admin.

<dd>He may not need them, but we don't need his cheering section either. By inviting them back, Alex endorsed what was done to Kate. He endorsed what they have said about Sarah.

<dd>The logicaly justifcation for that claim is going to have to be very impressive. From where I am I can't see one. I don't endorse homeopaths. Should I block them from wikipedia?<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 03:19, 31 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Don't be silly. To begin with, you'd have to be unblocking them, and they would have to have been blocked for their venonous homeopathy, and they would have gone from being homeopaths in WP to facilitating homeopaths at WR. After what MSK and BA did over at WR, Alex invited them back, without requiring that they disassociate themselves with what they did and encouraged over at WR. He invited them back, despite their dirty hands, without even asking them to wipe their hands off. So, in effect, he said "your dirty hands are welcome here", and thus, endorsed all that they had done. It would be different if there had been some attempt to rehabilitate themselves. But inviting them back, right after what they had done to Kate, can only be seen as a reward for their misbehaviour - in other words, an endorsement of their actions. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 03:56, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I lack the imagination to play word games and split hairs. They were complicit in what was done to Kate. Alex invited them back fresh from their victory. You can use your imagination to concoct a fantasy scenario in which they took Alex's action as a rebuke, or whatever else you choose to. But imaginative fantasy is no substitute for reality. Alex may just have been incredibly insensitive, he may just have acted with no thought of the consequences, but his actions <i>still</i> amount to a slap in the face to a whole lot of editors, and it <i>still</i> amounts to a reward for what they helped do to Kate. Now, you might think that's a good idea, that they deserve the reward Alex offered them. But that's no reason to try to argue that it wasn't a reward for them and a slap in the face for their victims. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 22:37, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My reaction was due to Linuxbeak's storming out of here like he is the aggrieved party, after all of the damage that was caused by his unilateral actions. If he had even made any attempt at a meaningful apology, and had left because he was sorry for his actions, I would not have responded as I had.

<dd>Let me add one more thing: I was only tangentially attcked by Amorrow in his various incarnations, nowhere near as much as MusicalLinguist, and have not seen the wrath of Brandt as have others. Having a "thick skin" and being able to take criticism is one thing, and you have to put up with a lot of criticism as an admin on Wikipedia (and in emails). That comes with the territory. But to have your personal life affected by these people goes beyond the pale, and then to have somebody come in and say that he's willing to forgive all of that (even though he, personally, was not affected), is a slap in the face to those who <i>were</i> personally, real-life, affected. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 02:47, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Not terribly impressed. An apology like that is, at best, a "I'm right, but I regret that my actions hurt you". It shows no willingness to own up to the fact that he has hurt (and the project) far more than anything I have experienced in my almost two years here. Alex has caused us a huge loss. He won't own up to what he did. He doesn't try to fix the problem. He just leaves in a huff, with his feelings hurt, as if he is the victim here. Don't give me that "We need to stop the bleeding" crap. I haven't seen any evidence that Alex is willing to admit the insult of his actions. Have you ever read the filty at WR? Have you read the stuff that's been written about Slim and Ann and all the rest? People who had a part in that shouldn't be here. How much time did this take that could have been spent writing an encyclopaedia? Any clue how much Slim did to solve problems and defuse crap?

<p>Would anyone object to me moving this mess to a subpage or something?

<p>Greetings, I'm Quadell. I've been away from Wikipedia for a while, but I wanted to come in and give my opinion on this latest mess.</p>
<ol>
<li>Linuxbeak made a mistake in good faith. He didn't violate any specific policy, but he showed poor judgment. I've shown poor judgment in the past too. He also apologized for unblocking without discussing it here first, and he has said he won't do it again. Dumping on Linuxbeak is rude and inappropriate. Every time you act incivilly, the Wikipedia community loses a little respect for you.</li>
<li>It's horrible that SlimVirgin and others have (temporarily?) left the project over this. I understand why they did, and I sympathize, and I hope this can all be resolved peaceably. But Linuxbeak should not have to apologize for the fact that these admins have left -- they chose to leave. I'm in a similar situation: I left because of the actions of a long-time admin. And I think that admin should apologize for her actions -- but she should <i>not</i> have to apologize for the fact that I left.</li>
<li>I think attempting to unblock someone indefinitely banned should be done no sooner than 3 months after his or her ban, and 6 months is better. Additionally, if that user has recently caused other problems (using sockpuppets to evade the ban, for instance, or posting inflamatory and stalking comments on WR, or permitting the blackmailing of a fine admin) then one should wait 3-6 months before even thinking of unblocking that user.</li>
<li>People who post images and addresses of Wikipedians in order to intimidate or blackmail them are scum. I don't think anyone who does this, or admins on a board which does this, should be tolerated here unless they seek to make amends to the people they have harmed. But that's just my opinion.</li>
</ol>
<p>Anyway, I hope this blows over soon. I miss you all. – <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadell_cd19.html" title="User:Quadell">Quadell</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuadell_8ab2.html" title="User talk:Quadell">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../b/o/u/Wikipedia%7EBounty_board_8f83.html" title="Wikipedia:Bounty board">bounties</a>)</sup> 16:50, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
