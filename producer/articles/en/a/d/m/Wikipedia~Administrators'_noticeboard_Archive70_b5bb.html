<p>I just noticed that a feature which Ligulem <a href="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8392" class="external text" title="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8392" rel="nofollow">requested</a> last week has already been implemented. If you click 'edit' on a page and scroll down to the list of pages transcluded onto it you will now see "(protected)" or "(semi-protected)" next to those which have such status. This is a quick way of identifying any templates on the <a href="../../../index.html" title="Main Page">Main Page</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/i/Main_Page_Tomorrow_f3be.html" title="Main Page/Tomorrow">Main Page/Tomorrow</a>, the 'article of the day', or any other page are vulnerable to vandalism. Good job by the devs. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 13:52, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It seems to be listing the current number of Featured Articles, so the number only has to be updated in one place to fix all places where the number is used.

<dd>'s ok. I am not a newb. I am unbitten. I will probably create a private text that's a lot stronger than this and use it on severe offenders. I think y'all are way too soft on these people. They are seriously the #1 bane of Wikipedia, worse than the edit warriors. n00bs are our biggest asset, and I have already heard a hundred times on and offwiki that we are regarded, rightly or wrongly, as a bureaucratic morass where good faith contributors who don't know our ways have to put up with overzealous NPP goons competing as if for first place in some perverted contest with their fancy Javascript tools. I have posted last week about <a href="../../../n/p/w/WP%7ENPW_6248.html" title="WP:NPW">WP:NPW</a>, asking if people thought that thing was deleterious to the project overall - there were no takers. Seriously though, the problem needs solving. I've been making trouble at RfA with it for a couple of months now, but that apparently did not strike enough fear into the relevant hearts.

<dd>Noob-biting is the number-one bane of the 'pedia? I would've said lack of sources, but maybe that's just me. Anyways, I understand where you're coming from about the NPP thingy - this automated new-page-patrol tool surprised me too. (The again, I couldn't even figure out how to install AWB once I downloaded it, so maybe I'm not one to comment on these tools.) But giving stop-hand emblazoned, robotic, and somewhat patronizing warnings to contributors who are working, in good faith, to clean up the encyclopedia isn't going to help. Why not just type them an explanation of what actions of theirs that you disagree with, direct them to the <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">relevant policy</a>, and save block warnings for when they haven't stopped after two or three personalized, situation-specific warnings?

<p>(de-indent) I've said this on a couple of RfA's, but nowhere more public: as much as I agree that some of the NP patrollers think they're playing an <a href="../../../m/m/o/MMORPG_6790.html" title="MMORPG">MMORPG</a> and are leveling up by racing each other to bad articles, is quick speedy-tagging really "biting"? If I were a newcomer who had written a blatantly deficient article, I'd like to be informed of it quickly, rather than coming back a few days later to find my one creation swept into the wastebin hours after I considered it "finished". We'd also like to see enthusiastic newbie effort going toward something productive - even a well-written and polished article about a lame garage band is still an article about a lame garage band; no sense in letting them pour more time and effort into something that is never going to pass muster. Also, obligatory general objection to talking in templates. <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 03:24, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's mostly the immediate <i>mis</i>tagging that I am worried about. "Jane is stupid" can be tagged before creation for all I care. It's good faith legitimate efforts that are getting swept up.

<dd>I've seen the kind of biting you describe sometimes, but agree with Picaroon that it's not the "#1 bane". I think the first message should be a very friendly reminder, not a threat to block. Anyway, you're free to use stronger wording, I just wouldn't put it in a template. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small>2007-01-03 03:54Z</small></i></span>

<dd>But there are plenty of "good-faith" but totally misguided new articles created - mostly people's garage bands, from what I've noticed. Does tagging these fall under your definition of biting? To pull a random example of the speedy queue, I doubt the creator of Phazm meant it in bad faith, but there's nothing encyclopedic about it. It was tagged 3 minutes after creation and a talk-page template was left for the author: is that a bite situation in your view? <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 04:09, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wikipedia is having a problem with incivility in general (anyone biting anyone, not just newbies) <i>and</i> with oversensitivity about being bitten (Bob:You were rude - you should be blocked for always being so incivil.

<li>Well, it can be both, I guess.

<p>I got jaded doing new page patrolling, but a monh or two ago, I tagged many, many articles within a minute of creation, and yes, quite a few withing seconds and often got beat to it by others doing NPP. Apart from obvious spam, I tagged many articles with db-bio for being non-notable. Now one could argue I should wait an hour or two and come back and see if the user added more info, but the whole system of tagging gives the user a chance to say they are going to add to the article with a holdon. Sometimes admins would remove the speedy tag and change to a prod if they felt there was some doubt and I think this works well. If I have to wait an hour to check the article again, it's a no go, on a busy night I might tag 50-100 articles, and there is no way to keep a notepad of articles and wait and see if certain articles improve. <i>If I felt that I'm going to be tagged for biting when I'm doing vandal fighting and new page patrol, I would be hesitant to bother to do the work.</i> --<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmadilloFromHell_83a4.html" title="User:ArmadilloFromHell"><font color="#0000FF"><b>Armadillo</b></font><font color="#000000"><b>From</b></font><font color="#DD2222"><b>Hell</b></font><font color="#AAAAAA"><b>GateBridge</b></font></a> 06:07, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree that many articles can and should be speedy tagged instantly, but for those where additional work may show the required notability (say, articles about bands), waiting a bit can't do much harm. However, this means that we need more people doing time-delayed new page patrol (TM), i.e. going to the new pages, moving down to the 500th or 1000th most recent raticle (some 12 hours old or so), and start digging through those. It is amazing how many of those pages are still fit for either speedy, prod, or merge... <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 09:52, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Then their editing histories and patterns cannot be seen (without admin rights) and this has obvious consequences, particularly if an admin needs to evaluate whether/when/not to apply a block. 137.222.189.198 16:45, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I would have discussed, if I hadn't been prevented by being blocked. The point is less whether red rain in Kerala is paranormal or not (and I don't see how organic material in comets could remotely be considered paranormal), than whether this admin acted appropriately by a) blocking someone he was in dispute with, and b) giving a dishonest reason. I think it's very patronising to talk of spilt milk, when this is not about my block but about an administrator who directly contravened policy.

<dd>(edit conflict and beaten to the punch by JS) Please keep in mind that the template you removed simply indicated the article was being watched or edited by a Wikiproject; in this case, it does NOT mean that the incident is definitively related to the paranormal or any such thing, it simply means that the Paranormal Wikiproject has agreed to contribute to the page (because of the proposed theory discussed on the article page).

<p>Separate from the merits of the block, I'm concerned that this editor apparently posted the "unblock" template at 11:38 (UTC) today, no admin reviewed it, and the block remained in effect unreviewed until it expired by time at 23:34.

<dd>I have to concur. Initially both this IP user and Inshanee were using Edit Summaries to discuss the issue, rather than using the talk page. That's a bad idea, but far more forgivable for a newbie than an admin. Inshanee then both warned <i>and</i> blocked the IP at virtually the same time - telling him that he was the only one who disagreed, and for the first time telling him that he should take it up on the discussion page. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:81.178.208.69" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:81.178.208.69" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk3ARed_rain_in_Kerala&amp;diff=98047634&amp;oldid=98001817" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk3ARed_rain_in_Kerala&amp;diff=98047634&amp;oldid=98001817" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> (I've got to wonder how the IP was supposed to do that given that he was being blocked.

<dd>Well he did edit war rather than discuss. I don't buy that admins are never allowed to critisize new users/whatever subset of users, the new user here was acting in good faith but still sort of in the wrong and that he was edit warring. This was a situation where you expect an admin to try to help a new user understand what's going on and the need for discussion, rather than just block them and walk away. Still, if you get reverted, new user or admin, the best thing to do is post an explanation and request an answer, not just keep reverting back and arguing in edit summaries. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 01:05, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

If you characterize something that is important to someone (like their religion, culture, viewpoints, etc) as something that it is not, that can be offensive and should be discussed. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 01:10, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>This is just the straw that broke the camel's back. This is certainly not the first thing he's ever done, and not the worst thing - and considering that this block is so unbelievably illegitimate and wrong, that speaks to the severity of his other actions. Wheel warring, vindictive blocks, punitive blocks, edit warring, abusing AWB, calling people vandals when he disagrees with their edits, criticizing people for calling others trolls when he does it often, protecting pages to suit his wants and needs, and of course, assuming bad faith. After all of this, I cannot see how he can be allowed to be an admin. He clearly hasn't shown ANY caution after receiving an RfC, where he had many people supporting the idea that he has at least done something wrong, with many agreeing he has acted poorly as an administrator. The man thinks that his role here is to govern the lesser Wikipedians, which he has shown by his constant demands for non-admins to show him respect. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 08:31, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, the anonymous editor in this case was me, dropping by after a few months away and wanting to do so anonymously. InShanee is not really guilty of biting a newbie, though he had no way of knowing that he wasn't, and I was guilty of making my case via edit summaries instead of on the talk page. What doesn't change, though, is that InShanee's block of me was unjustified, he used his administrating tools to gain the upper hand in a dispute, and the reason he gave for the block was dishonest. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 15:41, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Exactly. What he was doing could be said as attempting to bite a newbie. InShaneee could not have known that this user was not a newbie - he blocked him thinking of him as a newbie and ignoring a spotless block log (that, if this really were a newbie, would now blemished by an abusive and, let's face it, mediocre administrator). I don't blame anyone for thinking that Wikipedia is getting worse by the day - people like InShaneee ruin it for everyone but themselves. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 23:19, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't know anything about the history of InShanee's interaction with the various others posting here nor why such a level of hostility has been expressed, but this attitude of "I've already made my judgement, don't bother me with facts" is troubling. The claim has been made that InShanee could not have known that he wasn't dealing with a newbie, but I don't understand how anyone could have failed to recognize it. It seems obvious to me that a newbie's first action is not going to be to assert ownership of an article to the extent of removing a project template from a talkpage without any discussion. Clearly InShanee should not have labelled the block "vandalism", but I'm not sure I see any other fault in his action. Worldtraveller, on the other hand, does not own the article simply because he wrote the original and he should not be given a pass on <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> just by using an anon account. — <a href="../../../m/e/d/User%7EMediaMangler_0339.html" title="User:MediaMangler">MediaMangler</a> 08:34, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well I don't think it's terribly relevant whether anyone knew whether the IP was someone old or someone new. The fact remains that this block was completely outrageous. If you can't see anything wrong other than the dishonest labelling, let me outline what I see as wrong with it:</dd>
<dd>Going through <a href="../../../b/p/_/WP%7EBP_c8aa.html" title="WP:BP">WP:BP</a>, let's see whether the block was covered by it. Was the block <i>to protect the rights, property or safety of the Wikimedia Foundation, its users or the public</i>? No. Was it for personal attacks or making threats? No. 3RR? Not by a very long way. Was it for disruption? No, because <b>Disagreements over content or policy are not disruption</b>, and this was a disagreement over the content, not even of an article, but of a talk page. Was it because I am a banned user? No. So, there were not any legitimate grounds to block me. Now, let's look at 'when not to block': <b>Blocking to gain an advantage in a content dispute is strictly prohibited</b>. Did InShaneee do that? Yes he did. <b>Sysops must not block editors with whom they are currently engaged in a content dispute</b>. Did InShaneee do that? Yes he did.</dd>
<dd>As has been noted, I've been here a while. In all that time this is probably the worst abuse of administrative powers I've had any direct experience of (though not nearly as bad as the outrageous block on Giano that kicked off a massively destructive chain of events). In addition, it seems to me that InShaneee treats his fellow editors with some contempt, as you can see by his assertion that he does indeed see it as his role to govern them, and he treats his fellow administrators with contempt by ignoring this discussion and conspicuously failing to justify his actions. If this isn't his first abuse of administrative tools then I think there is a problem that needs to be resolved. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 12:04, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, given that there was no justification in the policy for the block, and given that even if there had been, InShaneee would have been prohibited by the policy from applying a block, and given that one would expect administrators to have read and understood the blocking policy quite thoroughly, I think InShaneee quite consciously ignored the policy. Not much room left for assuming good faith on his part when that much is clear, I'm afraid. I am interested to know whether you stand by your claim that there was no fault in InShaneee's actions. I'd also like to hear InShaneee's justification for the block. Oh, and by the way, in what conceivable way is removing an inappropriate tag from a talk page trying to own an article? <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 13:23, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I didn't say there was no fault in his actions, only that I'm not sure I see any fault. I don't feel qualified to judge how well his block complies with every jot and tittle of policy. Given <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>, I'm not sure I can ever understand Wiki policy well enough to make such judgements. My concern was that those making the judgement have the full facts in hand. It is your opinion that the tag was inappropriate, several others disagree. (Frankly, if I ever experience blood-red rain falling on me, my first thoughts are likely to be about something paranormal!) You removed a tag from the talkpage of an article which you have no current intent to edit (since you claim to be on wikibreak), thereby disrupting the efforts of that project. Tagging the talkpage was simply an indication of the intent by members of that project to edit. You certainly have no right to tell the members of that project that they may not edit the article. You're free to argue that the term "paranormal" should not be associated with this article, but surely you should discuss that with those others who also choose to edit the article. — <a href="../../../m/e/d/User%7EMediaMangler_0339.html" title="User:MediaMangler">MediaMangler</a> 14:06, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Sorry to be blunt, but this forum is not to discuss what you or I think of red rain in Kerala but to discuss whether an administrator's actions were justifiable. How about sticking to talking about the merits of the administrator's actions, and stopping accusing me of trying to own things, of trying to tell people what they can edit, of disruption, and whatever other offensive and untrue accusations you might be thinking of making. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 15:11, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I tried to present my opinion of your actions in as diffident and diplomatic manner as I could. I'm sorry that still managed to offend you. In answer to your question of why I'm participating: I have long monitored these types of Wiki disagreements, since the psychology and politics involved fascinate me. When talk of "biting a newbie" first started to be discussed, if you had come forward to clarify that you were no newbie, then I would have been more than happy to remain an observer rather than a participant. If you wanted to remain anonymous then all that was needed was a simple "I'm not a newbie" in order to forestall the misconception. — <a href="../../../m/e/d/User%7EMediaMangler_0339.html" title="User:MediaMangler">MediaMangler</a> 16:43, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The 'newbie' thing is irrelevant to the central point, which is that an administrator abused his position, contravened the policy, and gave a dishonest reason for a block designed to win the upper hand in a content dispute. Whether he thought I was new or not, the action was still wrong. There is absolutely nothing in existing policy which could justify this block, and in fact existing policy specifically precludes this type of block. And yet you can't see any fault? If you don't feel qualified to discuss whether a block complied with policy, I can't really understand why you're taking part in a discussion about whether a block complied with policy. What you seem to be doing is just slandering me, rather than offering any constructive appraisal or criticism of the administrative action under discussion. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 18:22, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree with the premise that "a newbie's first action is not going to be to assert ownership of an article to the extent of removing a project template from a talkpage without any discussion." That seems to me exactly like a newbie thing to do - because they come across a template they don't agree with on a subject they feel strongly about, don't understand what the template is meant to do, and don't understand how Wikipedia works. (In this case I guess it wasn't a true newbie- and I'm not happy about being fooled - but the behavior was definitely newbie-esque.) Remember <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanlon%27s_Razor_789c.html" title="Hanlon's Razor">Hanlon's Razor</a>, which could be considered a part of assuming good faith - "Never assume malice when stupidity will suffice."

<p>Regardless of the validity of the block, the fact that an admin who clearly knows his actions are being questioned hasn't offered any kind of explanation is very concerning.

<dd>Or we could listify it, with wikilinks to the main pages of each.

<p>How should we determine which ones should be included in the mass AfD? Maybe a first batch containing all those having less than 10k users (per the ranking at meta)? Or less than 20k articles? Or less than 50k edits? Or all three? Any otherwise notable wikis could always be undeleted (in case we find out that there's been significant coverage of one of these very small wikis).

<ul>
<li>My advice is to tread carefully, and be conservative. If you nominate forty articles, and four turn out to be somewhat notable, the Afd will trainwreck, with some people voting to delete all, some to delete none, but most to delete all but three, with different people selecting a different three... you see the problem. Several of these have survived previous AfDs, for example <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Urdu_Wikipedia_ce22.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Urdu Wikipedia">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Urdu Wikipedia</a>. <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_Wikipedia_aa3b.html" title="Chinese Wikipedia">Chinese Wikipedia</a> is notable due to being repeatedly blocked, and ripped off by <a href="../../../b/a/i/Baidu.html" title="Baidu">Baidu</a>. <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Wikipedia_b337.html" title="Spanish Wikipedia">Spanish Wikipedia</a> is notable due to an editor revolt and fork. <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_Wikipedia_58de.html" title="German Wikipedia">German Wikipedia</a> is notable due to multiple print versions. <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_Wikipedia_cfe5.html" title="Russian Wikipedia">Russian Wikipedia</a> is notable due to winning a national prize. <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polish_Wikipedia_07b2.html" title="Polish Wikipedia">Polish Wikipedia</a> <i>may</i> be notable due to one print version. In short, go through every single article and only include the ones which have no mention in the outside community, otherwise I strongly suspect the Afd will fail. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 14:43, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>You will remember, I think, that a group of editors set off to remove links to YouTube, requiring that before they went back in we clarified the copyright status and encyclopaedic merit of the links. This met with some resistance. There appear to be two camps now, which might be summed up as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>those who believe that YouTube links should go in unless you can prove they are violating copyright</li>
<li>those who believe that YouTube links should stay out unless you can prove they are <i>not</i> infringing copyright</li>
</ul>
<p>Guess which group I'm in. The argument rages at <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_Identifying_copyrights_in_links_f83d.html" title="Wikipedia:External links/Identifying copyrights in links">Wikipedia:External links/Identifying copyrights in links</a>, <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EExternal_links_YouTube_ba59.html" title="Wikipedia talk:External links/YouTube">Wikipedia talk:External links/YouTube</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Sir_Nicholas_de_Mimsy-Porpington_680e.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington</a> and various other places.

<p><a href="../../../c/o/p/WP%7ECOPYRIGHT_17d4.html" title="WP:COPYRIGHT">WP:COPYRIGHT</a> makes it clear that <i>knowingly</i> linking to infringing material is contributory infringement (also that linking to copyvios makes us look bad). Given that many YouTube vids are copyvios I don't think it's excesive to require people to clarify copyright before adding, but there is a small and committed group who are insistent that the default should be the other way round. More input required, I think. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 10:34, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Can an admin please tell me why <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clemson_Tigers_football_fb22.html" title="Clemson Tigers football">Clemson Tigers football</a> was deleted? I believe it was a redirect that redirected to <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clemson_Tigers_1ab5.html" title="Clemson Tigers">Clemson Tigers</a>. Was the redirect deleted by someone's request so they could create an article there? If not, could it be restored please?

<dd>It appears the article was originally created as a redirect. Later someone decided to expand it into an article. After starting the editor realized that the work was redundant and put the article up for speedy deletion with a "db-author" tag. An admin then came along and carried out the requested deletion. Unfortunately, it appears the admin did not check the article's history or see that there were several incoming links to the originial redirect page. I've restored the redirect which should accomplish the original editor's intention. Thanks for pointing it out. --<a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuffOfInterest_823e.html" title="User:StuffOfInterest">StuffOfInterest</a> 17:18, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello, I was hoping an administrator would be willing to officially close a survey that has been idle for a few weeks now.

<dd>I may be missing something here, but administrators are not in the business of "officially closing" any discussions except where policy provides for it, as in <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAfD_60e1.html" title="WP:AfD">WP:AfD</a> discussions. I see nothing in the straw poll you link to that requires an administrator to do anything. Any user may close the poll if there is consensus to do so on the talk page. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 23:11, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please. There has a been discussion on the time of execution. It is in the archive. Since I felt many people did not feel like they had to go to the archive to see previous discussions, I reopened the topic on the talk page. I've discussed that various sources say do did indeed say he died at 6:10. However, there are twice as many sources that say he died at a different time, which why I was reverting the original version of the article that stated he was executed at "<b>approximately 06:00 local time</b>." That is consistent with <u>all</u> the sources. It removed the problem of conflicting reports. Mostly 64.107.0.85 is making unsourced, irrational, or irrelevant edits. I've tried to explain to him that there have been discussions on things he is vandalizing/removing. He ignores the discussions and replaces previously discussed content with the way he, and only he, feels the way the article should reflect his own views. I believe this is a direct violation of Wikipedia's <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV policy</a>, nevermind his incivility.

Video is not on original saddam page, should not be here, his links about 6am death are initial links, 6:10 was confirmed by Iraqi government. Videos like this can not be shown, except cnn version, up to the point before hanging, we do not want to create hate and mistrust and confusion, wiki must abide by its policies, people like uber have their own polocy, sure the guy is civil and all, but being civil DOES NOT MAKE YOU RIGHT OR WRONG, And he is wrong... civil?

<dd>Thank you 64.107.220.181. I understand your concerns. But without the a source to official document that states his death at a certain time, it would be imprudent to to cite a specific time based on one or even two reports. You have one or two sources that really do say he died at 6:10 or 6:05 (you can't make up your mind). However, for each of those, there just as many that say he died at a DIFFERENT time. Your source does not say "the official death record by the Iraqi government for Saddam Hussein is 6:10." No, it say "he died at 6:10." So now it is a case of he says she says (hearsay). Why? Because other sources say he died at exactly 6:00, others say before 6:00, some say 6:07. It ranges. It's best to say <b>approximately</b> 6:00, because, that, we can all agree on. As for the video, I respect your concern. However, I, and the rest who gave their consensus on the discussion page, feel the video does not "promote hate." It's an accurate and historical representation of the occurrences of December 30, 2006. If you do not wish to view the video (which was described factually and accurately so that one may understand what they were going to watch), then please do not click on the link. However, your opinion of the video should not deter deserving readers and editors of Wikipedia if they do not agree with you. Wikipedia makes that clear in various policies. ~ <a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUBeR_2da6.html" title="User:UBeR">UBeR</a> 03:37, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I disagree, like i said on saddam execution talk, we can put official cnn video, not illegal, ugly and tormenting, it does promote hate, you remind me of that iraqi puppet who said now that saddam is dead we can reunite, lol. Sunnis are really suffering. However, on talk page i also gave other links that proves he died at 6:10, also other sources say he was on the rope 5 minutes, it says died at 6:05, pronounced dead 6:10, so, even if he was on the rope 20 days, but pronounced dead at a certain time, that is what counts. And by doing the video, wiki promotes hate. No censorship? Then I can put just about everything and say... hey this is rape in action, see the blood and screams, mutilation, etc...

<p>Uber and 64 dude are arguing, but i did put important links back, and under saddam execution I put warning sign. Fair enough?64 was right, good links removed by uber and his supporters. <a name="Uber_problems_on_execution" id="Uber_problems_on_execution"></a></p>

<p>What is difference between admi noticeboard and incident report?</p>
<p>Whoever put the warning is right, i can live with that in front of links. Too many blood thirty people here...</p>
<p>Ok, this guy has a way with words and keeps on pointing to something on talk page, God knows what, but I added few simple words and I can live with that now, somebody did it yesterday. Viewer discretion advised. Also important links which have been here, which administrator stefans himself reverted to, have been under attack. I do not see anything wrong with that, especially saddam's last hours, again, I am calling on administrators to ban uber from screwing up this site. It is self evident this guy has self interest on this site, he keeps on spending hours and hours on it, reverting, sure he is polite, because he knows he will not last long here. Administrators, many times make a mistake, when somebody goes ranting, they side with the other guy, but again, you may be uncivil, but you are still correct, that does not change fact or anything else, there is no doubt in my mind this dude has personal interest, the way he is defending himself, the time he puts into this clearly says something. For example sfacets reversed a good website that uber reversed... (cur) (last) 21:52, 4 January 2007 Sfacets (Talk | contribs) (Undo revision 98501627 by UBeR (talk) The Times of India is spam?)

<dd>Well, there was <i>one</i> argument given: That it provides a way for people to co-ordinate editing activities in the same way that other user-definition categories do. That's a very small benefit, admitted, it's simply that the <b>stated</b> risk of predation was never discussed rationally, so if we're measuring arguments I'd have to agree with Jeff. The real issue was never presented, though, that there is a reputatinal risk in having this category.

<dd>The video, by itself, isn't much, but considering the article was talking about the very move that is shown in the clip, I'm not sure how it "adds nothing". The chances of an official video being posted by Midway (the manufacturer) is non-existant; not only is it a game long past its prime, but it is an easter egg that is available only on one console (Sega Genesis). <a href="../../../e/v/u/User%7EEVula_5373.html" title="User:EVula">EVula</a> <span style="color: #999;">// <a href="../../../e/v/u/User_talk%7EEVula_6eaa.html" title="User talk:EVula">talk</a> // <a href="../../../e/v/u/User%7EEVula_admin_63be.html" title="User:EVula/admin"><span style="color: #366;">☯</span></a> //</span> 15:28, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It's more that the majority of YouTubes have copyright issues, so all are being removed for discussion. If copyright is unambiguously clean, the links can go back in.

<p>DeLarge, I didn't remove those for copyright concerns. I actually spent quite a bit of time thinking of those and decided that they added little value to the article.

<p>I just found out about this page. It allows us to make external links with a syntax such as <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=elephant" class="extiw" title="google:elephant">Google:elephant</a>. However, the list contains over a hundred of sites that can be linked like this, most of which wouldn't even remotely qualify as either a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> or an <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">external link</a> - such as third-party wikis with very few edits. The links don't seem to show up in <a href="../../../l/i/n/Special%7ELinksearches_2409.html" title="Special:Linksearches">Special:Linksearches</a> either. This is far too easily abused for linkspamming purposes; I think the list is due for some heavy cleaning.

<p>From what I can see Teddierx told Nehpetskenawi to refrain from editing <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslim</a>, "because of your limited mental abilities, anything you wish to add will be indistinguishable from vandalism." He also told User:ChinChonWon on his <a href="../../../c/h/i/User_talk%7EChinChonWon_4c23.html" title="User talk:ChinChonWon">talk page</a> that "our records have detected that You are a shi'ite. Since the majority of Shi'ites are black, you have been blocked permanently from our encyclopedia, just in case." ChinChonWon then retaliated, telling Teddierx "Please stop vandalising the USER PAGE! Otherwise, I will CHOP OFF YOUR HEAD!" He also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:ShowerGel&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=98203704" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:ShowerGel&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=98203704" rel="nofollow">posted</a> on ShowerGel's talk page with the message "WARNING. YOU ARE TOO WIKITARDED TO CONTRIBUTE. YOU ARE A WIKITOSSPOT. THANK YOU" in large letters.</p>
<p><br />
<a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShowerGel_83f1.html" title="User:ShowerGel">ShowerGel</a> also faked being Teddierx, and also faked that that user was faking being WikiAdministrator, as well as <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetsnipe_10c5.html" title="User:Netsnipe">Netsnipe</a> on his own talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AShowerGel&amp;diff=98253652&amp;oldid=98203704#new_notice_from_REAL_administrator" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AShowerGel&amp;diff=98253652&amp;oldid=98203704#new_notice_from_REAL_administrator" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>I'm asking the administrators to take a look at this, because I'm confused about whats going on, and maybe a CheckUser is called for? <a href="../../../n/w/w/User%7ENwwaew_aacb.html" title="User:Nwwaew">Nwwaew</a> <small>(<a href="../../../n/w/w/User_talk%7ENwwaew_f1fd.html" title="User talk:Nwwaew">Talk Page</a>) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nwwaew_3368.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nwwaew">Contribs</a>) (<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Nwwaew_04d2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Nwwaew">E-mail me</a>)</small> 14:06, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well.

I gave ChinChonWon and ShowerGel {{<a href="../../../n/p/a/Template%7ENpa4im_59d7.html" title="Template:Npa4im">npa4im</a>}} warnings and will monitor their activities. Nehpetskenawi doesn't appear to be involved, except as a victim of their puerile behavior. If another admin wants to overturn my block on Teddierx (he wasn't properly warned, I suppose), feel free to do so. I have absolutely no tolerance for people pretending to be other users. I don't know that a checkuser is necessary, though: my guess is that the three involved know each other off Wikipedia, and may even be all on the same school IP. -- <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerope_5bcb.html" title="User:Merope"><b><font color="#3D59AB">Merope</font></b></a> 14:28, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Would you care to explain to me how the edit I made was <b>not</b> non-trivial (ie - it was clearly a trivial edit). Here's the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Execution_of_Saddam_Hussein&amp;diff=98559059&amp;oldid=98523740" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Execution_of_Saddam_Hussein&amp;diff=98559059&amp;oldid=98523740" rel="nofollow">diff</a>. ZScout370, with his impeccable understanding of the relevant laws, was removing fair use images. William M Connolley was remvoing the links to the execution videos premsumably as per (an interpretation of) <a href="../../../b/r/d/WP%7EBRDC_62bc.html" title="WP:BRDC">WP:BRDC</a> (without the revert, but in order to get a consensus and avoid an edit war), in order to form a really clear consensus on the talk page (which has happened). WhisperToMe entered a fair paragraph on a recent event related to the execution, improving the article - I don't think that he really had to discuss the issue first - it was an undebateable paragraph not related to the previous edit war. <strong><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_980f.html" title="User:Martinp23">Mart</a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartinp23_2732.html" title="User talk:Martinp23"><font color="red">inp23</font></a></strong> 15:04, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Fair enough about your edit and ZScout. However, I completely disagree with your characterization of William and WhisperToMe's edits. It's underhanded for admins to edit protected articles in all but the most non-trivial and legally required ways. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 15:11, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Hardly - I'm sure you'll agree that it ultimately falls to admins to keep protected articles up to date (hence Whisper's edit) and to resolve dispute (hence William's protection and edits (all in a very short time period - it's fair to say that what WMC did was in the course of <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">WP:DR</a>, probably after a 3RR report at <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_3_9d40.html" title="WP:AN/3">WP:AN/3</a>, and he was trying to let the dust settle and get some debate)). <strong><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_980f.html" title="User:Martinp23">Mart</a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartinp23_2732.html" title="User talk:Martinp23"><font color="red">inp23</font></a></strong> 15:21, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>No, I don't agree to that. This isn't the "Admin Wikipedia." It belongs to all of its editors. If an article is in such contention that it needs to be protected then all users, admins included, should respect that. I agree that it's not black-and-white and there are clearly instances when an article should be updated, particularly when major events occur. But for an admin to make any other edits gives the appearance of abuse of power. As admins you should avoid even the appearance of impropriety. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 15:34, 5 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Exactly - hence why we have as many mechanisms in place to allow edits from non-admins during the harmful spell of protection. WhisperToMe's edit was not controversial, and has only imporved the Wiki. It is regretful that, due to a content dispute, other editors couldn't add to it, but I'ms ure you'll agree that that edit only improved the article, and that it was perfectly within WhisperToMe's right to make. If protection was meant to restrict admins from editing, then it would (or we'd have another article locking feature). As it is, admins were&#160;!voted into being by the community, and are expected to show the ability to only make edits to protected articles which are uncontroversial or blatantly neccessary. As far as I'm concerned, WMC's edits immeidately after he protected can be easily ocnsidered to have occured before he protected, in the course of consensus building (which is what admins do). First, he wiped the slate clean by remving (most of) the links (I cleaned up the bit he left behind later) and then started a poll on the talk page, and discussion. This is the best way to deal with edit wars.

<dd>I'm not discussing the video or why the article was protected - those are separate issues. What I am discussion is the protection of an article and subsequent edits made by administrators. Wikipedia is not a two-tier system where administrators get to roam free on protected articles while us mere editors only get to sit and watch. It's not even so much the particular edits that were made as the principle of admins making unnecessary edits to protected articles. If the edits were not that important, why can't those admins wait to make the edits when the article is unprotected like regular editors? It's an abuse of power.</dd>
<dd>I'm not saying it's the end of the world but it's clearly unethical and should be addressed. I am asking that the practice be stopped and the admins involved should be told, "Hey, cut it out" to their fellow admins. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 15:30, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>The official <a href="../../../p/p/o/WP%7EPPOL_a58e.html" title="WP:PPOL">Wikipedia policy</a> for protecting a page says: "Do not edit or revert a temporarily protected page, except to add a protected page notice." After protecting the page, the administrator edited the protected page twice: (1) once to remove content he did not agree with and (2) once to add a protected page notice. Removing the content he did not agree with after the page was protected is a clear violation of the protecting page policy. Furthermore, Wikipedia policy for protecting a page says: "Do not protect a page you are involved in an edit dispute over." The given reason for the post-page protection editing was to remove content the administrator said possessed "excess tastelessness." As an administrator, William M. Connolley should be expected to act in accordance with Wikipedia policy. He should not involve himself in edit disputes if he is going to protect a page. Or he should not protect a page if he is going to involve himself in edit disputes. I am relatively new here, but I am disappointed that violating explicit Wikipedia policy appears to be okay in some circumstances. --<a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHab_baH_77d7.html" title="User:Hab baH">Hab baH</a> 08:04, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I just wanted to say that it is totally outrageous that this afd has ended like it did. No consensus was reached, and yet it gets deleted. It went on for 3 days, and not a week like originally promised. WP:SNOW makes no sense since consensus was not reached at that point. I am certain that this will end up in deletion review soon and that the article be restored to its former glory.

<ul>
<li>Topic for #wikipedia-en-admins is: Please do not release logs, although there have been public leaks. Please comport yourself in a manner becoming to an admin. Imagine the person you're talking about reading what you're saying. Be civil even in the third person to complete dicks^W^Wthe troublesome. Be excellent to one another.</li>

<p>I've been working for a few days to clean out the old Wikipedians in Esperanza category, which has been part of the CFD backlog for a while. Some of the category tags were extremely hard to root out due to the complexity of some userpages. However, I've gotten it down to just <i>two left</i>: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Glen_S&amp;redirect=no" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Glen_S&amp;redirect=no" rel="nofollow">this</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Sango123" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Sango123" rel="nofollow">this</a>. They're both protected, so an admin will have to manually remove the tag. Then the category will be depopulated and the backlog will be cleared.

Obviously dropping them into that hole isn't going to do any good.

<p>Hi folks, apologies for the long post. The following is a chopped-down letter sent by a "Sam Vaknin" to some of his mailing lists... the general gist of it is that we can expect several POV edits to List of further reading on narcissism and narcissistic personality disorder, <a href="../../../n/a/r/Narcissism_%28psychology%29.html" title="Narcissism (psychology)">Narcissism (psychology)</a>, and <a href="../../../n/a/r/Narcissistic_personality_disorder.html" title="Narcissistic personality disorder">Narcissistic personality disorder</a>.

<p>... BUT</p>
<p>There is something you can do.</p>
<p>The Wikipedia entries for Narcissism (Psychology) and Narcissistic Personality Disorder are laughable and contain numerous inaccuracies, urban legends and utter nonsense.</p>
<p>Some parts of the entries are borrowed verbatim from my work (without attribution or credit, without my permission, and despite numerous protests and notices of copyright infringement issued by my publisher). But about 60% of the text require urgent revisions or outright deletion.</p>
<p>Anyone can edit the entries. All you have to do is click on the edit button in the upper navigation bar of the article. You can change the text, add external links, add references to literature, citations, and anything else you deem relevant. I encourage to give it a try.</p>

<p>What do you all think of the massive amounts of external links that are contained in a traditional Wikipedia fraternity or sorority article such as <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delta_Sigma_Pi_c1c8.html" title="Delta Sigma Pi">Delta Sigma Pi</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alpha_Kappa_Psi_1e6f.html" title="Alpha Kappa Psi">Alpha Kappa Psi</a>, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phi_Kappa_Psi_21e7.html" title="Phi Kappa Psi">Phi Kappa Psi</a>, or <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alpha_Epsilon_Pi_d6b7.html" title="Alpha Epsilon Pi">Alpha Epsilon Pi</a>?

<p>I believe that they are unacceptable under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> as they are collections of external links used to formulate a directory of chapters.

<dd>That is not what external links are for. EL should be limited to articles that are clearly justified. The national chapter for instance.

<dd>Absolutely, those are not valid. We used to have chapters writing breathless articles about themselves. They'd go to VfD (it was back then), and the advice was always, either put it in the college or just delete it. So now it seems that they're linking from their national frat/sororities. That's better, but it's still unacceptable. The chapters have plenty of linking-to from the national organizations' own web pages and their colleges' web pages. They don't need to be page rank boosting with us. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:35, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>I note that the (few) bluelinks in that template are redirects to the main article. I don't think we need articles on each individual fraternity chapter; for most of them there is little to say beyond what it says in the main frat article. I think this template should be removed. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 12:02, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>It <i>really</i> seems excessive still, to me. I know it's <i>harmless</i> to have a list of "all chapters of X," but it's only harmless until people treat it like the infamous (and a pox eternally be upon it) List of high schools and argue that the presence on the list means that there should be an article on every one. I.e. lists are sometimes used in circular logic to argue that there <i>must</i> be an article on each item on the list. Therefore, I still maintain that the national organization's web page is linked from the article on the national organization, and that should serve sufficiently for anyone seeking chapters. If the chapters don't achieve fame/standing outside of their campus communities, then they're not encyclopedic, in my view, in a list or an article. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:25, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think we should draw the line at a list of chapters without external links. It is encyclopedic to have a list of what colleges and universities have these organizations, because that is what the organization is all about. When it is a fraternity/sorority with a lot of chapters, a list page is appropriate. However, I don't think external links to the chapter websites or articles about the chapters is appropriate. --<a href="../../../r/o/g/User%7ERogerd_6b4d.html" title="User:Rogerd">rogerd</a> 17:48, 4 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree. It's entirely relevant to the existence and mission of the organization in question (fraternity) to be associated with colleges. How else would one illustrate this without using a list? The external links thing, I agree with, we can get rid of those. But a link to the Wikipedia articles about the colleges themselves is appropriate. --<b><a href="../../../h/t/m/User%7EHtmlism_e997.html" title="User:Htmlism"><span style="color:#3C81D6">Htmlism</span></a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../h/t/m/User_talk%7EHtmlism_89fe.html" title="User talk:Htmlism"><span style="color:#518DD6">talk</span></a> · <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Htmlism_56ec.html" title="Special:Contributions/Htmlism"><span style="color:#6799D6">contr</span></a>)</small> 23:01, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<p>I can understand the reasons for removing the links (though I don't agree), but there should be a list of chapters. These are the most important aspect of any national fraternity/sorority. Greek organizations measure their size by the number of chapters and initiates as well.</p>
<p>I'm opposed to the inclusion of a list because 1) WP:NOT an indiscriminate collection of information and 2) I believe that this would be <a href="../../../l/c/_/WP%7ELC_690f.html" title="WP:LC">listcruft</a>; having a list for the sake of a list. If the individual chapter in particular is important, it would go in the history section. Otherwise, people will probably find a list individual chapters on the fraternities' home page or something.

<li>I still think that the organizations themselves bear the burden of telling people where they are, not us. An encyclopedic account of the organization should discuss the organization, rather than list all of its accomplishments (placement of chapters), in my view. After all, we would not want to have a list of all the places where a business was located, nor a corporation, nor a non-profit philanthropic organization. Secondly, the lists can be used to justify the re-emergence of individual articles, and six months from now people may have forgotten the present consensus or simply be nodding off on the issue. I have nothing against these organizations, but I don't think a list of each chapter would be appropriate for anything, including Recording for the Blind or American Heart Association. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 05:01, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'd like to see that case very much as well, if it exists, but Thatcher131 and I may be the only two users other than the arbitrators who have read every word the ArbCom has written for the past several months, so if neither of us remembers such a case, either the person who remembered seeing such a decision may be mistaken and/or any such statement may be older and/or not prominent in the decision. I've also just checked the page that summarizes all ArbCom decisions and I don't see any reference to this topic, one way or the other, although that page generally is limited to discussing the remedies portion of each decision rather than the principles applied or findings found.

<dd>I've seen the statement on AN/I that there was such a case, but I've looked for the case twice now, unsuccessfully.

<dd>There have been cases where removing warnings was cited as part of a larger pattern of incivility and disruption. Perhaps that is what people are thinking of.

<p>From what I recall in an earlier dispute, if someone removes a warning from their talk page, it is acceptable to do so as it indicates that they have been warned before. However, when it comes to IP talk pages, I am not sure, but my opinion is that they should stay.&#160;:: <em><a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_Keigher_bca8.html" title="User:Colin Keigher">Colin Keigher</a></em> <font color="red"><b>(<a href="../../../c/o/l/User_talk%7EColin_Keigher_2a62.html" title="User talk:Colin Keigher">Talk</a>)</b></font> 23:58, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Definitely for IP talk pages they ought to stay so RC patrollers know that they have been warned before.

<dd>IP vs logged in user is irrelevant. The only purpose warnings serve is to help the user understand Wikipedia procedures.

<dd>I would probably support virtually any bot proposal from User:HighInBC after seeing the wonderful work being done by his AIV bot that debuted this week. On the other hand, I can think of at least one mild negative to this proposal, which is that the bot would have no way of distinguishing between valid warnings, borderline ones, and bogus ones. For example, users who revert vandalism will occasionally get a warning suspecting that their edits <i>are</i> vandalism, either because removing a large amount of bad text triggers a bot warning, or because of a near-edit-conflict triggering a revert to a bad version. Right now, when that happens, the affected user figures out what happened, adjusts any mistake that might have been made, deletes or archives the warning, and forgets about it. If the existence of the warning were recorded "on the user's permanent record", then a bad warning might be taken much more seriously. The number of bad-faith warnings designed just to impair an editor's reputation might also increase. I can also imagine that soon enough, someone would run this bot on the account of every RfA candidate, for example. I don't know whether these concerns outweigh the positive potential of this bot but food for thought.

<dd>True, the bot will make that very clear, and post links to the revision's that the warning was added and when the warning was removed, this should be enough for the reviewer to find context. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 01:10, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That alleviates some of the concern, although even so, it could still magnify the effect of trivial disputes and increase some people's desire to leave a "templated" warning rather than a tailor-made one, so it will count as an "official warning."

<li>Legal schmegal, it's a bad idea. The data you'd get would be worthless in at least two senses. First, as we have been amply arguing all over the place, removing a warning is not indicative of abuse or not of abuse. <i>It depends.</i> Second, all you'd find out is that an action occurred, and not <i>by whom.</i> Additionally, -bots are stupid. They can't tell friend from foe, nor can they tell when a person is cleaning out a nest of [disreputable group here] and committing online sepuku. Finally, if such a bot <i>were</i> to be run, I know that I'd be happy to issue myself as many warnings as I could, just for grins. That would dilute the data considerably, of course, but that would be the point. Finally, there is simply no <i>need</i> for the thing. The "history" tab is available to us all. We don't need another area where -bots enable people to ignore subtlety and nuance and context. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 04:26, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>First, while removing warning may not be a problem, finding removed warnings can help you determine if it is a problem or not. Secondly, the tool will know who made the change and refer me to the diff where it was added, and removed. It is not supposed to provide a single answer but a series of links to help investigation.

<p>I do think we need to make a distinction between regular users and blatant IP vandals. Warnings to regular users are usually about content disputes, and escalating the situation by edit warring over warnings never helps. IP vandals shouldn't get the same consideration.

<dd>Unless you know that the IP is static, you can't assume that the remover is the vandal.

<p>There is no arbitration ruling on warnings. Obviously if someone removes a warning from his own talk page it can be assumed that he has noticed it. Which is the purpose of the warning. If you want to make a permanent notice about continued problems with an editor, and you've reached this point, an RfC is the thing to do. Not squabbling about whether or not you are entitled to maintain a permanent record of your displeasure on his talk page. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 01:26, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What if someone, say a different IP user, removes the warning on another IP user's talk page? I have seen this happen before. I have, up to today, considered such behavior vandalism.

<p>Why don't vandal fighters use page histories? If I suspect there might be anything misleading about a page, I go straight to the page history, and if I uncover lots of removals, I then investigate further. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 02:03, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Personally, if I received a warning I wanted to remove, I would leave links behind on the talk page, pointing at the diff that added it, and the diff that removed it. Kind of like archiving to page history, rather than archiving to a visible archive. Archiving to page history also has the advantage of the links not showing up in "what links here" or in Google searches, and the page not being categorised, but you can still pull out a view of what the page looked like if you want to. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 02:07, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The history tab is available for all, and removal is simply an act without value. If I put a warning on an IP, then realized that it was AOL and removed it, there would be a warning removal that was a correction. If a new user goes around insisting that the Trojans attacked Athens in <i>The Iliad</i> and I revert him, I darn sure better be able to remove a warning, template, or box he puts on my talk page. These "warnings" are brainless by themselves: they're templates, and therefore they should only be used in the first place when you think that the account being communicated with is anonymous and unresponsive. If it's a user, an actual editor who is here most days, who talks and goes back to things, then a damn template does no damn good. If it's a user, you <i>owe</i> him or her an actual <i>attempt to communicate.</i> We began using these blasted templates merely for the hit and run vandals and substub scribblers, not for any form of resolution. Personally, I think that all long time contributors should instantly remove <i>any</i> template warning and demand, instead, an actual explanation with attendant <i>listening.</i> <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 04:32, 7 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The problem with this bot is that it encourages those users who think that the best way to resolve a dispute is attacking people who disagree with them. If a warning template becomes part of a permanent record against someone (which this implies) that's an incentive to give warning templates to people in dispute against you, so that you can later argue that said person has a history of being disruptive. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 12:35, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>...each other. It seems to me that templates of all sorts do not require, at present, consensus or even agreement before they are placed. Therefore, anyone can put any template any place. Because there is no reasoning necessary for putting a "clean this up" tag or a "this should be merged" or "vandal" tag, we end up with arguments <i>after the placement</i> instead of before. Because there is no necessary reasoning ahead of time, we can't have any idea whether the placement is apt or not. <b>If</b> we could be sure that every warning template of any sort were placed on the basis of solid agreement, <b>then</b> we could see the removal of a warning as a bad act. Also, we could then counsel the person so tagged to accept the template/tag meekly. However, when anyone can put any tag on anything without demonstrating advanced reasoning, there is no particular <i>inherent</i> value to it. All it means at present is, "One person disliked or wanted to highlight something." That's why the answer to all of the argument is, I'm afraid, "it depends." <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:06, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

Though I consider RFA a suboptimal tool for addressing this issue, I am prepared to accept that some members of this community will recognize nothing less. However, I would like to renew my general request that ProtectionBot be allowed to continuing running on my account during the RFA. Should the dozens of support votes at <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_Requests_for_approval_ProtectionBot_be77.html" title="Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval/ProtectionBot">BRFA</a> somehow vanish, I will gladly shut it down, but given the nature of the issue being addressed I feel the delay will unnecessarily expose Wikipedia to additional vandalism merely for the sake of process. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 09:49, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I symphatise with your project, but as a matter of policy, I'd venture the opinion that under the current structure of <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a>, <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#I6" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD#I6</a> or <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#I7" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD#I7</a> override <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#G12" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD#G12</a> in cases where either could be applied. This is because <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#I6" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD#I6</a> and <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#I7" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD#I7</a>, which deal with images only, are the more specific rules. In other words, if <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#G12" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD#G12</a> could be applied in cases where the criteria of <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#I6" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD#I6</a> and <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#I7" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD#I7</a> are met, these latter criteria would be superfluous and would not need to be enumerated at all. Yet they are still on the books, and so must have some meaning. That's why I think that you should delete screenshots per <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#I6" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD#I6</a> if they are tagged as fair use but miss a rationale, or per <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#I7" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD#I7</a> if they are obviously falsely tagged as GFDL. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 22:07, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>You flagged my username (Merkinmuffly) as inappropriate. I read the article on inappropriate usernames and I agree that this name could fall under that heading. However my intention was not to reference the slang terms but rather the character of Merkin Muffley from the film Dr. Strangelove. Which, admittedly, itself refers to the slang terms. Anyway, I'm fond the of name (and the film) and it's served me well as a username for several sites, since it seems rarely to be taken. I'm wondering if you're personally offended by it or just noticed it as part of some kind of automatic flagging. If so, is there any chance we can wait to see if someone is genuinely offended by it before we force the name change? For what it's worth, in my experience, the people who know what merkin means usually know who "Merkin Muffley" is, too.Merkinmuffly 01:07, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Nearly Headless Nick, what do you think we should do about this? As he refuses to respond to any messages on his talk page, on the articles talk page or elsewhere, I believe that dispute resolution isn't a useful option. -- <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarl_Meier_d697.html" title="User:Karl Meier">Karl Meier</a> 11:46, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think it's any big deal, but the issue was raised that revising the CFD proposal as I did this afternoon perhaps ought be cause for restarting the discussion. Trouble is I don't know that I have any authority to unilaterally say delete it and start a discussion under the new modified proposal which effectively adds one category leaving the subject cat alone save for clarification editting.<br />
<br />
That would be fine except since posting, a half-a dozen others have agreed with my original (less informed) thinking.<br />
<br />
OTOH, we're sort of switching horses mid-stream if left alone. Either way, unless there is a procedural precedent to close the current discussion, someone could get their nose out of joint. Hence the alert and question on AN. If that's not clear on either <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a> or my talk, I don't know how to make the point better. Examining the linked CFD should clarify it upon inspection. I guess I'll post this to AN as well.

<br />
Two editors have suggested the current section be closed and restarted for this date, with my revised proposal of this afternoon. (<a href="../../../f/a/b/User_talk%7EFabartus_c63e.html#Thanks_for_your_notification." title="User talk:Fabartus">Here on My talk</a> and on that CFD discussion -- comments by <a href="../../../j/c/3/User%7EJc37_cfd0.html" title="User:Jc37">User:Jc37</a>)<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, there was a strong current in accord with my original suggestion, which for consistency in category naming practices, now seems to need adjusted, in effect withdrawing my own nomination, which I did via an edit a while back. The contention is that the new section is now too complicated, this violates procedure, or both. Sigh.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Assuming you all can reach a consensus on how to handle this then... Per the (above) suggestion at <a href="../../../f/a/b/User_talk%7EFabartus_c63e.html#Thanks_for_your_notification." title="User talk:Fabartus">Fabartus#Thanks_for_your_notification.</a> and that made recently on the section bottom <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_discussion_Log_2007_January_4_5c8e.html#Category:Categories_for_deletion" title="Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2007 January 4">Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2007_January_4#Category:Categories_for_deletion</a> can we get an appropriate close out, link to the <b>revised and re-dated</b> discussion per this suggestion and that left on that CFD talk, or other such measures that are appropriate to keep the admin tracking straight.<br />
<br />
Or do we let this original proposal ride, etcetera, including my revised proposal or would it be best to leave both proposals as necessary and let the spam notification have time to work to see if others change their vote or comment. (Waiting with bated breath on your collective wisdom! &lt;g&gt;)<br />
<br />
A 'Good Courtesy Complication': Since I contacted all parties who had signed the text one way or the other, if the current discussion section is closed, please leave a link to the new section and page dated today, etc.<br />
<br />
As the one suggestion points out, changing the proposal due to my brain fart in line with the better proposal seems in order... as does simplifying it for the novice. On the other hand, this tangles the rules up more than a little. Suggestions and resolution please. Whomever closes this out, there is also a <span style="font-family:monospace;">{{<a href="../../../h/e/l/Template%7EHelpme_09e4.html" title="Template:Helpme">helpme</a>}}</span> on that talk page section, as speed seems to be a good idea.

<p>Something odd happened last night and I'm trying to figure out if I hit a bug, found odd but expected behavior, or if I was just brain dead. I noticed that the very first edit for Douglas Bradford Oliver (<span class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDouglas_Bradford_Oliver_0941.html" title="User talk:Douglas Bradford Oliver">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Douglas_Bradford_Oliver_b7f8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Douglas Bradford Oliver"><span title="Contributions: Douglas Bradford Oliver">contribs</span></a> • <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Log/move?user=Douglas+Bradford+Oliver" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Log/move?user=Douglas+Bradford+Oliver" rel="nofollow"><span title="Page moves: Douglas Bradford Oliver"><font color="#002BB8">page&#160;moves</font></span></a> • <a href="../../../b/l/o/Special%7EBlockip_Douglas_Bradford_Oliver_f244.html" title="Special:Blockip/Douglas Bradford Oliver"><span title="Block User:Douglas Bradford Oliver">block&#160;user</span></a> • <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_block_4a41.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_block_4a41.html" rel="nofollow"><span title="Blocklog: Douglas Bradford Oliver"><font color="#002BB8">block&#160;log</font></span></a></span>) had unacceptable material in the edit summary. The page had a total of four edits so it seemed pretty straight forward to delete the page and restore just the last three edits. After I did this, I went back in and was surprised to find all of the edit summaries still in place. After deleting the page again I restored just the last edit. Still, four edit summaries shown, but I couldn't see the details in the edits. This would be OK accept that the problem information was in the edit summary itself. At that point I found out that the user had been indef-blocked for a vandalism spree so I just deleted the page and called it done.</p>
<p>Being that I don't want to expirement with creating, editing, and deleting pages to recreate the behavior, can someone plesae tell me if this is normal? If it is normal, how do we remove edit summaries that have issues?

<p>Hi, not sure where to take this.

What happened was that somebody overwrote the original "victory sign" image on Commons with a headshot. This was reverted after a few days, but we still have the headshot on the page (even though you get the correct image when you click on it). I assumed this was some weird caching thing that would go away eventually but it's been this way since October. Can the image be regenerated somehow? —<a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChowbok_9a99.html" title="User:Chowbok"><span style="background:black; color:white; font-weight: bold;">Chowbok</span></a> <a href="../../../c/h/o/User_talk%7EChowbok_a1df.html" title="User talk:Chowbok"><span style="color:black;">☠</span></a> 21:39, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I reviewed the edits in question and while the edit summaries get ugly, this looks more like a user coming to us, doing the right thing, correcting a factual inaccuracy, and getting stomped at by "Lakes", a user who seems to believe he has some ownership of professional wrestling-related topics.</p>
<p>The edit made by 129.7.35.194 was in fact the more factually accurate; a DDT maneuver is the result whenever the head is "immobilised" (in a head, face, or chin lock) prior to the action of driving the opponent to the canvas. Therefore, the "Double Underhook Facebuster", while under the name Facebuster, is really a DDT maneuver.</p>
<p>Lakes didn't pay any attention to the edits and called this "vandalism", whereupon a number of administrators decided to hold a beatdown contest to see who could attack the anonymous IP more.</p>
<p>If I have to, I'll take this to wikien-l and Jimbo. Lakes and the administrators in question were clearly in the wrong to behave as they did here. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.178.235.28_01fa.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.178.235.28">72.178.235.28</a> (<a href="../../../7/2/2E/User_talk%7E72.178.235.28.html" title="User talk:72.178.235.28">talk</a>) 01:28, 10 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>Well i have looked at your edits and the fact is that though your argument to move the section has ground it was placed there because in wrestling terminology the move is considered a facebuster. These overlaps occasionally happen and in the case of this move depending on how well it is performed (as in if the head stays clinched inbetween the legs or comes loose) places it under two different terms... the fact of the matter is the move is best known as a facebuster and every istance of its use is linked there. There is no just reason to move it to DDT esspecially as another move known as a double underhook DDT already exists. Please dont take offence it just isnt a viable move --- <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulley_2f3a.html" title="User:Paulley">Paulley</a> 01:45, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A content dispute, no? Not vandalism. Thus, it falls under 3RR. Hbdragon88 01:46, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Right, a content dispute, but multiple administrators insisted on calling it vandalism anyways, and we still have people like Paulley trying to make wikipedia less than accurate which is vandalism.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that the category has been wrongly applied in at least some cases, but the aggression and single-mindedness with which this user is removing all trace of it suggests to me a political motive.

<p>No political motivation in the removal of this category applied to people erroneously either then or now, as previously my actions were carried out after discussion on French talk pages and when the category was tagged for speedy renaming, not deletion. The way this category was/is applied to everyone from the south of France, regardless of ethnicity or linguistic abilities could have been politically motivated. I have left it on people from <a href="../../../l/a/n/Languedoc-Roussillon_c4f6.html" title="Languedoc-Roussillon">Languedoc-Roussillon</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midi-Pyr%C3%A9n%C3%A9es_dbb6.html" title="Midi-Pyrénées">Midi-Pyrénées</a>, esp. from before the mass migration of people. However, as I was under the impression that information on wikipedia had to be verifiable, the removal should be done unless it can be verified that these people are occitan. An example of how this category was misused is on <a href="../../../o/l/i/Olinde_Rodrigues_3d84.html" title="Olinde Rodrigues">Olinde Rodrigues</a>, a Spanish Jewish banker, not an occitan. Unless the facts can be verified, one should err on the cautious, especially with living people. On another note, what <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> has failed to purposely mention (for whatever reason is anyones guess), is that I have been filling up the appropiate sub-categories with verified occitan people. --<a href="../../../g/r/c/User%7EGrcampbell_a0e7.html" title="User:Grcampbell">Bob</a> 16:29, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I didn't deliberately fail to mention it; I didn't know. The way that categories work is that it's only possible to monitor their contents for articles on one's watchlist.

Actually, I'm still not convinced. <a href="../../../g/r/c/User%7EGrcampbell_a0e7.html" title="User:Grcampbell">User:Grcampbell</a>'s depopulation of the category is too single-minded for me to be comfortable. Although he usually doesn't explain his removal of the category (merely saying that it's inappropriate), he occasionally lets slip that it's because there's no evidence that the person in question spoke Occitan. In other words, he's operating from the position that Occitan people are only those who speak the language. I take that to be a personal view, doubtless held by many others, probably a majority view, but not uncontroversial, and not to be simply assumed when taking unilateral decisions about the appropriateness of categories.</p>
<p>Few people here are interested in the matter, and so I doubt that anything will be done (I'm certainly not going to go into this without support; his aggressive response last time makes it clear that it would be an unpleasant waste of time), but I'll still put myself on record as being worried by his actions. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 09:48, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yet again you assume bad faith.

Due to mass migration during the 17th/18th/19th centuries, as well as the French Revolution/World Wars the precise ancestry of the people in question is unstated on wikipedia. That is, of course, if we are operating under the verifiability clause of wikipedia. What do you think? Verifiability or POV? Personally, I would opt for the former, especially on living people articles, if you don't like this <i>modus operandi</i>, I guess you should speak to Jimbo. --<a href="../../../g/r/c/User%7EGrcampbell_a0e7.html" title="User:Grcampbell">Bob</a> 17:29, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Okay, let's review this because I have had to fix this no less than three times in the past week.</p>

<dd>I'm still not sure I understand what he means. I don't think ProtectionBot (I'm assuming that that is the bot mentioned?) is relevant to the discussion here: if it passes and runs, then the bot would take care of all of this, except for the deletion of the image (it would tag the image for speedy deletion instead.) However, for right now, while we don't have a bot, administrators need to pay careful attention to images on the Main Page and used from Wikimedia Commons. Protecting the image description page here, without protection on Commons, will not suffice; the image must be uploaded locally and then protected.

<li>For a protection to work, we need the image uploaded here. We can't protect a non-existing image and if we don't upload it here, someone else can upload an image with the same name and overwrite the commons one.

<p>This user appears to have a history of contentious editing, but I noticed one thing recently that make me suspect that he is the sockpuppet of an indef blocked user.</p>
<p>He added a link to a deleted article, Saintsteven, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chaos_International_%28magazine%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=98853035" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chaos_International_%28magazine%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=98853035" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>. As it was a red link I was curious and checked the deletion log and found the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Saintstephen" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Saintstephen" rel="nofollow">AfD</a>, where it appears the article was created by the subject Quadmona (<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuadmona_2ca4.html" title="User talk:Quadmona">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Quadmona_794a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Quadmona">contribs</a>), who ended up getting indef blocked for repeated vandalism. I know it's not much to go on and probably doesn't merit blocking at this time, but it might be a good idea if someone were to keep an eye on this user.

<p>I am bringing this up here because there was some resistance when I first mentioned the idea <a href="#ArbCom_ruling_on_talk_page_removals.3F" title="">See "ArbCom ruling on talk page removals"</a>. This is a bot that will search through each revision of a talk page history and report when it finds certain patterns. I currently have 213 user page templates programed in as patterns.</p>
<p>The bot will report the name of the pattern found(ie: Template:3RR), and the date/time of each occurrence of it being removed or added and a diff to that occurrence.</p>
<p>The report will emphasize that the existence of a warning does not mean an infraction necessarily occurred. It will urge the reader to examine the context of the warning and will provide diffs to aid in that effort. I am posting here to find a clear consensus before I proceed to make a bot approval request.</p>
<p>I have not chosen the form of the final report yet. There are several option from my point of view:</p>
<ol>
<li>A user could place a tag such as {{User:HBC Searchbot/scan|HighInBC}} on a blank page and the bot would replace it with a report on HighInBC.</li>
<li>A user could place a tag such as {{User:HBC Searchbot/scan|HighInBC}} on their own userpage, my bot would remove the tag and e-mail the report the user.</li>
<li>The bot could run on a separate server outside of the Wikipedia interface. I can provide this server not problem.</li>
</ol>
<p>What do people think of this bot, and how should I proceed? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 23:10, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I must say I have given <i>first</i> warnings to users before only to later find they were well aware of these rules, having seen and removed a warning. Anyone using this bot will still have to present diffs to evidence when making an argument, and if those diffs are blindly taken out of context, that will be evident.

<dd>Perhaps it could have a feature to ignore warnings by indef-banned users. I can't tell you how many times I've been warned by a malicious user. That being said, I do think it's helpful: community consensus has agreed that users can remove warnings mostly because anybody can go through the page history. This bot will simply do that manually. I don't see a problem with that - I even have some warnings on my own history (outside the vandalous ones) that I wouldn't mind if someone saw. -<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatstuart_7fbf.html" title="User:Patstuart">Patstuart</a><sup><a href="../../../p/a/t/User_talk%7EPatstuart_e8fd.html" title="User talk:Patstuart">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Patstuart_a3f0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Patstuart">edits</a></sup> 23:50, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>At the moment, I'd like to just get some feedback and ideas. I'm unfortunately involved in what has been a rather long running situation.</p>
<p>It started, innocently enough, when I came upon an article which I thought would be interesting to clean up. Over the past year it has had various clean-up tags, including that it was too much like a list. So with my enjoyment to organize, I thought I would dive in and do a ReOrg of the page, and hopefully broaden it into an article instead of merely lists.</p>
<p>It "almost" was going smoothly, until I moved a few of the references to the disambiguation page of the same name, which brought other wikipedians who disagreed with several changes.</p>
<p>A lengthy discussion of whether wiktionary links should be on a page, whether real-life or fictional should have more prevalence (I felt both equally, either in the same article or in separate articles), and on, and on. A large amount of information was split (before I arrived to the page) to a list already, and I split more to a related page.</p>
<p>The trouble is that those who would dispute a change never were willing to offer references for such arguement, and later admitted that they weren't interested in doing so far various reasons.</p>
<p>And it's continued on and on.</p>
<p>Much of the discussion has been about semantics, but lately, since I've attempted several times at compromising, I performed various page creations, splits, and mergers, at the request of others. The discussion has devolved into where the redirects should point to, and what names of redirects are more accurate, and where should the original page history reside.</p>
<p>So now we come to my Request for advice. You'll note I haven't mentioned any persons, nor the pages involved. I would like some general advice for such situations.</p>
<p>What should I do?</p>
<p>I feel like I'm being attacked consistantly for trying to uphold what I presume are correct policies and guidelines and such, by those who would seem to not know understand such policies.</p>
<p>Of course, it is entirely possible that I'm the one misunderstanding as well. (Sigh @ "the right version".)</p>
<p>On one hand I would like to just "walk away", from the situation, but on the other, this should be resolved "correctly" due to possible GDFL concerns.</p>
<p>I think the greatest problem so far is the lack of input from "outside" opinion.</p>
<p>So this is what I am asking now. (To quote Jonny 5: "need input".)</p>
<p>I am <i>very</i> hesitant to raise this to the next level (mediation or arbitration), because, honestly, I think it would reflect rather badly on those who have been involved, since I honestly think that their only real mistake besides what some might call rather aggressive "POV pushing", is a misunderstanding of policies or even how some features of Wikipedia work. Though it's becoming tiresome, I'll discount their various attacks on me at this point, if it only should bring some sort of resolution.</p>
<p>So anyway, let me bring my rambling request to a close:</p>
<p>What should I do now? - <a href="../../../j/c/3/User%7EJc37_cfd0.html" title="User:Jc37">jc37</a> 04:26, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was involved, but after one of the participants objected to the way I was trying to handle it (I was initially approached on my talk page by jc37 to comment on the issues), I've withdrawn. There is a half-hearted attempt to list the pages at <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_Analysis_of_the_page_history_of_Wikipedia_Magic_pages_9b61.html" title="User:Carcharoth/Analysis of the page history of Wikipedia Magic pages">User:Carcharoth/Analysis of the page history of Wikipedia Magic pages</a>, and I'm about to attempt to trace the edit history of a sample piece of text to demonstrate the issues. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 12:44, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I intentionally didn't post where and what and who. (Anyone who understands reading edit contributions could have found out the info if interested.) I wasn't asking about comment for the specific problems (else I would have posted on <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a>), though of course such comment is always welcome, and perhaps is just what the situations needs...</p>
<p>However, what I was hoping for was for others to offer advice on "such a situation". Ask questions for clarification, etc. That is (I presume) one of the functions of the admin noticeboard (this page)? I think in any situation, it's can be nice to get advice from others.</p>
<p>For the specific incident, I left a note on <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">User:Essjay</a>'s <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay">talk page</a>, which I suppose I could cross post to <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a>. But as I mentioned above, I was/am hesitant to go higher in the dispute resolution route, because I don't think it will reflect well on the others involved. (And perhaps I should apologise to Carcharoth for including him. He shouldn't have been subject to such as he was. Though I <i>do</i> thank him for his assitance thus far&#160;: )</p>
<p>Anyway, the request still stands... What do you (plural) think I should do now? - <a href="../../../j/c/3/User%7EJc37_cfd0.html" title="User:Jc37">jc37</a> 01:25, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah, I understand - and I (and others) would like to help. But I think the problem is that the answer to all of that is "it depends." It depends on the context, the other people involved, the specific things that have been said, etc. I don't think that, without knowing more, I can give you advice on what to do when you just generally feel attacked and think other people are wrong on an issue, but can't get them to listen to you. (Other than to take a deep breath, relax, and remember that it's just an online encyclopedia - and if a page ends up "wrong," there probably aren't any GDFL issues you need to worry about.) --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOther</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheOtherBob_cb4a.html" title="User talk:TheOtherBob">Bob</a> 01:43, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're right. (I've even given a similar response, saying "it depends", myself&#160;: )</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And I have to admit, it felt kinda odd reading "...just generally feel attacked and think other people are wrong on an issue, but can't get them to listen to you." Depending on the context, it could mean that the person in question (me in this case) is "POV pushing", or it could mean that those whom he's discussing with are, or both. So I guess it <i>is</i> necessary to give specific instances. I have to admit, after almost a year of discussions, this whole thing is really starting to feel wearisome.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well for now, since I still would rather not (yet) elevate/escalate/whatever this. Let me ask <i>this</i> way. Would anyone willing please read over <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_wizards_in_fantasy_4f0d.html" title="Talk:List of wizards in fantasy">Talk:List of wizards in fantasy</a>, and let me know if in some way I <i>have</i> been <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">uncivil</a>, or whatever else I'm being accused of? From my perspective, I <i>think</i> I haven't been, but I would welcome more opinions. (I'm also somewhat concerned about the copy/paste/merge/split/etc issues, which may or may not be GDFL concerns, but I suppose we can wait on that for now.) Note that to understand some of the discussion, you may need to go through the edit history of that page and of <a href="../../../w/i/z/Wizard.html" title="Wizard">Wizard</a>, comparing times to edits. (I don't know if or how "UTC" may confuse this.) Basically a sort of talkpage-specific <a href="../../../e/r/_/WP%7EER_5c78.html" title="WP:ER">Editor review</a>. I don't suggest that you add to the discussion there (though obviously anyone is welcome to) as of yet, if because I don't wish others to be on the receiving end of the vitriol that Carcharoth unfortunately received. I believe in the idea of "many eyes", and I think that probably this has just been a situation where there haven't been enough "eyes".</dd>

<dd>Well, wow. I saw the lower discussion on the talk page, but hadn't noticed that one. From where I sit, it (commentary about <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>) seems to be congruent to the relationship of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and <a href="../../../a/a/g/WP%7EAAGF_5ca1.html" title="WP:AAGF">WP:AAGF</a>...

<dd>Which raises the general question of where such things can be discussed. They were talking on a user talk page, maybe not realising that those pages, like all Wikipedia pages, are publically viewable. Discussion shouldn't be stifled, but equally discussing someone behind their backs (like they were doing, and like I am doing here) feels wrong as well. How does this all tie in with <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">WP:DR</a>? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 15:43, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, initially I intended that this discussion just be advice to me as to what to do next. I don't think that that was/is behind anyone's backs. Nor do I think that posting on this noticeboard to be that either. However, since this may have gone a bit beyond my initial intention, perhaps the discussion should move? Especially considering <a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGoldfritha_0e1f.html#Wizard_.28fantasy.29" title="User talk:Goldfritha">User talk:Goldfritha#Wizard (fantasy)</a> (as noted by Carcharoth, above); and now I find <a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInShaneee_cd66.html#User_ignoring_policy" title="User talk:InShaneee">this</a>, and noting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AInShaneee&amp;diff=98692356&amp;oldid=98682637" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AInShaneee&amp;diff=98692356&amp;oldid=98682637" rel="nofollow">the orginal header to the post</a>. I'm guessing that the user selected this admin due to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=72685976" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=72685976" rel="nofollow">this</a>, which follows up on the discussion in which they wish for a "sympathetic admin". (I honestly don't know if <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">User:InShaneee</a> would or would not be. I'm not certain if I've ever seen the username before?) I also am concerned since there are several flat-out untruths in the request. I think I'm past the <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">presuming good faith</a> question of "What should I do now?" On top of all the rest, misrepresenting the truth in order to push a personal agenda is enough, I think. My question now is: where to next? to <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a>? to <a href="../../../3/o/_/WP%7E3O_1830.html" title="WP:3O">WP:3O</a> as initially suggested by <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">User:Essjay</a>? to Mediation (per <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">WP:DR</a>)? or just straight to arbitration? When I mentioned this discussion to him, Essjay suggested that I wait some here to see what you all said first, so I think I'll do that for now. - <a href="../../../j/c/3/User%7EJc37_cfd0.html" title="User:Jc37">jc37</a> 13:48, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just a general suggestion as to how this might be progressed: Both sides should put together, in a neutral venue (that is, away from the contentious talk pages) a brief summary of (a) what they consider the major problems with the current situation are, and (b) how they think these problems should be resolved, without (at that stage) ventilating their critisisms of their opponent's actions. This should, at least, enable a neutral observer to form an opinion without having to wade through the current mass of argument. <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 07:52, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>On one hand I have no problem with that (It's kinda what I've tried to do, but we keep getting <a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?DontLookAtTheFinger" class="extiw" title="meatball:DontLookAtTheFinger">sidetracked</a>.) My only question would be "where".</dd>
<dd>On the other hand, to explain, might require explaining past events (likely lengthily). I think a summary of "how we got here", might be necessary to figure out "what do we do now". (Which is kinda why my initial request at the top of this thread, while stream-of-consciousness, wasn't the "50 words or less"...) But if that isn't a concern then, I suppose "off we go". Does anyone else have any ideas as well? At this point, supplementary suggestions are welcome&#160;: ) - <a href="../../../j/c/3/User%7EJc37_cfd0.html" title="User:Jc37">jc37</a> 08:18, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Take it to <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">RFC</a> if you need a neutral venue, setting up a subpage of the appropriate talk page to summarise either side, and linking to that from RFC.

<p>Our friends the developers have implemented a <a href="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3706" class="external text" title="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3706" rel="nofollow">new feature</a> which allows an account to be given a permission indicating that they should not be subject to blocks on their IP address. Currently this new permission is set for... us. All sysops are now immune to IP blocks. If you use the same IP/range as a vandal the IP can now be blocked for all users... except you. This sort of capability might also be useful in cases where a few legitimate users have the same IP as alot of vandals (schools come to mind). Currently, so far as I know, there is no interface for setting / removing the permission, but I expect that's being explored. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 11:36, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>It's a good feature for admins. I don't think it's a good idea to hand it out to other people. It would just become another form of the repeatedly rejected "Trusted User" proposal. If we ever do decide to create a trusted user group, it would be good to give it this permission, but I doubt that will happen any time soon. --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> 13:35, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would hope you are wrong about this, and that this permission is opened widely in the near future.

<p>I and many other trusted users have no desire to use admin tools; but one step at a time Wikipedia is creating admins as a special class not to be blocked <i>even</i> if they do things nonadmins would be blocked for. The constant drumbeat that "admin" = "trusted user" is problematic. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 14:37, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please (re-)read the details. This change has <i>nothing</i> to do with a block on an admin's registered account. Rather, if an <i>IP address</i> is blocked, an admin can continue to use that IP address - for example, at a school. This change has <i>nothing</i> to do with privileges; it's about keeping a scarce resource (admin time) from being inadvertently reduced. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Broughton_26e4.html" title="User talk:John Broughton">Talk</a> 14:44, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>See what I mean? "scarce resource (admin time)". What about scarce resource (non-admin time)? Double-standard. Our not having admin tools does not make our time worth less. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 16:57, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>WAS, that's unjustified. Prior to this change IP blocks impacted everyone using that IP. A way to prevent that was developed. The developers could not set this prevention code for <i>everyone</i> because that would have given vandals free reign. They also had not yet built an interface to set it on one user at a time... or determined who should have <i>access</i> to such an interface. So they set it for admins on the assumption that there are no admin vandals. Nothing has been taken away from non admins. Indeed, we are discussing how this capability can safely be rolled out to <i>help</i> non-admins. It is not a 'double standard' to recognize the <b>fact</b> that vandals don't remain admins while the collection of non-admin accounts contains some users who <i>are</i> vandals... that's a single standard. This capability will be given to 'non-vandals who need to get around IP blocks'. That standard applies to all admins. It also applies to many individual users, and will be so used when the capability to set it on a case by case basis has been built.

<dd>For instance, admins regularly get blocked as a result of AOL blocks, but I thought this problem was solved with the AO-only block? This flag is still useful, of course, for blocks when admins forget to set the AO flag, but I don't think that's a common mistake nowadays. Nonetheless, a useful feature! --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 15:37, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah, this is a bit redundant with 'anonymous only' blocks.

<dd>Yes, I imagine this was designed with the idea that you apply it to someone's account if an IP block is affecting them. It's not a "trusted user" thing, because trusted users that are on static IP addresses will never get this assigned to them... they don't need it.

<dd>"Trusted use" does not equal "user on static IP address". Take it as a rule of thumb that every time an admin is mistakenly blocked at least one trusted content contributing user is block and thus discouraged and content is lost and sometimes a user is lost. And to formalize this insult by automagically making admins immune is just one more difference in editing experience causing a difference in perceptions and a divide in the community. Belittling the mistaken blocking of trusted non-admins is a mistake. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 16:57, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Clarification: does the new flag mean that they <i>cannot</i> be IP/address-blocked, but that account-blocking works as usual? In which case, what are the criteria that will be applied, for non-admins who would benefit from this, to be flagged like this, in order not to be affected by IP/range blocks? That sounds like a policy-type decision. Is there any clear communal feeling about the concept? Alternatively, is there any robust reason why non-admins in good standing should as a blanket rule <i>not</i> be allowed to request this regardless? <a href="../../../f/t/2/User%7EFT2_b822.html" title="User:FT2">FT2</a> <sup><span style="font-style:italic">(<a href="../../../f/t/2/User_talk%7EFT2_8c21.html" title="User talk:FT2">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_FT2_cd1f.html" title="Special:Emailuser/FT2">email</a>)</span></sup> 01:29, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I have to admit the case against Husnock is pretty strong but there also really does appear to be a number of shared ip addresses and possibly public computer labs where these messages are coming from, giving rise to the unrefutable issue that these could indeed be separate people. Discussions about their motivations is moot, there is little way to know why anyone surfs a particular webpage. There is starting to grow concern that all of these ip addresses are being labeled as either being Husnock himself or being persons manipulated by Husnock. One person even went so far as to say he would assume all posts from the address were Husnock unless the people contacted him to say they weren't. This appears to have greatly upset one relatively new user who posted to the page and then was called a sockpuppet of Husnock without much basis. Maybe people just need to be kindler and gentler and not jump to conclusions. Husnock's own webpage says he is gone from the site and he hasn't edited in weeks. The main purpose of this message to make sure these ip ranges don't get blocked as they are used by dozens of people.

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Basic summary: There are 1300 character (16 line) sigs out there, and we need to put a stop to it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>A hard limit of <s>200</s> 250 characters has been suggested by numerous people. (Even the most colorful sigs (such as from <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> and <i><b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Transhumanist_1191.html" title="User:The Transhumanist"><font color="purple">Th<font color="blue">e Tra<font color="#9ACD32">nshu<font color="orange">man<font color="red">ist</font> &#160;&#160;</font></font></font></font></a></b></i>) are less than 200 characters.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>A more drastic solution suggested by <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a> in the VPr thread and agreed to by a few so far, is to disable raw sigs entirely, but offer the option to add a "user talk" link after one's username in the default sig. E.g. ~~~ creates either <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUsername_4f9c.html" title="User:Username">Username</a> OR <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUsername_4f9c.html" title="User:Username">Username</a> · <a href="../../../u/s/e/User_talk%7EUsername_2815.html" title="User talk:Username">talk</a></dd>

<dd>This is all quickly becoming a perennial proposal, and should probably get centralized somewhere soon?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Disclosure: I'm quite strongly opposed to the use of colored/complex sigs, and tend to treat them as a possible warning sign of patience being required with their owner…&lt;/mini-rant&gt;<small>(and of course I don't mean <i>you</i>! ...&#160;;-P</small> —<a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuiddity_6493.html" title="User:Quiddity">Quiddity</a> 22:14, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'd just like to point out that a purely technical approach is not the solution, because people can easily use JavaScript injection to continue using a signature of arbitrary length. You'd think this would be rare, but it's not. Awhile back one of the Esperanzians figured it out in bookmarklet form and it spread through that community. I echo support for a policy-focused solution that prohibits signatures that are greater than a certain length. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 00:04, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Me too, but there isn't any reason not o restrict it technically too. My proposal is for 250 chars, as I feel it will filter out most of the monstrosities, while still allowing for a case-by-case evaluation of the remaining. We must also have objective, rather than subjective criteria in eg. color combinations (there have to be specific color-charts for reference re "people with vision problems"). Finally, I feel that this discussion should be concentrated in ONE place (rather than <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28proposals%29_6eab.html#Reduce_the_size_limit_for_sigs.3F" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (proposals)">1</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28technical%29_e812.html#Signature_length" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (technical)">2</a>,<a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia_talk%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_9188.html#Propose_banning_non-standard_.2F_raw_signatures." title="Wikipedia talk:Sign your posts on talk pages">3</a> persistently spammed campaigns, plus my MfDd subpage where people are beating a dead horse coz I haven't had a new client since last October).

<p>Interesting discussion. Is there a "convenient" number to suggest for programming reasons (such as 255/6), or is that irrelevant these days? Also, I don't think that [talk] should be able to be enabled in preferences. It pretty much does away with the idea that a userpage is the "frontpage" for a user. (Everyone will click "talk" first.) Though I wonder what would be lost if we did away with userpages and had only user talk pages... - <a href="../../../j/c/3/User%7EJc37_cfd0.html" title="User:Jc37">jc37</a> 08:15, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>From a programming standpoint, there's no special benefit to any number in this circumstance, other than that every number is slightly worse than the number less than it. The best number would probably be something nice and round, that humans are used to, like, say, 200, 150, etc. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 14:10, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First off, if this isn't the right page to post this I apologize (and would appreciate a nudge in the right direction.) I've noticed that a very large percentage of the vandalism done to WP takes the form of gay bashing or has some sexual component. That's no surprise, of course, given the number of lonely, pathetic teens out there with computers, but what I would like to suggest is that a series of vandalism templates be written that address that type of vandalism specifically AND that they should to some extent deride the vandal. "Your comments to &lt;Article X&gt; have been removed because they were deemed unhelpful and indicative of your tragic sexual confusion rather than the article itself. If you would like to contribute more constructively you are welcome to do so, but regardless of any such participation, here are a few wikipedia pages that you might want to look at:" and then a list of pages dealing with repressed homosexuality or various exhibitionistic/vandal related issues. A series of such templates should exist just like the other levels of warnings. (The aforementioned one might be, say, level 2.) While this might be seen as a joke, I am serious that something like that would be both amusing to WP participants and a more effective method of dealing with these very sad, sad people. <a href="../../../g/e/e/User%7EGeeman_7ef2.html" title="User:Geeman">Geeman</a> 22:56, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Since this is about me all of a sudden, I feel obliged to say that I don't have any personal vendetta. I'm just looking for a response to vandals that will not be completely ineffectual--which it is pretty clear the current system is. When dealing with vandals who add material like (a modest example) "Ernest Miller Hemingway <b>had a huge dick and</b> was born on..." a response that such a comment indicates a personal problem on the part of the vandal is IMO perfectly reasonable. The current list of templates do absolutely nothing to deter such comments. Something more direct might have at least some chance of making the vandal go away (or, at least, wander off to some cyberspace location where their motives aren't revealed.) If that strikes you as being over the line then all I can say is that it is a very modest response to some very crude vandalism, and I'm looking for something more aggressive than the current, very passive, system. <a href="../../../g/e/e/User%7EGeeman_7ef2.html" title="User:Geeman">Geeman</a> 08:35, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Geeman, I can see you're well intentioned, but I don't know if you've ever done counter-vandalism. Quite frankly, these editors vandalize because they can, and it's stupid, and it's fun, and they know it. Just imagine a concerned parent walking by and telling kids to "stop being so profane, it's rude" - the reaction would only be laughter. Giving them a warning about their homophobic behavior will probably do worse than good (believe me, I've tried {{obscene}}, and we might as well <i>scream</i> at them "Don't shove <a href="../../../b/e/a/WP%7EBEANS_2a59.html" title="WP:BEANS">beans</a> up your nose!"). The only solution I find that might be helpful is Zoe's: it's a humorous way of saying, "you're not the first one to think you're funny"). - <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatstuart_7fbf.html" title="User:Patstuart">Patstuart</a> (<a href="../../../p/a/t/User_talk%7EPatstuart_e8fd.html" title="User talk:Patstuart">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Patstuart_a3f0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Patstuart">contribs</a>) 23:57, 10 January 2007 (UTC).</small>

<p>Well, yes, I do think vandals who post gay bashing material are dealing with their own repressed homosexuality, but that's not really the point. Maybe this wasn't particularly clear, but the repressed homosexuals are just one form of vandalism that I'm talking about here. Vandals who just put the word "Pussy!" in the text somewhere would get the same template warning.</p>
<p>I'm also not suggesting anything like sensitivity training. If anything, the opposite. My point is that we should call them on the root of their motivation in a series of vandal warning templates which indicate that not only has the vandal clearly shown his sad mental state to the world, but call him on it in a way shines the light back on them. It would be an interesting tactic to also direct them to pages that they would be more interested in vandalizing. Coralling them, if you will, into areas where their efforts will be more easily monitored.... And if we do so in a way that makes it amusing for the person who posts warning messages then all the better.</p>
<p>I'm not really surprised that something like {{obscene}} template would not work. It's practically a reward. A template that says, in effect, "your vandalism indicates you're sexually confused" doesn't congratulate the vandal. It turns the issue around on them. <a href="../../../g/e/e/User%7EGeeman_7ef2.html" title="User:Geeman">Geeman</a> 04:42, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>What precisely is the need to restore an archive of accusations of nastiness, especially given the strong majority in the MFD that wanted it deleted? The arbcom can view the deleted history if they need it (which I seriously doubt, and which I wouldn't assume unless an arbiter actually says so). People wanted the ruleset kept in history so they could learn from what didn't work out, not the archives of accusations. Likewise, with Esperanza, the most troubling bits were the membership roster and the hierarchy, both of which were deleted and salted. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 10:44, 12 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Deletion should be used to archive things. <b>Seriously</b>. Please can someone nag a developer to get a clear verdict on whether the deleted pages part of the database should really be used as an archive. On a wider issue, admins seem to use deleted pages as a way to hide things that shouldn't be viewed in public. Isn't that what the ability to delete or oversight items from a page history was meant to do? If there is a need to have protected archives, where page history is preserved but only viewable by admins, then that should be requested from the developers. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 11:44, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I am not at all saying that deletion should be used to archive things (but rather, that it is fallacious to claim it should be kept because the arbcom might hypothetically at some point need to see it).

<p>This page is backlogged to the point of behing overwhelmed. Reports dating back to early November are going unanswered.</p>
<p>I think the whole system needs overhauling, as at the moment such cases are far too complex and confusing for us to look at anyway. In the meantime, I wonder if we should put an amnesty on all unanswered cases from November and December and call the page temporarily dead?

<p>Gang, there are apparently a lot of pages with my name on it and a continued investigation into my activities. I want nothing further to do with this site. I also haven't edited since December but there is a tremendous amount of people who have posted that I am active under various names and ip addresses. None of this is true. There is also hounding going on of various users who are living in the same part of the world where I was in December. One user has been targeted and flat out harassed with accusations of being a sockpuppet. This needs to stop and those who are doing it should offer their sincere apologies since these are innocent people who either wanted to help me or were totally uninvolved. I am leaving Wikipedia to devote myself to professional publications. It was a good site, but there were simply too many people with hidden agendas and there appears to be a growing segment who want to harass and threaten rather than edit and help.

<dd>I strongly urge you to stop this now - ask admin to blank your sock. You do not have email enabled so I cannot discuss this with you off board but your actions here are at the stage where they could have serious real world ramifications for you (I don't want to get into the detail because this could actually make matters worse - think SERIOUSLY about what you are doing, your career and where you are, think about the trail you are leaving on this board with those two accounts). Delete the sock, ask admin to delete your real world picture connected to this HUSNOCK account, get a new account and edit without trying further attention to yourself.

<p>Can someone please trace the ip address of that statement above, if for no other reason to prove that it is not me. Husnock has stated over and over again he is not in the UAE but posts coming out of here are constantly being said to be him. A trace of his post should clear this up. We all should just leave him alone since he says he is gone from this site and not bother others for their associations with him. The statment above about serious real world ramifications sounds very sinister, Husnock has done nothing and doesnt deserve that.

<dl>
<dd>Husnock (and I refuse to play this game that Pahuskahey is someone one) it's not me suggesting that I'm about to do something sinister but I want you to consider the following - you are not the only member of the miltary or with connections to the miltary who reads those boards. I don't want to go into the detail on the public board for the sake of making it worse - but your stories (especially as Pashuskahey) have so many holes in them they are dismantled with very little investigation. Your problem is that while this seems like a fun game at the moment, you are currently leaving a trail of evidence that (unless that's a lie as well) shows you are a military officer who likes to pretend to have a dead son who died in active service. Am I going to follow that up in the real world? of course I'm not, but that does not mean that someone else is not, and you are riding your luck when it's pretty easy to get hold of a real life photo of yourself. I was one of the other people who checked the dead son stories (it's complete lies and husnock makes it easy to catch him but again I'd rather not discuss that on a public board for fear of making it worse). That is why I suggested you got your own photo deleted.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Again I really suggest you use your right to vanish and start again with a new name (but leave out all the nonsense associated with the Pahuskahey account). That is my last word on the matter unless I am asked to make a contribution. If you want to self-destruct in public that's your business. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesknight_2ce5.html" title="User:Charlesknight">Charlesknight</a> 10:44, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

While this stopped almost all of the vandalism, it doesn't appear to prevent vandalism from throwaway accounts who can still edit after registering the account. The two instances of vandalism by new accounts on <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anime.html" title="Anime">Anime</a> are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Countdown_to_Extinction" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Countdown_to_Extinction" rel="nofollow">[40]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Destroy-all-nerds" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Destroy-all-nerds" rel="nofollow">[41]</a>. --<b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheFarix_32b9.html" title="User:TheFarix">Farix</a></b> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheFarix_f893.html" title="User talk:TheFarix">Talk</a>)</p>

<p>I've reduced the protection level of <a href="../../../g/a/y/Talk%7EGay_Nigger_Association_of_America_f69d.html" title="Talk:Gay Nigger Association of America">Talk:Gay Nigger Association of America</a> to semi-protected. I have no doubt that this is a very unpopular decision and will be regarded as a bad move. I do this because people whose judgement I respect were appalled at the idea that the talk page was salted, and I found that I agreed with them. Obviously an article cannot exist under the present conditions, but if someone wants to try and develop sources on the talk page that seems a proper enough exercise. If it becomes a den of trolling and disruption it can always be protected again.

<dd>As a general rule, I think allowing talk pages to develop, even on deleted or salted articles, is a good thing. As long as we've got enough eyeballs on it, I don't see how this is a problem. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 06:25, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, Someone has cut-and-pasted material from Zyman Institute of Brand Science to The Institute of Brand Science to reflect the name change, instead of using the proper move mechanism.</p>
<p>Can someone please restore the article history on The Institute of Brand Science to reflect its former history at Zyman Institute of Brand Science, but keep it at its new location (remembering to move the talk page from ZIBS to TIBS as well).

<p>Replaceable fair use images from January 2-6 2007 has a grand backlog of <b>515 images</b> to evaluate.

<dd>All of the image deletions have fallen behind. I'm seeing in the neighborhood of 60 images each in the 'no source' and 'no license' categories for each day to be reviewed and deleted, and I'm finding that I can't review more than one day's worth in one of those categories in a given day. I find reviewing 'replaceable fair use' images even more trying and time consuming.

<dd>It would help if some of the cleanup crew were to record their investigations on the image pages, then any admin could speedily delete them without having to do a lot of work verifying.

<dd>Ooh, on the plus side, by looking at the contribs of one uploader I found a whole batch that had been speedied as fair use violations and then re-uploaded with {{<a href="../../../p/d/-/Template%7EPD-release_c976.html" title="Template:PD-release">PD-release</a>}}, which is very clearly not supported by the source url, so I warned that user. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 12:57, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
