<h2><span class="mw-headline">Policy</span></h2>
<p>I know that I've been chewed up and spat at once by Kelly Martin for suggesting that someone else stand for re-confirmation since only Arb-Com (and Jimbo) have the <i>power</i> to take away the bit, but I also am 80% sure that I've seen it done. Captain beefheart (or something?) put himself on RfA while retaining the powers, I think. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#000000">brenneman</font></a> <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" rel="nofollow"><font color="#000000" title="Admin actions"><sup><b>{L}</b></sup></font></a></span> 07:57, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Sarge Baldy, and he requested his powers be removed and then stood again. See <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Sarge_Baldy_fb61.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Sarge Baldy">Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Sarge Baldy</a>. That sets the precedent, and I'm surprised at Kelly's comments, I believe admins have always had the power to ask for the admin mop to be taken away. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 09:26, 24 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>No, Kelly was objecting to the idea of standing <i>while having</i> the bit...

<li>Ah, I see what Kelly is saying, although Sarge Baldy's actions kind of negate some of her conclusions, in that he didn't get opposed for being flighty or anything. But I don't see that it's against policy that one stand for reaffirmation, and I think the way it's set up at present, as an honour system, isn't the worst way. Other wiki's allow such a system, and I think there's mileage in testing the water on having a system here, although I'd favour either fixed terms or letting the arb-com periodically review admins. I'm not sure I'm ready to don the sack cloth just yet but I think adminship as a concept has moved on since the early days. Even looking back on my own vote shows wikipedia to be a simpler place than it appears now. Still, as a voluntary system, I can't see a problem with your category. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 12:06, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I also loved the gesture of "Captain Beefheart" (?!), and support the concept of this category. For myself, I've already upped the ante: all it would take is one established Wikipedian saying that I had substantively abused my admin buttons. This isn't as radical as some think: I won't stand just because someone says "I don't like you." He or she must cite a real incident, and the claim must be both serious and reasonable. I know I'm a moron, and I make loads of mistakes every day; but, since I try to think before I act, I'd be genuinely surprised and disappointed in myself if anyone seriously caught me <i>abusing</i> the buttons. Being wrong is an acceptable human failing; being a jerk about being wrong is not, in my eyes. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 14:43, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Possible drawbacks</span></h2>
<p>Don't you just love vague section headers?</p>
<p>I agree with the basic idea here, that if six editors in good standing want to see you undergo RfA (or whatever) again, then it should happen. This is fantastic, as it allows admins who haven't done something egregious enough to get ArbCommed a forum to see if the community really wants them. However, I see several problems.</p>
<ul>
<li>We already have RfC. I know, I know, RfC does a crummy job of solving problems (in my experience, anyways). But if RfC does a crummy job, I see little reason that this won't do the same.</li>
<li>Will it happen? So six guys say, Out with you. Man says, No, you're all vandals/trolls/poets/whatever and you're wrong. Standoff. Now what? Is he required to go into this re-RfA? How do you plan on handling the inevitable "quelching of the underdog's opinions" when if you say, No, he's doing fine, you're a langer, piss off (politely, of course)? Basically, who decides whether or not the request is valid? Who are editors in good standing?</li>
<li>Will this actually help anything? We get into conflicts. Admins who RC patrol, deal with copyvios, and others will have many people disliking them, even if they do the best job. Yet these jobs are necessary, and admins who don't care about the popularity sacrifice one makes in these fields should be respected. My fear here is that you'll get six blokes who make thousands of userboxes wanting to deadmin the man who deleted {{User shirley}}. Then, pileup occurs and the admin who did nothing but uphold policy gets sacked due to "no consensus" on his re-RfA.</li>
</ul>

<dd>Good stuff there, all valid and worthy of thought. That said, I added myself to the category because it seems a good idea, but I'm not thinking I'd turn in my sysop bit and go through RFA again. to me it's more like I'd do an RfC and if consensus was that I was duff, I'd turn it in then. No consensus? no turn in. That seems to defend against trolls turning up... maybe. <b><font color="green">+</font><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Lar_3e70.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Lar"><font color="blue">+</font></a></b><a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 19:01, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There are just a few of us here as of now but we still all seem to have slightly different ideas about this. Maybe we should try to evolve this into a general category of admins who would be open to recall under conditions stipulated by themselves on their user pages. For example I would simply hand in my bit if asked by five established editors - and then maybe run again in RFA at a time of my choosing. <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 03:32, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Comment</span></h2>
<p>I'm just dutifully fulfilling a request to comment, and have nothing of much consequence to add. I view this scheme as at once commendable, harmless and unnecessary. I think it is commendable because it signals the high value placed by at least some of us on accountability. I think it is harmless because I am unable to see that the scheme will be harmful, either to administrators and the body they serve, or to the resources of time and effort so often done violence by similar proposals made in the past. I think it is unnecessary because I believe those administrators who will unhesitatingly undertake to do this are precisely those administrators who will never have to; a glance at the current list confirms the conjecture. —<i><a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><span style="font-family:Times;color:navy;"><b>Encephalon</b></span></a> 11:59, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</i></p>

<dd>That was pretty much my take. Though I suppose there's some chance that this idea snowballs, peer pressure forces every admin to join or be known for deliberately not joining, people start pledging to join in their RfAs or they lose voters, and it sweeps through Wiki culture like Sherman through Georgia. Oh, did I mention it was a small chance?&#160;:-) —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 15:31, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I was thinking that exact thing- participation in a program like this, while voluntary, may end up on people's requirements lists for a support vote at RFA.

<dd>My optimism must be shining through. This is <i>exactly</i> what I hope will happen. Once some critical mass is reached, since policy is <b>de</b>scriptive not <b>pro</b>scriptive... who knows. I had intended from the beginning to start asking about this at RfAs at some stage.<br />

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Another idea</span></h2>
<p>Just tossing this out, but we have RFC's don't we, on admin abuse, and perhaps we could incorporate that, perhaps if 10 admins certify an admin abuse ticket then an admin should step down and seek the trust of the community again. The problem I have with objections to these sorts of proposals is that they always seemt o be from people with something to lose. It's completely analagous to proposals to reform the House of Lords. Adminship is granted because a user has the trust of the community, yet the community has no power to recall the power granted if that trust is lost. That is the bare bones of the issue to me.</p>
<p>So an rfc on admin abuse should probably look at getting 10 admin sigs, say the average count on an rfa is 50 people, and so 20% of that is ten, which would put you in the crat discretion zone, and either the case goes to arbcom (automatically, they should not refuse), or the admin can elect to have his adminship reaffirmed through an rfa. That's the way I'd do it. But that's just tossing out thoughts. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 13:38, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Fundamentally, you still have the problem that the people who would get 10 admins to endorse an RFC against them (and there have been a number of such cases) would also refuse to do anything like this voluntarily, or to support an involuntary system. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 13:42, 26 May 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Thoughts</span></h2>
<p>One thing I would suggest adding to any formal proposal for this sort of thing is a limit on how often re-affirmation can be requested. We don't want people calling for a recall immediately after someone they opposed becomes an admin or a week after the person was just re-affirmed. Keeping an 'X month' limit on attempts would prevent this from being used for constant harassment and bogging down the process.</p>
<p>The concept of needing a certain number of people requesting re-affirmation to start the process also makes sense in that it would prevent vast numbers of re-affirmation requests on people who will easily pass. I'd suggest something like the current RFC practice of needing 'X signatories' within a time limit of 'Y days' so that it isn't just a collection of every vindictive vandal the admin has blocked over the past year. The 'must have Z edits' standard makes some sense for the users calling for re-affirmation, but I don't think it would be needed for the actual 'RFA' any more than it is for current RFAs. If there is excessive sock-puppet activity the bureaucrats can take that into account when making a decision.</p>
<p>Finally, as a means of making this more palatable to some admins (aka 'giving it a chance in hell of being accepted') I might suggest starting out with a lower thresh-hold of required support and then slowly increasing it over time. The most common objection to this sort of thing is, 'admins just naturally become unpopular by doing their job / a handful of vandals and trolls will derail the reaffirmation RFAs'. I don't agree with that assessment, but if we accord it some validity it might be argued that roughly 50% approval is sufficient support for an active admin (given the extra dislike argued to be inherent in the position). I'd like to see 80%, same as becoming an admin in the first place, but even meeting a 50% thresh-hold would require some admins to display a bit more discretion. I think the possibility of losing adminship in this way would lead to better admin behaviour in general and thus allow higher standards of consensus approval to be expected as time goes by. I don't think there is any way an '80% consensus' for reaffirmation would be accepted to start with, as there are dozens of admins who would be gone within a month... but we might be able to slowly raise standards back up to that point, and virtually any standard is better than the '0.001% community approval' currently required (0.001% = '50% of active ArbCom members').</p>
<p>For myself, unless an actual process for this is installed before then I plan to put myself up for re-affirmation once I've been an admin for six months or so to help prove the concept. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBDunkerson</a> 12:12, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If there is a centralized place where the reaffirmation is done, I expect many admins will choose to watch it and participate. <i>And that is what is needed next - a noticeboard for cases in the practice.</i> So a small number of trolls should not be an issue during the reaffirmation, but they could get one started. I think if the practice evolves gradually, having one started will come to be seen as no big deal, especially if admins don't have to put down the mop during the process. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 12:28, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>These are very good points, but I don't think the majority of them apply, for the simple reason that this process is <i>entirely</i> voluntary; the only consequences to an admin for not actually following through with the re-affirmation are to his reputation. Thus, an admin could disregard a request as obvious trolling—or run an RFC with some unusual percentage of support—as he felt most appropriate. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 12:53, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just to document that there was a thread about this proposal, subsequently archived, here's a link <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_adminship_Archive_58_1f4c.html#Admin_recall_has_landed" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for adminship/Archive 58">Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_adminship/Archive_58#Admin_recall_has_landed</a> to the discussion. We are at 19 admins that have added themselves to this category (out of 1000). That's less than 2% and growth has tapered off... There was substantial resistance to the proposal raised in that WPT:RfA thread.</p>
<p>I have to admit to some sympathy to the notion raised in the resistance that those of us choosing to do this might be saying we're "better" than others, or that this would be something that people feel chivvied into doing.</p>
<p>My goals are stated on my talk page... I want to be accountable to the community and in a way that's less drastic than an RfAr, and this process lets me do that. If others don't want to do this, that is their perogative, it doesn't mean they are bad admins (As I said, one of my co-noms, a person I have a great deal of respect for, a person I knew from a former community, came out strongly against this idea and she is <i>by no stretch of the imagination</i> a <b>bad</b> or <b>unaccountable</b> admin). I'm wondering (thinking out loud) if removing the category and just leaving the notice box (a variant in your own words perhaps?) might be an approach that engenders less feelings that this is something being forced. It does reduce the PR aspect though. Maybe that's good, or bad.

<dd>I'm always open to being challenged on my adminship. I try not to be a rogue or rouge admin, but sometimes I'll be bold if I think it's the right thing to do. However, I've not added myself because I don't want to be put in the position of a) having to say "but you (6) are not in my opinions editors in good standing" b) having to worry about lynch mobs. Everyone who has listed themselves here has their heart in the right place for sure, but it's not for me.

<dd>Well I'm not rogue, I don't think, but I'm perfectly fine with being considered rouge, (although no one's put the flag on my user page yet) despite being a process wonk, because being rouge means doing the right thing for the right reasons, even if process gets in the way. Process here is our servant, not our master. Note that nothing is stopping you from taking this idea (the pink box on my page is seperately editable) and shaping it to meet your own needs (and then adding or not adding yourself to the category as you like). If this idea were to spread to the point that no one remained unlisted that wasn't troublesome, that would tell you something, but I suspect that is not going to happen as it stands now, because many people have principled and legitimate objections.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Question from non-admin</span></h2>
<p>Hi all. &#160;:) I have to admit, I'm feeling a mix of emotions at the moment since I just found this talk page. My first reaction when I saw the category was, "Wow, what a classy thing to have!" And then when I saw the names of the admins on it, my thought was, "Wow, what a classy thing for them to do!" But then I saw this talk page, and I realized, "Oh. It's not something stable, nobody agrees on it yet." So I'm kind of bummed. Then again, after having read the ANI discussion, I can see the other side. There are plenty of "rogue editors" out there who love to pick on admins, and so it's a risky thing to put one's name on such a list, especially when there's a perception that there are more problem users than there are good users (or at least that the problem users are more vocal, whether or not that's true).</p>
<p>But this brings me back to my original problem, which is what to do about an admin that I really do believe needs to have their admin access removed, or at least re-examined. I looked into their original adminning discussion from over a year ago, and the reports of their behavior were <i>glowing</i>. 100% support votes, not a single oppose. I actually had difficulty reconciling the behavior of the individual that I was reading about from that discussion, with the behavior of the individual that I've been observing over the last few months. But for whatever reason, their behavior (at least, IMHO) has changed. They're engaging in defensive behavior, personal attacks, name-calling, moving pages without consensus (and sometimes without even discussion), reacting with escalated behavior when the issue is brought up on their talkpage, etc. etc., and other "good" users are also rumbling that there's a problem and that a de-sysoping may be necessary, but no one yet appears brave enough to "bell the cat".</p>
<p>When I saw this category, I was really happy because it looked like a good solution. But, now I'm not so sure. So, I'd like to ask those of you who are discussing this process, and doubtless have access to more tribal knowledge about Wikipedia than I. What <i>should</i> I do? Just wait around and hope that pressure increases enough to where someone with more Wikipedia experience than I is going to try and fasten the cat collar? Or, how should this be handled? --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 21:46, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I honestly don't know, it's definitely an uphill fight.

<dd>If you act with integrity, intelligence, neutrality, kindness, understanding, and with civility, you'll do fine. Talk to the admin first and see what happens. Don't post rants.

Be aware that any request saying "<i>X should be de-sysopped</i>" is likely to be ignored because almost all such requests are trolling (I mean, it's like writing a letter to your Congressman and saying, "Bush should be impeached!" Thus, be reasonable with what you ask). Understand that you may be wrong and that there's quite possibly a side to the story that you're unaware of. Never be afraid to admit what you were wrong about, and apologise with dignity. Remember what we're here for: to build an encyclopedia, not for <i>any other reason</i>, and make sure that what you're doing matches that. If you do that, all things should come up roses.

<dd>Is it really an inappropriate amount (or type) of pressure? Unlike many of the questions that seem to appear on RFAs these days, this would be directly related to the question of potential admin abuse. While actually asking someone to sign on as a precondition for one's support would be in somewhat poor taste, I don't really think that a simple request to consider the topic and respond in some way would be over the line. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 03:58, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I don't see the harm in asking it, and seeing what develops from there.

<p>I disagree strongly about the "no blocks" part.

<dd>Yeah, I'm in that camp too.

The way it seemed to work, was that for each user who added their name to the "support recall" list, the admin went into "horse-trading" mode, and then worked things out individually with that user, in order to make them happy and get them to retract their vote with a <s>strikeout</s>. And ever since, there have been no further problems (that I've seen) with abuse of admin powers by that particular administrator, so the process was a success, IMHO. In other words, the existence of this category definitely provided a useful additional tool in dispute resolution, between an admin and some non-admins who had concerns about the admin's behavior. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 04:51, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Terrible flaws in this concept - urgent action required</span></h2>
<p>As recent days have clearly demonstrated to me this cat now makes the <i>best admins</i> incredibly vulnerable to almost ANYONE looking to settle a score or harm them or wikipedia itself. Whilst I applaud the concept (and barely a day or two ago would have signed myself up to without hesitation), I sincerely urge every current member to urgently review their position on this. The more, *ahem*, (shall we say) <i>aggressive</i> users (or fellow sysops for that matter) are in a position of comparatively substantial power when a controversy flairs up. Consider this:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>FACT</b>: Administrators <i>by definition</i> will face opponents to their actions and thus themselves. As the ultimate person responsible for hitting the BLOCK USER or DELETE PAGE buttons this is a 100% certainty.</li>
<li><b>FACT</b>: Whether any specific individual's "recall" basis is valid or not; whether the administrator being held up for recall has acted impeccably or improperly; and/or no matter whether the specific recall basis is a complete and utter farce or not; those users who feel they have in any way been done wrong by the "victim" of any recall <b>WILL use that opportunity to get even</b> - this process is literally the only chance they will have.</li>
<li><b>RESULT</b>: any recall using the current "500 mainspace edit" format will fail. It is INEVITABLE based on the above. Think about this please: SB gave up the tools of his own accord, without recall, and look at the amount of opposition to his receiving them back, barely a couple of months later - (IMO) his RfA narrowly scraped through using current consensus guidelines, coming in under 75%... Then think about how many RfAs pass with fewer than 6 oppose votes... <b>BEFORE</b> the user has given a single block, made a single deletion, or had a chance to face one iota of controversy due to their sysop actions!</li>
</ol>
<p>Personally, I do not see how this can be rectified without putting in place process guidelines that could resemble the RfC process, but I do know this: You guys are unquestionably the best administrators; quite simply any admin who signed up for this is one we cannot afford to lose. Suspend your membership herein or the entire cat itself and restructure, <b>please?</b> - <a href="../../../g/i/e/User%7EGIen_ba45.html" title="User:GIen">Gl<font color="green"><b>e</b></font>n</a> 06:41, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree. When RfAs routinely get 100+ voters, putting all this focus in the hands of just 6 individuals out of those hundreds makes no practical sense.

<dd>Not sure I agree. Recall petitions in other organizations are kickoffs of investigations, not elections. They need to be inititable by a minority, because they are not themselves the recertification election. THAT... sure, majority vote or whatever, but you need to allow a small minority (perhaps oppressed) to start the process of shedding light on the activities in a formal way. Hopefully most of the time it becomes clear there is nothing to the allegations (I say this having survived a recall in another organization, one for which (mea culpa) perhaps some feel I should have been turned out instead of being reconfirmed), but when there is, it's important that a majority not be able to suppress initiation.

<dd>It should certainly be initiatable by a minority. But the question is about the action to follow once we get six valid votes. What about always starting off with an RfC, and then based on the comments a third person (like Lar, who decided the valid votes this time) can decide whether the admin should continue or go for a confirmation/RfA&#160;?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Mandatory admin recall</span></h2>
<p>I believe there needs to be a simple system, whereby all admins are potentially open to recall and that this should be mandatory. This should be something validated by experienced users capable of making informed judgements. I suggest the following:</p>
<p>At least 10 editors of good standing must ask for an admin to stand again for RfA. Good standing is both 3 months service and 3000 edits, in other words the sort of minimum qualifications you'd need to be an admin.</p>
<p>At least 10 such editors to ask for recall within 2 weeks of first editor asking. (If more editors oppose recall than support, it is the admin's choice whether to stand for recall.)</p>
<p>It then automatically goes to RfA (which is open to all editors) and is done on a simple majority there, i.e. over 50% either way.</p>
<p>If an admin is not suitable, then I think all the criteria should be met easily.</p>
<p>An admin is bound to have ruffled feathers by being a good admin, so it can't be seen in the same way as a new candidate on RfA.</p>
<p>All the above should be mandatory, and not optional.</p>
<p>Recall cannot be initiated within 2 months of previous recall initiation.</p>
<p>The initial request must be made by an editor in the standing mentioned.</p>
<p>Potential de-sysopping is a serious matter and should not be left to just a 5 editor request. The above criteria for de-sysopping are fairly stringent, but then it should be so, to allow admins the sense of security to carry on their work properly.</p>
<p>If the initial recall process is open to all editors, then I suggest 25 need to ask for recall.</p>

Further, This issue is only a small part of what ArbCom is all about since desysopping comes up in only a small proportion of cases.

<li>This isn't a bad idea at all. I think that if there is regular administrator recall, it should be mandatory, as those who would get recalled would most likely not volunteer. I think its a little difficult to tell how this scheme actually plays out, but it seems like it would be generally difficult to get someone de-sysop'd, which is a good thing. I fully concur with your suggestions regarding the "good standing"-ness of editors involved in this voting process, as just going by straight numbers without taking into account where they came from would be no good at all. Anyways, I'd be interested to see how often this would actually get used.

<p>I disagree with Tyrenius' proposal as I think Recall should remain a voluntary undertaking. I would primarily like to see the process get more defined.

<p>Voluntary recall is by definition self-defeating as a bad admin is not going to subscribe — because they're bad. It's only the best admins who are going to, and then they leave themselves wide open because of any momentary lapse. And does that benefit the project overall? I think not. If it is going to be genuinely voluntary, then there should not be a question about it on RfA, as this imposes an obvious pressure for joining, and removes what is stated to be a matter of free will. A candidate disadvantages themselves if they say they're not going to join, because it looks as though they're either worried their future conduct might lead them to recall, or they're not prepared to be accountable, whereas they might have other very good reasons for not joining, which an RfA does not give them a secure platform to expound. One very good reason is that it's an extremely flawed idea, which currently means, I understand, that the general workload has increased by 700 deletions a week. What's right for one is right for all, and if all admins were in the recall category, that would be fine — except the number of active admins might shrink rather suddenly. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 08:35, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I oppose making the recall process mandatory at this time, or even suggesting it be made so. Ask me again when there are 300 admins in the category instead of 30. I'm convinced that offering oneself up for accountability is a good idea, but we are at 3% acceptance. We have a long way to go before this idea is widely enough accepted (assuming I am right that this idea can be made to work, recent events give me great encouragement but I could be wrong) for such a step. I also have concerns, as raised by others the last time this was mooted at talk:RfA, that it might be seen as chivvying. That's why I structured my question the way I did, and you'll see that I supported people who came out against it and opposed people who supported it (not usually but I did)... we have a lot of work to do yet. I want to avoid creaky topheavy structure, I like everyone chooses what it means to them, but I do think more examples or definitions might help. Without wishing any particular admin ill, I also think a few more examples (to show that this process does work) will help a lot too. If we get to the point where the majority of admins have embraced it, it will not be necessary to make it mandatory. If we never do get to that point, it will not, IMHO, be accepted as mandatory. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 14:22, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Given the nature of Wikipedia, good admins tend to piss people off; particularly POV pushers, policy violaters, sockpuppeteers, etc. It's only if you completely abdicate your admin responsibilities (fly under the radar, avoid any controversy, don't block any editors, don't get involved in heated AN discussions etc.) that you end up pleasing everyone. There is already a process for recalling administrators - it's called the Arbitration Committee. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 17:25, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I suppose the question is to what extent good admins also tend to piss off the non-POV pushing, policy violating, sockpuppeting editors, and whether we're content to write this off as collateral damage.

<dd>I completely agree with Jayjg. There are very few really good admins I can think of who haven't made several enemies.

<dd>I think that's too lenient. The threshold to stay an admin should be the same as the threshold to become an admin, in my view. Jayjg is right that in the course of their duties, admins sometimes upset people. <i>But if an admin upsets so many people that they can no longer pass an RfA, something is wrong.</i> We don't need to burden RfA with reconfirmation every time someone gets upset; instead, we wait until complaints reach an initiatory threshold. Currently, recallable admins can set their own thresholds, and choose what to do when those thresholds are reached—stand for reconfirmation, step down, etc. That's a great start, and I commend the admins in this category (and CrazyRussian!) for participating in this system and demonstrating their accountability and respect for the community which gave them their tools. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim_Smith_0e3f.html" title="User:Tim Smith">Tim Smith</a> 19:00, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The current system that exists is not one where power is placed with the community. The corollary is that the Arbitration Committee should appoint admins, but most people would find this unthinkable now. The notion of factions and parties forming does not show a great deal of faith in the community as a whole, and is the sort of vision that would anticipate the impracticality of wikipedia to start with. As the "call" process has not produced this phenomenon, I don't see why we should fear that the "recall" process should produce it. I'm not aware that most admins are so imbalanced in their views and judgements as to be easily identifiable with any particular faction anyway, and, if any are, that would seem to be a good reason <i>for</i> their recall, rather than against it. The descent into chaos would obviously be undesirable, but I feel may be overstated. "Dick", or perhaps better an abusive admin, is not merely in the eye of the beholder, unless we attribute no sense of jugement, justice or fair play to people. I think the community deserves more credit than that. However, there are always imbalanced individuals, and if the good admins have made several enemies as an inevitable part of their work, thus gaining them more opposition in a recall, that is an argument for lowering the threshold, not in itself for dismissing the process. As has been said above, if any admin could not gain in excess of 50% of the community's support, it means a lot of unhappiness trails in the wake of that admin. One has to question seriously what would have brought that about. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 01:56, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I fully support making this category mandatory. Many admins have questionable conducts but no apparent policy violations. Note that admin open to recall is not telling the admins who are recalled to desysop immediately but instead to re-confirm the support of the community, which makes trolling, socks, and other vandals bringing an good admin down an extremely remote, virtually impossible possibility.--<a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBonafide.hustla_8457.html" title="User:Bonafide.hustla">Bonafide.hustla</a> 04:51, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ideally all admins would be open to recall, but proposals to force de-adminship have a poor track record—see <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_de-adminship_8eb9.html#Proposed_processes" title="Wikipedia:Requests for de-adminship">Wikipedia:Requests for de-adminship#Proposed processes</a>. Because it is voluntary, this category has so far avoided that fate. With only 33 out of 900+ admins, we are not in a position to mandate membership, and to do so would risk discrediting the category. Better for now to grow it gradually, in my opinion. I do like Lar's idea of discounting recall requests from non-recallable admins; that would protect members of this category and give others an incentive to join.

<dd>Not necessarily; one could make the argument that we'd be discounting only anti-recall people, but still allowing those who had never had the opportunity to formally make a choice.

<dd>True, but since the category is not universal, recallable admins are more vulnerable than non-recallable admins, and whenever an admin is recalled, the proportion of recallable admins decreases. Discounting requests from non-recallable admins is a way to offset that proportional decrease, while giving those admins an incentive to join the category. (Of course, discounting requests from <i>everyone</i> would stop the decrease altogether—but then the admins wouldn't be recallable!) I'd weight reputable non-admins and recallable admins more heavily than non-recallable admins, but it's up to each member. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim_Smith_0e3f.html" title="User:Tim Smith">Tim Smith</a> 23:43, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Now, I think the discussion over there is unlikely to come to a consensus to delete, but if it were I think we would be very foolish indeed to attempt to keep the idea alive in some modified form. Even without consensus to delete, the CFD certainly raises penetrating questions: I personally do not think the notion is divisive, but if these good people <i>think</i> it is divisive, well, thus it becomes. I am tempted to suggest that unless if the consensus at CFD is to keep, we should all remove ourselves from the category on a voluntary basis. Of course, if the voices comes not from a cross-section of Wikipedia, but instead mostly from admins not in this category, that raises some doubts about the wisdom of that suggestion. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 04:48, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry, mandatory recall strikes me as a non starter at this time and I don't think I'll be dumping much effort into that proposal. I'd rather try to address the objections to voluntary. KimvdLinde, I'm willing to avoid specific questions that give the appearance of promoting the idea but not avoid asking about it altogether. I think knowing whether someone feels that voluntary recall is a good idea (and why, that's the most important part) is a legitimate question, (same for ROUGE, and for "willing to make hard blocks")... but am willing to "promote" only after sucessful candidacy. Would that address your objection? Also I need to (or someone needs to) put together a comment on the CfD that succinctly summarises all the objections and acknowledges or addresses them. I think the idea is sound and will survive even if it means we all just put things on our talk pages like my <a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_Accountability_eee6.html" title="User:Lar/Accountability">User:Lar/Accountability</a> and nothing more (no userbox, no transcluded image, no category). ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a>

<dd>O yes, that would be fine with me. Along the same line, it should not be asked whether an admin would be a rouge admin, those are categories that can easily be asked afterwards. As for the many fear arguments, I do not see that those are valid (Good standing Trolls&#160;???). As for a more general questions, should there be something as a recall procedure different from the ArbCom, I can see the value of asking admins, although I wonder how important that is for the functioning of the person as an admin.</dd>
<dd>As for my own ideas, I would do something along the line of a petition. A number of editors (5+) in good standing write down the rational to desysop someone, and sign it. The admin in question responds. One week talk page discussion. The arbcom votes on it (with the provision that they can kill the petition in an earlier stage when it is frivolous). No extended fluf with evidence, workshop etc phases, just straight foreward. -- <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimvdLinde_061a.html" title="User:KimvdLinde">Kim van der Linde</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/m/User_talk%7EKimvdLinde_a7d1.html" title="User talk:KimvdLinde">at venus</a></sup> 16:07, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Having triggered the CFD debate, I probably ought to come here and try and make my objections plain. I consider this process inherently divisive because it creates two groups:
<ol>
<li>The admins who can be percieved as "good", "accountable", and "responsible".</li>
<li>The other ones.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>It is that segmenting of the community that I fundementally object to. It would be like having the police and the "good" police. By marking yourselves with a label saying that you will be held to higher standard it is intrinsically (if presumably unintentionally) denigrating to all the other admins who might be just as responsible and accountable but for whatever reason have chosen not to join the club. The fact that one side is so easily percieved as "right" creates pressure for others to join, to say nothing of the fact that some people expressly want to pressure others into joining. It is a bad situation built upon a false dichotomy. If you want to have voluntary guidelines for recall, fine. If you want to create a recall policy for all admins, even better. (In the past I proposed reconfirmation if any three admins thought it was warranted, and would be happy support other reconfirmation proposals). But I can't support creating a club of people where the public perception will be that they are somehow better than the other admins. And especially not if new admins and candidates are going to be pressured into joining. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 18:58, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Maybe the name of the category is the problem, though I confess I don't see it personally. Would Category:Administrators open to voluntary recall be better, to differentiate it from an eventual mandatory system? I do think it's coming, someday, but I'm not sure I agree about the divisiveness. I've got a much bigger problem with the gameability/prejudice toward recall of decent, community-minded admins that a voluntary system promulgates. -- <i><a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae</a>'<a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">blis</a></i> 19:36, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, I'd much rather not have a category at all. If you'd like to know my preferred approach, create a guideline titled: Wikipedia:Procedure for requesting admin recall. Spell out who can request an admin be recalled, under what conditions, and what an appropriate response looks like. At least for now, set it up so that actually being recalled is voluntary (i.e. at the admin's discretion), but also make it clear to the recallers that they could subsequently pursue Arbiration in an attempt to force an admin to be recalled if he refuses to step down voluntarily. Further, don't have a club of volunteers, but state that the procedures for admin recall can be applied to any admin. (Which would be a much fairer test of the process then having a group of volunteers pledging to step down.) I would be much happier with a process (even a voluntary one) that could be applied to all equally rather than creating a category or list of admins purporting to adhere to different standards than the rest. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 20:34, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ideally all admins would be open to recall, and we wouldn't need a category. But proposals to force de-adminship have a poor track record, as <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_de-adminship_8eb9.html#Proposed_processes" title="Wikipedia:Requests for de-adminship">Wikipedia:Requests for de-adminship#Proposed processes</a> shows. Because we've lacked a community-based recall process for so long, we've accumulated unpopular admins, and they are likely to vigorously resist any attempt at mandatory or universal recall. Unfortunately, the probable result of implementing Dragons flight's proposal is that a slew of requests would be placed to recall unpopular admins, the admins would ignore them, ArbCom would cite a lack of severe abuse and refuse to desysop, and the recall process would be discredited.</dd>

<dd>Universal recall will be difficult to enact in the current climate. A more feasible approach, in my opinion, is to build support gradually by demonstrating that recall is a workable option. This category is a way to do that while minimizing the risk of being discredited by anti-recall admins. The greater its membership and the longer it exists, the more it shows the viability of community-based recall, and the easier it will be to gain consensus for a recall procedure which applies to everyone. I don't see it as a permanent divider between "good" admins and the rest, but as an interim step on the road to a more universal process. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim_Smith_0e3f.html" title="User:Tim Smith">Tim Smith</a> 05:13, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I'm somewhwat disheartened at the CfD debate, I feel people are raising objections that have essentially been refuted - such that this process will be used by trolls to get even with innocent hardworking administrators. Maybe we need a good FAQ? Anyway, even if there won't be a consensus to delete I think we'll have to take this seriously.

<p>I share some of the concerns that people might feel pressured to join this if it is asked about during RfAs. Taking that further, they might feel pressured if we encourage it at all right after their promotion. And you know what? Newly-minted admins probably <i>don't</i> have enough data to know what being an admin is like and to decide whether being in this category would be a good thing or bad thing for them personally. Is it worth considering a mandatory waiting period? It might be reasonable to only allow people who had been admins for a couple of months to join. Yes, it might slow the growth of the category some. But it also might keep people from being forced into uninformed decisions. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 20:11, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>And of course the concern that <i>"The noblest admins will list themselves, thereby making themselves vulnerable to knee-jerk reactions, while any long term abusive admin (should one exist) wouldn't go near it."</i>, as stated by <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a>.</li>

<dd>I think some of the points there are moot. Someone seems to forget theres already a category that divides admins, and isnt going away either (Rouge admins of course). As for mentioning it on someones RfA: if they're that squeamish in the first place, why accept a nom (or self nom for that matter)?

<dd>Thanks!!! I'm leery of creating a template as that seems process heavy. Even the notion of using a clerk, and how one does it... that all seems like it's imposing structure on people. I just made it up as I went along and I would not want to say anyone else who got recalled should feel free to ask for a clerk or not...(if they do, doesn't have to be me every time!) and should organise as they see fit. Maybe that's too loosey goosey? But I'd rather not impose structure if I can avoid it. Am I all wet? Is a template (or a set? one for the inital layout, and a pair for closes) needful?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Good idea, needs some work</span></h2>
<p>Phew! Just finished reading through all the comments on this talk page. When I read this category, I immediately had some thoughts about it, and see that most of them have been reflected somewhat in the discussion above. Here are the main things I would offer:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia is slowly evolving from a dictatorship to a democracy, and that's a good thing. It would be great if, over time, Jimbo had less to do in terms of policing the project because it took care of itself.</dd>
<dd>Administrators, like judges and prosecutors, engage in inherently controversial decision-making, and should have some modicum of protection against ordinary disgruntlement. However, long-term, chronic drawing-of-ire can hurt the project, and there should be a way of addressing that, short of an Arbitration Committee action for specific misconduct.</dd>
<dd>This situation, though it should be rare, is inevitable, as administrators are imperfect (if lovely) human beings, and can fail us.</dd>
<dd>It makes senses to have a process that's voluntary at first, to test things out, and then becomes "expected" and finally mandatory. Sort of the evolution of the two-term limit for the Presidency of the United States.</dd>
<dd>So long as the process is voluntary, as a practical matter, admins can choose their own criteria for who is a credible petitioner/requester, and for what process they should use if their recall request is successful. Nonetheless, because the policy should eventually become an expected/required part of adminship after sufficient testing, there should eventually be consensus about both of these things.</dd>
<dd>Especially because recalls will be rare, it seems to be a bad idea to</dd>
</dl>
<p>With that said, I have some specific thoughts and suggestions about the proposed category/policy:</p>
<ol>
<li>There should be a waiting period after any significant adminship action (by which I mean selection as an admin, prior unsuccessful attempt to recall, arbitration committee action, etc.), before a recall could be initiated. I would suggest a 3-month "cooling off" period, in between such actions.</li>
<li>There should definitely be specified limits on both the number of editors making the request, and the timeframe in which they make it. Six editors in any one month period sounds as good as any, remembering that the process could be renewed after the specified cooling-off period.</li>
<li>There should be criteria for who should be allowed to participate in a recall request, i.e. a "good standing" requirement, and it is reasonable to have the requirement be about 500 edits (whether to the mainspace or not seems like not such a big deal to me), and, say, 30 days on wikipedia. It also seems reasonable to have a person's block history be relevant to "good standing", though I would exclude blocks by the admin in question and blocks that are older than a specified time (say, one month).</li>
<li>The procedure for surviving actual recall should be no more stringent than for RfA in the first place, and perhaps a bit less, given the fact that good, active admins must necessarily make controversial decisions at times. I'm completely open to those who have more experience with the project, but a 50% (perhaps 2/3?) vote with a signficant suffrage requirement ought to do the trick, again, with an appropriate time limit. However, leaving it up to the embattled admin to decide the process seems unhelpful.</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, great idea, and with some polish, could be even better. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThesmothete_249d.html" title="User:Thesmothete">Thesmothete</a> 19:45, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Moving it on</span></h2>
<p>Okay, we're getting a good few people here now. I thought I might toss the idea of how the system might work. The way I see it, if a user gets six people who meet his criteria calling for their recall, then it's best to move over to either a Request for comment or better yet Wikipedia:Request for recall, give it a week to run and get a crat to close it. The crats have indicated they will consider doing this. That's how I figure I'll go if and when it comes up. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 13:47, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I indicated that if there were a consensus system for something like requests for de-adminship I would be willing to judge consensus on those requests just as I do RfA. Until there is a consensus system, I don't believe any bureaucrat should oversee a non consensus one. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 18:00, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I agree with Taxman. If this proposed policy is adopted by the community, I'm happy to take part in implementing it. At this point, it appears to have been put forward as voluntary since there is widespread objection to making it policy. Since it is, at present, voluntary I would expect that those participants in it should voluntarily step down at their discretion when they believe a consensus and whatever other triggering thresholds exist have been met. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">The Uninvited</a> Co., <a href="../../../u/n/i/User_talk%7EUninvitedCompany_4866.html" title="User talk:UninvitedCompany">Inc.</a> 18:28, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>So for arguments sake, if I asked either of you to close a discussion on whether I should be desysopped and declare a consensus, you wouldn't? <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 19:19, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>I wholeheartedly agree with Uninvited Company. As long as this is a voluntary system, and not official policy (and it would have to be one where Bureaucrats are specifically empowered to act), we are not authorized to judge consensus on de-adminship authoritatively as we do with RfA, and even less so to decide effectively and peremptorily on the removal of access of any Adminstrator. As long as this scenario exists, we really cannot do it. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 23:09, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Fair enough. If the bureaucrats won't do it I guess we'll just close each others. Anyone is authorised to list someone for de-adminning as long as a consensus exists. Next step then will be either a list or a category of users prepared to close de-admin discussions, similar to this category and <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdmins_willing_to_make_difficult_blocks_b657.html" title="Wikipedia:Admins willing to make difficult blocks">Wikipedia:Admins willing to make difficult blocks</a>. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 19:55, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You do realize that if it's not voluntary and there's no official policy making this discussion or vote a valid means for removing access, the Stewards will not carry out any de-adminning, right? And if it's voluntary, then it is really up to the Admin concerned to decide when there's sufficient consensus to justify his or her decision to request (again, voluntarily) de-adminning from a Steward, which in essence makes this non-policy procedure ineffective — if in the end the Admin decides not to go along with it for whatever reason. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 22:49, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's not my understanding of the policies describing how a steward acts, but I'll take it under consideration, thanks. As to policies and procedures and voluntary efforts and what not, since Wikipedia is a volunteer based organisation I think all our policies are voluntarily based, no? Let's let us volunteer to act as we will, and eventually we might describe how we act and call it policy. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 14:59, 3 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Let me go into more detail, then: the Stewards have different approaches to projects under different circumstances. For the English-language Wikipedia, a highly developed project, with a local ArbCom and an extensive policy for conflict resolution, the circumstances in which a Steward will de-sysop anyone are as follows: (a) voluntary; (b) ArbCom decision (policy-based); (c) Executive decision from Jimbo Wales (who may de-sysop the user himself, using his Steward access); (d) an OFFICE decision by Danny (who may also de-sysop himself, since he too is a Steward — and also policy-based). That is it. Until (and if) there's a policy change (meaning: something is made into official policy), there's no de-sysopping in this project. If, under any circumstance, a Steward were to do it inadvertedly, this action would most probably be reverted, unless the Admin concerned were to validate it by requesting to remain de-sysopped (so again, voluntary). To be perfectly practical, the way to go here would be to work on making this into policy first, and putting it to practical use second, and not the other way around. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 17:22, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>More to the point, there was an example about a year ago of someone who "voluntarily" reconfirmed their adminship. I believe it involved <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilsor_f92e.html" title="User:Silsor">User:Silsor</a>. The reconfirmation (on RFA) didn't pass, and the stewards declined to act upon it. I can't remember the details but the whole thing was a waste of valuable think time. Ultimately, if I recall correctly, Silsor resigned his adminship voluntarily on <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Requests_for_permissions" class="extiw" title="m:Requests_for_permissions">m:Requests for permissions</a>, and then asked for it back some months later at RFA and got it.</p>
<p>The point being, that as Redux and other have pointed out, the stewards aren't going to desysop anybody unless they request it themselves or it's requested by the arbcom or there's some sort of egregious immediate need to do so. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">The Uninvited</a> Co., <a href="../../../u/n/i/User_talk%7EUninvitedCompany_4866.html" title="User talk:UninvitedCompany">Inc.</a> 20:55, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm confused. We have had two recall requests already, both of which I clerked. Did those of you discussing this review them? They seemed to go smoothly enough and there was no question in anyone's mind whether there were or weren't "6 editors in good standing" to start the process. I'm also not clear on what stewards have to do with it, or what adoption by the community, et al is. This is a grass roots effort and the admins who voluntarily placed themselves in this category all have their own takes on what the process actually is or what happens if a recall is certified. SO help me out here!... especially if you are not yourself in this category, why would you be commenting on how it ought to go? I might be missing something, but remember, being in this category means that you WILL voluntarily resign if the outcome of whatever consensus seeking process you choose to execute is. (or face the wrath of the community for going back on your word, at which point you might well find yourself before ArbCom anyway) Thanks for clarifying this. (and note I am adamantly opposed to this becoming official policy. I'd rather that it just keeps growing grass roots style) ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 21:34, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>well I was outlining what would happen if I met the six people criteria. I'd start an rfc, or a request for recall, ask a crat to close it and then take it from there, if the consensus was go, I'd go. The crat's seem to have misread this and it degenerated into a farce from there on in. I'm happy to let this grow as a grass roots effort, but I'm also naive enough to hope that this will eventually become an accepted practise, and therefore a policy, since that's all our policies are. The point about the stewards is a technical one. A request for desysopping has to go before the stewards, because they are the only ones with the power to desysop. Techinically the stewards can only desysop if a consensus exists or it's a self nom. They can't involve themselves in the politics of the issue, and they shouldn't desysop someone on the same project that they steward. Now the case with the english pedia is muddy, because arb-com are allowed to request desysopping, and no-one is clear on whether that means the community can or cannot desysop. However, that's a side issue, since, as everyone agrees, this is a voluntary category. Anyone requesting a desysop would be doing so voluntarily. the basic principle is that it operates somewhat like how Silsor did it, which some people thought was a waste of time. That this category exists indicates that other people do not. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 22:45, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li><a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">User:crzrussian</a> went through it as well, before BoG did, actually... The outcome for Crz was that 6 people certified and he then immediately (based on his choice of process) requested desysop, which was granted. 2 months later he stood for Admin again via RfA and was confirmed. The outcome for BoG was that the recall failed for want of 6 editors in good standing to certify. (it was, arguably, a recall started in a way that gave the sense that the person starting it was trolling... or more accurately, had a dispute with BoG for things BoG did that were pretty widely supported). As for the desysop itself, I note that in a recent case, ArbCom introduced the notion of "under a cloud" (they found a better name for it) and stated that they felt sysops resigning that way could not just ask for their bit back as sysops resigining who were otherwise in good standing coul,d. I'd say that a desysop request made voluntarily as the outcome of this process would be "under a cloud" and I would have an expectation that 'crats would interpret it that way and not grant a resysop request. (unless the process itself came up with an outcome, consensed to, that the admin needed to take a break for x months but could then start again... and it was now X months later. That would be an odd outcome of the process, but I could see it, if the admin offered it as one of the possible things he would agree to voluntarily and the community chose it) Hope that helps. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 14:28, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>There have actually been (at least) four requests, two clerked and two unclerked. I've created a list <a href="../../../a/d/m/Category_talk%7EAdministrators_open_to_recall_Past_requests_a528.html" title="Category talk:Administrators open to recall/Past requests">here</a>. Like Steve block, I hope that recall will eventually become an accepted practice, and one which applies to all administrators. We're not there yet, but the category's growth is very promising.</p>
<p>Regarding Steve's original post, my opinion is that the most suitable venue for reconfirmation is RfA, where there's already precedent for it:</p>

<p>Seth Ilys and moink reconfirmed while still admins, but announced that if their reconfirmations failed, they would resign. Sarge Baldy resigned his adminship first, then reconfirmed. Either option is open to members of this category. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim_Smith_0e3f.html" title="User:Tim Smith">Tim Smith</a> 22:08, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Thanks everyone. I remember Sarge Baldy's re-run, and I knew about the "under a cloud" arb-com thing, I actually opposed it because it contradicted what I'd been told earlier in that case, that arb-com could remove an admin's powers even though they had voluntarily given them up, but I guess looking at it now it amounts to the same thing, just without the strong language. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 18:34, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I think it might be prudent to suggest that six editors <i>who have never been blocked by the admin in question</i> should be necessary; users who have been blocked could, of course, suggest or support the process, but as it stands now, vandals who are miffed about being blocked count as "editors in good standing", which I don't think is a good idea. Allow them to suggest process, but it would be prudent to require six editors who haven't been blocked by said admin in order for the process to proceed.
