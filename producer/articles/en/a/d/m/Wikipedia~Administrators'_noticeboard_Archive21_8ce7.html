<p>I feel really bad for having to make a minor complaint against a fellow administrator. I don't think it's bad enough for an RfC, so I'm posting it here.</p>
<p>I'll start with the positive comments first. For a few months, Template:Admin2 has been blocking many suspected vandal accounts, often before they are used. However, he often uses "user..." as the block summary. That is not descriptive at all, and it can be confusing for new users. But for the most part, the blocks seem legit.</p>
<p>Non-descriptive block summaries make Wikipedia seem less professional than it really is. If a new user gets blocked with "user..." as the reason, s/he will definitely be very confused. Several users have already complained about these block summaries.</p>
<p>Of course, I can unblock the accounts and re-block them, but I don't feel like doing it with several hundred accounts.</p>
<p>I'd like to hear other users' thoughts on this. --<a href="../../../i/x/f/User%7EIxfd64_14d3.html" title="User:Ixfd64">Ixfd64</a> 02:54, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, the block reason is simply given as "user...". This is clearly a reference to the "usernames" section of the blocking policy.

<li>No, it's not <i>clearly</i> a reference to anything.

<p>This admin has been most unfair to me; I previously posted a single piece of vandalism, and was indefintely blocked (later changed to 48 hours), see <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.9.73.251_74d0.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.9.73.251">Special:Contributions/84.9.73.251</a>. I came back after my ban (changed to 48 hours) and posted an edit to show that I was back to be helpful (see contributions), and then left a message for jtdril effectively questioning whether he could really have thought my rather light hearted edit summary could really have been considered "[an] implication that [I] engage in sexual abuse, may leave [me] liable to police investigation and criminal prosecution.". For this alone, I was almost immediately blocked again (or at least my previous ip was), for "legal claims". Surely, if anyone, it is jtdril that has been making "legal claims". How on earth is a "vandal" supposed to reform when one gets this sort of treatment? And I wouldn't be suprised if jtdril's actions are endorsed for this, while this ip gets banned for "circumventing a ban" or similar nonsense, but I would at least like a proper sort of justification. 84.9.93.27 00:43, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>While "defamatory claims" (from the IP talk page) is certaintly the wrong description, jtdirl explains his reasoning <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3APakaran&amp;diff=32035583&amp;oldid=31936909" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3APakaran&amp;diff=32035583&amp;oldid=31936909" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Given that and the message left with the block, I wonder why the ip edit hasn't been deleted. I think it also would've been helpful if jtdirl had briefly explained that reason before someone else asked, as the explaination isn't necessarily obvious. --<a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMairi_7ec6.html" title="User:Mairi">Mairi</a> 01:13, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am impressed that an anonymous editor with only three edits in total–including the complaint above–was able to correctly assemble such a thorough defacement of <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trials_of_Saddam_Hussein_4c1e.html" title="Trials of Saddam Hussein">Trials of Saddam Hussein</a>, including modification/replacement of several images and correct wikisyntax throughout. Use of an edit summary (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Trials_of_Saddam_Hussein&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=31925720" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Trials_of_Saddam_Hussein&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=31925720" rel="nofollow">I LIKE TO WANK SMALL BOYS - YES I DO - I LIKE TO PLAY WITH THEIR WILLIES</a>) is also commended.</dd>
<dd>I would like to extend congratulations to the many editors who have assembled and refined our documentation and help pages over the years. If a new user is able to assimilate such advanced techniques so rapidly, the transparency and ease-of-use of our editing tools must be truly incredible. Worthy of mention as well is the anon's ability to find <i>this</i> page for his complaint, and his ability to use a correctly-formed Special:Contributions wikilink on it. Obviously our dispute resolution guidelines are extremely clear and concise.</dd>
<dd>Such a talented and fast-learning editor should be able to find more productive outlets for his expertise, and will no doubt appreciate that our administrators are very busy and have other urgent concerns. He will surely understand that refraining from doing dumb things in the future is an excellent way to avoid further blocks.</dd>

<dd>An experienced editor like yourself probably knows that Wikipedia is philosophically opposed to the notion of "punishment"; that wasn't why you were blocked. I used the word "interesting" as a civil euphemism for "displeasing". And <i>that</i> was when I assumed you did regret it, but merely omitted to say so through social ineptness.

<dd>Well, at the minimum there should have been a contact address (e.g. email). In any case, the current pic shows the logo as part of a building, and I believe this is OK copyrightwise, although I am not sure about the laws in Singapore. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_73_2ea7.html" title="User:Chris 73">Chris 73</a> | <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChris_73_0282.html" title="User talk:Chris 73">Talk</a> 11:33, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am not a lawyer and do not wish to become involved in this situation, but logos are considered fair use under U.S. law, and the servers are hosted in the U.S. I'm pretty sure they can't restrict people from publishing a photo of their building with their logo once it's been taken. You should probably forward this to <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_4e16.html" title="User:Danny">Danny</a>, who if I remember correctly, asked that all mailings dealing with legal issues be forwarded to him so that the appropriate people can take care of it.

<dd>I would like to clarify, that the logo in question was actually Image:Singapore Police Force Logo.png, which I uploaded on wikipedia claiming fairuse of a logo, although I was unsure if it infringes on Singaporean copyright laws. The logo was displayed in the said article on 18 November 2004 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Singapore_Police_Force&amp;diff=7749825&amp;oldid=7594386" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Singapore_Police_Force&amp;diff=7749825&amp;oldid=7594386" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. On 11 November 2005, I sent an email to the SPF to make an enquiry on an unrelated matter. A few emails were exchanged, asking me for which publication I was making my enquiry for. On 22 November 2005, an anon deleted the logo wih no comment left <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Singapore_Police_Force&amp;diff=28970653&amp;oldid=28547910" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Singapore_Police_Force&amp;diff=28970653&amp;oldid=28547910" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, and I subsequently reverted it on the same day thinking it was an act of vandalism <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Singapore_Police_Force&amp;diff=28977303&amp;oldid=28970653" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Singapore_Police_Force&amp;diff=28977303&amp;oldid=28970653" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. On 24 November, I received an email from the SPF informing me that they have removed the logo due to alleged infringement of copyright, as well as issuing a warning over the unauthorised use of "any images, text and statistics from the Singapore Police Force website and all its publications". Unsure if I had indeed infringed on any copyright, I left the article as it is, and went about seeking a replacement to resolve the issue. No message was ever writtern in wikipedia informing others over the copyright infringement issue, and I admit my lapse in bringing the issue to the attention of others.</dd>

<p>There is apparently a concerted effort at the chat forums of http://www.planet-rugby.com to continually vandalize Wikipedia. A post to that forum, dated 12/21/05, entitled "Attn: Girv Gang", calls for comments on <a href="../../../g/i/r/Talk%7EGirvan_Dempsey_0629.html" title="Talk:Girvan Dempsey">Talk:Girvan Dempsey</a>. The articles edited by these folks invariably add nothing but POV text -- either in the form of effusive praise (which may possibly be "taking the piss") or in the form of direct attacks -- to a pre-existing stub about a rugby player. The same post calls for the continual recreation of the Planet Rugby and/or the Planet Rugby Chat Forum article, which was deleted by consensus (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Planet_Rugby_Chat_Forum_3997.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Planet Rugby Chat Forum">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Planet Rugby Chat Forum</a>).

<p>I just noticed that my account already has pagemove permisions, except I only registered my account about 30 minutes ago, the waitlist for pagemove permissions seems to have vanished, probably after the last server crash, perhaps someone wants to recreate the waitlist before other people notice this, the vandals could have a field day with this bug--<a href="../../../1/_/u/User%7E1_use.html" title="User:1 use">1 use</a> 17:50, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Copy and paste <i>moves</i> are very frowned on since the history is lost.

<dd>This was talked about yesterday, and <a href="../../../l/i/e/Liel_Kolet_c3e3.html" title="Liel Kolet">Liel Kolet</a> was the more appropriate article. No problems since <a href="../../../l/i/e/Liel.html" title="Liel">Liel</a> is still there as a likely redirect unless i'm mistaken.<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist">karmafist</a> 04:11, 23 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>karmafist, I am not complaining about the move being made. I have no opinion about that at all. I am checking if something needs to be undone/redone by an admin to preserve the page history to comply with GFDL. <a href="../../../p/f/c/User%7EPfctdayelise_e220.html" title="User:Pfctdayelise">pfctdayelise</a> 04:14, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Gotcha, I'll check it now, although making a page into a redirect doesn't do anything to edit histories. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist">karmafist</a> 04:58, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>... so, in this case (since the redirect will carry its own history) it's sufficient to simply merge. There should be a reference to the pre-redirect history of the other article from the composite article's history (it's sufficient to note this on the talk page). If one of them were being deleted, the story is different (procedure is described at <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_fix_cut_and_paste_moves_8038.html" title="Wikipedia:How to fix cut and paste moves">Wikipedia:How to fix cut and paste moves</a>). -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_f5f2.html" title="User:Rick Block">Rick Block</a> <small>(<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERick_Block_ba04.html" title="User talk:Rick Block">talk</a>)</small> 05:52, 23 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I have fixed this. All edits on the topic of the musician have been moved to <a href="../../../l/i/e/Liel_Kolet_c3e3.html" title="Liel Kolet">Liel Kolet</a>. <a href="../../../l/i/e/Liel.html" title="Liel">Liel</a> is now a historyless redirect, and thus not a cause for concern if it needs to become a disambiguation page later.

<p>I have informed all the users with the checkuser ability under advice given by <a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelestianpower_d90c.html" title="User:Celestianpower">Celestianpower</a> to run a CheckUser on <a href="../../../m/c/f/User%7EMcfly85_4985.html" title="User:Mcfly85">Mcfly85</a>. As you all know, this user "claims" to have NEVER once opened an IP address to vandalize; list of IP addresses that vandalized my user page are suspects. I also suspect he created/opened accounts to vandalize too. A few days ago I was <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_SWD316_2_fb43.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/SWD316 2">running for adminship</a> and he got on there and edited. Mcfly85, Rock09 and Sigma995 all voted oppose when well noted administrators and others voted support. I suspect Mcfly has vandalized my user page <b>9</b> times. You can see conflicts there at <a href="../../../s/w/d/User_talk%7ESWD316_2795.html" title="User talk:SWD316">my talk page</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_SWD316_2_fb43.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/SWD316 2">my RFA</a>. I posted these accusations here at the Administrators' noticeboard and nothing was done because of lack of evidence and supporting vandalism. Well, today <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanes_f250.html" title="User:Banes">Banes</a> noticed something interesting. He posted:</p>

And, less interestingly, the history of <a href="../../../w/a/y/Wayne_Newton_b0ac.html" title="Wayne Newton">Wayne Newton</a>. I just thought this might interest you.</i></p>
<p>It was where Mcfly85 and Rock09 edited the same articles simultaneously. Rock09 vandalized the articles and Mcfly85 does clean-up. Suspicious that an article like Frank Beard, an article with 11 edits has edits by Rock09 and Mcfly85 simultaneously. I dont propose a block on Mcfly85 since he technically never vandalized anything but a ChechUser to see if he created sockpuppets for vandalizing. Can anyone please run a <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/CheckUser" class="extiw" title="m:CheckUser">CheckUser</a> on him?</p>

<p>Despite his indication that he has quit, Mcfly85 continues to try to vote and add comments to influence SWD316's most recent RfA (which I brought to try to restore some procedural justice). (See <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_SWD316_3_135a.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/SWD316 3">Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/SWD316 3</a> -- for which I'm myself voting neutral on.) Celestianpower believes that the vote is valid, while Howcheng and I believe the vote is invalid. What's the thought from the peanut gallery?</p>
<p>Also, should Mcfly85 and/or the additional sock puppets be blocked in light of this? Should a <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERfAr_c2e7.html" title="WP:RfAr">WP:RfAr</a> be brought? --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 03:58, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Update: Mcfly85 continued to insist on voting/commenting, and I've blocked him for three hours in light of this. <b>Please</b>, folks, put in your comments on this, as I need to know before the block expires whether to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Allow his vote to stand;</li>
<li>Strike the vote;</li>
<li>Block him for longer period or;</li>
<li>Do something else.</li>
</ol>
<p>I am not sure that I'm handling the situation correctly, but it seems just wrong to allow Mcfly85's vote to stand in light of what had happened. Still, input is requested. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 04:07, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think his vote should be counted or remain on the page even. However as it is generally known that he ruined the first RfA it doesn't do much harm. I'm tempted to just block Mcfly85 indefinitely but it is SWD316's place to make a complaint or Request for Arbitration. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> 04:14, 17 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>Update: I've decided to go ahead and bring a <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERfAr_c2e7.html" title="WP:RfAr">WP:RfAr</a> asking for an emergency ruling on this. Obviously, the ArbCom might not make a ruling quickly enough. Mcfly85 has since made an apology to me and to SWD316 on our talk pages (as well as on his own). I've indicated that I do not want to see him permanently blocked, but that I am still seeking a ruling because I am not 100% sure that my actions were correct.

<li>Because they're in the mainspace.

<p>I hesitate to bring this us but it's all in the news this morning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"THE FOUNDER of Wikipedia, Jimmy Wales has been tinkering with his own biography to remove things he doesn’t like, and make himself the hero, it's claimed. Technology writer Rogers Cadenhead looking for a Yuletide exclusive, has been digging around the public edit logs of Wikipedia and discovered that Wales has edited his biography 18 times. Though some Wikipedia editors believe that it's always wrong to edit subjects in which you are involved, Wales does not seem to think so, claims Cadenhead. One of the things Wales didn’t like were some phrases describing former Wikipedia employee Larry Sanger as a co-founder of the site. He also tinkered with a description of a search site he founded called Bomis, which included a section with adult photos called "Bomis Babes," it's claimed. In an interview with Wired News, Wales acknowledged he's made changes to his bio, but said the edits were made to correct factual errors and provide a more rounded version of events. He said that people shouldn’t do it, including him and he wished he hadn’t as it was in poor taste." <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=28474" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=28474" rel="nofollow">[22]</a></p>

<p>I figure this merely shows that Jimbo, like all of us, gets carried away with Wikipedia at times. Unfortunately, though, Wikipedia haters are going to use this against us.

<dd>Of course what is generally overlooked in the media is that I edit under my own account, widely known, and all edits were made on an equal footing with other editors, and all edits were publicly known and discussed. I regret making the edits now, because I have always thought it in poor taste to edit one's own bio, but I stand by the quality of the edits and by my conduct in the discussion of the edits. I am very sympathetic to those who find factual errors about themselves in Wikipedia, because it happens to me. It's a tough thing to sit on one's hands and do nothing but complain on the talk page, but that's what I plan to do from now on.--<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> 15:14, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I also noticed that the media didn't mention the fact that you edited the article under your own name. The articles make is sound like this reporter did some amazing investigating.

<dd>I think Jimbo editing his own userpage is totally different to Adam Curry editing the podcast article using an anonymous IP. Perhaps there should be a guideline that specifies the conditions of editing your own bio. Personally, I think there is not problem with editing your own bio as long as the community is aware who made the changes. The problem of course with this kind of media coverage is that the distinction is too nuanced for sites like the inquirer (let's not even talk about the register) to understand. I'm kind of dissapointed that Wired didn't have more of a clue, though. At the end of the day, Wikipedia might be getting a lot of bad press recently, but that <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;range=3m&amp;size=large&amp;compare_sites=&amp;y=p&amp;url=wikipedia.org" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;range=3m&amp;size=large&amp;compare_sites=&amp;y=p&amp;url=wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">doesn't</a> seem to be harming us&#160;;) <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacoplane_198a.html" title="User:Jacoplane">Jacoplane</a> 18:43, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I see no harm in editing your own biography if it needs editing and you adhere to Wikipedia policies. It is entirely possible to take a NPOV on at least some aspects of yourself.

<p>I would think that edits to your own bio could actually be <i>helpful</i>. I see a lot of bio changes that are ...well... just strange. If I saw an edit like that, and noticed it was the subject of the bio that made it, then I would know at least that the subject didn't find it insulting, and I wouldn't have to research it to verify it. --<a href="../../../s/s/d/User%7ESsd_e9c6.html" title="User:Ssd">ssd</a> 08:43, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What evidence is there that they were used to unfairly stack debates? I thought that "AFD is not a vote" therefore making such a claim irrelevant. It should be logic, not numbers, that wins through. From what I can gather, they edited totally different articles, had different views, and on just a handful of occasions had similarity with votes - less than 5 AFDs.

<dd>These people are friends (in the <a href="../../../u/k/_/UK_7642.html" title="UK">UK</a>) who have sometimes supported each other in article disputes or voted the same way in vfds, but actually I think thats a pretty normal thing for friends to do? If it is prohibited for friends to have similar beliefs or to give their opinion in a dispute that a friend has been having it should be stated that friends should avoid voting in the same vfds or joining in the same disputes. All these people have made positive edits and I think it is a pretty bad injustice to continue these blocks. Arniep 02:33, 22 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Even as friends versus sockpuppet accounts, they would be called "Meatpuppets". See <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html#Meatpuppets" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK#Meatpuppets</a> for the relevant description. Basically, meatpuppets act like sockpuppets, even if they are the same person, and the <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAR_b522.html" title="WP:RFAR">arbitrators</a>, along with most admins, treat meatpuppets the same as sockpuppets. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">D</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><b>e</b></a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">ath</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 14:26, 22 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Please can you provide this evidence publicly, as its accuracy is being heavily disputed here. There is quite a lot of evidence that they could not theoretically be the same person, such as the evidence that <a href="../../../r/a/c/User%7ERachelBrown_1109.html" title="User:RachelBrown">User:RachelBrown</a> last edited on 10 December 2005, that they edited at the same times and so forth. It is possible that they all use the same ISP service, and that their IP addresses circle through. I am sure that there are several thousand Wikipedia editors who have at one point in time used the same IP address as me, because mine cycles, so does that make them all my sock puppets? It is a great stretch of the imagination, and, as stated elsewhere, the circumstances of this make it highly suspicious. This evidence needs to be made public. I ask that all blocks be overturned immediately pending a thorough investigation in to the matter, and to enable the affected users to participate in appropriate RfCs, RfArs et al that concerned them, which is a large part of the issue here. The link between these users is about as tentative as the link that Lulu of the Lotus Eaters, SlimVirgin and yourself are all the same person, just because you occasionally overlap with opinions. It is, in other words, a nonsense claim. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 16:57, 22 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I have reviewed the evidence in this case, and agree with the conclusion reached by <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindspillage_87a5.html" title="User:Mindspillage">Mindspillage</a>. Either all of these editors are the same person, or several people all of whom share the same workplace, residence, and (apparently) a single computer. There is one point in the log where in the course of nine minutes three distinct accounts edited from the same IP, and multiple instances of two distinct accounts editing from the same IP within the space of two to five minutes. We've only heard one flatmate suggested; am I to believe that there are three (or more) people all sharing the same workplace and residence, the same obsession with the same topic, and who carefully coordinate their edits so as never to interleave them? No, the most probable conclusion is that this is a single person. Any other conclusion multiplies entities unnecessarily. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 06:12, 23 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Very bad conclusions there. My understanding is that <a href="../../../r/a/c/User%7ERachelBrown_1109.html" title="User:RachelBrown">User:RachelBrown</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/e/User%7EPoetlister_675f.html" title="User:Poetlister">User:Poetlister</a> are friends, although I gather that they do not live together (they might, I don't know), but they do visit each other. The "IP address" that you refer to is RachelBrown's IP, which was published once because she forgot to log back in, or Wikipedia accidentally logged her out. I shall clarify this for you to avoid confusion. <a href="../../../8/1/2E/User%7E81.153.41.72.html" title="User:81.153.41.72">User:81.153.41.72</a> is the IP that belongs to <a href="../../../r/a/c/User%7ERachelBrown_1109.html" title="User:RachelBrown">User:RachelBrown</a>. <a href="../../../p/o/e/User%7EPoetlister_675f.html" title="User:Poetlister">User:Poetlister</a> visits RachelBrown regularly, and they likely used the same computer. Thus, it is quite likely that these "3" users (really 2 people) may have got on to the same computer. Just to explain this a bit more explicitly here for people who are confused - Rachel Brown was logged in when Giselle (Poetlister - her name does not seem to be Lisa) asked to log in and have a go. Then afterwards Rachel Brown wanted to have a go, but for some reason Wikipedia didn't log her in properly. This is the very obvious explanation which had already previously been explained at the time that it happened. There was no sock puppetry as they never once pretended that the IP address did not belong to RachelBrown. All edits by that IP address were made by RachelBrown. Am I to understand it that it is illegal for an editor to ever accidentally log out? Or is it illegal for an editor to be friends with another Wikipedia editor? As for the other 3, it has been explained to me that Londoneye was Rachel Brown's cousin and may have visited her once or twice, and may have used Wikipedia whilst editing. The other two don't know Rachel Brown other than that they used to know each other at University. I suspect that they just happen to use the same ISP, as if they went to university together then they probably live in the same area. I think that you would agree that all using the same ISP is not a crime. It also should be noted that the above user, <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">User:Kelly Martin</a> is not neutral to this case. Indeed, she was the person to whom <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">User:SlimVirgin</a> made the request to have these people banned. See here: <a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html#User-check_request" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">User_talk:Kelly_Martin#User-check_request</a>. Thus Kelly Martin is an inappropriate person to make a review, as she likely simply told Mindspillage to ban them all. Indeed, it seems that Mindspillage's involvement was simply as messenger, as she seems to have no idea of the underlying problems surrounding this. Checking their contributions for the 5 users in question, <a href="../../../r/a/c/User%7ERachelBrown_1109.html" title="User:RachelBrown">RachelBrown</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/c/User_talk%7ERachelBrown_0886.html" title="User talk:RachelBrown">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RachelBrown_8825.html" title="Special:Contributions/RachelBrown">contribs</a>), <a href="../../../p/o/e/User%7EPoetlister_675f.html" title="User:Poetlister">Poetlister</a> (<a href="../../../p/o/e/User_talk%7EPoetlister_8375.html" title="User talk:Poetlister">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Poetlister_0819.html" title="Special:Contributions/Poetlister">contribs</a>), <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELondoneye_eeac.html" title="User:Londoneye">Londoneye</a> (<a href="../../../l/o/n/User_talk%7ELondoneye_f33c.html" title="User talk:Londoneye">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Londoneye_0685.html" title="Special:Contributions/Londoneye">contribs</a>), <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxwoman_c5ae.html" title="User:Taxwoman">Taxwoman</a> (<a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxwoman_ecec.html" title="User talk:Taxwoman">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Taxwoman_8402.html" title="Special:Contributions/Taxwoman">contribs</a>) and <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewport_447f.html" title="User:Newport">Newport</a> (<a href="../../../n/e/w/User_talk%7ENewport_2ad9.html" title="User talk:Newport">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Newport_4237.html" title="Special:Contributions/Newport">contribs</a>) they edited vastly different topics and acted in completely different, often opposing ways to each other, with no coordination whatsoever. Whilst Poetlister and RachelBrown did occasionally support each other, it was not consistent, and it is incorrect to state that they acted as "one voice". The IP address belonging to RachelBrown did act as "one voice" with RachelBrown, but that should not be a surprise, since RachelBrown was just kicked off Wikipedia a few times. Any other claims about them acting as "one voice" are blatantly false. I have reviewed every edit made by all 5 users, and I encourage everyone else to do the same. Indeed, <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxwoman_c5ae.html" title="User:Taxwoman">Taxwoman</a> (<a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxwoman_ecec.html" title="User talk:Taxwoman">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Taxwoman_8402.html" title="Special:Contributions/Taxwoman">contribs</a>)'s edits were so vastly different to that of RachelBrown's that they could more accurately be described as enemies. The exception, however, is that they at one point in time clearly did call each other on the phone to ask each other to vote on the various Jewish lists, something which was likely organised by Rachel Brown. Thus, for those specific AFDs there is a possibility of meat puppeting. Thus, these Jewish lists should be relisted for deletion, with the 5 user names forbidden from voting. I think that this would be an appropriate result. I would also ask you to investigate matters properly in the future, as you seem to have made some grave errors in this case. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 11:41, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If we assumed good faith, as the admins in question order others to do, we would assume they were simply young women who knew each other and sometimes used the same PC to edit WP. We would all move on. The "debates" that were "stacked" will be fixed some other way. The people involved don't lose "debates" because they have far too many friends they can call on if they look like they will. So let's leave the accounts in question unblocked, let Slim and Lulu actually prove the merits of their case regardless how many sockpuppets oppose them, because if they're right, they're right and as Zordrac says, we don't decide who's right by numbers, right?

For reasons best know to him or herself, the operator of the account is pretending to be involved in a dispute, so someone is playing silly buggers, and all I know is it's not me and it's not Lulu; beyond that I neither know nor care.

<p>Hm. First off, Kelly didn't order me to do anything. (As a volunteer I don't suppose I can really be ordered to do anything, but sometimes people ask me to do specific things&amp;mdashsuch as looking into potentially problematic situations—that I have volunteered to do in general, and I usually agree to do so.) Someone else asked me (in private, so as not to be harassed) to look at the relevant evidence to see if I thought that it suggested sockpuppets. Their IP evidence (for which the specifics are private) very strongly suggested it, and their all weighing in those AfDs was thus against policy, so I placed the block. (Yes, I am aware the rest of their editing is on different topics: that doesn't necessarily mean anything.) When it was questioned from multiple sources, I asked Kelly to sanity check by reviewing the evidence to see if I had been too hasty, but instead she concurred with it. There's not much more I can say about it; I have no interest in the dispute, and none of the accounts have contacted me to either question or protest. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindspillage_87a5.html" title="User:Mindspillage">Mindspillage</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMindspillage_c644.html" title="User talk:Mindspillage">(spill yours?)</a> 07:02, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I ran across what may be plagiarism by a newspaper entertainment reporter of a good chunk of a Wikipedia article. In an article in the Honolulu Star Bulletin (<a href="http://starbulletin.com/2005/12/22/features/story05.html" class="external text" title="http://starbulletin.com/2005/12/22/features/story05.html" rel="nofollow">"'243' is horrific Aloha flight story"</a> by Tim Ryan, dated December 22, 2005) a solid 138 of Ryan's 456 words (30%) appear to be nearly identical to our article on <a href="../../../a/l/o/Aloha_Flight_243_d686.html" title="Aloha Flight 243">Aloha Flight 243</a>.</p>
<p>I've put together a side-by-side comparison of the remarkably similar sections at <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_Aloha_Dupe_304b.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades/Aloha Dupe">User:TenOfAllTrades/Aloha Dupe</a>. The passages in our article were added by at least four separate editors over a five-month period, so I consider it unlikely that the Star Bulletin reporter is reusing his own work. The last duplicated section was added to Wikipedia six months ago–in May of this year–suggesting that our article is the original source. (A quick search reveals no other online content from which both authors might have drawn the passages in question.)</p>
<p>I have a few requests.</p>
<ul>
<li>Please don't send angry frothing emails to the Star Bulletin until we've figured out what we want to do here.</li>
<li>Is there a plausible alternate explanation? (Is <i>our</i> article 'clean'?)</li>
<li>How should we handle this? Whom should we contact, and who will be our spokesperson?</li>

<dd>If they use our material, by the GFDL, the <i>have</i> to credit The Project. Their failure to do so is a violation of our copyright here.

<dd>This has nothing to do with plagiariam; rather it's a straightforward copyright matter. A polite email to the newspaper telling them that they can use our copyright material freely <i>subject to the GFDL</i> would be enough. Possibly a sub-editor or reporter has copied our text without acknowledgement, in which case a bit of re-education is in order. But it's also possible that one of the authors of our piece submitted his own work to the newspaper and to us--which he's perfectly entitled to do as far as the GFDL is concerned. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 23:55, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I suspect that some of the other stories are verbatim (or near-verbatim) extracts from a press release that both writers were given, rather than copying of the other writers' work. While such behaviour is lazy and dishonest and does a disservice to the reader, it's seen by many journalists as 'acceptable' plagiarism.</dd>

<p>I'd just like to drop a note here that I have occassionally seen a vandal insert a bunch of trash and then remove <i>most</i> of it, in what might be an attempt to sneak vandalism in past the RC patrollers.

<p><a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Stanek_3b54.html" title="Robert Stanek">Robert Stanek</a> has found Wikipedia, woe is us. He's a (self/small-press)-published author who's written a bunch of generic fantasy novels such as Ruin Mist (along with some computer-related non-fiction).</p>
<p>He's slightly (in)famous for what some people <i>claim</i> is the use of sockpuppets to prop-up his Amazon reviews (e.g., see: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1575450429/qid=1135358592/sr=1-5/ref=sr_1_5/002-9004627-9214425?s=books&amp;v=glance&amp;n=283155" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1575450429/qid=1135358592/sr=1-5/ref=sr_1_5/002-9004627-9214425?s=books&amp;v=glance&amp;n=283155" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>), along with some mysterious reviews that appear of other, much more popular fantasy books, that in effect, say, "A wonderful book in the tradition of the giants of fantasy fiction, like Tolkein, George R.R. Martin, and Robert Stanek!". This sort of thing has been noticed by SF-commentators like <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Langford_8cb2.html" title="David Langford">David Langford</a> (<a href="http://news.ansible.co.uk/a219.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.ansible.co.uk/a219.html" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>).</p>

<li>Yeah, I just did another pass. My feeling is that I've no objection to this sort of thing being in "List of yadda yadda" articles, but you can't put Stanek on a short list with C.S. Lewis, Tolkien, and J.K. Rowling and expect us to accept it. A related problem, by the way, is that there is a growing group of Ruin Mist articles -- Dwarves (Ruin Mist), Dragons (Ruin Mist), etc. These don't really seem notable enough to me to have their own article; it would be more proper for them to be merged in to a single Ruin Mist entry. I've done the work of culling the herd in Whatlinkshere -- does someone else want to take a hit for the team and figure out a way to coalesce this stuff without biting the newbies? <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 06:46, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

An Admin who gave no warning (at all) blocked me this morning for a past 'offense' (currently in ArbCom...with 0 votes for and 3 against even hearing the matter in the first place). This same Admin is completely new to the issue, and apparently is just emotional for some reason. She is also a *former* member of the ArbCom, and so my guess is that she disagrees with all of the votes against (and...yes!...none "for") even hearing the matter. An ex post facto ArbCom 'vote' is apparently where she's coming from...but clearly and highly inappropriately.</i></dd>

<dd>I think that AustinKnight was trying to shut me up because whenever I clarified the applicable law, it undercut his POV. He really hated that. So, he targeted me, the editor of the article with (arguably) the most legal knowledge, so that he could shut me down and go back to pushing his POV. Well, mission accomplished, via the personal attack. It was a doubly irresponsible personal attack in my case. After tracing my IP, AustinKnight knew I worked in a court. He knows, or should know, that we get (death) threats from kooks all the time. These can't be brushed off, at least since Judge Lefkow's husband and mother were murdered. I have a panic button in my office that will summon armed marshals to burst into the room, precisely for that reason.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Of course, he didn't threaten violence, but he made it clear that he hated me for what I was doing and was unscrupulous enough to make threats against me. That's enough to put my nerves on edge.</dd>

<dl>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>On another note, is it just me or are some of AustinKnight's comments very misogynistic? (e.g. "fearful woman response", "she is acting emotionally for some reason") I fear that this editor may have some problems with women editors (and particularly, administrators) on wikipedia in the future.</dd>

<dd>I followed this incident very carefully after stumbling upon it by chance. I feel that AustinKnight has not only been obnoxious, xenofobic and mysoginistic but also made Personal Attacks against <a href="../../../u/l/p/User%7EUlpian_bb80.html" title="User:Ulpian">Ulpian</a> (Then an anon user), threatening him with going to his employer. After being called on it, AK not only defended his position, but he proceded to attack the people that confronted him. I think he shouldn't be unblocked, especially after pulling a very sneaky (and unethical?) move trying to get admins to unblock him by providing them with a very biased view. AK displays blatant disregard for WP policies and shows that he is in fact a person who is more interested in looking for trouble than in contributing valuably. For more information, please go to his talk page where you'll see that shortly before this incident he goes on and on ranting against Jimbo and the evils of WP. I think that since he was so annoyed by our policies and procedures (and showed it by ignoring them blatantly), he deserves the block until he truthfully apologizes. Then he should be put in probation until he proves he can contribute within WP limits. <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESebastiankessel_8c89.html" title="User:Sebastiankessel">Sebastian Kessel</a> <sup><i><a href="../../../s/e/b/User_talk%7ESebastiankessel_cf55.html" title="User talk:Sebastiankessel">Talk</a></i></sup> 22:34, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As the blocking administrator, I stand by this block. AustinKnight was making serious threats against another contributor who disagreed with him, and his comments on his talk page were very clear that he was completely unrepentant and would do it again - despite having been warned and asked nicely many, many times. The arbitration committee quite clearly felt that there was no need to hear the case <i>because</i> the community could deal with it with a ban by acclamation. I then proceeded to do so, and I note that as of this moment that block still stands. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 00:40, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Me too. I've been reading User talk:AustinKnight. If the user recants his threats and personal attacks, fine. If he can show that he <i>is</i> as superior to women, wikipedians, Australians, admins, Europeans, and lefties as he thinks, even better: then he must be a real asset to the project. If neither, why keep him around? <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 01:52, 26 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I do also. Threats are not on, and I've reviewed the way the author has posted to Wikipedia. Basically, they don't want to play nicely with others, and I strongly suggest that you see his messages on Jimbo's talk page (though Jimbo can look after himself, I know, I know...). I support Ambi in the block. Please note that I've had some pretty heated conversations on his talk page, so you might need to take that into consideration. The heated conversation occured because he threatened another editor, however. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 01:23, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've done my part and using this page and the mass-watch tool, I have added close to 2000 previously unwatched pages to my watchlist. I'll be adding more as they become available (apparently you can only view the first 1000 on the list so if you are waiting to see whats under "S" everything before that needs to be watched first). Perhaps someone should create a page to help divide things up. Maybe a list of names of those currently watching a lot of pages, and somewhere you can put the name of pages you are watching but have no real interest in. - Trevor MacInnis (Talk | Contribs) 12:21, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, but offensiveness isn't the criterion. Never has been. The criterion is, basically, civility.

<dd>To some extent, yes, but I really do think that the policy is ultimately silly - we are an encyclopedia, editors are expected to take the project seriously, and, for the most part, professionally. Profanity, generally speaking, does not contribute to that, although there are circumstances in which it is merely not good as opposed to bad, and these can generally be figured out by anyone with a modicum of social intelligence. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Phil Sandifer</a> 06:19, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Basically, yes, though I'd still use "incivil" over "offensive," just because offensiveness is ultimately a matter of personal taste, whereas civility is more objective. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Phil Sandifer</a> 06:26, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ah, no. It's a widely-shared IP and should not be blocked for more than a very short time to deal with vandalism in progress at the actual time. Do a whois and see who it belongs to.

<dd>Describe how that was a violation. I was very careful in how I wrote that.

<dd>It still shows up in the edit history. I will also note <i>and should</i> especially <i>not confer that trust to someone who many people feel is usually wrong—perhaps they have a good reason for feeling that way?</i> from the second paragraph. It is in the policy/guidelines regarding NPOV to not use many people/some say in articles as it is merely a crutch to not have to <b>cite actual sources for facts</b> and to push a particular POV. This is followed by a statement that Everyking should have <i>special trust</i> granted to him as his views are <i>in general accordance with those of the broader community.</i> Is there any evidence to back up this claim? It seems to me that this was a major issue in the cited Arbitration decision. <a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWAvegetarian_a804.html" title="User:WAvegetarian">WAvegetarian</a> <a href="../../../w/a/v/User_talk%7EWAvegetarian_1514.html" title="User talk:WAvegetarian"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> <small><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_WAvegetarian_f393.html" title="Special:Emailuser/WAvegetarian">(email)</a>&lt;/small&gt; <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WAvegetarian_0ea5.html" title="Special:Contributions/WAvegetarian"><sup>(contribs)</sup></a> 06:50, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</small>

<dd><small>What difference does the history make? I decided it might get me in trouble, decided "better safe than sorry", and removed it within one minute.

On the mentioned page (a community project talk page from which he has not been banned that I know of), Everyking at first left a reasonable comment, which was not addressed to Snowspinner and did not mention Snowspinner or allude to Snowspinner <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3ARequests_for_arbitration%2FXed_2%2FProposed_decision&amp;diff=32314957&amp;oldid=32304910" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3ARequests_for_arbitration%2FXed_2%2FProposed_decision&amp;diff=32314957&amp;oldid=32304910" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>.

<p>Found two users who wish to make these articles reflect the "Skeptical" view. When the "Pro-UFO" editors, the "Pro-Roswell/Alien" editors see this sort of thing going on, there will be a Edit war going on. I've had to help settle a Edit war that had taken place in the <a href="../../../b/i/g/Bigfoot.html" title="Bigfoot">Bigfoot</a> article. That was a real bloody war. Told both Users this: The object is <b>NOT</b> to prove or disprove these matters, only to be encyclopedic.</p>

<dd>It doesn't appear that there is a current edit war, and as such no administrator action is required. If your worried that one might errupt, perhaps you should speak to the potential warriors to encourage them to start discussion. It might help if you could be more specific about what you would like someone to do, who the potential warriors are, and what they did to draw your attention. If an edit war does in fact occur you can report <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> violations at <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_3RR_4b52.html" title="WP:AN/3RR">WP:AN/3RR</a>. --best, kevin <b>[</b><a href="../../../k/z/o/User%7EKzollman_a660.html" title="User:Kzollman">kzollman</a><b>][</b><a href="../../../k/z/o/User_talk%7EKzollman_107b.html" title="User talk:Kzollman">talk</a><b>]</b> 05:28, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I must object most strongly to your claim of having "had to help settle a Edit war that had taken place in the <a href="../../../b/i/g/Bigfoot.html" title="Bigfoot">Bigfoot</a> article" as you were someone who was edit warring to insert your POV and OR into the article, ignoring people explaining why you couldn;t do that, and egging the controversy on. Considering your inability to understand <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> on that article, I find it very unlikely that there are really people trying to make the default view on <a href="../../../u/f/o/UFO_9768.html" title="UFO">UFO</a> and etc. pro-skepticism, as a quick glance there earlier showed no such thing. Having an article not endorse a concept is not the same as it being pro-skeptic. And, really, this whole topic is misplaced here, as there's nothing for an admin to take note of. Please restrain yourself from overzealous posts here, as I see you;ve made plenty here and none of them were relevant to this page's purpose. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 03:58, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I wanted to get a clarification... Does copying and pasting content from IMDB constitute a copyvio? A movie list or episode list I could see as being fair use, but if someone takes an entire review or bio or something verbatim I have a harder time seeing fair use. --<a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 17:05, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is very definitely a copyvio. Imdb explicitly claims copyright on each page. Reviews are unacceptable anyway, as they are opinion. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 17:08, 27 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Absolutely. The only things we should be getting from IMDB are raw facts, not chunks of text. A list of movies is OK (it is <i>pure</i> information) but a bio is not. Of course, we can still check the dates of birth etc, but the text must be our own. <a href="../../../p/h/y/User%7EPhyschim62_966c.html" title="User:Physchim62">Physchim62</a> <a href="../../../p/h/y/User_talk%7EPhyschim62_05f3.html" title="User talk:Physchim62">(talk)</a> 17:32, 27 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>And there have been incidents when the author of the IMDB bio has posted portions thereof here, which is acceptable as (despite IMDB's claim) it's the author that has the copyright.

<dd>One of the big issues with IMDB (and somewhat the same issue with Amazon.com) is that they claim copyright on things that they blatantly can't claim copyright on, for example lists of who the actors were in a movie or the birth date of an actor or actress and in that respect we can use that information since it's raw movie data and it isn't theirs to hold copyright to but other than that we can't use any of their stuff directly copy and pasted. <small><a href="../../../j/t/k/User%7EJtkiefer_5ea4.html" title="User:Jtkiefer"><font color="red">Jtkiefer</font></a><sup><a href="../../../j/t/k/User_talk%7EJtkiefer_123b.html" title="User talk:Jtkiefer"><font color="orange">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jtkiefer_4fd4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jtkiefer"><font color="green">C</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jtkiefer_1273.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jtkiefer"><font color="blue">@</font></a></sup></small> ---- 18:59, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A list of movies can't be copyrighted, but I wouldn't copy-and-paste it straight in anyway. For one thing, it <i>feels</i> like a copyvio, even if it's not. For another, IMDb list all films (if they get it right, that is) and we should be aiming to list only the important ones in a "selected filmography" (otherwise we're just aping IMDb). Finally, the IMDb formatting looks crap when unconverted to wikisyntax. When getting info from IMDb, I always copy down what looks important, and change the formatting. I think that should be the way for everyone to go, rather than just copying and pasting — regardless of the legalities. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 04:48, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>IMDb is also rather stupidly organized in <i><b>reverse</b></i> chronological order. It makes no sense in the context of a biography of an actor to go <i>backwards</i>. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 04:51, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I had placed a non - Wiki source concerning Bigfoot in the Sources section, and a editor had removed it, citing it as "silly" and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>.

<p>Tried to insert it into the <a href="../../../b/i/g/Bigfoot.html" title="Bigfoot">Bigfoot</a> article. As stated, I have, after hearing about the "Fouke Monster" on all manner of media, I have investigated this matter myself. This matter <i>is</i> true. This is one of <i>many</i> sources regarding the thing seen in <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fouke%2C_Arkansas_a1cf.html" title="Fouke, Arkansas">Fouke, Arkansas</a>. This creature is mentioned in <i>many</i> websites and data sites, and this non-wiki source also mentions this thing. To be safe, I have done a Google Search on "Bigfoot,Fouke,AR.". You try it and you see what I'm referring to as well. Appreciate the help. I also have a documentary DVD called <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Legend_of_Boggy_Creek_0657.html" title="The Legend of Boggy Creek">The Legend of Boggy Creek</a></i>. One does'nt grab some heat(guns) to go looking for myths and lies. I have also investigated other really famous paranormal incidents. In Fouke, AR., there <i>is</i> really a creek called <i>Boggy Creek</i>, and this thing has also been seen in Texarkana, Texas/Arkansas (the place is on a state line). There are police incident files on file. How do I cite this ? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartial_Law_9af9.html" title="User:Martial Law">Martial Law</a> 05:57, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This user is repeatedly editing the user pages of people who have left Wikipedia due to his harassment. It seems that he has some friends among administrators, and is allowed to vandalise Wikipedia pages and user pages as he sees fit. I left Wikipedia after I was blocked for reverting his blanking vandalism on the page <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Orlowski_20f6.html" title="Andrew Orlowski">Andrew Orlowski</a>. After that he repeatedly vandalised my user page, and eventually I had my user page deleted in order to stop this person vandalising it any further. I see he is carrying out similar behaviour on <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">User:Zordrac</a>'s page. I'd like to request that he is told to refrain from vandalising other people's user pages, especially those of people who have decided to leave Wikipedia due to his incessant campaigns of harassment.

<dd>DannyWilde (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_DannyWilde_f932.html" title="Special:Contributions/DannyWilde">contribs</a>) leaves out several important facts, and presents as "facts" things that aren't so. Prime among them is that he himself is harassing people, by publishing what he mistakenly believes to be my real name, which he does <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zordrac&amp;diff=32966805&amp;oldid=32965189" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zordrac&amp;diff=32966805&amp;oldid=32965189" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Zordrac&amp;diff=32960610&amp;oldid=32932366" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Zordrac&amp;diff=32960610&amp;oldid=32932366" rel="nofollow">here</a>. This alone should dispel any notion that Danny is acting in good faith. Furthermore, what he is describing as "vandalism" to user pages is actually removing categories created for the purpose of harassment (Category:Users who have left Wikipedia,Category:Users who will probably be using a different account if they ever return, unless the stalking situation is dealt with, Category:Users who will ask a trustworthy administrator to delete this account if they ever make a new account, Category:Users who left Wikipedia due to being victims of stalking, Category:Users who left Wikipedia due to being harassed, Category:Users who were threatened with being banned for helping out others, and Category:Users who tried to make Wikipedia better for everyone, all of which are now up on <a href="../../../c/f/d/WP%7ECFD_d190.html" title="WP:CFD">WP:CFD</a>.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Danny's claims that I am a "vandal" are of course entirely false, as hinted by the fact that he never made any report to <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_in_progress_33dc.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism in progress">Wikipedia:Vandalism in progress</a>. What he calls "vandalism", everyone else calls "content disputes" or in fact "not trying to find loopholes around Wikipedia policy"; for instance, what he calls "blanking vandalism" on <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Orlowski_20f6.html" title="Andrew Orlowski">Andrew Orlowski</a> was in fact removing the entire verbatim contents of the now-deleted article Wikifiddler, which he had <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Andrew_Orlowski&amp;diff=30555445&amp;oldid=30554897" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Andrew_Orlowski&amp;diff=30555445&amp;oldid=30554897" rel="nofollow">merged</a> into Andrew Orlowski a day before the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Wikifiddler_ed07.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Wikifiddler">AfD</a> was to close. I'm sure he also thinks it was "vandalism" that I nominated Andrew Orlowski (journalist) for AfD, as well; that "article" was Danny's copy-and-paste of the entire contents of <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Orlowski_20f6.html" title="Andrew Orlowski">Andrew Orlowski</a> the way <i>he</i> preferred it (with the contents of the now-AfDed Wikifiddler in it) to a new title that should of course been a redirect. Of course, that is a textbook case of a POV fork, and the article was of course deleted by unanimous consensus, but I have no doubt that Danny considers it "vandalism" for which he feels entitled to retaliate by attempts to "out" my personal information (which he has done to other editors as well) and to smear my name, for instance, in the false report he left on this page. I would request that Danny be instructed that misdescribing edits he doesn't like as "vandalism" is not acceptable and that attempting to harass other editors by "outing" what he thinks are their real names and geographic locations is <i>in no way</i> acceptable. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 16:55, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
