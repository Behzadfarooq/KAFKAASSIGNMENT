Shortly after, those four accounts have all requested unblocking, all from the same autoblocked IP address, which for the record doesn't appear to be shared (see contribs and WHOIS).

<dd>Being suspected as a sock to evade an indefinite block on an account is reason enough to block until it is proven or disproven, if I remember correctly. But as these were all autoblocks, then <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good faith</a> should be assumed, until proven otherwise.—<a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryūlóng</a> (<a href="../../../r/y/u/User_talk%7ERyulong_923f.html" title="User talk:Ryulong"><font color="gold">竜龍</font></a>) 10:30, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>A sockfarm is likely; feel free to block specific usernames. I'd give them more time until they give themselves away. All I did was to unblock the IP. <tt><a href="../../../a/w/y/User_talk%7EAwyong_Jeffrey_Mordecai_Salleh_3248.html" title="User talk:Awyong Jeffrey Mordecai Salleh">Kimchi</a>.<a href="../../../s/g/%21/WP%7ESG%21_e9d9.html" title="WP:SG!">sg</a></tt> 10:33, 25 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Keep in mind that it's also possible that this is a family with several Wikipedians, who happen to be interested in DragonBall Z. If this is the case, one would expect them to all have the same IP address and have edited DragonBall Z pages. <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EEli_Falk_9cef.html" title="User:Eli Falk">Eli Falk</a> 10:58, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I will look over the unblock requests to attempt to determine which ones are socks and which ones aren't, but I think it's likely that they ALL are socks.

<dd>Every single one was showing the signs of being a sockpuppet of Taracka. Hell, several users admitted that they'd been on Wikipedia before.

<dd>1) I reserve the right to delete material that constitutes vandalism; 2) I suppose if you want to interpret the guidelines so narrowly as to exclude anyone who isn't explicitly included, you're going to have get very busy here; 3) There are eleven bishops in the Church of Norway, and these are responsible for about 3.5 million parishioners.

<dd>I can't speak for other allegations, but attempting to speedily delete an article about a subject that has prima facie notability clearly - at least in my view - amounts to disrupting Wikipedia. Maybe people here believe that Norway's too small a country to warrant articles in Wikipedia, or that bishops are not really all that important leaders - but that would undoubtedly be a fringe view in the general public. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 00:00, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In my opinion, this article should have been sent to AfD. A bishop of a national church should be sufficient assertion of notability to pass CSD. If there's even vague doubts about CDS - send to AfD.

<dd>Don't be so precious. Its not vandalism to stick a speedy tag on an article no matter how attached to it you are. Frankly, responding in such an extreme way is only denigrating your own complaint and if you don't follow the consensus for delaing with disputed speedy tags you are being disruptive. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpartaz_f576.html" title="User:Spartaz">Spartaz</a> 23:58, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>A good faith effort, even if ill-conceived, to improve the encyclopedia is NEVER vandalism. Unless the user was deliberately mass tagging articles for deletion as a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> or something like that, this isn't vandalism. Your reaction, IMO, was over the top. A <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> request on the user's talk page that they reconsider their position is much better than starting off with a threat. The better way to contest the tag is to (1) add {{<a href="../../../h/a/n/Template%7EHangon_38a0.html" title="Template:Hangon">hangon</a>}} to the article page, (2) explain on the talk page why the person is notable, and (3) leave a civil note on the talk page of the person who tagged the article. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 00:00, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Saying stuff like <i>Speedy delete - even AFD - is way beyond the pale here.</i> + the loose vandalism accusations are not helping Leifern's case here.

<p>Recently a user previously unknown to me has started to revert nearly all my edits after accusing me of an "anti-German crusade". There is no Anti-German_Crusade, I am merely trying to get rid of surplus and unneccesary German terms in the English wikipedia. All my points are valid and logical. Nevetheless, after explaining my point of views in my edit summaries and on talk pages this user refuses to discuss. Instead he adds comments refering to my "crusade" and to the fact that I'm on a revert parole (which I am but that's another story). Could an admin please tell him that he must discuss his changes and stop his accusations and libel?

<dd>Ryūlóng. at the very least it is meatpuppeting. I have filed a formal complaint, but the sockpuppetting complaint page is very backlogged. And notice that they chose a holiday weekend to start this stuff, assuming rightly that very few of the adults would be around to supervise. Yes, DUmmies is a pejorative word for members of Democratic Underground, and indeed some of those editing the article are members of that site. I am not, however, and it appears that you are not either. This seems to be some sort of political game they are playing with Wikipedia in an attempt to force an untrue article about Free Republic to be accepted as consensus by means of a revert war where they wear down the other "side" by having more people doing the reverting. Of course it might also be sockpuppetting as well as at least three of these editors are from Palatine, IL.

<dd>I agree with Ben, and note that Admin Jossi worked long and hard with all of the editors and came up with a balanced NPOV article. As soon as certain pro-free republic editors saw that it would include a small amount of well-sourced criticism they started reverting the article and breaking WP by doing such things as making massive edits and summarizing them as 'spelling corrections' and adding totally unsourced POV claims. I ask that this article remain locked indefinately and all changes submitted and approved by an admin, possibly Jossi, who has acted as a fair and impartial informal mediator to the article for the last several weeks. After the sock/meatpuppetry issues are settled perhaps it can be unlocked. - <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairness_And_Accuracy_For_All_6573.html" title="User:Fairness And Accuracy For All">F.A.A.F.A.</a> 05:01, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>What a surprise. Ben and FAAFA agree with one another.</p>
<p>As always, BenBurch has left out several important details and spin-doctored others in his relentless efforts to make this article as negative as possible. Early in the process, I sought formal mediation and BenBurch rejected it. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:BryanFromPalatine#Request_for_Mediation" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:BryanFromPalatine#Request_for_Mediation" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> BenBurch has acknowledged that he was a member of Democratic Underground before being banned from that site. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:BenBurch&amp;oldid=91914047#No_kidding.3F" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:BenBurch&amp;oldid=91914047#No_kidding.3F" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> The archives of his Talk page are loaded with evidence of his extensive participation in bad faith edits and edit wars. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:BenBurch&amp;oldid=61551524" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:BenBurch&amp;oldid=61551524" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:BenBurch&amp;oldid=91914047" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:BenBurch&amp;oldid=91914047" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> Much the same can be said of his tireless friend, defender and agent in all things Wiki, <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairness_And_Accuracy_For_All_6573.html" title="User:Fairness And Accuracy For All">F.A.A.F.A.</a>, another problem child <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Fairness_And_Accuracy_For_All/Archive2" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Fairness_And_Accuracy_For_All/Archive2" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> -- formerly known as <a href="../../../n/b/g/User%7ENBGPWS_4469.html" title="User:NBGPWS">NBGPWS</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:NBGPWS" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:NBGPWS" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> an abbreviation of "Neocons Be Gone ..." etc. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AFairness_And_Accuracy_For_All%2FArchive2&amp;diff=89013862&amp;oldid=88928249" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AFairness_And_Accuracy_For_All%2FArchive2&amp;diff=89013862&amp;oldid=88928249" rel="nofollow">[12]</a></p>
<p>As the archives of their own Talk pages clearly demonstrate in exhaustive detail, both Ben and FAAFA have extensive track histories of bad faith edits, vandalism, personal attacks and edit warring, that stretch back at least six months. This went so far as directing the following remark to me, and then quickly deleting it after he knew I'd seen it: "Fuck you and the horse you rode in on." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABenBurch&amp;diff=92300325&amp;oldid=92298874" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABenBurch&amp;diff=92300325&amp;oldid=92298874" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> Recently these tactics have evolved into the use of warning templates and even a sockpuppet investigation as vehicles for harassment.</p>
<p>They invited an informal mediator of their choosing to the Free Republic dispute and, rather than acting as a true mediator, <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">Jossi</a> has acted as an arbitrator. (I hope that the administrators understand the difference.) The version he has imposed upon all editors was not agreed upon, and was produced during the holiday weekend. Personally, I had announced in advance that I wouldn't be present during this extended weekend; previous delays for the sake of BenBurch and FAAFA were welcomed by this mediator, but in my announced absence, he proceeded to a "final solution" without my participation (and, it appears, without the participation of some of the others who were opposed to the efforts of BenBurch and FAAFA).</p>
<p>The resulting rewrite by Jossi contains negative material in its lead paragraphs that relies entirely on a self-published and unreliable conspiracy theorist by the name of Todd Brendan Fahey. Following is a summary of Fahey's self-promotion campaign to become the next Hunter S. Thompson. <a href="http://www.disinfo.com/archive/pages/dossier/id269/pg1/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.disinfo.com/archive/pages/dossier/id269/pg1/" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> This Fahey material, by some strange coincidence, was first introduced by FAAFA. Jossi's final version also included an abundant amount of other material introduced (and spin-doctored) by FAAFA that hadn't even been discussed by any other editor. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Republic#Social_organization_and_events" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Republic#Social_organization_and_events" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> When <a href="../../../1/2/p/User%7E12ptHelvetica_6de6.html" title="User:12ptHelvetica">12ptHelvetica</a> removed the Fahey based material -- which consisted of <b>just one sentence</b> plus a link -- but left the rest of Jossi's version intact, BenBurch reverted back to a pre-mediation "hit piece" version. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Free_Republic&amp;diff=96238033&amp;oldid=96220704" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Free_Republic&amp;diff=96238033&amp;oldid=96220704" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> This evidently triggered the most recent volley of reversions.</p>

<dd>The conduct of BenBurch and FAAFA is a textbook example of the word "trolling." They deliberately try to provoke angry and inappropriate responses, and then complain to the site administrators about it. Any misconduct by other members must be viewed in light of this continuous hectoring and baiting. Bryan's Talk page is only the most recent example. BenBurch, in addition to being a banned DU member, tried to mislead WP administrators by saying "I am not [a member of that site]." This was not the whole truth. He was a long term member who was banned for life. Also, he is the webmaster of the <a href="http://www.whiterosesociety.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.whiterosesociety.org/" rel="nofollow">White Rose Society</a> website, which argues that George W. Bush and the Republican leadership are fascists. They take their name from the White Rose Society of Munich, which distributed anti-Nazi pamphlets in 1943 and have adopted the slogan, "Fighting the Rise of the New Fascists." BenBurch's trolling here is agenda driven, and it may reasonably be inferred that FAAFA shares those motives for his own conduct. FR supports Bush, while BenBurch and FAAFA strongly oppose Bush. Their bias in addressing the topic of FR in a Wikipedia article is self-evident. - <a href="../../../d/p/1/User%7EDP1976_7cfa.html" title="User:DP1976">DP1976</a> 14:22, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

FR has done everything that any reasonable person could expect to protect its reputation. Also, I think the lawsuit by <i>The Washington Post</i> and <i>The Los Angeles Times</i> might deserve further scrutiny. The plaintiffs won over $2,000,000 through summary judgment; and then it was appealed; and after oral arguments but before the appellate court decided the case, the newspapers' attorneys settled for $10,000. That's a reduction of over 99.5% of the summary judgment. Something happened in the appellate court that scared the hell out of the newspapers' attorneys. They thought they were going to lose. That is the only possible explanation for a reduction of over 99.5% in a negotiated settlement. -- <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryanFromPalatine_0d90.html" title="User:BryanFromPalatine">BryanFromPalatine</a> 02:15, 15 December 2006 (UTC) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Free_Republic&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=94344095" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Free_Republic&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=94344095" rel="nofollow">link</a></p>

If RadioKirk continues to claim that his actions were not wheel warring, or were acceptable, this should be taken to arbitration. --<a href="../../../s/r/i/User_talk%7ESrikeit_6c22.html" title="User talk:Srikeit">Srikeit</a> 11:20, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agreed. I pointed that out to him on the main AN board, and I believe he said something along the lines of "then let me be sanctioned here" (might not have been exactly what he said, but with that idea). – <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChacor_c07b.html" title="User:Chacor">Ch</a><a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChacor_1f31.html" title="User talk:Chacor">acor</a> 12:02, 26 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>In a previous discussion on AN, at least two arbitrators indicated an interest in hearing cases involving wheel warring, and indicated that such cases would be quickly accepted. The problem is that no one ever brings them. For myself, I agree that the general level of respect admins have for each others' actions has greatly declined, with Radiokirk's block warring being only the most recent example. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 13:18, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Srikeit, you indicate that you have concerns about RadioKirk's blocking "aside" from the Santa dispute. Are you suggesting there are prior examples of a blocking/unblocking/reblocking pattern involving him? I took a quick look at his logs and I couldn't quickly tell what other incidents you were referring to. Could you expand on what other situations, if any, you believe RadioKirk was involved in? Also, have any of them (other than Santa) been discussed with RadioKirk? <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 17:33, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Rereading the sentence, I thought he meant "the dispute over the merit of the block aside, he still wheel warred". <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 20:24, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Perhaps, though there was also the word "pattern" that threw me. If Srikeit's comment refers only to the episode the other night, then while I don't at all agree with the way that was handled, I can't consider it the stuff of an arbitration case, either. As Dmcdevit and Thatcher131 and Srikeit know, at the moment there are 9 open ArbCom cases currently in the evidence phase and 2 more ready to be opened, in addition to 3 being voted on. I can't really see adding "Santa on Sleigh Wheel War" to the list. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 20:32, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes I did mean "the dispute over the merit of the block aside, wheel warring was apparent". I definitely didn't mean that I have seen RadioKirk has do something like this before. I brought this matter up because, as Thatcher said above, several admins have become remarkably disrespectful of each others actions and these kind of tussles are now occurring with alarming regularity. Considering the interest displayed by arbitrators in this matter, I'm sure they will be quite interested in accepting this case. Also the addition of seven new arbitrators will decrease the workload considerably. I think taking this to arbcom is very important to remind administrators the seriousness and absolute unacceptability of wheel-warring. RadioKirk has gone on a wikibreak, fully protecting his user/talk pages so I have sent him an email informing him about this thread. --<a href="../../../s/r/i/User_talk%7ESrikeit_6c22.html" title="User talk:Srikeit">Srikeit</a> 07:47, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Say I make a point of ignoring consensus to delete the contributions you've made, and ignore all pleas, or reasons given, or rules cited, for me to stop. I also delete other people's entries on your talk page so you can't get the messages; and I delete your own questions when you start asking them. Then I block you for objecting to my behavior. At that point, would your looking closely at my record, and complaining about my abuses, mean that you are "going after" me and "being hostile", and you should be blocked or banned for it? Boy, that would sure be nice for me.

<dd>With all due respect, Mr. Dodge, I never said that it did. My point was far larger than that. Pluto.2006 is not simply harassing or stalking Srkris; he appears to have been trying to report questionable behavior by Srkris, and went about it the wrong way. That's a huge difference. Regardless, until the issue is live again, I see no need to act on it. Even a warning is likely to be ineffective when it's so far removed from the edits in question. | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">Mr. Darcy</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a></small> 16:18, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Since we're here, let me ask a question about the John Bambenek article. A User claiming to be Bambenek (<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnBambenek_f73a.html" title="User:JohnBambenek">User:JohnBambenek</a>) wanted the article deleted, and claimed that it was a copyright violation from his webpage. Indeed, the two articles are the same, and the Wikipedia article has been duly flagged as a copyvio. My question is, how do we know that Bambenek didn't just copy our article to his page and then came here demanding we delete the copyvio? If somebody with a website doesn't want their article here, it's pretty simple just to copy our article to their site, then demand we take ours down as a copyvio, and we are hardpressed to determine which came first. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe">(talk)</a> 17:05, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I second Zoe's point of fact. You have a great deal to worry about if you use buttons around Cplot, and I advise adminstrators and users to tread lightly with respect to doing so. If you insist on attempting to constrain Cplot, you will first get a nice attack page at encyclopedia dramatica. Then, you will have your name constantly spammed around this encyclopedia by Cplot sockpuppets attempting to reveal facets of your personal life. This will be followed by individuals Cplot contacted via email participating in an ongoing harassment campaign against you (likley taunting remarks on your talk page). If you respond to this with any level of anger whatsoever, you will probably be desysoped. The alledged reason for your desysopment may state that you unprotected pages you were involved in editing, but they will neglect to mention that you had not edited the pages for weeks, and the sum-total of your editing was to correct a few gramatical mistakes, and that on unprotection, you did not edit the page whatsoever. This appears to be because Cplot's harassment is quite effective, and very few people wish to stand up to it. <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 18:39, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Perhaps you're right--maybe I should have waited for him to rack up an even larger record of disruption before proposing this (he's certainly on his way), but I was hoping to nip this in the bud before it gets even uglier. He's already been quite disruptive, and his actions today have escalated the disruption to a new level. When the entire community is against him, and his only response is to go on a spree of disruption, there's a serious problem. I really don't think mediation will work, since he is the only one advocating his viewpoint. Thank you, however, for looking into this.

<p>Let me explain this further (I was going to make a new thread, but I was directed here).</p>
<p>I have recently started up a WikiProject entitled <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Tokusatsu_8312.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Tokusatsu">Wikipedia:WikiProject Tokusatsu</a>, which covers the areas of Japanese television and cinema that primarily features <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_effect.html" title="Special effect">special effects</a>. The English language Wikipedia has an article on <a href="../../../t/o/k/Tokusatsu.html" title="Tokusatsu">Tokusatsu</a>, and it is obviously central to the WikiProject. The article needs a clean-up, but that is something that the WikiProject will be working on.</p>
<p>When I went to the article last week, I saw that it had a merge tag on it, with a merge to the article on Special effects. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tokusatsu&amp;diff=94966275&amp;oldid=93836007" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tokusatsu&amp;diff=94966275&amp;oldid=93836007" rel="nofollow">I removed this tag</a>, and clearly stating my reason for the removal. I then saw <a href="../../../t/o/k/Talk%7ETokusatsu_6469.html#Another_tag" title="Talk:Tokusatsu">FasterPussycatWooHoo's thread on the talk page</a> about the tagging, which I replied to and explained myself, but it immediately fell into an incivil volley from FasterPussycat.</p>
<p>The next day, FasterPussycat replaced the template, and the discussion continued on the talk page, at which point <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tokusatsu&amp;diff=95244008&amp;oldid=95242936" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tokusatsu&amp;diff=95244008&amp;oldid=95242936" rel="nofollow">an uninvolved party removed the template</a> citing the consensus against FasterPussycat on the talk page. After that, every single edit of FasterPussycat's to the article was to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tokusatsu&amp;diff=95292816&amp;oldid=95257945" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tokusatsu&amp;diff=95292816&amp;oldid=95257945" rel="nofollow">restore the template</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tokusatsu&amp;diff=95720631&amp;oldid=95711191" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tokusatsu&amp;diff=95720631&amp;oldid=95711191" rel="nofollow">twice</a>), and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tokusatsu&amp;diff=96273287&amp;oldid=95798954" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tokusatsu&amp;diff=96273287&amp;oldid=95798954" rel="nofollow">undo our work</a> as to improving the article to make it clearer that the subject of the article is unique in many ways from special effects.</p>

<p>Since becoming a Wikipedian in February 2005, I've been on the receiving end of a fair amount of personal attacks and other incivility. This is the first time that I've felt uncomfortable enough to file a formal complaint.</p>
<p>As part of a dispute/discussion at <a href="../../../i/n/_/Template_talk%7EIn_the_news_d441.html" title="Template talk:In the news">Template talk:In the news</a>, <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExplorerCDT_cbe5.html" title="User:ExplorerCDT">ExplorerCDT</a> threatened to "hang the ITN editors by their balls" if they failed to comply with his demands <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:In_the_news&amp;diff=96684133" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:In_the_news&amp;diff=96684133" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. In response to a comment that I made regarding another user's edit, he added, "And you'd be the first person I hang...with dental floss." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:In_the_news&amp;diff=96685369" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:In_the_news&amp;diff=96685369" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. I informed him that this such remarks were inappropriate and that I would seek administrative intervention if they continued <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:In_the_news&amp;diff=96686401" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:In_the_news&amp;diff=96686401" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.</span></p>

Until then, I do not retract my comments and reserve the right to criticise you when I feel justified (as I have thus far)."

Woof Woof Woof ... I don't respond to anonymous dogs. " which I found singularly uncooperative, but completely consistent with her interactions with other editors. She seems to be a SPA and is hostile in the extreme to any discussion of her nasty attitude and POV pushing, or even requests for sources. She has a "you're either with me or you're trying to censor and oppress me" attitude. She is a time and effort sinkhole.

<dd>SPA - Single Purpose Account. She has been the recipient of aggresively adverse edits that are pretty thin for such experienced editors. I see some of this as "political" where one side *is* larger. That said, perhaps you (all) should try to get an agreement *from her* about what she does here (i.e. restricting her site links to other editors on Talk) and perhaps *helpfully* explaining an issue, <b>one at a time</b> (I've see three letter policy blasts that are literally "well some of it must be right"). I have seen early multipronged accusations around her in forms that I think are "unhelpful" (I am not saying she's innocent) and would boil my blood, too. <b><a href="../../../l/y/n/Lynching.html" title="Lynching">RfARB???</a></b>--<a href="../../../i/27/c/User%7EI%27clast_cb31.html" title="User:I'clast">I'clast</a> 00:15, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What about a 'formal' warning based on this AN/I, with specific examples of what would, in this case, warrant a longer ban? I do think comments like "She is a time and effort sinkhole" are themselves uncivil. I am not defending the conduct objected to, and have stated the same <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:The_National_Council_Against_Health_Fraud&amp;diff=96510813&amp;oldid=96510180|" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:The_National_Council_Against_Health_Fraud&amp;diff=96510813&amp;oldid=96510180|" rel="nofollow">here</a>, where I was not exactly tactuful.

<dd>She has had numerous formal warnings, informal warnings, and outreach attempts. That she has chosen to remove them from her page indicates that she saw them.

<dd>I think Ilena is a <b>new editor</b> that has been overwhelmed/outnumbered by adverse edits (-ors) in a hot subject where she has a definite point of view and her learning curve is insufficient to deal with the experienced crowd that <i>doth sometimes protest too much.</i> There are scattered, less obvious early edits that might provoke a newcomer that may seem to rudely contradict her edits rather than truely help and inform. I realize that she has to become more rules saavy, but I also see provocative stuff that is not easy to spot for the uninvolved, where the adverse editors presume they are righteously correct. Ilena has contritbuted points that were not spotted / corrected by her counterparties.

<dd>I think you entered in the middle of something hot that includes an actual WP:BLP problem (hers) where the involved (offended) editor doesn't yet viscerally understand a lot of Wiki policy issues and is in fact outnumbered by her much more experienced, polar counterparts. Not saying this is how to run a railroad, but that the problem is wider, more complex than it appears. She clearly suspects some others' edits, where in her eyes WP:AGW has been long breeched w/o redress and now others are POV'g the articles w/o completeness or accuracy. She as well has a point of view. I don't think her handling has been done helpfully or effectively. Some others' santimoniously quoting the rules back that she perceived to have been breeched (i.e. CIVIL) is not helpful. She is still coming to grips with various policies, how much it affects her edits and how this works.--<a href="../../../i/27/c/User%7EI%27clast_cb31.html" title="User:I'clast">I'clast</a> 02:44, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Please let me update your information. My edits were removed from the moment I came to Wikipedia exposing NCAHF's questionable (and apparently non existent) corporate status. State records were called POV and removed. Within moments of posting links to NCAHF's corporate suspension, Barrett's assistant listmaster, fyslee would remove them. When I first began to read here ... Barrett Vs Rosenthal was unrecognizable to the facts of the case. I have recently defeated Stephen Barrett in court and his team is doing the best they can to gang up on me and remove my opinions. I made a Wikipedia page of my website to explain my treatment here. I am very familiar with being ganged up by people defending Stephen Barrett and his questionable operations. What is called a "feud" is his losing SLAPP suit that went on for over 6 years and ended up in The Supreme Court of California with all 3 plaintiffs losing. The Barrett information here is biased and unencyclopedia.

She's not been raising "<a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> issues"... she's been using Wikipedia as a front in her war with Barrett. Again, I have no idea who's "right" or "wrong" in that particular war; I just know that expanding it into Wikipedia is inappropriate. The biggest issue here is has moved past any supposed provocation - it's the fact that she has now had reams of suggestions/warnings, starting relatively <a href="../../../d/b/t/WP%7EDBTN_1b88.html" title="WP:DBTN">friendly</a> and ending up pointed, that her actions are inappropriate for Wikipedia. Yet I've seen no indication that she's internalized them or modified her behavior in any way. I'd also argue against <a href="../../../i/27/c/User%7EI%27clast_cb31.html" title="User:I'clast">I'clast's</a> suggestion that action now is precipitate; she's gotten away with far more in terms of <a href="../../../d/e/_/WP%7EDE_3fff.html" title="WP:DE">disruptive editing</a> than most editors, and I'm discouraged by the history that any further talk-based intervention will be successful - hence I brought the issue here. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMastCell_1b0e.html" title="User:MastCell">MastCell</a> 04:17, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I see things differently. From July when I posted, my edits were immediately reverted and me threatened with POV. When I discovered that the Barrett Vs Rosenthal article (I'm Rosenthal) was unrecognizable as to the facts of the case, every edit I made to correct it was reverted .. sometimes in seconds. In the last 24 hours, people I've never heard of have gone through and removed every edit of mine and replaced it with the Barrett/Quackwatch/NCAHF POV. As the winning defendant in Barrett Vs Rosenthal, Barrett's links are allowed and mine removed. On the Stephen Barrett page under Critics who have been in litigation with him ... again my link removed. This reminds me of the Gladiator Days ... I'm going to write about defeating Barrett &amp; Team in the Supreme Court of California, but Killer Chihauha and MastCell rule on Wikipedia.

<dd>MastCell, Levine doesn't seem to be editing right now.

Ilena's is a newbie in the sense that she has been locked in on issues that seem elementary to her, (remember the SPA charge above?) rather than a diet of successful learning steps. Ilena seems to have improved some, just not at the rate you prefer. There *are* points where the pro-QW editors have seemed substantially partisan. I feel that there has been an undercurrent to the responses to her early edits that is not high level obvious or is "mainstream" but can be a specific insult not appreciated by the unfamiliar. I think there are issues that she has got to understand and internalize but I also think that some edits she found corrosive, because I was annoyed when fresh to the scene by these edits too. I think that some QW proponents editing earlier on seemingly simple factual stmts soured her outlook on some counterparties' AGF. I think Ilena's has issues that needed to be talked out in a different way to see whether she can climb the learning curve, or not, and that we can identify and meaningfully address her concerns, which in my eyes includes the WP:BLP issue. But I'll agree that her language has to change, as do some others' attitudes.--<a href="../../../i/27/c/User%7EI%27clast_cb31.html" title="User:I'clast">I'clast</a> 05:39, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that <a href="../../../i/l/e/User%7EIlena_9a07.html" title="User:Ilena">Ilena's</a> response sounds good. If it's followed by a change in behavior, that would be even more encouraging. Thanks for your efforts. I do think that excusing her behavior may be counterproductive in the long run (as pointed out above, she's hardly a newbie)... and furthering a persecution complex ("Last one was OK cause he was a doctor"??) is unlikely to move the situation forward either. Anyhoo, given the positive response from <a href="../../../i/l/e/User%7EIlena_9a07.html" title="User:Ilena">Ilena</a>, perhaps we should step back and give her another chance. However, I also think that this discussion should be archived as a clear, formal, official, what-have-you indication that a continuation of her previous editing style is not acceptable. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMastCell_1b0e.html" title="User:MastCell">MastCell</a> 00:09, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Everyone's learning curve is different, and I don't really feel that serious attempts were giving at addressing her mistakes in a way that would be proactive until the AN/I notice (throwing around "zomg arbcom ruling" and "your link is bad omg" without a good clear explanation tends to get bad). I really find that to be a shame, and hopefully she can be guided a little bit and become a productive editor.

Her approach to getting revenge and "one up" over those with whom she has been in conflict in the past is to follow a user to an article they have edited recently and/or frequently, perform piddling, often nonsensically trivial or inaccurate edits, and then aggressively and persistently resist attempts by the editor she is harassing to correct her edits.

<p>What on Earth can be done? I'm probably too involved in this situation, and with Velten's seemingly deep animosity towards me, I'm in no position to be handling it on my own; if I blocked her, she'd surely accuse me of making up "reasons" or "excuses" to prevent her from editing, because, of course, she'd <i>never</i> do anything disruptive. I've assumed good faith for far longer than I should have, tried my hardest to tell her what she's doing is unacceptable (see, for example, <a href="../../../m/a/n/Talk%7EManeater_%28Nelly_Furtado_song%29_7ac6.html" title="Talk:Maneater (Nelly Furtado song)">Talk:Maneater (Nelly Furtado song)</a>), and all I get in return is, in true Velten fashion, complete denial of any wrongdoing and childish, sarcastic or plain snide retorts such as accusations of rules lawyering <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Extraordinary_Machine&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=87228964" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Extraordinary_Machine&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=87228964" rel="nofollow">[43]</a>. It's obvious that she hasn't decided to change her behaviour or attitudes since many months ago, and she's flat out refusing to acknowledge other editors' past or present concerns about her. This has dragged on and on for months and through arbitration, and as Velten's indicated on talk pages and in her editing elsewhere, she simply doesn't care. If she feels strongly enough about something, she'll do anything to get her own way (policy and guideline pages be damned), and that includes scratching away at and wearing down any unfortunate soul who happens to cross her path. How much longer do I or anyone else on Wikipedia have to put up with this?</p>

<dd>I've been following this issue slightly. As a person who is on the other side of many of the debates on the <a href="../../../o/w/u/OWU_adbc.html" title="OWU">OWU</a> page and a person who suspects a fair amount of sockpuppetry on the <a href="../../../o/w/u/OWU_adbc.html" title="OWU">OWU</a> pages, <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiprojectOWU_35b8.html" title="User:WikiprojectOWU">User:WikiprojectOWU</a> is one user who I don't consider to be a sock. I don't always agree with <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiprojectOWU_35b8.html" title="User:WikiprojectOWU">User:WikiprojectOWU</a> but I do believe that she is trying to make the OWU pages better---while trying to be open-minded. There are other users that I do suspect of being puppets to push specific agendas... but, and I may be niave, <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiprojectOWU_35b8.html" title="User:WikiprojectOWU">User:WikiprojectOWU</a> isn't one of them. She may be single minded on this subject, but so too are a lot of other Wikipedians... I don't partiularly care for her name (it is too easy to misinterpret) but she is a solid/concerned editor. I personally don't consider her comment to be a threat... she will consult with others to see what her options are? So what, she'll find out that you did nothing wrong. It is her perjogative to inquire with others as to her options if she thinks she has been wronged, but it'll go nowhere. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalloonman_3871.html" title="User:Balloonman">Balloonman</a> 18:40, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First, a disclaimer - I know nothing of OWU, but came across WikiProjectOWU's work via either peer review or FAC (I can't recall which). I've seen how hard s/he is working on Wikipedia and at learning policies and guidelines, and as I do for many articles that come up on FAC, FAR, or peer review, I've been providing feedback on improving the articles s/he is working on to FA standards. I've been around Wikipedia for almost a year, and I actually don't even understand what the question or issue being raised here is - is s/he supposed to change the username, or what?</p>
<p>But, what I do know, is that I had to ask Zoe several times to apologize to another editor on another article back in <s>July</s> August,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zoe&amp;diff=67035915&amp;oldid=66958453" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zoe&amp;diff=67035915&amp;oldid=66958453" rel="nofollow">[47]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zoe&amp;diff=67047347&amp;oldid=67036786" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zoe&amp;diff=67047347&amp;oldid=67036786" rel="nofollow">[48]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zoe&amp;diff=67105600&amp;oldid=67102686" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zoe&amp;diff=67105600&amp;oldid=67102686" rel="nofollow">[49]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zoe&amp;diff=67107680&amp;oldid=67105600" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zoe&amp;diff=67107680&amp;oldid=67105600" rel="nofollow">[50]</a> when she deleted a legitimate article written by him as an attack page, and issued a warning to him on his talk page when a simple Google search would have revealed that the page was quite legitimate (the criteria for diagnosing <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asperger_syndrome.html" title="Asperger syndrome">Asperger syndrome</a>). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:SandyGeorgia/arch4#Natche24" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:SandyGeorgia/arch4#Natche24" rel="nofollow">[51]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Natche24" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Natche24" rel="nofollow">[52]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Asperger_syndrome/Archive06#Peter_Szatmari_Article" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Asperger_syndrome/Archive06#Peter_Szatmari_Article" rel="nofollow">[53]</a> I could never understand how anyone could interpret it as an attack page, or issue a warning to a user who was trying to write a legitimate article, which today is part of a featured article. I understand that mistakes happen, and that Zoe's deletion of the page and warning to the user was a simple mistake: what I don't understand is why I had to ask her more than once to please issue an apology or clarification to the hard-working and well-intentioned editor, so that his talk page wouldn't show that he had created an attack page. (This was again a situation I became aware of only because the article came up on <a href="../../../f/a/r/WP%7EFAR_432e.html" title="WP:FAR">WP:FAR</a>.) I raise this now because, like then, I'm concerned that apologizing or clarifying doens't seem to come naturally to Zoe. Admins should put out fires, not start them.</p>
<p>WikiprojectOWU appears to be a hard-working editor: an apology or explanation in this case would go a long way towards maintaining good will and avoiding "bite"; I don't understand why a seasoned editor like Zoe should feel "threatened" over something that should be quite simple to explain and resolve. Someone just please explain to WikiprojectOWU what policy s/he has gone afoul of, and how s/he can fix it. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESandyGeorgia_ca9b.html" title="User talk:SandyGeorgia">Talk</a>) 19:18, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Excuse me, I <i><b>did</b></i> attempt to explain to this User what my concerns were. They removed my comments from their talk page. I have never accused this person of anything, as I told them, I merely wanted other eyes to take a look at a User with an SPA-echoing name, which has only made accounts to OWU related articles, articles which have a long history of edit warring. I will not comment on this further unless this user's and other people's attacks <i>on me</i> continue.

<dd>&lt;sigh&gt; back at you. I have no idea why you feel your opinions on me should matter, but I will explain to others who might be interested as to what your attacks on me started from. For admins: The original edit to the article which User:Natche wrote was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Undelete&amp;target=Peter_Szatmari&amp;timestamp=20060709223854" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Undelete&amp;target=Peter_Szatmari&amp;timestamp=20060709223854" rel="nofollow">here</a>.. Note that I was the <i><b>second</b></i> admin to delete this, not the first. To me, the edit read like an attack. I am not about to go around reviewing all of the edits that read like attack pages to verify that "Johnny is a fag" is a real attack or not. Things like that get deleted. When an explanation came, I apologized to the User and explained why I had felt the article was an attack. I see that Sandy hasn't bothered to link to <i><b>that</b></i>, but it <i>is</i> still on Natche's Talk page. Why that has any bearing on this, I cannot fathom. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe">(talk)</a> 19:43, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Incorrect - I did link to your eventual apology (above), and since the diff you gave is admin only, I can't see it - I only have what you left on my talk page then, which contained no attack. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESandyGeorgia_ca9b.html" title="User talk:SandyGeorgia">Talk</a>) 19:52, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Zoe, I'm very saddened that you don't see the connection. It's not that the article was wrongly deleted (that happens all the time) or that the editor was wrongly warned - no big deal, never was. It's that you didn't immediately issue a clarification to the editor as soon as it was brought to your attention, and I had to ask more than once - that is the similarity. Admins and seasoned editors need not become defensive over minor "stuff that happens" all the time, and should be quick to put out fires, rectify wrongs, avoid being defensive, and help out newcomers. Natche24 was not an experienced editor, nor is Wikiproject OWU - a teensy bit of good will can go a long way towards preserving them as editors. De-escalate the situation rather than escalate it. That's all, I'm done. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESandyGeorgia_ca9b.html" title="User talk:SandyGeorgia">Talk</a>) 19:48, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Looks good - I was confused about the SPA issue; when I was new to Wiki, I was certainly thousands of edits into being a single-topic editor before I had the courage to expand into other topics, and I distinctly recall that finding my way around Wiki's policies and guidelines was no small chore. I guess I'm lucky that my username didn't indicate the single purpose topic that initially brought me to Wikipedia&#160;:-)) <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESandyGeorgia_ca9b.html" title="User talk:SandyGeorgia">Talk</a>) 22:32, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Zoe, there is a difference between <a href="../../../r/o/l/WP%7EROLE_99f9.html" title="WP:ROLE">role accounts</a> and <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPA_03df.html" title="WP:SPA">single purpose accounts</a>. In your initial question above you described WikiprojectOWU as a role account... which so far as I can tell was was not only an 'accusation', but an apparently false one. Which could be extremely upsetting to someone given that <i>actual</i> role accounts (those with a password shared by a group) are generally banned on sight... as stated in the link which you sent to WikiprojectOWU. Likewise you stated that WikiprojectOWU had only edited one article... again, an 'accusation' which wasn't quite accurate given that they have contributed to several articles... though all are on the same subject (OWU). Getting defensive and insisting that they are complaining about nothing because you haven't <b>made</b> any accusations also wasn't true and didn't help the situation. To go back to your original question on 'general feelings' about a user who is apparently minding their own business and contributing positively to the encyclopedia... 'thank them' seems like an appropriate response. There is nothing inherently 'wrong' with 'single purpose accounts'. Yes, many single purpose accounts are created to push a POV or vote stack or otherwise violate policy... but everyone involved seems to agree that isn't the case here. If a 'single purpose account' makes alot of contributions and doesn't do any of those things... then that is a 'good user' and ought to be left alone. Or given barnstars. Not falsely accused of committing a bannable offense and then berated for getting upset about it. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 12:01, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I have received an email from Bluecord claiming his friends used his computer to vandalize.

<dd>If his account has been compromised, he can register another one (Bluecord the 2nd or something that at least harkens back to his old username; we can make an exception to any such rule in this case).

<p>More of it again. It looks like nasty trolls have found a good game. I suggest to think about semiprotecting all templates: Why would newbies have to edit them?

<dd>Hello, I am Kiwi. I am a trifle shocked to see myself labeled as an out of line experimenter who is subverting how Wiki is edited. I was only following advice from administrators on what to do so that the inlined deletions could be FOUND and worked on by the BPD editors (we have a pretty good team effort going on).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It was not me who inlined the extensive amount of material, but someone who normally would (and wants to at the moment (see her last comment) simply delete it in toto. Alternatively, she would toss some of it into another topic. See: Zeraeph <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Borderline_personality_disorder#Me_too" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Borderline_personality_disorder#Me_too" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Borderline_personality_disorder#Me_too</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Our group of active cooperating editors have already discussed what she outlines as issues and we seem to have a consensus at present at how to proceed while eventually improving 3 other topics. See here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Borderline_personality_disorder#Shortening_the_article" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Borderline_personality_disorder#Shortening_the_article" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Borderline_personality_disorder#Shortening_the_article</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If you will read this section where Zeraeph announced her "Experiment". THAT was the experiment. What I did was follow recommendations and directions from two of the many admins who chipped in with possible solutions to this problem -- How to edit material that is already effectively deleted.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I hope I have been reasonably clear, but please ask me any questions you need answered and I will copy out here all the advice various admins placed on the topic talk page, my talk page and in private emails to me.</dd>

<dd>I've moved the page into your userspace because you can't create sub-pages in the mainspace. You can only create sub-pages in User, Talk, and Wikipedia namespaces.

<dd>Kiwi here again. I just got an email from an admin who has told me that the inline removals of so much text has been replaced (by removing the inline coding). This sounds good -- but I am glad I was allowed to keep the workpage JUST IN CASE all those parts get deleted anyway.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Like I said - what I did was by selecting, from three different admins, advice to provide the BPD editors a way to do out editing without having to search for it in the Wiki coding behind the pages - in it's experimental inline status.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>BUT, PLEASE NOTICE that I was SPECIFICALLY INSTRUCTED to put the Work Page in the Topic name space. This was NOT my idea. What I WANTED was for the inline stuff to be removed, the material returned to the article, and for the entire article to be <b>POV Bannered</b>, and the issues discussed on the article Talk Page.</dd>

<dd>I won't extend this discussion further, but rather cap it off. My reason for leaving the message I did on A Kiwi's talk page rather than anyone else's sits with speaking to the actor in the matter and not to the people whom the actor consulted. I understand that A Kiwi was acting after extensive consultation (and I recognized that at the time I spoke on the talk page); it is unfortunate in my opinion that those consultations led down the particular road they did. However, this was a minor matter as things go. It seems things are ending well, and all's well that ends well.

This is unacceptable when the same crowd that appears on AfDs joins the discussion on DRVs without having any regard to policies/guidelines/process.

<dd>The issue at DRV wasn't whether the article was sourced properly. It was that the article was deleted out of process. The closing admin enforced his views in closing with delete against consensus. Even if the consensus is wrong, it's not the job of the closing admin to judge whether or not the article is worthy in his opinion. This is why we have AfD discussions in the first place. —<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalber_d5cd.html" title="User:Malber">Malber</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMalber_7564.html" title="User talk:Malber">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Malber_b734.html" title="Special:Contributions/Malber">contribs</a>) 13:44, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Fine, but there were several cogent examples given by editors voting keep that there were sources provided and the closing admin completely ignored the fact that there was a criteria for inclusion on the list.

<p>These ip addresses have all been used today to continually add an external link to the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheshire.html" title="Cheshire">Cheshire</a> entry which is not mentioned in the entry. It is purely a website for a local radio station (<a href="http://www.cheshirefm.com." class="external text" title="http://www.cheshirefm.com." rel="nofollow">Cheshire Radio</a>), making it inappropriate according to the guidelines laid out in <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html" title="Wikipedia:External links">Wikipedia:External links</a>. Additionally, ipaddress 80.47.85.246 blanked out a user page for one of the users who, along with myself and others, have been reverting these additions (see page history for <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_W.M._Jones_a98a.html" title="User:Richard W.M. Jones">User:Richard W.M. Jones</a>. There have been other attempts to add this same extrenal link to other entries of towns and districts within <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheshire.html" title="Cheshire">Cheshire</a>, but I have not given explicit information about them in this message.</p>
<p>I have discovered that the first and last ipaddresses belong to the ISP, Tiscali in the UK, and the second one to BT, also in the UK. The times at whch the edits were made were as follows:</p>
<p>80.47.85.246 Tiscali 21:38 (UK time) 86.143.95.226 BT 18:59 (UK time) 80.47.220.20 Tiscali 14:16 (UK time)</p>
<p>This might help trace and report the vandals. I wonder if some kind of partrial protection to the page might be a simple interim solution, whereby only registered users can edit it? I know this may be unsatisfactory in the long-term, but temporarily it might help until the vandals get fed up and go to do something else. <a href="../../../d/d/s/User%7EDdstretch_3ca8.html" title="User:Ddstretch"><sub><span style="border:1px solid DarkGreen;padding:1px;"><font style="color:White;background:DarkGreen;">&#160;DDS&#160;</font></span></sub></a>&#160;<a href="../../../d/d/s/User_talk%7EDdstretch_65ba.html" title="User talk:Ddstretch"><font color="DarkGreen" size="0">talk</font></a> 22:44, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
