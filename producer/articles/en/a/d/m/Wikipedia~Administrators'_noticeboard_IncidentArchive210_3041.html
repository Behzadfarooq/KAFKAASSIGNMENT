<p>This user is completely uncommunicative for month and never really reacts to criticism of his edits which are often POV or redundant to existent content. He is uploading copyright violating images since at least December 2006 (the last one I found was Image:MMBLA3.jpg). I tried to reach him in German language (his native language) but my message was deleted just minutes after sending. I'm sorry to say that his ignoring is not caused by language problems but just foully. Maybe someone can solve but I really have no more idea... <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo-Loge_2ec5.html" title="User:Geo-Loge">Geo-Loge</a> 16:35, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just for some background, I blocked this user in December 2006 for being uncommunicative, blanking his/her talk page and also all of these erroneous uploads. The idea was not to punish Nadia but to get his/her attention, i.e. to be instructive. Apparently it didn't work. There is nothing worse than a user who refuses to communicate with others. Honestly, I don't know what to do next. I could block the user, but I see no evidence of change. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">Woohoo!</a></sup> 05:50, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are normal and justified edits among his contributions, I know. But his understanding of copyrights is unportable. Some of his upload license information are lied and he knows that this uploads are illegal. I tried to communicate in German language.. I warned him that I will argue for an unlimited block of his account, if he just blanks this message.. he blanked and so I only see one way: Block this user for an unlimited period. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo-Loge_2ec5.html" title="User:Geo-Loge">Geo-Loge</a> 11:07, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Jeez, way to overreact. A lot of signature books have "Can I really edit this?" or somesuch, supposedely from Jimbo Wales, in them for the humour of Jimbo supposedly asking if he can edit it.

<dd>Seriously, I don't approve of the whole autograph sub-pages, but thats a little bit of an overreation to warn someone about it.

<dd>Maybe it's overreacting and maybe it's a joke but some users get excited when they see Jimbo has signed their signature book and are probably felt let down, angered and whatnot if they find out it was another user making a joke [at their expense]. <a href="../../../y/o/n/User%7EYonatanh_cbfb.html" title="User:Yonatanh">Yonatan</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yonatanh_afb0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yonatanh">contribs</a>/<a href="../../../y/o/n/User_talk%7EYonatanh_729d.html" title="User talk:Yonatanh">talk</a>) 22:37, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Personally, autograph sub-pages should just be out-right deleted since they have nothing to do with building the encyclopedia. Anyways, Spawn Man is a established editor, not some random troll.

<dd>I think <s>Deskana</s> Chrislk02 acted entirely appropriately in this matter, and I am glad the editor got a warning (which is really not much, in the great scheme of things). The issue is not who was impersonated, but that anybody was impersonated. You allow this under the guise of "joke", and then you open the door to people signing your name to Rfas and so forth. Where does it end? Good job, Chris. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffpw_23d5.html" title="User:Jeffpw">Jeffpw</a> 22:44, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>No, Deskana is on the other side of the debate. As am I. This is a long running joke, and it doesn't stretch into matters where comment attribution will ever matter. Impersonation on rfas is a long way off from "impersonation" on silly subpages. Spawn Man deserves an apology for this overreaction and the block threat. <a href="../../../p/i/c/User_talk%7EPicaroon9288_6280.html" title="User talk:Picaroon9288">Picaroon</a> 22:55, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I made sure to generalize. It realy wasent who he impersonate other than the fact he did impersonate. While anybody could track down impersonations it would make things alot worse. The only reason i warned him that he could get blocked is a previous discussion he had on his talk page claiming that he hadent been warned before blocking.

<p>Geez! I was joking, as I saw a couple of other users placing the same joke on their autograph books &amp; since Cremepuff wanted Jimbo to sign, I thought I'd be nice &amp; sign it for him (Like santa's helpers...). Never knew you people would take a kind gesture so seriously. So a harmless joke which numerous other users make has been brought here because a girl can't handle being "let down". I was only trying to be nice &amp; if you can't handle that then maybe you shouldn't be on wikipedia, where people try &amp; be nice in different ways. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpawn_Man_fbc1.html" title="User:Spawn Man">Spawn Man</a> 22:08, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It has nothing to do with being mean and you being nice. It has to do with falsley representing yourself, and that being innapropriate.

That archive also shows that the examples of Indian Sikhs and Muslims who are indexed by first name are noted. When the switch was made to the Yuvraj entry, there was a reminder on the talk page. After another user came and fixed up typos and grammar in late 2006, they weren't aware of the way Yuvraj is categorised, so when I switched it back to Y, I left an invisible comment <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yuvraj_Singh&amp;diff=97080184&amp;oldid=96774434" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yuvraj_Singh&amp;diff=97080184&amp;oldid=96774434" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> in late December. Since then, Gene has reverted the article four times, despite the article having a note and the talk page having a note, for a total of six reverts, whereas other articles such as <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harbhajan_Singh_dba0.html" title="Harbhajan Singh">Harbhajan Singh</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/n/Maninder_Singh_886e.html" title="Maninder Singh">Maninder Singh</a>, which do not have a reminder notice, have been less frequently targeted.

<li>I'm starting to see a big problem here. On the surface there are two serious editors with a content/policy disagreement. Both revert each other and both are sure they are right. One is an admin and complains at an/i; he doesn't take responsibility for his own reverting, he doesn't pursue the dispute resolution process - he asks that the other editor be blocked. The other editor is not a admin and gets blocked before being able to participate in the discussion. Also, there seems to be some article "ownership" issues on the part of the admin. Maybe it is time for an RfArb. --<a href="../../../d/u/k/User_talk%7EDuk_82a4.html" title="User talk:Duk">Duk</a> 19:45, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

It's only the indexing which is contested, and I'm not the lone ranger by any means. The DR occurred last year.

<li>No, I am not. It is you who is trying to change that consensus. Address the points I made above: 1) That consensus dealt with cricketers from Pakistan, Bangladesh, and UAE, not those from India, 2) That consensus involved indexing ALL people in the cricket categories for those countries by first name, and 3) that consensus involved only cricket categories for those three countries. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 16:05, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The block was imposed not punitively, but for prevention. The problem was that Gene was repeatedly undoing other people's edits without discussion, violating consensus on the topic. Additionally, he was incivil - accusing others of intentionally screwing up a version he didn't like - and behaving rudely to those to criticized him. All this is clearly disruptive. Gene has been dealt with fairly - the block is not lengthy either, more a slap on the wrist. If he is the productive editor Duk believes he is, he will understand his error and do something to address these complaints. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama%27s_Arrow_544a.html" title="User:Rama's Arrow"><font color="green"><b>Rama's arrow</b></font></a> 21:02, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I repeat - the block was NOT punitive. However, I do not expect anyone to be so naive as to not understand WHY they were blocked and do something to rectify their errors - the "slap on the wrist" was meant that way. I hope you do realize that you made some mistakes and that you won't repeat that behavior. Don't act like a victim, because you are not - you had your "rights." You could have requested to be unblocked, in which case another admin would have reviewed the circumstances. While it is natural for anyone to see a block as a punishment, you should have some faith in Wikipedia's policies and try to not see it that way. There is no reason for you to trust me (and vice-versa) but at least have some respect for Wikipedia. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama%27s_Arrow_544a.html" title="User:Rama's Arrow"><font color="green"><b>Rama's arrow</b></font></a> 18:09, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I <b>did</b> request to be unblocked; you know that, you can publish it if you like. And I <b>was not</b> given any opportunity to address the issues before you blocked me, was not given any notice of the discussion here.</dd>

<dd>You e-mailed me and I responded on your talkpage. When I say request for unblock, I mean putting this {{<a href="../../../u/n/b/Template%7EUnblock_0164.html" title="Template:Unblock">unblock</a>}} on your talkpage and asking "another admin" to review. As far as I know, this is an old issue and you've been warned and asked to discuss numerous times. My job was to stop the disruption. You can take the block as a punishment if you like - I don't care, that's your choice. I certainly did not intend it as a punishment. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama%27s_Arrow_544a.html" title="User:Rama's Arrow"><font color="green"><b>Rama's arrow</b></font></a> 19:08, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, and by the time you responded there, 18 hours of the block had passed, and it was a couple of more hours before I saw it. The instructions to contact the blocking administrator first; though they don't preclude the use of that template immediately, that is unlikely to accomplish much unless as in the case of Darwinek's earlier block of me there is clear abuse of admin privileges by the blocking admin.</dd>
<dd>If that is "as far as you know", then what were you doing blocking me? Can you show me one place where I've been "warned and asked to discuss" the sorting issue involved here, and I have failed to do so? Can you show me <i>even one place</i> where your buddy, your use-of-the-block-button mentor <a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Blnguyen&amp;diff=88340534&amp;oldid=88339813" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Blnguyen&amp;diff=88340534&amp;oldid=88339813" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> the one whom you owe for Blnguyen's conomination for adminship,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Rama%27s_Arrow_2&amp;diff=86842342&amp;oldid=86842137" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Rama%27s_Arrow_2&amp;diff=86842342&amp;oldid=86842137" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> has tried to discuss this sorting issue with me and I have failed to do so?</dd>
<dd>The thing is, <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">Wikipedia:blocking policy</a> specifically provides <b>"Blocks . . . should not be used as a punitive measure."</b> Far too often we see admins giving lip service to this principle, then basically ignoring it.

<dd>Let's get something straight Gene - you have a long history of rudeness, boorish behavior and personal attacking.

<dd>If you wanted to disprove your statement above that "My job was to stop the disruption" was a total falsity, and that what you intended was indeed punishment, you could not have done a much better job of it. Did any of that involve Blnguyen? No. Did any of them involve current discussions? No. Did any of them involve disruption that would need to be stopped with a block? No.</dd>
<dd>Why in the world are you bringing up a discussion with <a href="../../../h/s/e/User%7EHseldon10_d295.html" title="User:Hseldon10">User:Hseldon10</a> that was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Gene_Nygaard&amp;diff=107998472&amp;oldid=107988797" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Gene_Nygaard&amp;diff=107998472&amp;oldid=107988797" rel="nofollow">resolved amicably</a> between us two weeks ago? "Stop the disruption"? Bullshit. Don't be trying to invent post hoc justifications for your actions.</dd>
<dd>You were taking <a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">User:Blnguyen</a> word for it on the issue of the sorting of Indian cricketers, something for which he has repeatedly misrepresented any earlier consensus. That's the main reason you blocked me, because he had asked that I be blocked so that he could revert my changes with impunity and gain an upper hand in a content dispute.</dd>
<dd>You claimed that you were blocking me because I had previously been "asked to discuss" the issues, without ever pointing out any case in which I had failed to discuss the issue when it had been brought up.</dd>
<dd>I'll even do you one better than what I said above. I challenge you to show me even one case from before your block of me in which <a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">User:Blnguyen</a> has responded to me, when I have replied to him.

<li>Did he do so above, when I pointed out that he had misrepresented the old, archived consensus? No.</li>
<li>Did he do so anywhere else? Not that I can find. Can you?</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I suggest you reconsider who really needs to blocked for refusing to discuss the issue. One of those non-punishment slaps on the wrist, of course. I won't hold my breath while I wait for it to happen, however.</dd>
<dd>Exactly who is disrupting Wikipedia to make a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">point</a> here? An editor who goes through a category and fixed those which appear out of place? Or a different editor who reverts a series of those edits and then tries to gain the upper hand in a content dispute by gaming the system. One who runs here to ask that I be blocked, without my having reverted any of the unexplained reversions he has just made, without even telling me that he is coming here to complain,? Who does not discuss those reversions on the talk pages involved or anywhere else, but comes here and misreprents the existence a previous consensus? <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 03:37, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just heard about this and it seems other discussions are protected or archived but a article on wikiinews links to Essay's talk page where Essay says that Jim Wales and others knew and accepted the ruse and STILL HIRED HIM for the Wikia thing and none of them told him to correct his info on this wikipedia. Would that not consittute some kind of offense by Wales and the others like site disruption? I mean,should not those people also be asked to resign?</p>
<p>"Once I accepted a position with Wikia, I was in a safe place to "come out," and I did. Before I accepted the position, I provided all my real details to Angela and Jimbo, and immediately provided the same information to Brad Patrick; I also placed it on my Wikia userpage, from where I expected it would fairly quickly make it's way back to Wikipedia. The stalkers picked up on it immediately (but couldn't believe that a 24 year old had fooled them), but nobody here seemed to notice, which I didn't find particularly odd, since I expected that everybody here knew what was going on.</p>
<p>Awww, what a nice thing to say.&#160;:) One nice thing about being "out" is that now I get to hang out with the rest of the cabal in real life; I had dinner tonight with Jimbo, Angela, Datrio, and Michael Davis. All I can say is, I love my job! Essjay (Talk) 05:25, 6 February 2007 (UTC)"</p>

<p>While I'm sure by now everyone is aware of the ... interesting events surrounding Essjay and his false credentials, a fairly disruptive side dust-up has occurred involving FCYTravis. As some may be aware, there is a straw poll ongoing at <a href="../../../c/o/m/Wikipedia%7ECommunity_noticeboard_Essjay_971d.html" title="Wikipedia:Community noticeboard/Essjay">Wikipedia:Community_noticeboard/Essjay</a>. Some have raised concerns that it an attack page by nominating it for deletion at <a href="../../../m/i/s/Wikipedia%7EMiscellany_for_deletion_Wikipedia%7ECommunity_noticeboard_Essjay_2c65.html" title="Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Wikipedia:Community noticeboard/Essjay">Wikipedia:Miscellany_for_deletion/Wikipedia:Community_noticeboard/Essjay</a>. Irregardless of my own feelings there, it was improperly closed by Travis with the following rationale: <i><b>speedy keep</b> - I am an admin. Thanks. Deleting this page is not going to happen, period.</i> At first he was reverted by fellow admin <span class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetacommand_e660.html" title="User:Betacommand">Betacommand</a> (<a href="../../../b/e/t/User_talk%7EBetacommand_bfb0.html" title="User talk:Betacommand">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Betacommand_4a01.html" title="Special:Contributions/Betacommand">contribs</a> <small>•</small> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_block_4a41.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_block_4a41.html" rel="nofollow"><font color="#002BB8">blocks</font></a> <small>•</small> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_protect_c66b.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_protect_c66b.html" rel="nofollow"><font color="#002BB8">protects</font></a> <small>•</small> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_delete_f5f8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_delete_f5f8.html" rel="nofollow"><font color="#002BB8">deletions</font></a> <small>•</small> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_move_02c8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_move_02c8.html" rel="nofollow"><font color="#002BB8">moves</font></a>)</span>, and then by myself. Am I the only one other than Betacommand that thinks that is an extremely poor closing reason? This has been discussed somewhat on <a href="../../../f/c/y/User_talk%7EFCYTravis_fc36.html#Wikipedia:Miscellany_for_deletion.2FWikipedia:Community_noticeboard.2FEssjay" title="User talk:FCYTravis">his talk page</a>, with what I think were fairly inoffensive comments, to which he responded with astounding vitriol. At first I gave him a {{<a href="../../../u/w/-/Template%7EUw-npa3_7d49.html" title="Template:Uw-npa3">uw-npa3</a>}} warning, which may or may not have been too strong, which he removed, saying in fairly abrasive terms not to use a template, so I iterated my thoughts in my own words: <i>If you cannot communicate in fashions that are civil and do not include personal attacks, then do not communicate at all. Wikipedia has a Code of Conduct. Occasional lapses are forgivable but continued infractions will be sanctioned.</i> In my opinion his responses hardly follow the decorum expected of a Wikipedia administrator. The comment on Sagacious' talk page is particularly telling <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sagaciousuk&amp;diff=112138780&amp;oldid=110502835" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sagaciousuk&amp;diff=112138780&amp;oldid=110502835" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> as well as his response to my warning <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:FCYTravis&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=112141806" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:FCYTravis&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=112141806" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>.</p>

<li>Travis' responses have been uncivil and abrasive, and his "I'm an admin and I'll do what I want" attitude is unhealthy. He has not maintained the decorum expected of a Wikipedia administrator.</li>
<li>Travis clearly has a strong negative opinion of Essjay, which is the topic of discussion on the disputed page. Him closing an AFD on the matter is a clear <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">Conflict of Interest</a> and is grossly inappropriate. Administrators should refrain from using their administrative powers in situations where they have a personal stake.</li>

<p>If I understand things correctly, we are discussing whether there was a proper discussion about closing the discussion regarding whether we should continue the discussion that was set up to summarize the other discussion which was set up as an overflow from the original discussion.

<li>There is a MFD over the discussion. Travis improperly closed it, and followed it up with a series of personal attacks and "I'm an admin I'll do what I want" type comments to anyone who disagreed with him. I for one have an issue with that kind of attitude, and hence the post here. I apologise if it is unclear.

<dd>It's your <b>opinion</b> that it was an improper close. Again, I note that I was far from the only administrator to close it, or to ask for a speedy close.

<dd>I feel the template warning about personal attacks was justified. While it may have been FCYTravis's impression that the MfD would not pass, it was still inappropriate to close it prematurely. 12 keeps (1 made by a single edit user) and 7 deletes, in my opinion, does not in any way justify a closure at that point. Regardless of whether the initial closure edit summary was in response to the small message at the top, the user's behavior past that edit has done little to convince me that it was in good faith. Further to this, I believe this user may be in breach of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConflict_of_Interest_604b.html" title="Wikipedia:Conflict of Interest">Wikipedia:Conflict of Interest</a>, mainly after they added <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Miscellany_for_deletion/Wikipedia:Community_noticeboard/Essjay&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=112142555" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Miscellany_for_deletion/Wikipedia:Community_noticeboard/Essjay&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=112142555" rel="nofollow">this comment</a> to the MfD. (Even if it's not explicitly stated in policy, the fact this user has an apparent strong opinion in the Essjay matter makes it difficult for me to see how them closing an MfD relating to the matter is fair and justified.) --<a href="../../../s/a/g/User%7ESagaciousuk_943b.html" title="User:Sagaciousuk">Sagaciousuk</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../s/a/g/User_talk%7ESagaciousuk_5eb4.html" title="User talk:Sagaciousuk">talk</a>)</sup> 20:12, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I have no means of defending myself against any reader who comes to that page. It would be inappropriate for me to post a rebuttal on his userpage, or to remove this content from his userpage since it is an attack against me. If he wants to leave Wikipedia, that's his business and I wish him the best of luck in future endeavors.

Thus, I am bringing it here to have it removed from his userpage, assuming another admin feels as I do that this is inappropriate. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 21:38, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>As it says somewhere above. I earlier today tried to move the Brandt article away from another non-consensus AFD by stubbing it and spliting any useful information to other articles. I provided a detailed explanation at <a href="../../../d/a/n/Talk%7EDaniel_Brandt_eca9.html" title="Talk:Daniel Brandt">Talk:Daniel Brandt</a>, and specifically asked any reverting admin to explain their reasoning, and everybody else to let it go after that and continue with the previous process. Not everybody agreed, but we were having some sort of conversation about what to do next. So I finally went to sleep. When I woke up, I found the article on AFD again, ahead of previously agreed time. So it obviously didn't work, and now we're maybe even worse off, and if we are, I'm sorry I caused it.</p>
<p>What I find curious is this: Despite my thorough explanation, detailed reasoning, and a polite request to handle the matter graciously, I was reverted by Majorly whose only communication with me or the general readership of the talk page existed of an unprotection summary. I tried talking about it with him on IRC, but it's obvious that we won't come to an agreement that way. In any case, this isn't a question about Majorly, it's about whether this kind of revert is justified in this kind of situation. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User_talk%7EZocky_f226.html" title="User talk:Zocky">Zocky</a> | <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_Picture_Popups_bee7.html" title="User:Zocky/Picture Popups">picture popups</a> 02:05, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It doesn't appear that Majorly reverted your edit, just your protection of the page. Since you had just made a major edit to the page, protecting it on your chosen version was inappropriate. (Why, for instance, should only admins be able to revert you?) Your explanation was certainly detailed but did not appear to me to explain why you felt protection was needed. In light of that I think Majorly's unprotection was justified. Though I don't begrudge your effort to try something original, and I think your edit was probably good, protecting the page was not necessary. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 02:26, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>I understand that, but I think that the admin part of your action was largely unexplained, and inappropriate. The main content of your edit, the stubbing and merging to which you devoted hundreds of words of explanation, was not reverted. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 02:41, 3 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>As far as I understand, he unprotected the page specifically by request of editors who wanted to revert the article itself. But in any case, my question is not "should Majorly have unprotected the page?" I agreed in advance that I would have no problem with anyone doing that and I don't. The more relevant questions are: was there sufficient communication from my side for what I was doing? was there sufficient communication from his side? was he right to ignore my request for explanation? <a href="../../../z/o/c/User_talk%7EZocky_f226.html" title="User talk:Zocky">Zocky</a> | <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_Picture_Popups_bee7.html" title="User:Zocky/Picture Popups">picture popups</a> 02:44, 3 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Having read your statement, I don't quite understand why you protected the page, aside from the fact that you liked your version. But presumably everyone else liked their versions as well. So to use your words I think the communication from your side was not sufficient. Majorly might have been a bit rude in his responses and certainly should have said a few sentences more at your request, but I think his initial unprotection summary was reason enough; your action was exceptional (and basically contrary to the main rules on using protection, since you apparently were directly using it to win a content dispute) and not well-supported by the connected explanation. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 02:58, 3 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>What content dispute? What my version? I have nowhere expressed my opinion on what the fate of the article should be. I was looking for a way forward. We don't have a deadline, the article doesn't have to be perfect today or tomorrow. Even waiting for the whole 13 months would not have made Wikipedia a worse encyclopedia, and we were obviously discussing things to be done before that, even today. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User_talk%7EZocky_f226.html" title="User talk:Zocky">Zocky</a> | <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_Picture_Popups_bee7.html" title="User:Zocky/Picture Popups">picture popups</a> 03:18, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You dramatically edited the article which was the subject of a current dispute, in a way directly relevant to that dispute. That makes you part of the content dispute.

To then protect the page (preventing people from reverting your major edit should they disagree with it) is not appropriate at all, without some strong explanation of the need for an extraordinary response (for instance, doing this in a BLP situation might be appropriate). <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 03:31, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It wasn't a content decision, it was about process. I was summarizing the arguments and deducing from them based on what both sides said, not based on what I personally would prefer, nor even based on what I think is the right thing to do with an article. I was attempting to shortcut another round of AFD which, especially with the rumours of admins being willing to close a non-consensus discussion as delete, wasn't looking like something that will solve our long-term problem with this article. Where does the assumption that I did otherwise come from? <a href="../../../z/o/c/User_talk%7EZocky_f226.html" title="User talk:Zocky">Zocky</a> | <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_Picture_Popups_bee7.html" title="User:Zocky/Picture Popups">picture popups</a> 03:40, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry, it was definitely a content issue; you changed the content of the article radically. By doing so you offer a clear opinion on what the article should contain (even if based on the opinions of others and not your personal preference), and involve yourself in the content dispute you were trying to address. I'm not sure what you are getting at by saying this was a process action; what process involves stubbifying/merging an article and then protecting it? If the point was just to force a conversation, which is a valid goal, you can simply protect the article. There are very few exceptional cases in which you should both make substantial edits to a page and protect it. This was not one of them. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 04:02, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That's somewhat like saying that an admin closing an AFD is getting involved in the content issue. "Process" is not the same thing as "policy". Policy describes and prescribes process. What I did was out of other policy than IAR, but it wasn't out of process because I did what IAR, itself a policy, demands in such cases. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User_talk%7EZocky_f226.html" title="User talk:Zocky">Zocky</a> | <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_Picture_Popups_bee7.html" title="User:Zocky/Picture Popups">picture popups</a> 04:06, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Question; "should Majorly have unprotected the page?" Answer; <b>Yes</b>. To make such bold changes to an article then fully protect it... what were you thinking? To do so then make it that only admins should be able to make amendments? Highly inappropriate protection IMO. Q; "was there sufficient communication from my side for what I was doing?" A; Irrelevant. Sorry Zocky I just dont see your logic here <b><a href="../../../g/l/e/User_talk%7EGlen_S_ecf5.html" title="User talk:Glen S">Glen</a></b> 02:51, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Look, we're not going to abandon IAR, and this was a rare instance of it being used as it's supposed to be used: I made a decision which was not inline with other policy, but I thought it the best course of action. I fully explained my reasoning, and was engaged in the discussion about it on the appropriate page. I didn't delete anything, nor force removal of any information whatsoever. I even myself moved the information I thought was notable to another article.</dd>
<dd>Some people expressed support, some were outraged, others were outraged at first, but decided to engage in the discussion anyway. I was not threatening to force my way, I even offered to revert myself if we can't come to an agreement in a day or two. I left an open option for any admin overruling me and the return to the regular process at any time, all I asked was explained reasoning, so that we can move on normally.</dd>
<dd>It's not just a matter of "respecting your felow admins". Majorly could have chosen to undo my protection and leave a message on the talk page, explaining why he thought that that's a better way of dealing with things and advised everyone to wait for the originally suggested one week before going into AFD. If he did, I wouldn't be here complaining. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User_talk%7EZocky_f226.html" title="User talk:Zocky">Zocky</a> | <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_Picture_Popups_bee7.html" title="User:Zocky/Picture Popups">picture popups</a> 03:13, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I recognize that anything D.Bran.dt-affiliated is going to generate angst and various other issues, so I respect any attempts to allay some of that. In my opinion, though, IAR is intended more to be a way to avoid cumbersome process, rather than to avoid longstanding and important policy (such as not using protection to enforce your version of an article). I don't fault you for attempting it for the reasons above, but I also don't think it's something that should be done and protection should have been removed. However, I also agree that communication should have taken place by whoever unprotected to explain the reasons why. In my humble opinion, 98% of the wikidrama around these parts could be avoided outright if people would simply hold their horses and talk it out rather than reacting disproportionately out of moral outrage (note: speaking in generalities, not saying that's what happened here). So, in summary, I like to sit on fences. Both sides could have done things better, and (hopefully once Majorly sees this) we can all move on with better ideas on how to proceed in the future. Unfortunately, we'll still have all forms of d.bra.nd-T-related drama.

<dd>I understand your rationale for the changes (though personally disagree with them) however, I dont understand what this has to do with fully protecting the article. The people you're protecting it from are <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good faith editors</a>. Not vandals, not those involved in edit wars, but those interested in seeing the best article being produced. Just because I have a sysop flag next to my name should not mean I'm the only one able to disagree with you. This is a misapplication of IAR.

<dd>The whole point was keeping it at a near disambig for a time and moving all useful information about his activities to other appropriate articles. Let's face it, we're not talking about some random article. Without protection, I would have been immediately reverted. Sure, I could have gotten several people to do editwar for me and another admin to protect it afterwards, but if I tried that, the somewhat normal conversation we were having would have lasted 5 seconds instead of half a day. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User_talk%7EZocky_f226.html" title="User talk:Zocky">Zocky</a> | <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_Picture_Popups_bee7.html" title="User:Zocky/Picture Popups">picture popups</a> 03:44, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Logically, 'IAR' can only work if everyone (or nearly everyone) agrees that the action is correct/beneficial. If they don't then someone is just going to IAR to put it back. In short, IAR leads directly to edit/wheel warring and stagnation unless the action is uncontroversial. For actions which ARE generally agreed IAR is a way of saving time and cutting through red tape. For actions which are disputed it is a disruptive waste of time that would be wise to avoid. There was no chance of your Brandt rewrite being greeted with near universal acceptance - which you presumably knew and therefor protected the article. Therefor it was IMO a poor candidate for an invocation of IAR... and I am only surprised that it didn't turn out alot worse. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 20:05, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I at this point have no choice but to agree that an AFD is probably the only way forward. But I'm extremely dissappointed that it was pushed today. We agreed just 3 days ago that the AFD would be in 7 days. After my IAR intervention failed, the proper thing is to return to the normal process, or possibly discuss other options, not run the AFD ahead of time. Many people indicated they want to present prepared cases at the AFD, and this cheats them of the chance to do that. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User_talk%7EZocky_f226.html" title="User talk:Zocky">Zocky</a> | <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_Picture_Popups_bee7.html" title="User:Zocky/Picture Popups">picture popups</a> 04:20, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't see how you can single out my occasional excesses when the entire Talk page is out of control. I'm trying to bring balance to what I consider to be a lynching of a fellow Wikipedian.-<a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillDeanCarter_644b.html" title="User:BillDeanCarter">BillDeanCarter</a> 07:08, 3 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Your excesses were not occasional; literally every single edit you made to that page has been needlessly abusive and abrasive. That you continue to do so after being politely asked to stop by multiple editors is completely unacceptable. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 07:14, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>First, you can't expect balance from a discussion in which nearly everybody agrees. But even if it were different, attempting to bring balance by insulting people is not likely to work. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User_talk%7EZocky_f226.html" title="User talk:Zocky">Zocky</a> | <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_Picture_Popups_bee7.html" title="User:Zocky/Picture Popups">picture popups</a> 07:19, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Although it is a bit late at this point and doing so would probably be more punative than preventative, this user certainly merited a block for the excesses of his incivility. <i>(<a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetscott_c779.html" title="User talk:Netscott"><span title="Leave me a message.">→</span></a><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott"><span style="background: white; color: grey" title="Go to my userpage.">Netscott</span></a>)</i> 18:23, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Isn't this his 50th or so warning? He's been through multiple Arbcoms, he knows the rules. How many times will Dean and Bryan and the Freeper gang get free wiki-abuse passes? It seems like the timespan defense (well, they haven't committed X in the last Y time period, despite having committed this offense Z times before) gets used way too often. And frankly, I think that the 'I'm in an Arbcom' defense is getting abused too.

<dd>Moe, you are correct that I did not warn the user while they were vandalising. However, you should note that the user had received several messages the last time that they vandalised and did receive a block. The user certainly had the opportunity to receive these messages and was blocked during a prior session, which is a pretty strong message in itself. Also, please note that AIV instructions specifically direct this type of vandalism reporting to this page as AIV is only for cases where immediate action is required. --<a href="../../../a/f/t/User%7EAfter_Midnight_e273.html" title="User:After Midnight">After Midnight</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../a/f/t/User_talk%7EAfter_Midnight_381d.html" title="User talk:After Midnight">0001</a></small></sup> 16:34, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>AIV is used for immediate response of IP vandalism, which of course would have been the case if you had responded accordingly. AIV actually says "use the links above", not specifically this page, just pointing out. Regardless of what AIV says, when a users starts vandalizing on this site, common sense tells us to warn him of his actions, not wait until he commits 8 acts of vandalism, not warn him and expect him to get blocked. Again, if he starts again, go ahead and revert and report so he can be blocked, but at least, next time, if an IP starts, warn them. — <a href="../../../m/o/e/User_talk%7EMoe_Epsilon_62b6.html" title="User talk:Moe Epsilon"><font color="#000000">Moe</font></a> 16:50, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Moe, I agree that it is best to warn when the user is vandalising, but until I get the special bells to ring in my head to alert me to check the articles and the watchlist when the vandalism is occurring, I can not always be there to do it in time. There is a difference between "wait until he commits 8 acts of vandalism" and just not being aware of something while it is happenning. Please keep in mind that we all do the best that we can here, we are not neglectful or lazy, as I feel you are suggesting to me. --<a href="../../../a/f/t/User%7EAfter_Midnight_e273.html" title="User:After Midnight">After Midnight</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../a/f/t/User_talk%7EAfter_Midnight_381d.html" title="User talk:After Midnight">0001</a></small></sup> 17:01, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry if this is what you are implying, because it wasn't my intention and I apologize. But you seem to want something more to be done, am I correct?

<p>For nearly 2 weeks now, this article has been under attack by sock puppeteers, vandals and agenda pushers. Could the editors there get some assistance?

<dd>Seems like the problem is that regular editors oppose 'recentism' in any form, then use the 'it's been weeks and no one is talking about it' argument to avoid inclusions. The fact that multiple editors left comments about Coulter's use of 'gay' as an attack comment against Edwards, and even before that in multiple instances, thus constituting a notable pattern, and that one editor left a list of six different national specific coverage/reaction instances, and so on is ALL dismissed as activist recentism is no doubt part of the reason for the edit war. The simple fact is that Coulter's aware of the impact of her comments, and the media noise it generates, and so on. To not include a known pattern of behavior which even the conservative talking heads are repudiating, instituted against a major political figure, saying 'let's wait and see' each time she does it, is to make the article inherently POV. If she says something stupid, and gets called about it, it should be included with citation. That's what Wikipedia's here for. Documentation. No one's denying what she said, it's on tape and all over the internet. Apparently some editors can support that it's a pattern with citation, making it doubly notable, and still it's deflected with 'Let's avoid recentism'. I don't have a solution, but the page is guaranteed to keep being subject to edits seeking to include it. I recommend that the regular group of editors finds a way to include it with proper citation. If you take control of how it's phrased, you can probably control it more than the general denial on grounds of 'recentism' pattern. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 20:44, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Fyslee has made it perfectly clear on Fyslee's talk page to never use Fyslee's real name for the security of his family. An editor has revealed this person's real life name without permission or consent. Further, this editor has made dubious accusations about Fyslee, a long standing good contributor to Wikipedia. This may be blockworthy. --QuackGuru 03:49, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm trying to keep this article tagged as a copyvio for an admin to review, but the creator of the article keeps removing the sd tag through a registered account and an IP that only edits articles the registered account has been editing.

<dd>What, you want revenge or something? Those comments were made days ago and as far as I can see haven't continued. Yes, incivility is a violation of the <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">rules</a>... but the best advice I can give you for a one-time incident like this is to let it go. ---<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User%7EJ.smith_e018.html" title="User:J.smith">J.S</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User_talk%7EJ.smith_6ef6.html" title="User talk:J.smith">T</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_J.smith_698b.html" title="Special:Contributions/J.smith">C</a>/<a href="../../../w/r/e/WP%7EWRE_9138.html" title="WP:WRE">WRE</a>)</small> 16:52, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Not even so much as a warning? Is that "revenge" too? And no, it's definitely not a "one-time incident": JoeMystical had done this before, and he was even warned on his talk page. <a href="../../../b/i/_/User%7EBi_fef5.html" title="User:Bi">Bi</a> 17:24, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Personally, I'm wondering if that collection of random links at the bottom of the page is allowed; especially that set of porn site links.

I am posting this matter here in case some other account also tries to add such material into articles. So keep your eyes open. And yes, I caught the user vandalising templates.

<dd>It has WP:BIO-sufficient notability? Really? No sources, the claim to fame in the article was helping to <i>maintain</i> a website... It seemed like a totally obvious speedy deletion to me, and that's what I did. We don't remove articles simply because someone doesn't want to be on here, and there are ways to attract adequate attention to pages in need, but this was obviously not notable enough to me.

<dd>Fixed, though it wasn't really a cut and paste move, but rather a normal move followed by a cut and paste revert. I've left it at <a href="../../../s/o/a/Soap_made_from_human_corpses.html" title="Soap made from human corpses">Soap made from human corpses</a>. Jewish soap legend gives the incorrect impression that this is an urban legend that is Jewish in origin or that it only concerned Jewish victims. A quick Google also shows that "Jewish soap legend" seems to be a term mainly used among neo-Nazies. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 00:07, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I want to report the above named user who is shadowing me on WP. The situation has arisen from my edits on <a href="../../../c/e/l/Template%7ECeltic_mythology_9bfe.html" title="Template:Celtic mythology">Template:Celtic_mythology</a>, where I believed that ambiguity was introduced into the template by another editor. The above editor got involved, and is I fear that this reverting is the outset of a campaign to shadow me and revert my edits on WP.

<p>I think the edits here speak for themselves. As anyone who knows my history, or even looks at my contribs can see, I edit and monitor a large number of articles on Irish and Scottish history and mythology. When a new user turns up on these articles and encounters the group of us who regularly work on them, no one is "shadowing" that new user. Multiple editors have been trying to talk to Manopingo and explain why a number of us have had to revert many of his edits. Unfortunately, this is his way of responding to that feedback. <font face="Georgia"><a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_9cdf.html" title="User:Kathryn NicDhàna"><span style="color:navy">~ Kathryn NicDhàna</span></a> <a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_4e24.html" title="User talk:Kathryn NicDhàna">♫</a><font color="navy">♦</font><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_0d4e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kathryn NicDhàna">♫</a></font> 03:06, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmmm, all I can see there are two comments (4 days apart) left in a wrong place. I see no reason to think that this account is compromised.

I'd say there's cause for concern for this editor. He basically edit wars dissenters into staleness as a means of disagreement resolution (see <a href="../../../o/r/g/Talk%7EOrganization_XIII_38bd.html#The_Fight_Against_Roxas" title="Talk:Organization XIII">here</a>, where he basically tells someone that it doesn't matter because he and someone else who agrees with the guy will just get him blocked for 3RR), and his general unwillingness to communicate on his talk page... this guy has no regard for any other editor and acts like he owns many articles. Maybe there's a legit concern here. ScottchS 10:21, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is quite frustrating to me because my every intent in posting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AEssjay&amp;diff=110874299&amp;oldid=110873107" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AEssjay&amp;diff=110874299&amp;oldid=110873107" rel="nofollow">this</a> in response to him was to point out that I understood his outburst was not something he had control over, and I forgave him for it. No attempt on my part was made to act or sound as if I was somehow superior to him. My every statement on Wikipedia has continually and routinely shown that I do not hold <i>any</i> good-faith user in any higher or lower respect than I hold myself. This includes even Jimbo, whom I have taken to task twice before for what I felt were errors on his part. Regardless, I recognized post-facto that there were other ways of interpreting my comment towards him. Because of this, I apologized twice to him <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Community_noticeboard&amp;diff=111413471&amp;oldid=111412831" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Community_noticeboard&amp;diff=111413471&amp;oldid=111412831" rel="nofollow">[75]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Community_noticeboard&amp;diff=111490321&amp;oldid=111489531" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Community_noticeboard&amp;diff=111490321&amp;oldid=111489531" rel="nofollow">[76]</a>. In the last, I specifically asked him "If there's something more that I can do to make up for this error on my part, by all means please let me know." Despite this, he remains offended and continues to attack me for it. I am deeply bothered by this because there are alternate interpretations. If I could somehow undo what was said, I would. I never intended to offend him.</p>
<p>If <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_M_Dodge_b77b.html" title="User:Peter M Dodge">User:Peter M Dodge</a> wishes to take this matter up in the form of a formal complaint against me, I would be happy to have him do so, in the hopes that this can be amicably resolved. At this point, I do not see how I can make any more amends for this than I already have. My apologies to him are heartfelt and honest. Had I felt at the time there was any other way to interpret my comments towards him than the good intentions that I meant, I would never have clicked "Save page". I remain at his disposal to tell me how I might make amends for this in any way in which I have not already done so. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 21:38, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You have made sincere amends, and on public pages, no less; you can't do anything else.

<dd>Just my two cents, but bringing his depression into this is an almost unforgiveable action. I can't imagine what was going through your head when you wrote that, and had I seen it when it happened, I might have blocked you straight-out for such a blatant personal attack. We have many users here who suffer from mental illnesses or developmental disorders, and they should get the same courtesy and civility that everyone else gets. Durin, the lesson here is to watch what you say; it looks to me like your words drove off a good editor. | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">Mr. Darcy</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a></small> 15:41, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

Given that I'm leaving, I really don't care if he "apologises" or not, but I've yet to see an apology that wasn't belittling me more - in fact, in light of that, I'd rather he didn't "apologise" again.

<li>Peter, for well over a month you have said that you intended to leave the project after the Ilena/fylsee arb com. As for mentioning your personal life, if you advertise your moods so visably on your user page it is inevitable that some people will mention it. To then use that against people seems to be a bit strange. If you are that sensitive about it, wouldn't it be better to not advertise it? Or take a break? Hopefully you will come back when you feel better. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_D._77aa.html" title="User:David D.">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_D._d1e6.html" title="User talk:David D.">(Talk)</a> 23:11, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Exactly. I contribute because I enjoy contributing, and when it ceases being enjoyable, I cease contributing. I wore my ailments and my identity on my sleeve, despite stalkers and harsh words about them for quite some time. Durin's comment was hardly the first harsh comment about it, but it will be the last, on Wikipedia at least - or the last I'll read. Using someone's mental disabilities against them to gain an advantage in debate is <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">completely</a> <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">unacceptable</a>. It's not the only reason I'm leaving, but it's a big one.</p>
<p>The idea previously was to "retire" to just clerking for a while to pass the time and take time off to feel comfortable editing again. I no longer really have a desire to get comfortable editing here - in fact, if I were to get comfortable in a place where those kinds of attacks are acceptable, I would worry about myself. ✎ <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_M_Dodge_b77b.html" title="User:Peter M Dodge"><font color="#669966">Peter M Dodge</font></a> (<a href="../../../p/e/t/User_talk%7EPeter_M_Dodge_3d4d.html" title="User talk:Peter M Dodge"><font color="#669966">Talk to Me</font></a>)</span> 23:29, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Defense</b> - I simply noted an incivil comment made by MONGO and wanted to say something about it, I can't even find the edit as I noticed it before I was unblocked, all I wanted to do was post him a message, I haven't committed any vandalism! any edits I made which were deemed to be POV were reverted and I haven't touched the articles since! I know MONGO has been here longer than me so I spent a lot of time exploring the site to actually find how to defend myself here! I notice that MONGO was himself "de-sysoped" for this exact kind of over-reaction late last year.

<dd>I also looked at FrogSprog's contribs, and they don't seem that remarkable. The Bush sodomite thing wasn't very useful, but it wasn't in an article. Otherwise, FrogSprog had mostly good edits.

<dd>Nobody would have taken notice of him if he hadn't tried to harass MONGO. Once it's established that a banned sockpuppet is harassing editors, the ban should be enforced.

<dd>Unless this harassment consists of more than leaving unpleasant messages around Wikipedia, it's entirely irrelevant, and mentioning it frequently sounds very much like whining. Admins get to make decisions and it's inevitable that not everybody will like them, and this being teh interwebz, there are bound to be flames, annoyances and inane threats. If one wants to be an enforcer, thick skin is a prerequisite.</dd>
<dd>And it's not that patently clear that this person is banned. We have a general forget-and-forgive policy. If somebody is properly banned (e.g. by ArbCom, and for a known amount of time) for a set amount of time, registering a new account to evade that ban is clearly gaming the system and should be prevented. But if somebody's account is permablocked forever by an individual admin, is that person banned forever? Obviously not, we even regularly advise people like that to register new accounts. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User_talk%7EZocky_f226.html" title="User talk:Zocky">Zocky</a> | <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_Picture_Popups_bee7.html" title="User:Zocky/Picture Popups">picture popups</a> 03:46, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I would say that hi8s numerous sock accounts which have been blocked by numerous editors is clear demostration you couldn't be more incorrect.

<dd>We do have a forgive and forget policy. No one requested a checkuser or went on a fishing expedition and if he had returned and simply contributed to the project, no one would have complained. But he didn't. Insteead he decided to repeat the same actions that led to a block previously. Sorry, the community's patience is very short with repeat vandals and very forgiving for reformed ones. Once the IP block has expired, this user is free to create another account and contribute and there will be no questions asked. Unless he decides to vandalize again. In that case he will promptly be blocked. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 06:39, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Of course he's using sockpuppets. That's what everybody does once they get their primary account permablocked and learn that evading blocks is easy. But he isn't a vandal, and he isn't engaged in a personal vendetta. He's a POV pusher, but we all are to some xtent and that's not a cardinal sin on Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>My whole point in this is that permablocking problematic users who are not blatant vandals is counterproductive and in the long term wastes everybody's time and effort. <small>(And it's not as he doesn't have some of a point. Articles about North Korea are indeed often written from the American perspective. Countering systemic bias a worthy goal.)</small> If and when this guy returns, he will still have the same POV, and still go to the same articles. When he's instantly met with reverts, and threats of blocks for being a sockpuppet (how else could he edit at all, his account is permablocked), that just reinforces his conviction that he's being targeted. I bet he feels just as harassed as MONGO. And then we continue the vicious cycle until he gives up and a bunch of other people are disgusted. OTOH, if we reset our patience counter to 0, try talking to him and working with him, maybe there's a chance that he can learn to work with us. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User_talk%7EZocky_f226.html" title="User talk:Zocky">Zocky</a> | <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_Picture_Popups_bee7.html" title="User:Zocky/Picture Popups">picture popups</a> 07:05, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Maybe in time, he'll calm down enough to be a decent contributor...but honestly, you can't expect anyone to agree that redirecting another editor's userpage to Murderer and the other offensive edits are not examples of blatant vandalism. For the record, I never dealt with this editor until informed about his harassment of others...after he was blocked by other admins and still failed to reform, I saw no reason to not invite him to leave. Your attitude suggests that harassment is to be tolerated, and I linked you to his very first edit, which was hardly indication that this editor had started his efforts here with simply a desire to rid North Korean articles of some systemic "American" bias...he didn't start off being the nice guy and then find himself blocked for POV pushing...he showed up trolling, and for the most part, has spent his time harassing other editors with not some minor ribbing, but offensive and derogatory ethnocentric rubbish. Like I said, you unblock him and you can nurture him, but I don't see much consensus here for an unblock.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 08:23, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Look MONGO, the more I try to talk about how this benefits or hurts the project, the more you defend your actions, as if I'm criticizing you personally. This isn't about whether you need to be praised or criticized, it's not about whether this guy is a model contributor or not. We all agree that he isn't, amd that some of his edits constitute vandalism. But he obviously wants to change what the encyclopedia says about issues that matter to him, not to simply vandalize articles to have a piss. I'm simply trying to point out that permablocking might not be the best way to deal with such people. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User_talk%7EZocky_f226.html" title="User talk:Zocky">Zocky</a> | <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_Picture_Popups_bee7.html" title="User:Zocky/Picture Popups">picture popups</a> 08:37, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Pertaining to you bringing up my comments, I apologize for them; doing things like that brings me down to their level and I've decided to just flat out ignore them, if all possible, at least. It's just that his has been going on for quite a while, and it's truly "wikistressing" me out that nothing either has or can be done about it. Also, I fear Craxy may be "revving up" another verbal bombardment soon; he recently posted a message about him hearing, no doubt from Butterrum, that I called him a "retard," which is, if you don't know, totally false. ♣ <a href="../../../k/l/p/User%7EKlptyzm_14bd.html" title="User:Klptyzm"><font color="blue"><b>Klptyzm</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../k/l/p/User_talk%7EKlptyzm_0579.html" title="User talk:Klptyzm"><font color="#FF0000">Chat wit' me</font></a> <b>§</b> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Klptyzm_dc1b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Klptyzm"><font color="#FF1234">Contributions</font></a></sup> ♣ 22:04, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The heavy metal music article is at FAR, and a few editors are working on the article. I'm worried of the page turning into a revert war due to Deathrocker rather than the original intention of improving content. Really, I think Marskell's being fairly reasonable with the editor - given the amount of blocks he's recieved, he's lucky he hasn't recieved a permanent one. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuciferMorgan_f0d2.html" title="User:LuciferMorgan">LuciferMorgan</a> 11:04, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>JzG, in your complaint about my "unilateral removal of information at ArbCom," you have carefully avoided mentioning one inconvenient truth, as you are in the habit of doing: the information I was deleting was personal info about a Wikipedia member. As Moe said on my Talk page, posting such information is unacceptable and worthy of a block. I will also mention, in this venue, the e-mail you sent to me this morning that said, "Fuck off." If I did the same things you've been doing, I would instantly be blocked for incivility and posting personal info.</p>
<p>Is anybody going to do anything about this?</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to the logic that was used to permablock <a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFensteren_63a8.html" title="User:Fensteren">Fensteren</a> ("no new user goes straight into dispute resolution"), both Apj-us-nyc and Eschoir should be instantly permablocked as sockpuppets.</p>

I have refactored the worst instances of inappropriate material being added (by various parties) and left the rest for the arbitrators to sort through, and urged all the parties to bear in mind that the evidence and workshop need to be relevant and comprehensible for the arbitrators to use to resolve the case. It would best at this point if everyone would stop editing the pages, unless absolutely necessary. Evidence inappropriate for presentation on-wiki (including but not limited to information revealing real-world identifying information) should be e-mailed directly to the arbitrators and not posted on-wiki. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 21:53, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>With all due respect Brad, I feel that some of your conduct has been the same. You posted a spurious defamatory email from banned <b>multiple checkuser confirmed sockpuppteer</b> user BrianfromPalatine - who was determined through multiple RFCU's to be a <b>serial</b> liar about every aspect of his life including his indentity, age, location, employment, background, etc. You published this wild unbelievable screed full of spurious unfounded allegations of harassment and stalking without one bit of evidence to back them up. The <b>documented</b> facts are that in the 100's of posts by Bryan on Free Republic during that time frame <b>not one</b> claims harassment - but instead they document his own malfeasance such as bragging about being a 'long time trouble maker' on liberal boards, and even outlining a plan to infiltrate liberal discussion boards, post <b>phony</b> threats against conservatives, and then report those threats to the police, to benefit Free Republic! 'Dean' accused BenBurch of felonious harassment that involved the police, but when I offer to have someone get the 'police report' for verification, you delete <b>these</b> comments, while letting banned user 'Bryan's' 100% undocumented claims of stalking and worse, and 'Dean's' claims of felony harassment against an editor in good standing stay. Thank God that Bryan didn't claim in his email that [liberal] '<a href="../../../a/z/a/Azaria_Chamberlain_disappearance_b947.html#Popular_media" title="Azaria Chamberlain disappearance">Dingoes Ate My Baby</a>!', as I'm sure it would have been entered into 'evidence' by you, as credible, true and correct. - <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairness_And_Accuracy_For_All_6573.html" title="User:Fairness And Accuracy For All">FaAfA</a> <a href="../../../f/a/i/User_talk%7EFairness_And_Accuracy_For_All_8a6a.html" title="User talk:Fairness And Accuracy For All">(yap)</a> 23:24, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am the clerk for the arbitration case. Blocked or banned users are permitted to submit evidence by e-mail, to be either posted to the evidence page or forwarded to the arbitrators. To an extreme degree of obviousness, this does not mean that I vouched for the content of the evidence as "credible, true and correct." If you had requested at the time that I remove this evidence and forward to the arbitrators by e-mail instead, I would have considered your request. That you are raising the matter instead at this time is really extraordinary. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 23:30, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Most of 'Bryan's' email tirade was not pertinent to the matters being Arbifatrated. I had no idea that we could request removal unless there was specfic personal attack, BLP violation or similar (my fault) and that was one reason why I challenged 'Dean's' claims of felony harassment by BenBurch - and even arranged for a friend to drive from Chicago to Palatine to get a signed statement from the police - but you deleted all that - while 'Dean's' claims of felony harassment not only stand, but get posted to 1000's of users talk pages via the Signpost.

<dd>Damn right. The case should be closed, endorsing Bryan's ban, applying the blindingly obvious, i.e. blocking Dean, and probably an article ban and civility parole for FAAFA. It has been far and away the most ill-tempered and pointless RFAR I have ever been involved in.

<p>Yeah, I'm going to respond to that. My entire purpose in starting an account was to remove an abysmally sourced criticism from an article about an organization that, in the time period that was described by the abysmally sourced criticism, was a one-man website run by a living person named Jim Robinson. I happened to know that the abysmally sourced criticism was a lie. It has been removed. <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> has been served. Anything that I manage to achieve beyond that is pure gravy. If I'm doomed, and if I manage to drag down the two incorrigible trolls who posted it when I go, it's a fabulous fringe benefit. They have track records that make the worst goat trail in the Sudan look like the Autobahn. Wikipedia will be better off without them.</p>

All the attacks replace a random page with "ESSJAY'S REVENGE" numerous times, and do the same to the edit summery. So far, there has to have been about 1000 attacks in numerous waves.

<dd>Possible, but the block was a username block, I assume because using "wiktionary" in the name is a violation of <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSER_5ae6.html" title="WP:USER">WP:USER</a>.

<dd>The username claims that he is an sanctioned representative of Wiktionary, which is blockable under our username guidlines as implying authority within Wikipedia or Wikimedia.

<p>Am I confused? I know that blocking people for isolated personal attacks is not a proper action. But when somebody develops a pattern of personal attacks, and has been warned, and warned again, and warned about being block for it, then keeps doing it, surely a block is warranted? Am I missing something? I have been getting grief over 2 blocks I did today, both people had multiple warnings about personal attacks, and continued to do it. I just don't understand what I have done wrong here. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC"><small><sup>High</sup></small>InBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 23:03, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>(copied from a thread higher on the page to centralize discussion here:) I see that HighInBC has now also blocked <a href="../../../d/b/u/User%7EDbuckner_293e.html" title="User:Dbuckner">Dbuckner</a> for 24 hours for personal attacks made in the above thread and continuing on Dbuckner's userpage. The user has argued against the block but has not posted an unblock request to date, and has instead e-mailed the blocking administrator. I find much of the language of Dbuckner's comments to be highly unnecessary, but am troubled by the concept of blocking a serious content contributor based in part on comments made in response to an administrator's comments on the user's own userpage. I post the matter here for comment. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 23:05, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>HighInBC, I don't think anyone is defending personal attacks. The questions are, what constitutes a personal attack, and what constitutes a <i>blockable</i> personal attack. I do not endorse, by any means, all the language used and comments made by the two users you blocked today. But we administrators are supposed to have thicker skins sometimes; and comments made in the context of discussing administrator actions, or on a user's own talkpage in response to an admin's comments there, may deserve a bit more leeway than might otherwise obtain. I would have strongly deprecated the comments made today, but I would have walked away rather than block for them. Of course these are often judgment calls. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 23:09, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I see somebody insulting people all day long, and not responding to warnings, then getting blocked for it. The block was preventative because I had every reason to believe he would continue. My skin is plenty thick and I never got angry, this was simply me enforcing policy. I do not think that "the situation" justifies personal attacks, any situation. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC"><small><sup>High</sup></small>InBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 23:11, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

First, I agree that thicker skins are needed. If I blocked everyone who got annoyed and used inappropriate language, half the editors on Wikipedia would be blocked.</p>
<p>Secondly, the incideents in question were on places like the editor's own Talk page and <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a>; that's surely much less important than if they were made on article Talk pages, or even on another editor's Talk page.

<dd>What? Personal attacks are okay in certain places? All I can do is read the policy and follow it, how do I learn these unwritten rules about talk pages being exempt from NPA?

<dd>(ec)If this is about judgment calls, the please respect my judgment. But if I have gone against some sort of well established rule please point it out and I will repent.

<dd>You seem to be under the illusion that I took it personally. It is just me enforcing policy. What I take personally is the accusation that I had some sort of childish motive. I would not tolerate that behavior from a new user, why should I take it from an established user who knows better. Even if calling me pompous is not an attack calling a bunch of editors fuckwits is, and that was the first final warning I gave him. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC"><small><sup>High</sup></small>InBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 23:35, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You say to him "Don't call me names." That sounds personal to me. If someone called me a name, I would look at the person and feel pity as he/she needs to stoop to a low intelligence level.

You gave me an attitude as well on his talk page. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetsFan76_ea64.html" title="User:MetsFan76">MetsFan76</a> 23:37, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>HighInBC, don't worry about it. Everyone has different standards for when repeated personal attacks reach the level of blockable disruption... and for far too many people those standards seem largely dependent on who the person is and who they are insulting. At 'worst' you applied a strict standard for civility - while adhering to that standard yourself despite considerable provocation. Hardly worthy of condemnation, though varying degrees of 'disagreement' are inevitable. Worldtraveller, Dbuckner, Giano II, and even MetsFan76 have clearly engaged in insults over this issue and ought to cut it out. If they continue you can always ask another admin to step in to spare yourself yet more attacks for stopping their bad behaviour. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 23:39, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Add "acting like a child" to the list of insults you supposedly <b>haven't</b> made today. No, his user page did not say that he blocked Dbuckner because he was drug addled... that was all you, 'extrapolating' from his pro-marijuana comments. As to diffs... I provided a diff for the drugs comment and the other two insults were made (or repeated) by you right here in this thread. Surely you can find the statements on this page where you said it was ok to call him pompous and that he was acting like a child.</dd>

<dd>Responding to repeatedly being called a "fuckwit" with a mild warning about personal attacks IS 'handling criticism' fairly well. As is the way he has dealt with your repeated insults. Eventually blocking when the incivility went on and on is a debatable matter, but I don't think there can be any question that HighInBC has remained considerably more civil than various of his detractors.

<dd>CBD, do you see what you just did? This is one of the problems on Wikipedia and why someone like Worldtraveller wrote an article such as <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAIL_249b.html" title="WP:FAIL">WP:FAIL</a>. People here sometimes are too quick to get their thoughts down that they don't bother to read what other people have written. If you scrolled all the way down, you will see that me, Giano and HighinBC have resolved our dispute. In fact, HighinBC sent me a personal email which I greatly appreciated. What you just did was why some editors resort to personal attacks. The issue here has been dropped yet, you have continued it. You are doing it now and you did it before with WT. You push people to the point where they are going to resort to harsh words. It seems as if you would rather not has this resolved but continue going back and forth with mindless drivel. If you do not have anything constructive to say in this matter (which has been resolved) then I suggest you back off. If, however, you are looking to start something with me, feel free to email me as I do not think any further discussion here is necessary. If your prefer not to, then I am done talking to you. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetsFan76_ea64.html" title="User:MetsFan76">MetsFan76</a> 00:43, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I'm sure it's been said by others, but I cannot pass up the chance to go on the record again. Blocks for "personal attacks" should be so rare as to be shocking. They should be exceptional. They should be because of things that simply are so far beyond the pale as to be unconscionable. They should be for saying that X is the <a href="../../../z/o/d/Zodiac_killer.html" title="Zodiac killer">Zodiac killer</a>. They should not be for "defiance." They should not be for four letter words. After all, some people (including me) can be very insulting without ever using a dirty word. Some people (including me) can be calculatingly belittling. Some people (including me) can push the right buttons to make the other person want to explode in anger. Other people can do the same with hitting the "block" button.</li>
<li><i>Argumentum ad block</i> is not a valid argument. You cannot win by blocking. The blocking policy makes this clear enough. Therefore, a person making you angry and angrier and angriest is not a reason for blocking. It's a reason to call a cop -- to call in a third party.</li>
<li>So, no blocks for "personal attacks" unless you can define what is and is not a personal attack, how much of an attack makes a block, how much of a block goes with what level of 'attack' and, most of all, a good explanation of <i>how Wikipedia was harmed and productivity inhibited by that "attack."</i></li>
<li>Because of the exceptional misuse and misreading of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> (which shouldn't be policy at all, as it says virtually nothing), most of AN/I is "block X for insulting me!" More, people are going around poking at others to get them to utter a dirty word so that they can be blocked. Others are blocked and then, when the blocked person gets angry, have that anger used as justification for a bigger block. That's insane! Other people are going around with their radar dishes spinning, hunting for an insult anywhere and everywhere. Way, way, way above I tried to wittily satirize HighinBC in my comment on unblocking by using the word "high" in several combinations. It was playful, but it was intended to express an opinion. On the other hand, on my talk page right now, HighinBC is worried that, when I said I didn't want to get into an electronic tarbaby argument, that I was making a racial slur. You have to break syntax to even get a racial slur in there, and the main meaning was straightforward. Now, he didn't threaten to block me, but that kind of alert and tripwire sensitivity to anything that <i>might be</i> an attack is really not helpful to our productivity.</li>
<li>At least that's my view. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 04:31, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Honestly, Geogre, we already know your view.&#160;:) I think that there have to be consequences to personal attacks. They are inherently disruptive because they negatively affect the frame of mind of other people trying to edit in peace. Warnings and short blocks are quite justified. Let's side with the people who are defending the tone of Wikipedia, not the people who undermine it.</dd>
<dd>Then again, I suppose everyone already knows that's what I think. Also, I'm not talking about defending the kind of hair-trigger actions we have seen in the past from a small number of high-profile admins who won't be named. But this "Oh no, someone blocked a poor uncivil user!! Let's all play the violin!" mentality doesn't help, either. Let other admins do their job and use their discretion unless they develop a pattern of trying to act like petty tyrants, in which case the community will eventually bring them back into line, as we've seen in the past. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 06:33, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>HighInBC, In general we don't block for personal insults. IIRC It has never been a part of the blocking policy until last fall when "persistent personal insults" was added (I see it's just been removed again, and then put back). These types of blocks used to come under "disruption", and you had to make that determination.</p>
<p>In some of your comments you seem to be asking for hard and fast rules. Use your judgment instead: is the block preventative? Is it going to do more harm than good? Is the user a juvenile little prick trying to run someone down, or is he a great editor who gets exasperated once in a while? Before you block a productive editor for disruption (personal attacks) try to interact with them to find out if they are in the midst of a legitimately complaint or if they are just trying to cause trouble. If it's the former, a block will nearly always make things worse. While productive editors almost never do the latter.</p>
<p>CBD mentions above that some admin's blocks "seem largely dependent on who the person is and who they are insulting". This is absolutely right. Would you treat a 14yr old who comes here, without doing anything productive, and calls every one a "fuckwitt" the same as a great featured article writer who blows his top from time to time? Put the interest of the project first when you make these decisions. --<a href="../../../d/u/k/User_talk%7EDuk_82a4.html" title="User talk:Duk">Duk</a> 07:04, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh noes edit conflict again—well, it can't be helped, I'll just reply to HighinBC and Metamagician3000 as I intended (and thank you for your sensible words, Duk). Metamagician, what about the productive users being driven off while "eventually" plays out? How long an eventuality can the project afford? I want to ask HighinBC (as I asked CBD above, which went over like a ton of bricks, so why not try again) to exercise his imagination—to put himself in another person's place—while I play the violin myself if necessary. HBC, when I posted a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:HighInBC&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=112667377" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:HighInBC&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=112667377" rel="nofollow">polite message</a> on your page some hours after you blocked dbuckner, urging you to at least take the block to ANI for review, you told me "I can't believe this shit"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:HighInBC&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=112667377" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:HighInBC&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=112667377" rel="nofollow">[112]</a> and then promptly "archived"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:HighInBC&amp;diff=112674729&amp;oldid=112670785" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:HighInBC&amp;diff=112674729&amp;oldid=112670785" rel="nofollow">[113]</a> mine along with several other messages on the same theme—well, actually just deleted them (there are no archives) but no matter. I won't quote your pronouncements today about civility back at you. I'll be glad to overlook your calling my message shit and deleting it. I assume you were a little stressed and upset. But please consider that you lengthened Worldtraveller's block because he was a little upset (he'd just been <i>blocked</i> by CBD! He was probably <i>very</i> upset!) You blocked Dbuckner for being a little upset. And you have made up a perverse rule—I'm sorry if you don't like that way of putting it—you thought there was a rule?— about how it's extra criminal to be upset <i>while you're blocked</i>: ".. it was for calling me and a few other admins fuckwits while asking to be unblocked that I gave extended the block. That is standard when people are abusive while asking to be unblocked." Standard? While asking to be unblocked? What standard is that? No, the <i>standard</i> is to have "extra" patience with users who have just been shocked by a block. Altogether, it's standard for admins to look the other way if a blocked user loses his/her temper, because it's a natural thing to do. It's standard for admins, decent ones, to be less sensitive on their own account than on behalf of other people. If that's playing the violin, we need a bigger string section. We have the buttons for the defense of Wikipedia, not for our personal fights. Enough with the "personal attack blocks" already, HighinBC, everybody. Please. Let's use the buttons with fellow-feeliing and <i>imagination</i>. And now I'm going to unblock Dbuckner, because there's no way the project is at risk of being "disrupted" by him. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 07:19, 5 March 2007 (UTC).

<dd>My two cents: I agree that we need to give people who are blocked some space and steam to vent on their talk pages without considering it a personal attack or incivility. This is not to suggest that we let them go berzerk there, but I would suggest that everyone keep in mind that if they play ball with the block (only edit their own talk page) there's little damage to <i><b>prevent</b></i> by blocking for longer if they get upset at people - nobody is forced to go read the blocked users' talk page. If they make severe attacks, that's a different case. But I would suggest that allowing them slightly <i>more</i> leeway than a normal incivility block, under these specific circumstances, and limited to their talk page, is in the interests of the project as a whole. It gives people space to vent, which is important. People get upset about being blocked, even if the blocks are completely called for. We need to be able to block without it escalating into a functional ban or driving people away. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 07:37, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I generally agree with being very lenient on blocks for personal attacks, especially those directed at yourself. Indeed, I don't think I've ever blocked anyone solely for personal attacks. However, there comes a point where persistent attacks, incivility, and/or harassment have to be stopped. Because it IS disruptive to the project. Bishonen, you are wrong in claiming that Dbuckner wasn't being disruptive... you said yourself that you assume HighInBC was stressed/upset by the attacks on him. Yes, that argues against him being the one to place the blocks, but it also demonstrates how such incivil behaviour harms the project. And Dbuckner didn't just do it once, but over and over again. At some point it has to be stopped. There will always be disagreements about precisely at what point the disruption from incivility outweighs the benefits of tolerance, but IMO when multiple people have told you repeatedly to stop and you <b>don't</b> then a block is the proper response. People <i>have</i> to be able to control their tempers and act civilly when asked to do so. If they <i>won't</i> do that then they need to be blocked to prevent their continual incivil behaviour from provoking more of the same. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 12:39, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First of all, I want to endorse the unblocking of Dbuckner and Worldtraveller. The block of Worldtraveller was a very bad idea, and was quite surprising, coming from someone who shows a lot of sensitivity about the vulnerability of users who are being reverted, hassled, and threatened when they remove unwanted comments from their talk pages. Surely, CBD, you can see that for a productive, established user, a block for anything other than 3RR is a shock, an insult, a slap in the face. Blocks for disruption are meant to be extremely rare, and used only in cases where it could be reasonably considered that <i>not</i> blocking would harm Wikipedia. They're absolutely not meant to be used as a "Do what you're told or I'll smack you" weapon. Worldtraveller had a very legitimate grievance. Inshaneee's original block of him was completely improper, and admins have been desysopped for such things. I've looked at this "harassment", and honestly, I've had worse than that from Alienus, but I didn't block him or ask anyone else to block him. An administrator who uses a block in a content dispute does not have the right not to be questioned about it, and the fact that it happened some time ago does not mean that Worldtraveller should consider it satisfactorily resolved. It would have been preferable and more dignified to have dropped it, but his not doing so was not a blockable offence. <i>Especially</i> refusing to drop it with an admin was not blockable, because (a) admins should be ready to publicly explain actions that are queried (unless it concerns a block of a sockpuppet or of someone who was posting personal information, in which case explanations can probably be better given <i>privately</i> by e-mail to senior Wikipedians), and (b) admins absolutely need to have thick skins and be able to put up with it if they feel they're being pestered. I could grudgingly accept Inshaneee's refusal to provide a proper answer, but for someone to <i>block</i> the aggrieved victim is extremely counterproductive. Surely the Giano affair has taught us that when someone starts making a fuss <i>because he's annoyed at what he sees as an unfair block</i>, it's the craziest possible solution to block him again. I'm not talking about obvious trolls — teenagers who registered last Thursday, have two article edits, and fourteen obscene edits on user talk pages. I'm talking about respected users being humiliated by a permanent record in their block logs.</p>
<p>As for increasing the block for being uncivil to the admin who was increasing it, that's so obviously wrong as to hardly need comment. But apart from the level of involvement, <i>of course</i> someone who sees himself as unfairly blocked will be upset. If he does <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADisco79&amp;diff=98205089&amp;oldid=98196299" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADisco79&amp;diff=98205089&amp;oldid=98196299" rel="nofollow">this</a>, then by all means, increase the block. If he lets off steam by speaking his mind against those who blocked him, then ignore it. As for HighInBC being upset, I'm sure he was, but I doubt if it was because of disruption and harassment, or because of the naughty word used. If I blocked someone and he filled his talk page with "Musical Linguist is a $&amp;£$*£&amp;$", I wouldn't feel undermined, <i>but</i> if I blocked someone and found that respected administrators were criticizing me for an improper block, I'd feel embarrassed. Please don't blame Dbuckner for HighInBC being upset. If an admin places a proper block, he shouldn't be upset if people query it, even if they refuse to drop the matter. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">Musical L</a><a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist">inguist</a> 13:36, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agreed. It also gets to the point as to <b>who</b> is being more disruptive, the blocker or the blockee. Both WT and Dbuckner kept their cool after they received their respective blocks, however, the blocking admins continued to debate this fiasco. If the issue was done, then it should have been let go, regardless if they felt the need to defend their actions. It is not productive at all and only leads to this AN/I getting longer and longer when there are articles out there that need to be edited. Sometimes this place is no different from a playground.

<dd><i>(overlapping edits, response to Musical Linguist)</i> I actually agree with <i>most</i> of what you say, but strongly disagree about ongoing harassment. Yes, Worldtraveller had every reason to be upset. Yes, he had every reason to request an explanation. Even continuing to pester InShaneee about it was 'ok' (though not good) <i>up to a point</i>. However, <b>nobody</b> has the right to continue harassing another user indefinitely - for <b>any</b> reason. You are correct that 'just because two months have passed' "does not mean that Worldtraveller should consider it satisfactorily resolved"... but there is a vast difference between 'thinking it is still a problem and following dispute resolution procedures' and 'thinking it is still a problem and harassing, insulting, and threatening the other user'. I would have supported, and indeed had already actively encouraged dropping the personal attacks in favor of DR. You say that Worldtraveller's comments about InShaneee being a "witless moron", his threats to 'do everything in my power to get you de-sysoped', and the rest of it 'were not so bad'... and in comparison to some other incidents of abusive behaviour that's true (though I've also seen plenty of 'established users' blocked for alot longer than 24 hours for alot less - without fuss), but I didn't block Worldtraveller for his personal attacks or his threats. I blocked him for harassment. InShaneee had made it clear at least two weeks earlier that he wanted to be left alone. <i>Alot</i> of people had told Worldtraveller that it was time to leave InShaneee alone and follow DR. Worldtraveller actively refused. He insisted on his 'right' to "keep on harassing"... and I blocked him for it. I would do it again. Because I do not believe anyone should be allowed to deliberately go out of their way to try to make another user miserable on an ongoing basis over an extended period of time. Not for any reason. It's unconscionable and offensive. Worldtraveller had options for civilly addressing his grievance and refused to use them. No one tried to force him to drop the issue, just to stop being abusive. He wanted to continue harassing InShaneee rather than to resolve the issue through DR. Wikipedia's policies don't allow such and I would not tolerate it. Finally, you bring up 'removing warnings' and my sensitivity to the concerns of those who are being 'hassled and threatened' about them... just as I am here sensitive to the <b>fact</b> that InShaneee was being 'hassled and threatened' by Worldtraveller, who I then blocked only when he openly refused to stop. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 14:22, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>You are incorrect. The policy is clear that personal attacks <i>may</i> result in blocks in <i>extreme</i> cases. Taking away from all of this that you are perfectly correct and all these people (most of the admins for a really long time) want to "change Wikipedia" is precisely the wrong lesson and will lead to further trouble. If you get nothing else from the experience, get this: you should not block for insults. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 15:25, 5 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>At the same time, I hope we can agree that personal attacks are never an acceptable mode of communication. We've discovered, however, that even asking someone to be civil is itself a breach of civility--that's the lesson I've taken from the last three months. So, is <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> a dead letter? <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 15:28, 5 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My view is that NPA merely said that we don't go around insulting each other. No one disagrees with that, but it also doesn't say much, which is why I regarded it as a non-starter. Of course we shouldn't be insulting and hateful. That's not really a problem. The problem is what happens next. I don't think that asking people to be civil is incivil, but I do think that throwing templates at people is insulting. "What, you can't talk to me, like a person? You have to treat me like an anon getting scolded?" is perfectly reasonable as a reaction to a template. At any rate, I absolutely agree that no one should be going around insulting, nor running to AN/I when insulted. We need to make NPA a real policy by saving it for <i>serious</i> personal attacks (e.g. mentioning real details of a real person's person). <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 18:17, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>HighInBC, you may be able to build a rationale to block someone for "persistent personal attacks" that is in line with policy, but that doesn't mean it is the right thing to do. You always have to apply judgment. The same goes for blocks based on "disruption". Blocking long time editors for personal attacks almost always makes matters worse. To clarify what I wrote before, personal insults have never been a part of the blocking policy until last fall when "persistent personal attacks" was added (someone correct me if I'm wrong). There was a clause for "Personal attacks which place users in danger", but this is different and out of the scope of what we are talking about.</dd>

<p>Just for the record, I would prefer you all to stop referring to my 'personal attacks'. Personal criticisms maybe. I find a rude and impertinent message left on my talk page. <a href="../../../d/b/u/User%7EDbuckner_F---wits_e4e9.html" title="User:Dbuckner/F---wits">This interchange followed</a> (which I have cut and pasted onto my page because the other user has deleted it from his). You can see that I criticised this user's actions, his general lack of manners, and that was all. What followed was hardly proportionate. <a href="../../../d/b/u/User%7EDbuckner_293e.html" title="User:Dbuckner">edward (buckner)</a> 15:35, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, people should have thick skins, and no one wants to hear constant whinging about how so-and-so called me ignorant last week so please block them. But if someone's cautioned to stop getting personal by an uninvolved admin, and doesn't stop, then a block is hard to argue with. An editor who won't back off personal attacks despite a warning is likely to escalate to more serious disruption and drag in other editors, and aren't blocks supposed to be preventive? By the way, the excuse that "I didn't call you a fuckwit, I just suggested that you were acting in a manner analagous to that in which a fuckwit might be expected to behave" strikes me as wikilawyering. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMastCell_1b0e.html" title="User:MastCell">MastCell</a> 18:02, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm here on referral from <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>. Not sure how to deal with this particular problem user. Is advocating some type of religious agenda; keeps creating strange nonsense pages with religious rants that get speedily deleted (which is why most of this user's history doesn't appear in their contributions page), and adds odd unsourced information &amp; commentary to religious articles dealing with Christianity and Islam. Also edits the user pages of other editors, but I think that was a newbie mistake that nobody ever explained to this user. Also some linkspamming. Not sure what to do in this particular case...<a href="../../../r/j/a/User%7ERJASE1_c81d.html" title="User:RJASE1">RJASE1</a> <a href="../../../r/j/a/User_talk%7ERJASE1_09fb.html" title="User talk:RJASE1"><sup>Talk</sup></a> 05:00, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This user seems confused (even to the point of not knowing why they get negative comments). However, I notice they still edited a user's user page after you left the note about not doing that (and they responded on your user page no less). It almost seems like willful ignorance at that point. <font color="#1874CD"><b><a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeebo86_eb89.html" title="User:Leebo86">Leebo</a></b></font><small><sup><a href="../../../l/e/e/User_talk%7ELeebo86_8ca0.html" title="User talk:Leebo86"><font color="#B22222">86</font></a></sup></small> 05:10, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I deleted the article in question along with another recently created article on a non-notable band. I don't think it's a compromised account as I have run into this editor before as he left a rather odd message on my Talk page. I don't remember running into him before that point, so I'm not sure how he ended up on my Talk page. Anyways, let's AGF since he did blank the article and see how he behaves after the article has been deleted. -- <a href="../../../g/o/g/User%7EGogo_Dodo_6e56.html" title="User:Gogo Dodo">Gogo Dodo</a> 08:59, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
