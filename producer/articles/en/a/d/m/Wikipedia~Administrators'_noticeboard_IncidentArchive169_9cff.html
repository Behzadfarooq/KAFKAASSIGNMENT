<p>As a new admin, I'ld appreciate guidance on policy implementation regarding 2 users who have been revert warring (12 edits between them in a few hours, with 9 reversions). Each has repeatedly reverted the other's changes, but no single change more than 2 times (but 3RR does not entitle people to revert to this limit, just that 3RR is so heinous as to automatically warrant blocking), clearly though both editors should pull away from editing article space and instead have discussed civilly on the talk page, rather than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABreast_implant&amp;diff=97434659&amp;oldid=97362135" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABreast_implant&amp;diff=97434659&amp;oldid=97362135" rel="nofollow">this acrimonious exchange</a>. The article in question is <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breast_implant.html" title="Breast implant">Breast implant</a>, and the 2 users are Jance and <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurtis_Bledsoe_7efd.html" title="User:Curtis Bledsoe">Curtis Bledsoe</a>.</p>
<p>Jance has had previous blocks for edit warring on this article under her previous username of User: jgwlaw (deleted at her request when she previously "left" wikipedia) and has been subject of a <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Jance_978e.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Jance">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Jance</a>. Curtis Bledsoe has had comments made by a couple of editors on his talk page, advising of disruptive process (repeat reverting, failing to engage on talk page discussion and possible 3RR).</p>

<dd>David, this has been months ago. Droliver was also blocked for edit warring. Are you going to bring him here? He has also done edit warring recently, with that article. IS he going to be sanctioned? I t hink your bringing this here now is malicious. Yes, you most certainy are involved. I have begged you or someone to warn Droliver to stop with his insults towards DrZuckerman (who is a Yale-trained epidemiologist, since Drolvier seems to gain credibility by his profession), but David has done nothing. Jance 18:00, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I suspect this is all now proving sufficiently disruptive to warrant action, but how best to proceed? Merely give each a warning that further action will result in a block (but both have either prior blocks or warnings on this)&#160;? If I block now, presumably Jance's block should be even-handily just a single day to match new-user Curtis Bledsoe's first block&#160;?</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Why don't you also bring Droliver here, since he has been consistently guilty of edit warring? Why don't you get anyone else who has been in the past a part of edit warring? It seems to be that you are now coming in after the fact, to punish. That is amazing.Jance 18:00, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>WHOSE BIAS?? If you look at <a href="../../../n/c/a/NCAHF_c50a.html" title="NCAHF">NCAHF</a> you will see that Curtis is still reverting with impunity. Also, if you look at his 'edits' above, you will see that they are in fact reversions. Also, the last person to revert was Droliver. He has continuously reverted, and been warned to "apologize" by David (which Oliver of course ignored). I am not going to revert, but I would like someone to do something on [[]NCAHF]]. WIll Curtis be able to continue with his abusiveness? Or is he just succeeding in driving everyone off, since nobody will stop him? Jance 20:37, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have been one user in the past -- over 6 months ago. The block was on one article, on which two editors were blocked temporarily (Droliver and I). It seems that David wanted to resurrect old complaints, and is selective in doing so, since Droliver has edit warred as much as I have on this article. Jance 18:00, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Whoa, I didn't notice that previous user thing.

<dl>
<dd>Everyone had full knowledge of the rules. Please take a look at what Curtis did after his edits were tagged with Copyright. I might add also that David's friend Droliver has also edit-warred frequently and recently, so if we are going to start blocking people who have recently edit warred and ever had a block in the past, Droliver should be here too. Jance 18:00, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A guy with sudden interest, intruding on Jance's obvious interest in BI with such heavy, high velocity edits seems likely as a strategic form of wikistalking to me. A number of editors are not happy with Curtis' edits, also including my usual opponents (we now have something, -one, to agree about). see NCAHF article &amp; talk for starters, complaints are also scattered elsewhere. I would be so bold as to suggest that in some other areas Curtis' aggressiveness may cause <a href="../../../e/x/p/Wikipedia%7EExpert_retention_3051.html" title="Wikipedia:Expert retention">Wikipedia:Expert retention</a> problems<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Arthur_Rubin&amp;diff=97476604&amp;oldid=97476538" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Arthur_Rubin&amp;diff=97476604&amp;oldid=97476538" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> i.e. useful legal reviews for WP articles' complex issues.--<a href="../../../i/27/c/User%7EI%27clast_cb31.html" title="User:I'clast">I'clast</a> 14:26, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It was wiki-stalking, and in fact someone else already pointed that out. And it appears that David is trying to use this as an opportunity to block me. I have repeatedly complained about Droliver's edit warring and sarcastic comments - David, only once, told Drolvier that he should apologize for his reversion. Of course, Oliver never did. By David's logic, Droliver should have been blocked, and still should be. I urge anyone that questions the events to look at <a href="../../../n/c/a/NCAHF_c50a.html" title="NCAHF">NCAHF</a>. It's pretty clear what happened. And David has gone out of his way to escallate the problem, after any "edit warring" was stopped and after Curtis' complaint was closed. I was invited to lodge a complaint against Curtis, but declined to because I thought it would look retaliatory. It appears, however, that retaliation is a Wiki tradition, evidently used by admins as well as the community at large.. Something is indeed wrong here.Jance 18:00, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>re Jance &amp; DrOliver edit warring, that previously resulted in a temporary protection to the <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breast_implant.html" title="Breast implant">Breast implant</a> page by Samir. Since then I thought discussion had been more civil; with DrZuckerman somewhat acting as a discussion facilitator and other editors also contributing and Samir keeping a light-touch overview. Advice on the way to proceed on that article has been repeatedly given by a number of editors and admins (raise one point at a time for civil AGF discussion, obtain straw-poll helping to clarify consensus and then implement. Editors failing to follow consensus should have this politely point this out on talk page and if still act disruptive to the collaborative process then to follow normal dispute resolution - RfC, mediation or more formal AN/I, but further personal engagement in edit/revert warring is not the way to proceed).</dd>
<dd>J's posting above breaches AGF (<i>"David has gone out of his way to escallate the problem"</i>) - the raising of this incident report was based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABreast_implant&amp;diff=97434659&amp;oldid=97434038" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABreast_implant&amp;diff=97434659&amp;oldid=97434038" rel="nofollow">J's request on the article talk page for an Admin to look at CB's involvement</a> - that involvement was with edit warring with J on the latest day of the edit history.</dd>
<dd>I would agree, looking further back that DrO and you have been having a lower-level tussle in the last couple of days at least. AN/I is not really about content dispute resolution but rather about stopping edit warring, dealing with disruptive behaviour. Having been previously involved, I sought advice/opinions from other admins and the outcome has been that discussion has ensued with CB and also some advice on descaling disputed with J (along with support over a difficult period on a couple of articles), and another admin has protected the page again as "The article seems to have descended back into edit warring". This should now force all editors to again return to talk page discussion. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 02:55, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you. I am glad this is over, and you saw what happened. It did seem very odd that you would open a new An/I immediately after one closed. This An/I seemed to solely be directed at me; hence, my conclusion. It is possible I was mistaken. I have always AGF with you, but this was baffling. That was why I expressed my opinion, as to what appeared to have occurred here. I might note that the last reversion on the Breast Implant article was by Droliver, not by me. In fact, I had made no reversions on any article after the 'warning'. Curtis, on the other hand, has. Droliver has, as well, after being told by you to apologize for a reversion. Regardless, I am glad that this is now over. And I am glad that you think DrZuckerman is facilitating discussion. However, it has not stopped Droliver from reverting her edits.Jance 21:01, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For a month there have been complaints on <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28miscellaneous%29_ea61.html" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (miscellaneous)">Wikipedia:Village pump (miscellaneous)</a> about the Chinese Wikipedia, claiming that it is mainly government propaganda, with at least one of the complainants having been banned from that wiki. This complaining has, in my view, reached the point of disruption, with me just extending the block on <a href="../../../s/u/m/User%7ESummerThunder_438d.html" title="User:SummerThunder">User:SummerThunder</a> to indefinite for block evasion. The block was for personal attacks, and he was evading the block in order to repeatedly post and repost rantings across all Village Pumps. My extension on the account was the fourth today. (Note that indefinite is not necessarily infinite, if he promises to stop evading then I will unblock him, and if I don't then all admins have my blessing to do so instead.)</p>
<p>I suggest that as this discussion/argument/ranting is a waste of all sides' time, as we have no jurisdiction over the Chinese Wikipedia, we should close those discussions and revert futher posts. I have posted about this on <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia_talk%7EVillage_pump_%28miscellaneous%29_a41a.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Village pump (miscellaneous)">Wikipedia talk:Village pump (miscellaneous)</a>, but as I don't know how much attention that page gets, I'm posting here for more pairs of eyes.</p>

<p>If anyone wants to dispute my block of SummerThunder, I guess we can do that here - but I don't think it should be particularly controversial. The indefinite block is <i>not</i> meant to be a community ban, only a temporary measure until he stops evading his block. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 00:01, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Frankly I wouldn't object if this <i>were</i> a community ban. This editor has been on the fast track with prolific disruption and rejection of feedback. I think we can accept the bans at two other Wikimedia projects as precedents: this person does not come to Wikipedia.en with the clean slate that <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> normally accords new users. While I don't think this person is deliberately trolling, they're like a bull in a china shop all over a group of articles and Village Pump. It should not take twenty reminders, or fifty, to convey the principle that Wikipedia.en is not a grievance venue for Meta or Wikipedia.zh. Nor is it tolerable to spam procedural queries at the Pump after the edior has been given repeated referrals to <a href="../../../a/d/o/WP%7EADOPT_c4e7.html" title="WP:ADOPT">WP:ADOPT</a>. This crowds out legitimate threads and sets a bad example.

<li>I agree that Tresman is a problem. I note, though, that he does seem to be leaving the articles alone and sticking to Talk. However, his behaviour on Talk could best be described as "obdurate". See <a href="../../../w/o/l/Talk%7EWolf_effect_eec7.html" title="Talk:Wolf effect">Talk:Wolf effect</a> for a good example - he repeatedly asserts that ScienceApologist will not compromise but despite many offers he has yet to offer a compromise proposal for SA to accept or reject. He also refuses to acknowledge that the text he wishes to insert, is in support of the agenda which we know he is following. SA is capitalising on Tresman's article restrictions to move the articles to a much more sceptical stance - this would be much more of a problem if it weren't for the fact that these are in the main fringe theories. I lack the specialist knowledge to contribute in more detail, other than matters of interpretation (such as resisting a link to a propaganda film made by the plasma cosmology camp). <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 09:50, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Bucketsofg's analysis of the situation is correct. As Guy says, Iantresman is not editing heavily in the articles, though I do see a couple of reverts on the 30th. An article ban is probably not justified right now. More concern to me is Iantresman's use of dispute resolution to harass ScienceApologist. This seems to me disruptive enough in its own right to justify a block, or maybe even a temporary ban under a broad reading of the arbitrarion remedy. I don't see recent on-going incivility from ScienceApologist that would make a caution necessary. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 12:30, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I had meant to include talk pages in the ban and have added it since Tom &amp; Guy's comments. Although much more latitude is given to users on talk pages, Ian's behaviour is becoming disruptive enough that something has to be done. <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBucketsofg_06fb.html" title="User:Bucketsofg"><font color="#DF0001"><b>Buck</b></font><b><font color="green">ets</font></b><font color="grey"><b>ofg</b></font></a> 15:20, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>As I said on the fourth report, such nursed slights as Lantresman seems to have are divisive, create a negative environment on the encyclopedia, and poison the well - many editors aren't going to want to touch an article where this kind of negative environment exists, for fear of becoming entangled in this whole dispute. They seem to have an emotional attachment to the article, and are unable to disengage, as I feel they should. To be blunt, at this point it just looks like an axe to grind with a side order of gaming the system.

</ul>
<p>OK. My final inclination is (1) a one-day block for disruption and (2) a three-week ban from the pages mentioned above and their talk pages. The ban is shortened slightly in light of the comments of Tom and Guy. It seems to me, however, that it is the ArbComm remedy that must be our guide: it says he can be "banned from any article or subject area which he disrupts by aggressive biased editing". The disruption is mentioned by several and is clear; there is clear aggressiveness in the "gaming" that Peter mentions; bias is obvious. The remedy calls for bans from articles, which will have the added advantage of removing, hopefully, some of the divisiveness on the affected pages. I am going to wait a few hours before imposing this. If an admin suggests a change, can I ask that you propose a very specific one either on the remedy and/or its length. <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBucketsofg_06fb.html" title="User:Bucketsofg"><font color="#DF0001"><b>Buck</b></font><b><font color="green">ets</font></b><font color="grey"><b>ofg</b></font></a> 20:46, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oof... It looks like his range is 75.0.0.0 to 75.31.255.255, which would be a huge block (2,097,152 IPs). Range blocks are limited to at most /16 so we'd have to go through and block 75.0.0.0/16 — 75.31.0.0/16. I don't have enough experience either physically doing range blocks or with the policy implications involved so I'll leave it to another but it may be a much better alternative to simply sprotect the pages he's causing the most damage on. —<a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell"><b><font color="#333333">bbatsell</font></b></a> <a href="../../../b/b/a/User_talk%7EBbatsell_7978.html" title="User talk:Bbatsell"><font color="#C46100" size="1">¿?</font></a> 01:08, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not an admin, but as a worthless non-admin I guess I'm allowed to give you feedback.&#160;:) If he went through all 4 spam warnings without responding and continued to readd spam links, then a 24-hour block is probably for the better to prevent anymore being added. The only thing, maybe, wrong here is that you said that he requested an unblock, and you declined it. Generally, the blocking admin isn't supposed to review the unblock himself and wait for another admin to review the unblock and decide. Besides that, I think it was fair. Personally though, I'm shocked he didn't recieve an indefinite block being a <i>new</i> user and adding nothing but spam links. I would have, but thats just me. <i>semper fi</i> — <a href="../../../m/o/e/User_talk%7EMoe_Epsilon_62b6.html" title="User talk:Moe Epsilon"><font color="#000000">Moe</font></a> 01:52, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You might want to be more explicit when discussing things ArbCom related... I got a nasty start upon reading the words "<i>the ban that I have imposed</i>" without knowing the backstory: Danger, Rouge Admin! Danger Danger! /* insert flailing tube arms */ That aside, is it <i>really</i> necessary to stop someone from using the talk page? At Wolf Effect I see "obdurate" but it's hardly disruptive <i>per se</i>. I'd like to see stronger support for this before wheeeling it out. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="black">brenneman</font></a> 01:06, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The thing is, if there is an article ban (supported by the ruling) then what extra does the talk ban accomplish? It creates an obvious place for complaints to very little end. At best, other editors and he have reasonable discourse on the talk, middle-case his talk page contributions simply are ignored after time, worst case it mounts to incivility or <i>clear</i> disruption and it gets dealt with then. No, I think that a talk-page ban founded upon an arbcom ruling that doesn't mention them is a bad idea. But I'll shut up about it now and hear what everyone else thinks. <small>Maybe.</small><br />

<dd>No, don't be quiet, I'm glad for your input. As I said, I'm not against pulling back from the talk-page ban. But I spent 18 hours yesterday reading diffs, ArbComms, RFCs. There is no realistic hope of reasonable discourse. But I'm happy to have your opinion and I look forward to others' advice. <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBucketsofg_06fb.html" title="User:Bucketsofg"><font color="#DF0001"><b>Buck</b></font><b><font color="green">ets</font></b><font color="grey"><b>ofg</b></font></a> 01:29, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I've looked in on this dispute every so often, without becoming involved, and Ian certainly strikes me as a continuing disruptive influence. It's very difficult to edit an article productively when there's someone camping out on the talk page, relentlessly drumming on the same point - to say nothing of the continual nonproductive wikilawyering. It doesn't make much sense to let this ongoing disruption continue 'until someone becomes uncivil'. I support bucketsofg's solution, including the talk page ban. <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 07:08, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I just read through that, and it is not clear at all that this was a legal threat. A legal threat is something like "I'm going to sue you." or "I'm asking the cops to arrest you." but saying that "My lawyer friend thinks this will be very interesting to the court." is a passive observation of consequences, not an affirmative statement that you are planning to ake any action.

<dd>Agreed.

<p>I don't recall asking if it was a legal threat. I seem to recall asking what specific part of the policy on blocking or legal threats calls for banning a longterm contributor in good standing indefinitely. I understand that a block for a legal threat CAN be placed without warning, although NPA6 exists just for that. But I am concerned at the definition of "serious legal threat", which is unnecessarily vague. Is this basis enough for an indef block on a longterm contributor in a conflict with a SPA? --<font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a4a9.html" title="User:Elaragirl"><font color="SteelBlue">Elar</font></a><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a_7dff.html" title="User:Elaragirl/a"><font color="orange"><b>a</b></font></a><font color="SteelBlue">girl</font><small><sup><a href="../../../e/l/a/User_talk%7EElaragirl_228e.html" title="User talk:Elaragirl">Talk</a>|Count</sup></small></font> 21:53, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>See this from <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBLOCK_89b0.html" title="WP:BLOCK">WP:BLOCK</a>: "Users who make threats, whether legal, personal, or professional, that in any way are seen as an attempt to intimidate another user may be blocked without warning. If a warning is desirable, the {{<a href="../../../n/p/a/Template%7ENpa6_2f01.html" title="Template:Npa6">npa6</a>}} template can be used. Users that make severe threats can be blocked indefinitely.

<dd><b>No, it's not clear in the policies.</b> "Serious" legal threats? In this particular context, there isn't a "serious legal threat". There is an assertional stance that a lawyer outside the bounds of an actual court or any precedent of law found something interesting. If indef blocking is the de facto standard, then it needs to be clearly spelled out. As it stands, WP:Legal gives no clear idea of what a legal threat actually <i>is</i>, a point I find astonishing. A legal threat is a warning or statement that if you do or don't do this, person will conduct legal action. If we're using the <a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?LegalThreat" class="extiw" title="meatball:LegalThreat">MeatBall:LegalThreat</a> definition, that should be said...but the policy states that users may be blocked, not are always blocked, and that only severe threats warrant indef bans.

<p>It's not clear to me that Skookum1 made a legal threat. He threatened to report a person's behaviour to an organization that the person belongs to. In this case, the organization happens to be the <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_Society_of_Upper_Canada_0d7f.html" title="Law Society of Upper Canada">Law Society of Upper Canada</a>.

<dd>If this is the de facto policy, the written policies need to be clarified. <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">No personal attacks</a> says that "Extreme attacks, in particular legal threats and death threats, can be dealt with by blocking the offending user without warning." I don't see Skookum1's comment as falling into the category of an extreme attack. As some readers of Skookum1's statement think it contained a threat and others don't, it may be best to treat the situation as a misunderstanding. If Skookum1 can promise that he won't be reporting anyone's on-wiki activities to an off-wiki authority, I'd consider the problem solved. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClayoquot_bbe3.html" title="User:Clayoquot">Kla'quot</a> 19:23, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You indefinitely blocked an editor of more than 12.000 edits for this:"I've discussed this with a laywer friend who's been following the Ledgegate affair, and <i>he</i> thinks that your behaviour here on Wikipedia is going to be of interest to the Law Society of Upper Canada. Hiding information about yourself, etc..."?!!! No! When such decisions are taken, the contribution of the A or Z editor should be taken into serious consideration. After all, in this case, the legal threat is indirect (and not blatant as another user said!). This is not important?! I think some admins should be must more careful, when they use measures like "indefinite blocks", especially for users with very important contributions to the project. A warning? A temporary time-limited block? But indefinite block?!! No!!! Yes, the block was retracted, but an unfortunate decision was initially taken, and I need to express my regret for that.--<a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannismarou_16f4.html" title="User:Yannismarou">Yannismarou</a> 13:31, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

The spammer seems to have learned from this experience and is now using multiple aliases, with low frequency spamming to keep a low profile. I stopped cleaning up to see if a pattern would emerge, but nothing did. There are now at least three different alias URLs involved, and to be sure all are covered I will mention them here. Sapeso dot com. old-games dot com. sanpsw dot com. Unfortunately, all the signs are that the spammer will switch to new aliases once blocked. One useful analysis if it is possible would be to check Wikipedia for partial URLs (since there are often repeated things like pc/sports/games in URLs). I only know how to look for URLs with the site name included. <a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENotinasnaid_e8da.html" title="User:Notinasnaid">Notinasnaid</a> 12:32, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Note that Friday and I are involved in removing the question as well as the users Rick named.

<dd>I'd just like to note that, personally, I wouldn't take any action on this at all at this time. We're hashing out through the wiki process, and had a bit of a flare-up is all—it's something that happens on pages (even policy!) from time to time, and as far as I can see nobody violated <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">the three-revert rule</a>. I don't see how administrative intervention will particularly improve the situation at the moment, although any suggestions anyone has on the ref desk talk page about how to handle things better in the future might very well be useful. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 05:23, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There was no "targeted offence". You clearly don't understand the meaning of the phrase. An <a href="../../../i/d/i/Idiom.html" title="Idiom">idiom</a>'s "meaning cannot be deduced from the literal definitions and the arrangement of its parts, but refers instead to a figurative meaning that is known only through conventional use." You are inferring a literal meaning, not the figurative meaning. Therefore it implies nothing other than that you were behaving in an "annoying way" (something, as TenOfAllTrades notes, appears to be perfectly accurate). Have you considered perhaps instead of obtusely questioning every perceived criticism, instead of deconstructing the minutiae of every argument in an attempt to avoid accepting the glaringly obvious point, actually thinking about why so many experienced Wikipedians express the same concerns about your behaviour? <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_a_dick" class="extiw" title="meta:Don't_be_a_dick">Please, just think about it.</a> <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockpocket_2e94.html" title="User:Rockpocket"><font color="green">Rockpock</font></a><font color="black">e</font><a href="../../../r/o/c/User_talk%7ERockpocket_62af.html" title="User talk:Rockpocket"><font color="green">t</font></a> 05:19, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

As an aside, my opinion as a occasional RD contributor, is that the biggest problem facing the subproject is the self appointed "RD regulars" that spend their Wikitime there almost exclusively. RD works when editors with a level of specialist knowledge contribute to questions that they have knowledge of. It doesn't work when the certain individuals feel the need to answer every question asked, then when there is nothing current being asked, to ask their own irreverent questions, then - when they are bored of that - by arguing over unneeded policy. If it was simply used for the purpose it was designed, instead of treated like a social forum, it could get back to relative normalcy. How we would enforce that, I have no idea, however.

<p>I would suggest sorting out a <b>procedure for removing contentious questions</b> (or even contentious answers) that you can agree on. A good starting point would be that reverting the removal of a question is NOT the right thing to do (that way lies edit warring). Reverting a removal <b>must</b> be discussed first. The reference desk won't collapse if a removed question is not replaced straightaway, and it won't collapse if one poster of a question finds that the question has been removed (if the poster is an established user, make it a requirement to post a note to the user's talk page inviting them to participate in the debate). Then follow a procedure to decide whether the question should be put back, and in what form (maybe modifying the question would help). At the end of the procedure, restore the question/answer or leave it removed. I'll copy this to the ref desk talk page to see if they can agree on using a system like this. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 02:19, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Almost right, the start of an edit war is the first unilateral (non-consensus) deletion. The proper procedure is to discuss it first with the author, and then, if the author refuses to remove it and further action is warranted, bring it up at the Ref Desk talk page. If a consensus to delete is reached there, then the post can be removed. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 03:27, 30 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Or we could just, you know, remove the clearly inappropriate questions without having to go through all of that rigmarole, thus saving everyone's time. Admins are already trusted to use their judgment and delete articles; clearing questions off the reference desk is <i>nothing</i>, and is well within our capability to handle without so much unnecessary process. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 18:36, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Which is exactly what admins have done in the past, and most would continue to do, irrespective of the "proper process" that is now being mooted. The problem lies with when <i>certain</i> editors object to <i>certain</i> other editors removing <i>certain</i> questions. In other words, I believe the crux of the problem is with personality clashes, not with the general issue of removing inappropriate content. <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockpocket_2e94.html" title="User:Rockpocket"><font color="green">Rockpock</font></a><font color="black">e</font><a href="../../../r/o/c/User_talk%7ERockpocket_62af.html" title="User talk:Rockpocket"><font color="green">t</font></a> 21:07, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Rockpocket has summed it up admirably. To repond to StuRat, I would say that if someone removes a question you think should stay, <i>do not unilaterally revert their removal of the question</i>. Raise the issue on the talk page. That way you would be following your own logic. As soon as you revert their removal, you are descending to the level you profess to be avoiding. If you see a question you don't like, raise it on the talk page. And anyone can use common sense and blank/remove questions, not just admins. Have a look at <a href="../../../1/r/r/WP%7E1RR_8afd.html" title="WP:1RR">WP:1RR</a> to see what I mean. The philosophy is that absolutely anyone can remove something, but no-one should restore anything without discussion. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 01:30, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, the restore of a unilateral deletion is not unilateral, because you have both the person who does the restore and the original poster being of the opinion that the material should remain, against the single opinion of the person who first deleted the question. To break it down:</dd>

<dd>So you are saying that <i>edit warring</i> is the way to seek consensus, rather than discussion? Edit warring <i>ad infinitum</i> leads to a theoretical end result of 50% in favour of deletion and 50% in favour of restoration. Absolutely pointless. Discuss, do not edit war. If there is disagreement, remove the content, discuss on the talk page and reach agreement, and then implement the result of that agreement. Work with your fellow editors to achieve something of benefit to the readers.

<dd>I'm saying just the opposite, that no change should be made unless there are at least more people in favor of the change than opposed to it.

<dd>But that is not how Wikipedia works. If something inappropriate is added to a talk page, even though you have signed it, <i>anyone</i> can remove it and then discuss it with you. You can then, after discussion, restore it, but you <b>cannot</b> try and put in place 'rules' to prevent such removals in the first place. That stifles the whole "anyone can edit" principle. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 03:08, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not at all. If someone removes something, discuss it with them. If you want to remove something, do so and discuss it with them. If they restore it, discuss it with them. Do you see the pattern here? Starting a discussion is what ends an edit war. Whether you can reach agreement is another matter of course, but that requires skill, empathy and being able to compromise.

<dd>No thanks, my talk page is already huge. I'm all for discussion, but it's fundamentally unfair to say "I can remove anything without discussion, but you need to discuss it before putting it back".

<p>I just scanned through this discussion, and perhaps this was mentioned, but I didn't see it. How about this for dealing with a 'touchy' question: Anyone who feels uncomfortable about it being posted at ref desk could move it to the user page of the person asking the question -- and answer or explain why it is inappropriate. This would accomplish several things at once:</p>
<ol>
<li>It would move the question from a public arena to a more private one.</li>
<li>The discussion could continue on the user's talk page.</li>
<li>Anyone checking the history would see that it was moved and know where to find it.</li>
<li>It would document behavior that might be inappropriate on the user's talk page.</li>

<dd>That is very similar to what I suggested, but some editors (at the Ref Desk) think that <i>everything and anything</i> <b>must</b> be discussed before removal. They are, for some reason, rejecting the logical "remove and discuss" option in favour of the risky "leave and discuss" option. It is risky because, while discussion is taking place, the question and answer cycle may be spiralling out of control as people commonly: (a) give medical advice; (b) make lewd jokes; (c) respond to trolling comments. For an example in progess at the moment, see <a href="../../../r/e/f/Wikipedia%7EReference_desk_Science_39ae.html#Atlantis" title="Wikipedia:Reference desk/Science">Wikipedia:Reference_desk/Science#Atlantis</a>, where someone has, for some reason, started a visible vote on the actual Reference Desk page on whether to keep (or maybe whether to answer) the question. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 03:08, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I realise he's sincerely upset, and this is certain to be controversial, but when someone with admin powers states directly they're going to disrupt the wiki to "go out with a bang" and "I'm through here anyway, but lets have some fun", it's a block for the protection of the wiki.

<dd>Yeah, doesn't matter if you're right. What was the context? What is a "bang?" Given that he's just a regular editor, and given that he had already <i>done</i> the bang (posting a log, which would <i>get him banned from IRC</i>), he was speaking of his current action, not future actions. It's not a hard job reading his statements. Also, posting the logs is a violation of Freenode's rules, not ours. The bit about logging and posting logs is not on Wikipedia: it's on IRC. Therefore, Giano was disrupting Freenode and saying that he might as well provoke a storm with his present act. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:16, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>He was saying that he had more logs, and people could contact him for more. It appears that Jdforrester <i>is</i> the owner of the channel, sort of, which makes his authorship and endorsing of the "Giano on civility parole" even more clearly a case for recusal. I also don't think it's disrupting Wikipedia. It's disrupting IRC usage and annoying its users and continuing this conversation, but what <i>really</i> has this conversation going is more blocking of Giano. What do you folks think would have happened if you had ignored him? What would have happened if you had said, "Dude, that's not helping. Let's talk it through?" What would have happened if people had approached him with discussion rather than templates, blocks, templates, blocks, patronizing, templates, blocks, and paroles? A guy is here for 3 years. In that time, his behavior isn't substantially different from year to year, but suddenly he must be blocked. What happened with that "suddenly" is up to each to determine. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:54, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Ironically, David's suggestion of blocking <i>all</i> involved parties for a month is one of the more even-handed answers to this problem that I've seen. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 00:11, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hey, I suggested banning (not blocking) everyone involved first!&#160;:-) A full 16 hours before David's suggestion. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97231383" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97231383" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I only suggested two weeks, not a full month, but I did suggest a way to do this. A community ban on the basis that those involved are beginning to try the patience of the community. This would only succeed if the community could (a) agree on who is on this list of "those involved" and (b) no admins would unblock. That last one could be avoided if you implement this as a non-blocking ban. ie. lots of people sign up to a plea for certain people to not edit for two weeks and go on an enforced wikibreak. You could even water it down to a proposal similar to that of Doc Glasgow - just plead with those involved to stay away from each other for the next two weeks. To not post on each other's talk pages, to not run around geting upset, and so on. To just get on with being the productive members of the community we know they can be. If enough people sign up to something like that, it might get through to those involved. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 01:58, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Or, it might backfire horribly. Not be a pessimist, but in this case, I lean toward caution over what may well end up being a populist, quick fix solution that fails to achieve appreciable and long lasting resolution, and could even result in further escalation (it certainly has a dramatic flare). But by all means, anyone is free propose any remedy they see fit. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 02:31, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Carcharoth, what makes you think we would be able to come up with a definiton of "involved"? Have <i>you</i> an idea in the back of your mind as to who the "involved" parties are? Am I involved, for example? If so, I object for obvious reasons – I have (as far as I am aware) done nothing wrong, and certainly nothing that would warrant a two-week block. Even if not, I can't see even two people agreeing on the same list of "involved" parties, much less everyone – <a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurch_e84c.html" title="User:Gurch">Gurch</a> 22:41, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

Just trying to come up with something that would shake sense into those involved in this. Would more discussion really help? I don't know. Maybe we should all abandon our accounts and start editing with new ones. That would certainly achieve something. I'll call this 'nuclear' option the <b>community reset button</b>.

<li>It was an idea from left-field, and I wasn't really serious. There is the serious point though that people shouldn't get too attached to their reputations built up from past actions. Judging people on their <i>current</i> actions is the ideal. When there is too much history, but someone can still be a productive and useful contributor, sometimes it is best just to change accounts. There is a history of this. I've seen arbitrators offer to let someone edit under a new account known only to the arbitrators for a few months, allowing the arbitrators to monitor them but to avoid others baiting them. This doesn't work so well when someone has a well-defined editing area and circle of wiki-friends, but is workable in some cases. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 11:59, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi, I think we need some admin intervention on the <a href="../../../m/e/m/MEMRI_1fae.html" title="MEMRI">MEMRI</a> article. At the moment a mediation on the <a href="../../../j/u/a/Juan_Cole_474e.html" title="Juan Cole">Juan Cole</a> page is stalled and it looks like <a href="../../../m/e/m/MEMRI_1fae.html" title="MEMRI">MEMRI</a> has become the place to continue a proxy war regarding using Cole's blog as a source. It has descended quickly into personal attacks and edit warring (not quite crossing 3RR I think but certainly heading that way) and disruptive editing. I think we need some order to be established, and some experienced outside views regarding <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmon_3172.html" title="User:Armon">&lt;&lt;-armon-&gt;&gt;</a> 15:19, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

This does not belong on ANI -- this is a proper use of RfC. I believe this user has done this in the past, trying to circumvent content disputes by reporting them as if they were conduct violations of WP rules. WP:ANI reports require only convincing one admin to take action, whereas an RfC (whether over substance or conduct) requires consensus. I would love to see more participation on the MEMRI page, which indeed has become a focus of edit wars (though I have not seen too many personal attacks there), but it is not a "proxy war" about Cole -- the fact is that Cole said something relevant about MEMRI and there is a dispute over whether it should be included on the MEMRI page. As Armon is aware, there is other content in dispute on that page besides the material from Cole. So as I said I welcome more participation on that page, but I object to it being solicited via WP:ANI as if there were user conduct issues at stake here. <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 19:18, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

The IP's contributions are Soviet-related topics, which are what Jacob Peters usually edits, and take a clear pro-Soviet anti-Western POV lining up with Jacob Peters's: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Soviet_war_in_Afghanistan&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97418942" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Soviet_war_in_Afghanistan&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97418942" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Soviet_war_in_Afghanistan&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=97418979" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Soviet_war_in_Afghanistan&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=97418979" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Joseph_Stalin&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97424491" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Joseph_Stalin&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97424491" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Commonwealth_of_Independent_States&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97428331" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Commonwealth_of_Independent_States&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97428331" rel="nofollow">[33]</a>.

I feel merely resetting the block for the umpteenth time is not working out. I suggest we also extend the block, from four weeks to five (or thirty-three days maybe?). Granted, this may do nothing to stop him from the block evasion, but perhaps he'll realize that in the long run, it's not to his benefit. I'm a bit weary of suggesting an indefinite block, because that will give him no incentive to stop evading the block (and frankly, due to his serial block evasion, I can't picture a time when the current block will be allowed to expire). -- <b><a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETariqabjotu_f37f.html" title="User:Tariqabjotu"><font color="black">tariq</font><font color="gray">abjotu</font></a></b> 03:16, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello, as this is my first time reporting on AN/I personally, please give me a kick if this is an inappropriate venue.</p>
<p>There has been an ongoing dispute regarding the article <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barrett_v._Rosenthal_4883.html" title="Barrett v. Rosenthal">Barrett v. Rosenthal</a>. This has been posted before, in an indirect matter, as <a href="../../../i/l/e/User%7EIlena_9a07.html" title="User:Ilena">Ilena</a>'s spamming was noticed and reported. Now though, she has shaped up to a degree, and is showing some progress. However, those that disagree with her seem to need prodding in a similar direction regarding links, as recently, <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFyslee_abcc.html" title="User:Fyslee">fyslee</a> put a link on the talk page that was purely an attack on the character of <a href="../../../i/l/e/User%7EIlena_9a07.html" title="User:Ilena">Ilena</a>. I find this extremely frustrating, as it was counterproductive, and now Ilena is, understandably, in "defense" mode again, and extremely frustrated.</p>
<p>There are a few issues here, and I'll present them in the order I perceived them.</p>

This brought forth an AN/I report. After some dialogue, I came to the conclusion that she added them out of good faith and an honest misunderstanding of the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">COI</a> policies.

If he continues he will be blocked by a sysop, but until then just try to avoid breaking any rules yourself - seek to be better than him, not worse.</i></li>

<p>Unfortunately, it has fallen on deaf ears, however. The sad fact of the matter is that <a href="../../../i/l/e/User%7EIlena_9a07.html" title="User:Ilena">Ilena</a> has tried to follow my advice, and shape up - trying to avoid <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a> by only contributing to the talk pages, and refraining from further attacks and linkspam, but the other parties in the matter, <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFyslee_abcc.html" title="User:Fyslee">fyslee</a> namely, have refused to return the favour.</p>
<p>As the situation seems to continue to escalate and my own attempts at diffusion seem to have been unsuccessful. I welcome examination of the behaviours of everyone involved in the matter, myself included, and I would like to see, if possible, administrator intervention regarding the attack links posted against <a href="../../../i/l/e/User%7EIlena_9a07.html" title="User:Ilena">Ilena</a>.</p>

<li>looking through this, I think this is the wrong venue.

<dd>Fyslee is not being attacked. He apparently feels that explaining his chosen relationship to Stephen Barrett is attacking him, but it is merely descriptive. This is what I wrote after he posted a ridiculous unsigned piece being circulated by the plaintiffs on their Healthfraud list which misrepresented the facts of the case. I disagree that my links are anymore "vanity links" than quackwatch.com or the probably illegal operation of ncahf.org and any of millions of webpages linked to Wikipedia. I have been under attack by these losing plaintiffs for 6 years, and since the final Supreme Court of California ruling against them, their actions are een more egregious. The entire webring that Fyslee operates is filled with Barrett's attacks on scientists and physicians that they hate and try to destroy. Mr. Lee is profoundly inaccurate as to who I am and why I have devoted 11 years of my life to raising awareness to the dangers of breast implants and the dangers of the PR teams paid by the breast implant, chemical and pharmaceutical industries. Fyslee may call it a 'smear' to be linked to Stephen Barrett, but it is a fact. For several years, he was the Assistant Listmaster for the Healthfraud List and his webring links all of Barrett's questionable sites together which promote each other. He was also a member of the now removed "Rag-tag Posse of Snake-oil Vigilantes" <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050205050827/http://www.ratbags.com/posse/whoarewe.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20050205050827/http://www.ratbags.com/posse/whoarewe.htm" rel="nofollow">[41]</a> which provided Smear Campaigns via blogs and usenet of people Barrett and the other losing plaintiffs were suing. Mr. Lee and Barrett were on that list together for 6 years (up until last week.) Mr. Lee removed every link I have made on Wikipedia, filled my talk pages with the same nonsense he wrote above, and it feels exactly like stalking. He even interfered in my personal talk page. 21:30, 2 January 2007 (UTC) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../i/l/e/User%7EIlena_9a07.html" title="User:Ilena">Ilena</a> (<a href="../../../i/l/e/User_talk%7EIlena_10cb.html" title="User talk:Ilena">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ilena_da18.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ilena">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<dd>There is dispute as to the facts, and I believe that you <i>are</i> attacking <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFyslee_abcc.html" title="User:Fyslee">User:Fyslee</a> by wikipedia standards. His explanation on your talk page (which you've since deleted) is consistent with the facts you observe, and <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> suggests we should take him at his word. Furthermore, your links are "vanity links" because <i>you</i> inserted them; they are not "vanity links" per se. (They may be removable as attack links, though. I wasn't studying <i>that</i> interaction, so I don't know whether they qualify as "attack pages" by Wikipedia standars.) Finally, being "Assistant Listmaster" for one of Barrett's lists, or even taking the list over from Barrett, would mean at most that he agrees with the moderation of <i>that</i> list. As for your "personal" talk page; it's not <b>yours</b>. There are restrictions to what you can put on it, and restrictions to what others can put on it....</dd>
<dd>Although I agree with very little of what I'm aware of of what you've done <i>outside of Wikipedia</i>, I'm willing to give you the benefit of the doubt that you can become a constructive Wikipedian. — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 22:03, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Arthur, my personal frustration with the issue is I have been working with Ilena, to help her contribute positively, yet the other parties to this matter have continued to post attack links defaming her character. Her reactions to it have been with regrettable aggression and paranioa, but it is understandable - if I had such a site posted on myself, I wouldn't be happy about it either. On further examination it looks like fyslee just noticed the reference to her and thus posted the link in question there, but there have been other parties who have been chastised for this already, which continue, such as Curtis' revert warring over this article and articles related to it.

<p>Did you see the red letters at the top of this page which say <b>This is not the Wikipedia complaints department.</b>? <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">Dispute resolution</a> is over there →. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe">(talk)</a> 21:51, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Did you read the report? Obviously not.

<li>Your first sentence says, <i>please give me a kick if this is an inappropriate venue.</i> It is. This is more complicated than a simple removal of links can fix. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><sup><small><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a></small></sup> 22:21, 2 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Perhaps then instead of simply saying the venue is incorrect, you could suggest a correct one? MEDCAB/MEDCOM doesn't seem an appropriate place to discuss the content of sites linked externally, and the lack of civility on both parties, and I don't see it being seen by ARBCOM at this juncture.

<p>This is mostly just an FYI posting to make sure as many admins as possible are aware of this issue. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarin_Fidika_f96d.html" title="User:Darin Fidika">Darin Fidika</a> (<a href="../../../d/a/r/User_talk%7EDarin_Fidika_101f.html" title="User talk:Darin Fidika">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Darin_Fidika_2e03.html" title="Special:Contributions/Darin Fidika">contribs</a>) was blocked indefinitely for blatant plagiarism and consistently failing to provide copyright information for images he uploaded to the site despite numerous requests and warning about it. He plagiarised over 700 articles (see <a href="../../../n/i/h/User%7ENihonjoe_Samurai_54fa.html" title="User:Nihonjoe/Samurai">this page</a> for details on that). He actually got off fairly leniently as he was only warned sternly to not do that again, and to make sure he always included copyright information and reliable sources for all of his information to avoid any such problems in the future. Though he's deleted a lot of the warnings, he was warned multiple times after that about uploading images without copyright information, so I blocked his indefinitely as I believe strongly that he's a really bad legal liability to have around given his horrible track record.</p>

<dd>It is true that our policy against legal threats is not something people regularly encounter. I personally take the policy of given a rather stern and final warning upon the first occurrence of such a threat, then block the second time.

<dd>I think in this case it is <i>possible</i> that the user may have heeded a warning. However I am not personally prepared to unblock someone who threatens other users. When you go to a website that allows you to edit, such as wikipedia, then start threatening legal action against other users you deserve to be banned forwarned or not.

<dd>An approach I have seen work successfully is to tell the user that he or she is blocked unless and until he or she <i>withdraws</i> the legal threats. Referring the user to the on-wiki dispute resolution process is also appropriate, although not sure whether that's applicable in this instance.

<p>What Newyorkbrad said. We've been here before. Unblock <b>only</b> once the legal threats are fully retracted, and make it very clear to the user that legal threats are a particularly nasty form of bullying and are not tolerated.

<p>Whole article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Brahmanism" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Brahmanism" rel="nofollow">[55]</a> is a work of fiction. There is no substance in it. Most of links listed in article does not work and one which works are mainly blogs and op-eds. There is no hard evidence, proof, statistics of any incidence. Brahmins practice touchability and commit crime against lower casts and here on wikipedia they are trying to protray themselevs as victim. Here is the report from govt of India that tells the truth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"According to the 2005 Annual Report of the National Crime Records Bureau of the Ministry of Home Affairs of the government of India, a crime against the Scheduled Castes also known as Dalits is committed in every 20 minutes. The report stated that a total of 26,127 cases against Scheduled Castes were reported in 2005 while the number of crimes against dalits in 2004 was 26,887. The cases include 8,497 cases reported under the Protection of Civil Rights Act and 291 cases under the Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. On the other hand, going by the recent trend of crimes committed against the Dalits, it is undoubtedly increasing. Many chilling crimes against the dalits have been reported from across India during the last couple of months. The Dalits are untouchable but incidents of stripping, parading naked, beating, molestation and rape of the Dalit women by the upper castes are widespread and frequent. The 2005 Annual Report of the National Crime Records Bureau reported a total of 1,172 cases of rape of dalit women during 2005."</p>

<dd>It had been discussed just a few months ago to delete it and resolution was to keep, there is no point in bringing this up every 6 months, instead, perhaps a consensus can be reached about how it should be worded. I think the phenomenon can be described retained as an encyclopedic article but its must be more balanced. My editing strategy was to quote the allegations by saying that "it is alleged ...". I also was trying to balance the POV, not just dismissing the issue.

<p>Without wishing to become embroiled in a discussion I cannot add much to, being almost entirely ignorant of the subject, I'd like to note that there seem to be very few sources in this article. I think the parties would benefit from taking this to RfC and asking for uninvolved (and without wishing to offend anyone and recognising of course that Indian editors are more likely to have subject knowledge, perhaps nonIndian) editors to cast an eye over it. There are very many statements in this article, many quite hurtful to one group or another, that are not sourced at all. If editors removed unsourced statements, they are going to be supported by the wider community. Let's not just write "it is alleged". Let's put our sources for the allegations, and if we don't have sources, let's remove them. And remember, guys, we are working together to make something acceptable to all. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7EReverse_Gear_8b83.html" title="User:Reverse Gear">Reverse Gear</a> 09:41, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>These are all good suggestions. However, that is not what is going on here. The partisan editors above are not adding any sources but are, in fact, writing hate speech into the article.

<dl>
<dd>"the Dalit Christian movement excercises sharp criticism against what they represent as Hindu and especially Brahmin opressors". Not only is this wrong (Dalit Christians themselves are busy trying to get out of the clutches of upper-caste Christians, particularly in places like Goa) but is worded in a way to inspire hate against Hindus and promulgate communal violence (this may sound flaky to non-Indians, but the fact is that this is precisely the sort of incendiary remark that missionaries use to instigate poor Dalits into a clannish mentality, creating the myth of the Hindu "other" as an ethnocentric concept). This is not the view of the Dalit Christian movement but the view of aggressive and decidedly non-Dalit missionaries. <a href="../../../r/u/m/User%7ERumpelstiltskin223_6de5.html" title="User:Rumpelstiltskin223">Rumpelstiltskin223</a> 20:53, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Why so complicated? If it is wrong, then why didn't you bother to correct it? You have not even edited this sentence of mine. Look at your own language, you used the following words: "[christians] have <i>superficially used</i> ... to <i>villify</i> ... as part of their propaganda aimed to <i>eradicate Hindus</i>", "his [attempt] to <i>forcibly convert</i>" this is all the kind of unsubstantiated POV language that has nothing to do with a neutral encyclopedic description. Also, why do you keep refusing to discuss it on the talk page instead of bothering the administrators with all that sensational noise, Mr. Kelkar? Declare me a "Vandal", "disruptive", "fundamentalist propaganda", "hate speech", I trust that all your verbiage reflects amply on yourself. Gschadow 23:51, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I blanked the page and placed a warning on his talk page. Warnings should never be placed on the main user page. In fact, except in extreme cases, you should generally not edit another editor's userpage.

<dd>It's because you nominated his, or his friend's, vanity article for deletion. (Which was the right thing to do, IMO.)

<li>I think a (rouge) admin or two ought to come and take a look at this.
