<p>I wish to bring to your attention the recent activities of KDRGibby, who I'm sure you'll remember from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/KDRGibby" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/KDRGibby" rel="nofollow">this ArbCom case</a>. Since the closure of his case (which resulted in him being put on parole and probation for personal attacks), Gibby has made the following comments on the talk pages of articles on my watchlist. Keep in mind that I have not covered all his contributions; many more personal attacks could exist. What I find amazing is that no admin has yet taken it upon himself to enforce the ArbCom decision and block Gibby (I believe the maximum punishment is in order for such blatant disregard not only for the community, but also for the ArbCom itself):</p>

<p>KDRGibby was blocked for supposed violations of his personal attacks parole. See <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_KDRGibby_21a7.html#Log_of_blocks_and_bans" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/KDRGibby">Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/KDRGibby#Log_of_blocks_and_bans</a>. His comments may have been angry, but, if they're in response to someone removing sourced edits without explanation, to a certain extent justified. If he's blocked, at least the people deleting valid info should be too. Please review this block.- <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 17:49, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Personal attacks are personal attacks, and KDRGibby knows full well what making personal attacks will cost him. To quote <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>, "There is no excuse for personal attacks on other contributors."

<dd>Then could you explain exactly what part of his edit was a personal attack. All I see is anger, but as far as I know that's not a blockable offense. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 18:57, 2 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm pretty sure that when KDRGibby says, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Progressivism&amp;diff=41679325&amp;oldid=41679205" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Progressivism&amp;diff=41679325&amp;oldid=41679205" rel="nofollow">"You lefties are so gd amazing!"</a> he's not referring to his fondness for <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southpaw.html" title="Southpaw">southpaws</a>. Lumping his opponents together using a term clearly meant to be pejorative, all wrapped up in a number of comments that certainly fall outside the bounds of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">civility</a>, is a personal attack—and moreover is something that someone who <i>knows</i> he is on an attack parole should know not to do. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 19:43, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Can someone please review his edits. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Elle <small><sub><font color="#CC9920">vécut heureuse</font></sub></small> <small><font color="blue"><sup>à jamais</sup></font></small></a> (<a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENatalinasmpf_9405.html" title="User talk:Natalinasmpf">Be eudaimonic!</a>) 01:13, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've decided to investigate Gibby's most recent behavior, since the expiry of the block instituted by Tom Harrison 22:23 on March 1. Since it expired he has made an incredible 60 edits,</p>
<p>Firstly looking at his edit summaries alone I see:</p>
<ul>
<li>"the nuetrality dispute is because the leftists won't allow factual cited criticism to be present. stop abusing wiki rules for political purposes.)"</li>
<li>"that is not a legitimate reason to revert the text. You will do anythign to keep outstuff you don't like won't you. The other editors deletion excuse was it need sp corrects. I say fix it then"</li>
<li>"sorry you deleted cited credible material again, this is bordering on vandalism..."</li>
</ul>
<p>In the arbitration case, it was found that KDRGibby has said things like (names etc removed):</p>
<ul>
<li>"X is an immature communist brat from P who keeps deleting this and my other sections from Wiki, she has violated the 3rev policies multiple times and gets away with. Has no logical arguementation skills, and no ability to defend her deltions.</li>
<li>"Y you are an Fing MORON! You delete Hayek's interpretation as PROPOGANDA? What BS"</li>
<li>"rules mean nothing here, fuck the wikis the little bastards can't follow their own rules, and dont edit my own discussion page."</li>
</ul>
<p>and that these were personal attacks. Okay maybe the edit summaries weren't in quite the same category. Accusing people of abusing the rules, activities bordering on vandalism, and being willing to "do anythign to keep outstuff you don't like" may all be legitimate criticisms, though the edit summary is hardly an appropriate place to make them.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Of those recent edit summaries, only calling someone a leftist could possibly be interpreted as an attack. What he said before his arbcom case is not relevant to a block one places now.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>While he was blocked, KDRGibby said this on his talk page:</p>
<ul>
<li>"I try civility, but its very hard when dealing with so many moronic logically inconsistant editors and biased lazy administrators who only follow the rules to suite their political prefrences against users they ideologically disagree with." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:KDRGibby&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=41912752" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:KDRGibby&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=41912752" rel="nofollow">[17]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Well that's a personal attack but it's a fairly diffuse one. The "moronic logically inconsistant editors and biased lazy administrators who only follow the rules to suite their political prefrences against users they ideologically disagree with" aren't actually named (though we could infer). And in any case it could be a legitimate complaint (has he filed an RfC?)</p>
<p>So let's see what else he's been up to:</p>
<p>Since being unblocked he has said:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Oh and comparing classical liberals to "elitist republicans" not only shows your own bias, but extreme ignorance!!! They are nothing alike! Not to mention you have no citation for your little original research. Your entire edit is predicated on your own original research while erasing the publicated cited researched sources that say things you disagree with. YOU HAVE TO DO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS! (Gibby 23:58, 2 March 2006 (UTC))" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Classical_liberalism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=41974513" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Classical_liberalism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=41974513" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>
<ul>
<li>Pretty angry stuff. And very strong criticism. But not perhaps in the realm of personal attack. Just not polite.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"I'm not calling you a vandal, i'm calling you a left wing censor." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Economic_progressivism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=41989094" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Economic_progressivism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=41989094" rel="nofollow">[19]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>But the sheer weight of these edits must be crippling to dialog. He is permanently angry and he had made 60 edits to just 10 or so articles and their talk pages. The Committee found that he "consistently fails to assume good faith" and this seems to be what is at the bottom of his disruptive behavior.</p>
<p>While I don't think another block is necessarily merited (he's angry as hell, but not as bad as he has been), his behavior still falls far below an acceptable level and if it continues he *will* be repeatedly blocked for personal attacks. I do think this problem editor's activities on the following articles, amongst others, should be monitored, and if necessary we should consider banning him from those that he disrupts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Altruistic Economics, <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classical_liberalism.html" title="Classical liberalism">Classical liberalism</a>, <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economic_progressivism.html" title="Economic progressivism">Economic progressivism</a>, <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_trade.html" title="Fair trade">Fair trade</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In the arbitration case, it was found that he had engaged in tendentious editing, edit warring, removal of large blocks of information, and acting immaturely (<a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> was cited). Remedies include an impressive array of probations for disruption. It would probably be a kind act to ban him from editing articles that obviously cause him great mental anguish, rather than letting him continue to get angrier and angrier until he lashes out again. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 02:59, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>A number of administrators are now trying to modify this editor's bad behavior. If he acts badly, he gets a very <i>brief</i> block (a few hours at most) and a note explaining precisely why he has been blocked.

Not that I care deeply - it's odious behaviour and you will see from his talk page that he's utterly unrepentant. I noted that IZAK got ten days' ban for spamming talk pages with personal attacks, which suggests that 31 hours is so short as to be <i>out of process</i>; presumably StrangerInParadise should have the option of the longer penalty if he prefers - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 00:47, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I entirely support the block and agree with David Gerard that it's a relatively lenient one in all the circumstances. However it is in some ways fortunate that StrangerInParadise has come along to demonstrate exactly why Categories of Wikipedians by POV are wrong at just the point that it comes under discussion. For myself I would say that I would have much less hostile feelings toward Userboxes in general if none of them had included categories. Whatever process is used, we need to have a resolution of the Userbox problem which reminds everyone that Wikipedians are supposed to leave their POV behind, and Categories by POV are so far away from that that I really can't see why anyone can defend them. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 00:57, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Butting in here, I just want to note that, as far as I can determine, every proposed userbox policy, old and new, has included language to the effect that double categorization (by templates and categories) is unnecessary. I believe it's not far fetched to say that there already is a consensus for the position that, no matter what one may think about templatized userboxes, the inclusion of categories is at best redundant. Until SIP came along, nobody seemed to particularly mind the removal of categories from templatized userboxes. In the present case, insisting on having an <i>advocacy</i> category as part of an <i>advocacy</i> template is especially wrong. The usual disclaimers about "disclosing biases" etc. don't apply: the "pro-cannabis" template and category are advocacy for a cause that is completely external to Wikipedia (and the same would hold for a hypothetical "anti-cannabis" category, in case that wasn't obvious). The point is that no amount of editing Wikipedia can effect the changes advocated by the people who sign on to this template/category. As such, the advocacy is purely <i>external</i>, as opposed to Wikipedia-related advocacy (e.g. "school articles should be improved not deleted"). The way SIP went about this makes me question his motives and wonder whether a longer block (say, for the duration of UPP) may be more appropriate. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a>&#160;<small><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkSweep_9d72.html" title="User talk:MarkSweep">(call me collect)</a></small> 01:39, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah. The sensible and on-policy thing would have been to <i>remove the images</i> and leave the boxes themselves alone. (And I'm not at all convinced that this is a "legal" issue - I'm not aware of any cases where anyone has even been sent a C&amp;D letter, much less actually sued, for using fair use images in this way.

<dd>Conversation with StrangerInParadise in IRC led me to believe that he does not see why his actions were inappropriate and that he would continue them, reducing the issue to the oversimplified "why can I not contact a list of people?" and not acknowledging his actions were any more than that. The thought that this is acceptable practice is more harmful than the placement or removal of any silly colored boxes. As such, if StrangerInParadise doesn't realize how his actions were harmful and plans to continue then, I'm fine with the block, and would like to know why Babajobu believes it should be undone; I'm inviting him to this thread. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindspillage_87a5.html" title="User:Mindspillage">Mindspillage</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMindspillage_c644.html" title="User talk:Mindspillage">(spill yours?)</a> 07:28, 5 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hi, I'd like to apologize for unblocking Stranger last night without discussing it first. In fact, I wasn't even aware of this discussion, but my normal M.O. when I disagree with a block is to query the blocking admin (in this case David Gerard) rather than just unilaterally lifting the block. What I did was in very bad form. I had an overly pleasant Saturday evening out in Dublin with some friends, returned home on the <a href="../../../l/u/a/Luas.html" title="Luas">Luas</a> and then made the egregious error of WWD--Wikiing While Drunk. First time in over 7000 edits that I've done that, and it shan't happen again! After revisiting the issue, I must agree that Stranger's spamming of talkpages (though <a href="../../../a/w/b/WP%7EAWB_c695.html" title="WP:AWB">AWB</a> isn't a bot, each post is still submitted by the editor) with uncivil vote jockeying was very much inappropriate, and that because an initial effort to discuss it with him didn't meet with any success, a short block was not inappropriate. I do think, though, that 31 hours was far too long, given that there are what I consider to be very real mitigating circumstances. Users like Stranger are being relentlessly provoked and antagonized by admins who continue to implement the proposed template and category space policy while the poll is still ongoing. I support the new userbox policy, and will implement it if it is passed. But it makes a mockery of the entire process, and is a slap in the face of those users who are participating in the poll in good faith, to go on ad hoc deletion binges while mocking the concerns of affected users, all while we are supposedly still going through the process of developing a protocol about how these issues should be handled. As a wise man has said, "admins wield a mop, not a sceptre". When we act as though we wield a sceptre, it shouldn't surprise us when an irritated user starts spamming about rogue admins and attempts to "rally the newbs" against us. Anyway, again, apologies for my rash and undiscussed unblocking last night, I should have raised these issues with you rather than lifting the block. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 15:37, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So you're saying that you think administrators should sit on their hands until a new written policy is formed? Sorry, doesn't wash. Wikipedia doesn't have a written policy on a lot of matters, but administrators <i>will</i> take action to defend the encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 15:47, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What I think is that the ad hoc deletion binges are sowing enormous resentment among ordinary users, and are controversial even among admins, many of whom (myself included) believe that these deletions have done more to distract the community from its task of encyclopedia-building than the existence of the userboxen ever did. Moreover, Jimbo has explicitly stated that his words should not be interpreted as support for these sorts of deletions. I've never doubted for a second that admins who continue to delete the userboxen are doing so because they genuinely believe that they are acting in the best interests in Wikipeda, but not only do I disagree with them, I also think they are exercising a degree of authority that no one has ever given them. I think they have made adminship an *enormous* deal, have chomped down on tons of newbies, have fomented a pointless and unnecessary wiki-class-war, and accomplished very little else in the process. That's how I see it, obviously I know you disagree. But why not just wait until the new policy is established, when the same thing can be accomplished with considerably less controversy? <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 16:20, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Uh, what? Grossly non-encyclopedic categories in userboxes have been considered a bad thing since they first showed up. And notably, Mark (and others) has been removing such categories from userboxes for the last while now (particularly since the Catholic Alliance thing showed they were susceptible to gross abuse) with no objections whatsoever ... until SIP decided it was a great case with which to demonstrate just <i>why</i> such categories are a serious problem. Are you seriously saying Mark should have been continuously checking <i>just in case</i> someone had written a poll on a heretofore uncontroversially-accepted action? That really doesn't seem reasonable or workable. The problem here is not that Mark was deleting odious categories that were accepted to be a bad thing, but that a user then objected to the removal of an odious category by acting in a further odious manner - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 17:02, 5 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm saying he shouldn't go on deletion binges of categories and templates that as yet meet no criterion for speedy deletion, and then wheel-war over those deletions.

<dd>What I also find very disruptive was the mass reversion of people's talk pages who did get this message. I got the message, and, well I have quite a few userboxes.

But that is not what this is for. I agree, there could have been a better way of going about telling users about the new Userboxen policy vote, but it was effective.

<dd>As the talk page spamming was directed exclusively at those who possessed userboxes, it could never be effective in alerting people about the poll.

<p>I did intentionally place a notice urging an <b>Oppose</b> vote on <a href="../../../u/p/p/WP%7EUPP_e74c.html" title="WP:UPP">WP:UPP</a> on the talk pages of 43 <a href="../../../u/n/i/Category%7EUnited_Nations_Wikipedians_a70e.html" title="Category:United Nations Wikipedians">United Nations Wikipedians</a>, and intended do 12 more (completing Wikipedians S through Z), and call it a day. Apart from knowing them to have been subject to MarkSweep's mass blanking and category depopulation efforts, I had no personal connection that I can recollect with those 43 contacted.</p>
<p>I intended to be partisan, and although I felt a strict obligation to be accurate, I did not consider myself any more obliged to present both sides of this discussion than those who go about declaring <i>Userboxes are evil</i> in official proceedings. Therein, I characterized certain acts as those of a <i>rogue admin</i>, as I believe that to be an accurate description of a mass blanking campaign using admin tools to disrupt an established Wikipedia process of categorizing Wikipedians by perspective, as well as to thereby depopulate categories so as speciously to qualify them for CSD-C1 (empty). My note did not constitute a personal attack, but did reference the specific reprehensible acts of identifiable persons.</p>
<p>I was unaware of either any policy prohibiting this, or the degree of outrage <i>on principle</i> this act would provoke. I was unfamiliar with the ArbCom ruling cited, and do not see that it would necessarily apply to a Wikipedia-wide poll. I did not at any time receive notice that my actions were prohibited, though I was paused in discussions with Mindspillage over her express concerns about them at the time I was blocked. The reader should note that this is the first time in five years at Wikipedia that I have been blocked for anything.</p>
<p>As to charges of <i>vote-stacking</i>, it remains unclear to me how one can stack a vote in a Wikipedia-wide poll. As Avriette has pointed out, this is somewhat counter-intuitive. To DavidGerard's comment that my acquaintance with email should have clarified for me how this is odious spam, I would point out that (outside of the peculiar world of Wikipedia) <i>spam</i> is an unwanted message undesired by and of no relevance to the recipient. In DR's own experience of email, how often does spam receive positive action and thank you notes?</p>
<p>Contrary to statements by Mindspillage and others above, I did not at any time indicate that I would continue to place notices if told it was prohibited. I was unblocked by Babajobu within minutes of my block- and correctly, as there was no prior notice and the allegation of a spambot was patently false. Reblocking was unnecessary, and only allowed the above unfounded criticisms to go unanswered. My intention was- and is- to seek clarification on what appears to be an undocumented region of policy about which several Wikipedians nevertheless have strong feelings.</p>
<p>As previously discussed, I placed the notices by hand, using a <b>subst'd</b> page from my userspace. This and two others personal pages have been deleted, without sanction by policy. Though recreating them would be trivial, I will ask that at least the latter two be restored to me, especially as that it was done by a coauthor of WP:UPP to pages critical of it seems more than a bit improper. Only one was used in the UN campaign (User:StrangerInParadise/VNOUPP). Another (User:StrangerInParadise/PCI) was used to personal contacts and pages I frequent at Wikipedia and only said that there was a vote, but did not make a recommendation. The third (User:StrangerInParadise/AbstainerMsg) was not used, but the intended use was an alternative to the lobbying on the pollingspace itself, which I thought unseemly (JesseW, the Juggling Janitor comes to mind as having been prolific, though I and others did as well).</p>
<p>Finally, I note with that combination of dismay and amusement unique to Wikipedia the naked politicking above by coauthors and proponents of WP:UPP, calculating the political influence and how best to salvage their losing proposal. MarkSweep's suggestion that I be banned for the duration of WP:UPP was extra-special in this regard. Any charges of undue influence and corruption of process should be considered in this light.</p>

<dd>StrangerInParadise, I'd like to take this opportunity to repeat some of our <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">founder's</a> words and ideas: here, we're all Wikipedians. We strive to be as civil as possible, to respect each other as much as humanly possible, and to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> to the greatest degree. Calling admins "rougue", regardless of what you thought of their actions, is simply uncalled for; if you disagree with their actions, simply say so, but characterizing them in a negative fashion is uncalled for. In addition, as Mindspillage (who is a she, by the way) told you earlier, we generally don't like people trying to influence other people by placing mass notices on user talk pages. Remember, we're all here to work on an encyclopedia; calling a certain proposal to attention for selected Wikipedians is generally frowned upon. There are other ways of getting your point across. Please, Stranger, take time to reflect upon Jimbo's plea for calm and unity, and act accordingly.

<dd>I've commented previously that the actions described as <i>rogue</i> were so far beyond either civility or sanction that no assumption of good faith is possible. The term indicates restraint on my part. As to consensus, influence, and policy formation, this is a different and evolving discussion. I point out in my defense only that the proposal is already before an audience of largely <i>selected Wikipedians</i>, and that it is likely that, should it close at a significant number, the policy will be slammed into effect without reprieve.

<dd>The very dynamics of how people have became aware of the vote suggest vote-stacking of a sort. The pretense that this corrupts the poll assumes it was not corrupted to begin with. The fact is that I could choose pools of Wikipedians at random to notify in the most neutral fashion, and support would continue to drop because this only has minority support. Make no mistake, I sought to notify only a small group of affected Wikipedians. If you like, do the same: where is this pool of anti-userbox sentiment? If you polled those who have responded to the poll as to
<ul>
<li>how they learned of the poll</li>
<li>whether they were administrators</li>
<li>whether they were motivated by an experience of vote-stacking</li>
<li>whether they were motivated by POV issues generally</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>...you would see how self-selected the respondants were. There are all kinds of interesting possibilities for, say, randomly-selected juries and <i>voire dire</i>, but that is another discussion to which to look forward. This is more than a small <i>straw poll</i>, there is every indication that the policy would be slammed into effect without reprieve. StrangerInParadise 02:16, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You claim that "The fact is that I could choose pools of Wikipedians at random to notify in the most neutral fashion, and support would continue to drop because this only has minority support" but that claim is very easily exploded.

It is not difficult to see that this is, again, a self-selected group- not a bad group, just not representative. As for <i>morally reprehensible</i>, don't get me started....

The current discussion between myself and this user is taking place <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:HeyNow10029#Kelly_Clarkson_image_Image:Kelly_Award.jpg" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:HeyNow10029#Kelly_Clarkson_image_Image:Kelly_Award.jpg" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>Since this predicament began, there are now several IP addresses (presumably devoted Kelly Clarkson fans) who have started reverting the new images that directly relate to the article to the former ones, which currently include questionable fair use rationale (with only two concerns). I would really appreciate it if someone more familiar with the image criteria would participate in this incident, because I can't promote the article with the current state. It may also be notable that several IPs are including patent nonsense and restoring vandalism. Any help would be appreicated. —Eternal Equinox | <a href="../../../e/t/e/User_talk%7EEternal_Equinox_6bf0.html" title="User talk:Eternal Equinox">talk</a> 01:26, 6 March 200</p>

<dd>First of all, you claim that each of the images lacks a fair use rational yet as you can see, this page [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Screenshots_of_movies_and_television" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Screenshots_of_movies_and_television" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>]is full of hundreds of images, screenshots like the images I uploaded, the majority of them only have the screenshot tag very few of them go further then that in providing fair use rationale. I've asked you before in my talk page how it's possible that those images (many of which were uploaded months ago on heavily-visited pages) qualify as fair use, yet the ones that I uploaded do not. Yet you don't give me an answer and then you complain when I re-insert the image. You seem to think you're better then us 'devoted Kelly Clarkson fans', so much so that you can't even give me a reason for the changes you make. I guess I'm just supposed to accept the changes you make as gospel. You yourself say you are "not aware of all of the guidelines regarding images and screenshots", yet you could have fooled me with the way you police the page and constantly revert everyone else's changes as if we were foolish children that needed to be carefully watched over. I would love an admin to finally look at those pictures and give us an answer. <a href="../../../h/e/y/User%7EHeyNow10029_96cc.html" title="User:HeyNow10029">HeyNow10029</a> 03:07, 6 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>There has recently been a growing feeling among admins that a project-wide effort to cut back on fair use images is necessary. Mostly this has been done in fits and starts so far, and as you point out, there are hundreds of images still being used without any kind of fair use rationale. However, I don't see this as a defense for any particular image--sooner or later we're going to get around to those hundreds, but yours happens to have come to our attention a little sooner.

<dd>Yes, there should be a cut-back because there are many situations (including this one) that need to be sorted out.

<p>These users pass fake information as fact. Without verification at times. Diyako also invites other vandals such as user:Inanna, who has a track record of negativity and problems with the information to join in discussions knowing that they would distrupt order and the established wikipedia system. They are very underhanded and see themselves as the suprme authoritizes. They say something but act in another way. Many people have constantly argued with them and tried to fix articles, but they simply wait them out and then do what they want.

This happened before and I believe ArbCom rejected the allegation: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_arbitration&amp;diff=37791333&amp;oldid=37754412" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_arbitration&amp;diff=37791333&amp;oldid=37754412" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>. I am not going to get into a wheel war with another admin, especially since I think -Ril- has hardly made a great impression lately, but I have had an email from -Ril- protesting innocence and I am inclined to take it at face value. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 23:31, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Just to say, I didn't reject it. I was merely bowing to the superior experience of my colleagues to CheeseDreams. I am still personally of the opinion that -Ril- may well be a sockpuppet of CD. All the evidence is circumstantial, but it all adds up to a fairly convincing picture. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Korn_fe1c.html" title="User:Sam Korn">Sam Korn</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESam_Korn_f7db.html" title="User talk:Sam Korn">(smoddy)</a></sup> 23:35, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think there are several points to add here. One is that the Arbitration Committee rejected the case, not the allegation itself. Another is that there really wasn't any evidence to exonerate -Ril-, and the arguments that the two might be different people are extremely vague. If some people were unconvinced, I'd say they either haven't carefully studied the behavior of both accounts, or they are perhaps mistaking changes in tone for changes in character. There's also the additional evidence pointed out in the section above.</p>
<p>Finally, I've already <a href="../../../-/r/i/User_talk%7E-Ril-_f6e9.html" title="User talk:-Ril-">discussed this issue</a> with -Ril- personally. I think it's quite telling that through all this, and even in the face of direct questions, -Ril- still has not given anything more than a non-denial. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 23:54, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A number of us are quite convinced, based on the extent to which -Ril- and CheeseDreams share editing interests, opinions, tactics, and stylistic quirks.

<dd>I strongly oppose any block of -Ril- or any other user based on <i>suspicion</i> alone. Unless a user is engaged in repeated, blatant vandalism, an indefinite block should require more than just one admin's feelings. If Michael has strong evidence, he should take it to Arbcom. Wasn't that already done, and rejected before, though? In my opinion, -Ril- should be unblocked until and unless a much more convincing case is presented. <tt><a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrotalus_horridus_5cc6.html" title="User:Crotalus horridus">Crotalus horridus</a> <small>(<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECrotalus_horridus_e0ed.html" title="User talk:Crotalus horridus">TALK</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Crotalus_horridus_e95d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Crotalus horridus">CONTRIBS</a>)</small></tt> 01:04, 3 March 2006 (UTC)

He has no clear intention on creating an encyclopedia. All of his edits are basically POV pushing on the userbox war which is now taken to a whole new level of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> violation.</p>
<p>Since February 14th all this user has been doing is creating more frustration and problems on Wikipedia. All his edits are now consistant tagging userboxes and voting for thier deletion on thier respective TFD which he makes. All his TFD nominations explanations were listed as "Divisive userbox". Most, if not all, of his nominations were <i>not</i> granted. He also previously tagged userboxes under T1 violations, but all were removed or overturned, and if any of the userboxes were deleted it's probably put up on <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_U_c4a1.html" title="WP:DRV/U">WP:DRV/U</a> now.</p>
<p>Today, earlier, is what really did it for me. Alibabs created both {{User_Nazi}} and {{User AntiPalestine}} and then listed, one of them, on <a href="../../../t/f/d/WP%7ETFD_eab7.html" title="WP:TFD">WP:TFD</a> as once again listing them as a "Divisive userbox".

<dd>Any permanent block imposed right now would be controversial in my mind...how about this? We leave a little message on the userpage saying that the username is potentially controversial, and we'd really appreciate it if the user would consider choosing another one instead. We say that it is to the benefit of the editor that they pick a more neutral name, one which does not have these potentially offending connotations. How about that? We have no other clear guidelines to follow, other than to express our feelings and reservations in this case. Of course, being overly diplomatic may not be too helpful - personally, I'm not too concerned with the username. There are plenty more out there which are active and are more controversial than that. --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> 17:18, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>Undelete. No harm is being done including it, Wikipedia is not paper.

Is no one here allowed to disagree with your unfounded opinions or they get banned (or shot as you may prefer?) as in a totalitarian dictatorship.

Your POV accusations are false, but you refuse to discuss them, but obviously prefer the abuse tactic of just banning anyone who dares to not bow before your opinion.

<p>Dear Central: I am tempted to simply not reply to the above, based on its scurrilous and unacceptably poor faith character, but since you accuse me of "...refusal to debate any issue..." I shall reply to your points above. Incidentally, this charge begs the question: what am I refusing to debate? There is nothing to debate, as far as I can see, and debating would generally require at least a modicum of rationality and reasonably polite behaviour from you, which I feel the above does not demonstrate. You have not raised debate other than simply responding with your views that I am being biased. I attempted to raise the issue of NPOV with you politely on your talk page, to which you replied with animosity and assumptions of poor faith. You have persistently shown an anti-Jehovah's Witness POV editing stance, which is not acceptable for an encyclopaedia. As far as I can see, the matter is perfectly clear cut - POV editing is not tolerated on Wikipedia at all, and I see no reason why my action in banning you from Jehovah's Witness pages was not in defence of the neutral point of view on Wikipedia. You accuse me of bias, as Tommstein did, but on what basis? You say my view that you are pursuing a POV stance of editing are false, but yet you do not back up this conviction of yours by any evidence and indeed respond with animosity rather than politely indicating why this is not so. Does this strike you as reasonable behaviour for a Wikipedia editor on your part?</p>
<p>I feel that your judgement on my ability as a Wikipedia administrator on the basis of my age and beliefs is frankly also not within the bounds of decent behaviour, which reaffirms the purpose of banning you from the trouble areas that you have been involved in. If you make these kind of judgements towards everyone who disagrees with you, then I don't much want you editing at all, and I am not ashamed of stating so. Considering that I hold a job of some responsibility in my profession, and yet I would not consider myself above everyone who disagrees with me in the course of my work, I think you have a serious case of egocentricity with your assuming fault on the part of those who hold differing views. I held no personal fault with you to begin with, and indeed attempted to discuss with you amicably and in good faith. As for your threat to "take this up with you in person" - words escape me, they really do; I think you perhaps need to re-evaluate the perspective of what you are actually doing here.

<p>Could someone check the license for the deleted image <a href="../../../../fr/m/u/s/Image%7EMuscade.jpg_2ebb.html" class="extiw" title="fr:Image:Muscade.jpg">fr:Image:Muscade.jpg</a> (bypassing the Commons redirect somehow--I don't know how). I copied this image to En some time ago and I thought I'd have used the same license (GFDL) on the English page that the French one used. The image is now at Commons but I see that version is currently tagged as public domain. So, either: 1) I slipped up when copying the image from fr to en (it was PD and I made it GFDL (not a copyvio but slightly antisocial)); 2) someone else slipped up when moving the image from fr to commons (it was GFDL and they made it PD, a copyvio); or 3) the image was originally GFDL and the photographer later released it to PD (OK but should add a note). I just noticed this when marking the local English copy <a href="../../../m/u/s/Image%7EMuscade.jpg_2ebb.html" title="Image:Muscade.jpg">en:Image:Muscade.jpg</a> for deletion as a duplicate.

<p>He was put on 24 hour personal attack parole in the Tommstein case and he's continued to be as viciously abusive as he can. In addition, his actual article contribs have been the same level of rubbish over Jehovah's Witness articles. I was wondering whether to hit him with another 24 hours (even though he manifestly doesn't learn and doesn't want to) or just give up and block indefinitely as a hopeless source of disruption, trolling and vicious personal abuse. Then I saw that TenOfAllTrades had given him the 24 hours, and Alkivar the indefinite a few hours earlier. So I undid both blocks so as to hit him with the indefinite again. If anyone wants to review this block please do, but honestly, look through that recent contrib list, and his talk page, and you tell me if he's worth the trouble - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 20:46, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>At the moment (hopefully this will be changed eventually), if you blocked someone for say 8 hours and I came along 5 minutes later and blocked them for 48 hours only the shorter of the blocks will remain in place. So in the above, Central would have come off his block in 24 hours even with the indefinite block unless someone <b>unblocks</b> and then reblocks with the longer time. --<a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 16:53, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If there are multiple blocks in place then the block only lasts until the expiry of the shortest block. In this case Alkivar's indef block was undone when TenOfAllTrades' 24 hour block was completed. Alkivar meant he should have lifted the previous block before applying a longer one. That's my understanding, anyway. <a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeithp_3c9a.html" title="User:Leithp">Leith</a><a href="../../../l/e/i/User_talk%7ELeithp_0f76.html" title="User talk:Leithp"><font color="teal">p</font></a> 16:51, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, well I knew about the software preferring the shorter block, but it sounded like Alkivar was saying there was something he could have done to prevent TOAT's <i>later</i> block from undermining his.

<dd>If my understanding of the timeline above is correct, the 24 hour block was in place before the indef block was applied by Alkivar...so what Alkivar is commenting on is he didn't check the block log for standing blocks, or did and forgot to unblock/reblock. --<a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 17:13, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have concerns about this user. <b>First</b>, he has been blocked for abuse at the <a href="../../../r/a/c/Rachel_Marsden_81fc.html" title="Rachel Marsden">Rachel Marsden</a> page several times, but none of them show up in his new block log. He changed his name yesterday from <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Bourrie_7f18.html" title="User:Mark Bourrie">User: Mark Bourrie</a> (his real name, apparently) to <a href="../../../c/e/r/User%7ECeraurus_5025.html" title="User:Ceraurus">User:Ceraurus</a>. When this was done, he got a fresh block log <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User%3ACeraurus" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User%3ACeraurus" rel="nofollow">here</a>, thereby removing from his history (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User%3AMark+Bourrie" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User%3AMark+Bourrie" rel="nofollow">here</a> the three blocks for vandalism and 3RR to the <a href="../../../r/a/c/Rachel_Marsden_81fc.html" title="Rachel Marsden">Rachel Marsden</a> page. Also, he has created a sock-puppet (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_CheckUser#Isotelus_.28talk_.E2.80.A2_contribs.29_and_Mark_Bourrie_.28talk_.E2.80.A2_contribs.29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_CheckUser#Isotelus_.28talk_.E2.80.A2_contribs.29_and_Mark_Bourrie_.28talk_.E2.80.A2_contribs.29" rel="nofollow">here</a> here], by which he broke the 3RR rule yesterday (again, to revert the Rachel Marsden page, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR#User:Isotelus" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR#User:Isotelus" rel="nofollow">here</a>, blocked <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User%3AIsotelus" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User%3AIsotelus" rel="nofollow">here</a>). <b>Second</b>, he proposed deletion of the Rachel Marsden article on March 4, which resulted in a speedy keep (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Rachel_Marsden" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Rachel_Marsden" rel="nofollow">here</a>). On March 7, his sock puppet again proposed deleting the Rachel Marsden article, a proposal that he then logged in as himself=Ceraurus to support <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FRachel_Marsden_%282nd_nomination%29&amp;diff=42633949&amp;oldid=42633465" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FRachel_Marsden_%282nd_nomination%29&amp;diff=42633949&amp;oldid=42633465" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Later in the day <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FRachel_Marsden_%282nd_nomination%29&amp;diff=42657357&amp;oldid=42633949" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FRachel_Marsden_%282nd_nomination%29&amp;diff=42657357&amp;oldid=42633949" rel="nofollow">here</a>, he deleted his vote as Mark Bourrie/Ceraurus. <b>Concern</b>. My concern is not so much to punish him--I think there are times when he seems genuinely interested in making the article better and in finding compromises. But I think it is important that the details from earlier blocklogs find their way to his new block log. <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBucketsofg_06fb.html" title="User:Bucketsofg">Bucketsofg</a> 17:20, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've just noticed that yet another completely obvious sockpuppet of Melissadolbeer has been created:</p>

</ul>
<p>Can someone please look over the (amazingly similar) contributions of the several sockpuppets of Melissadolbeer (Listed at Category:Wikipedia:Suspected sockpuppets of melissadolbeer and also User:Mikefar) and see if they might be able to spot who Melissadolbeer really is (Melissadolbeer is simply the main role-account).</p>
<p>The puppeteer is someone who keeps a close watch on <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAR_b522.html" title="WP:RFAR">WP:RFAR</a> - Melissadolbeer's re-appearance was pretty quick as soon as her/his subject matter reappeared at RFAR. And its likely someone who has a strong dislike of me (or possibly Doc Glasgow) for reasons other than those that the Melissadolbeer sock shows issues with, but I don't know who.</p>
<p>Using "what links here" and "user contributions" on the user names that Melissadolbeer's sockpuppets constantly refer to I've come up with a few possibility (This isn't a definitive list of possibilities by any means):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBacchiad_744e.html" title="User:Bacchiad">Bacchiad</a> (<a href="../../../b/a/c/User_talk%7EBacchiad_94de.html" title="User talk:Bacchiad">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bacchiad_026a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bacchiad">contribs</a>) - made no edits between october and 12th February. 12th February was around the time when an arbitration case involving me (as the "prosecution") began. October was when the prior one involving me occurred. The talk page suggests an interest in spurious theories about Christianity and Jesus topics (essentially Melissadolbeer's main contributions were spurious theories about Christianity/Jesus).</li>
<li>(I was hoping to find more, but that's the only one I can find so far, and its probably another sockpuppet, albeit more sophisticated than the others)</li>
</ul>

It is certainly possible that Ril had fun and sacrificed one of his socks and wants to carefully live on under the radar as a user</p>

<p>This administrator has removed an included category from a series of templates (at least 53) with the apparent intention of emptying those categories of the user pages they contained. In doing so for the second time, he reverted the actions of another administrator, <a href="../../../g/u/a/User%7EGuanaco_98c8.html" title="User:Guanaco">User:Guanaco</a>, attempting to correct this out-of-policy edit <i>en masse</i>. He has also engaged in <i>en masse</i> edits of user pages without the owners' consent to subst-ing templates with the apparent intent to delete the templates without anyone knowing. He has already <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html#Mark_Sweep.27s_continued_disruption_of_Wikipedia" title="WP:AN/I">attempted to abuse CSD-C1</a> by using this very mechanism to empty a category, then list it for speedy deletion as empty.</p>
<p>The behaviour is at least disruptive, as it interferes with intentional large-scale action of other Wikipedians, most of whom do not know their user pages have been dropped from these categories. As the actions are a form of blanking to undo the intent of the hundreds of original participants, it borders on— and perhaps crosses into— vandalism.</p>
<p>Regardless of how certain administrators may feel about userboxes, or those using categories, the above-listed actions are entirely unsuported by policy, and clearly contrary to the express will of a significant part of the community. The clear administrative <b>duty</b> in this case is to restore the <i>status quo ante</i>, and to prevent a repeat.</p>
<p>I ask that the following templates be restored <i>en masse</i> to their previous state, that MarkSweep and any others subsequently found be barred from further such actions by whatever means necessary.</p>

<p>Will an admin step forward to uphold policy and revert this damage, or has the fear of doing one's job been successfully instilled?</p>

<p>MarkSweep has struck again, removing categories from these templates,</p>

<dd>Again, I have asked for specific action, <i>I ask that the following templates be restored en masse to their previous state, that MarkSweep and any others subsequently found be barred from further such actions by whatever means necessary.</i> This is the appropriate venue for this alert, and the request for action is also appropriate- MarkSweep's edits were clearly out-of-order and disruptive. This would require of an admin only a few minutes to correct, but it would require me many, whilst opening me (wrongly) to charges of edit-warring. Isn't this better?</dd>

<dd>Finally, with respect to Dbiv's comment, I hope he wasn't suggesting that this opinion about categories of Wikipedians should override a clear duty to correct an act of mass disruption.

<dd>This is not <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. MarkSweep is doing something he thinks should be done; and it may become policy. However, it would be gracious of him (at the least) to abstain from acting any further in this matter. If it really needs to be done, someone else will do it. He is being far more divisive than the userboxes he dislikes have yet been. I would find any redlinks in the table above particularly regrettable. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 01:19, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Whether MarkSweep <i>thinks it should be done</i> is irrelevant, and certainly doesn't separate his acts from any number of disruptive actions- the perpetrators of which all think they "should be done". The speculation- far from certain- that some ban on userboxes will be ratified by the community obviates neither the need to enforce current policy nor the need to respect the community. MarkSweep's acts are certainly WP:POINT, though I was talking about the hypothetical refusal of admins to check and revert his actions. StrangerInParadise 01:27, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Guanaco, that was enormously inappropriate. Rollback is for clear cases of vandalism or self-reverts. This kind of mass reversion is hostile and rude to say the least, and not the way to deal with good faith boldness: consensus is. This isn't the first time your misuse of rollback has been brought up. I'm becoming increasingly irritated by your pattern of disruption with regard to userboxes and policies concering them. Let me stress to <i>everyone</i> involved to act slowly and communicate, and always seek consensus. Doing otherwise, especially with the use of admin tools, serves only to inflame the situation, and does us no good. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 05:14, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree that they were hostile and rude. Mark's actions could possibly destroy any <i>consensus</i> (we all <i>do</i> remember what this word means, yes?) on the userbox policy we're working so hard to adopt. I'm inclined to pull out of it immediately. Guanaco appears to be trying to "keep the peace" and to force things to go through process. The above description of what happened is accurage. Mark, please, chill out until we reach some kind of agreement. There's no reason to "go nuclear" on things right now. <b>...&#160;</b><span style="background-color: #11cbc4; width: 52px; height: 16px; font-size: 12px; p { text-align: center; font-face: Times New Roman}"><a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvriette_f119.html" title="User:Avriette">aa</a>:<a href="../../../a/v/r/User_talk%7EAvriette_2538.html" title="User talk:Avriette">talk</a></span> 06:39, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That isn't my point at all. Using the <i>administrative</i> rollback in a non-vandalism situation is hostile and uncalled-for.

<dd>It was a clear case of blanking vandalism: MarkSweep's actions deliberately dismantled mechanisms which disrupted the activities of hundreds of users, against their wishes, for no better reason than he did not approve. This is not to mention his subst-ing campaign on user pages, which effectively sought to hide his attempts to delete the underlying templates. How can you possibly call Guanaco's actions <i>hostile, rude and uncalled-for</i> in the face of MarkSweep's actions?! Guanaco rolled the templates back to the state prior to the disruption. Three months ago, no admin would have thought twice about it. The real question is, Dmcdevit, why didn't you as an admin step up and do the rollback yourself? Are you only an admin to fight destruction <i>you</i> dislike? Would you let blanking stand on articles you happen dislike? This <i>userboxenkampf</i> is showing just how weak administrative commitment to policy has become. StrangerInParadise 07:09, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree. I do not think Guanaco was wrong in using administrative rollback. It <i>was</i> vandalism as blanking, it cannot be said to be in good faith (following the countless RFCs on the matter), and he was wrong to have blanked them.

<dd>I too agree that Guanaco's reversions were reasonable. The one-click rollback is a handy tool, not a big deal.

<dd>Please, hold off on the dramatics for a bit, step back and consider this. Let's just say that Mark Sweep was hugely disruptive and even acting in bad faith. This is a controversial dispute, causing lots of hurt and ill feelings. Now consider the rollback: impersonal, and even implying that the rollbacker has determined bad faith. It seems likely only to further escalate, even if it <i>was</i> a disruptive edit. When a normal revert with an edit summary saying why would have accomplished the same, and not run that risk. I think the use of rollback was ill-considered, and that shouldn't be too controversial to say. I do, by the way, think the 12 hour cool down is probably for the best, for both parties. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 07:35, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To borrow a phrase, this is disgraceful. Somewhere along the line, a lot of Wikipedians lost their respect for collaboration and each other. I said before, to no avail: "Let me stress to <i>everyone</i> involved to act slowly and communicate, and always seek consensus. Doing otherwise, especially with the use of admin tools, serves only to inflame the situation, and does us no good." If we have learned anything from the pedophila wheel war, it's use caution, communicate, and find consensus, <i>especially</i> when reversing another admin's action. That goes for both Mark Sweep and Guanaco, and Friday and Evilphoenix and NSLE as well. We make people admins for a reason, and give them discretion in situations like this to exercise that power. There is no excuse for not discussing a reversal beforehand. Everybody needs to slow down and Discuss. And take your fingers off those buttons. <i>All</i> of these actions are displays of disrespect toward other administrators. Please keep <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> in mind at all times, and never forget the goodness of a real personal message to a talk page, or even a request for mediation, in place of an incident report. This has nothing to do with the individual merits of any of the admin actions, but for crying out loud, <i>discuss</i> it first. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 07:59, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We are beyond that, Dmcdevit. Either policy is to be upheld, or not. How can you pretend that admins upholding policy are somehow on the same level with the vandals they are fighting, and those who support them?

<p>I warned all of you about Guanaco when his latest RfA came up that he is a loose cannon, but you wouldn't listen to me, and this is the result.

<dd>A little bit late to the discussion here, but I'd like to echo Dmcdevit's words that we act with prudence, caution, and with great respect for one another. Remember that we all are humans; we're all volunteers; we're all dedicated to this great project. If we should choose to act, act with the greatest <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assumption of good faith</a> for each other, with the most civility as possible, and with the most wisdom as possible. I'm not going to comment on this specific situation (as I haven't reviewed everything fully), but I would like to point out that mass revertings of anything but blatant, clear-cut vandalism without general support usually does nothing but aggravate the situation further. Discussion never hurts, as communication is vital.

<p>1. I blocked because I saw an edit war in progress. If Guanaco was in the right and had consensus behind him, he should have asked someone else to make the reversion, intead of getting involved in an edit war. Edit warring = bad. 2. My Talk page message that was referred to was unclear. My apologies. I'm not refusing to communicate, I just happened to go to bed right after the block and therefore wasn't available to discuss it. 2a. But I'm also not watching AN/I. I refuse to. I'm disgusted lately. I came here because I involved myself in this one, so I felt I should at least see what was said. 3. Here's what I think a wheel war is: If an Admin A takes an Administrative action, Admin B reverts it, and Admin A undoes the reversion. A-&gt;B-&gt;A. If an Admin simply <i>undoes</i> another Admin's actions, I don't think that is itself a Wheel War. It's <i>polite</i> not to undo something without discussing it, or at least attempting to, but let's please all remember that Admins can revert each other <i>for a reason</i>. What courtesy dictates that we do is to not revert if we're reverted...If someone undoes my Admin action, it's wrong of me to re-do my action, and I have a <i>real</i> problem with anyone who does that. <i>That</i> is a wheel war, and that is what we need to be fighting against. But I don't think it's a wheel war if someone simply undoes a block or a protection or whatever. I don't think it's a wheel war if Admin A blocks, B unblocks, C blocks, and D unblocks. That's not a good situation, but it's not a wheel war. It's when you get into not respecting your fellow Admins enough to re-do something you've been reverted on that we get into problems. Wheel warring = bad. 4. We all need to remember the things that are important and worth fighting for. NPOV. Verifiability. Accuracy. Consensus. Avoiding edit wars...realizing that sometimes, your edits will get reverted, right or wrong, and sometimes, your Admin actions will get reverted, right or wrong, and <i><b>that's ok</b></i>. What's <i>not</i> ok is stubbornly insisting on your edit choice without deliberation, or stubbornly insisting on your Admin actions if you're reverted. I hope this makes sense y'all, because this is getting insane.

<dd>(copied from the talk page) It would seem that your reversion IS involvment in of itself.

Firstly I don't believe Postdlf is involved in the page. His actions were in good faith. He readded material that he believed was deleted vandalistically (cool word!). His threat to block was made in the belief that some fan or promoter or even Hammer himself was trying to remove any and all critical material. Now you say the material that was added back in was suspect, so I think the best thing to do is add a disputed tag to the article and ask for references on the talk page. If none are forthcoming then I will revert myself.

<dd>I initially moved the table to the workshop talk page (and included a link on the workshop page, in context), as it made the workshop page unreadably verbose. I have indeed been moving James S's comments into the "comments by parties" sections of the page. In so doing I was probably being too lax -- I considered removing them to the talk page also, but I decided that it would be more appropriate to let a Clerk do that.</dd>
<dd>James's belief that only parties should be editing a workshop page is, to the best of my knowledge, simply incorrect. But if I'm wrong about that, I welcome an education. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 03:00, 8 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>I'm new here, but I have noticed in the last 2 days the same phrase and then the same link, from many different users. Is this something that could be prevented automatically? The phrase is "I see the love that you suppress... come back to me when your journey is done", and the link: <a href="http://www.loveblender.com/1998february/heart/eyes1.html" class="external free" title="http://www.loveblender.com/1998february/heart/eyes1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.loveblender.com/1998february/heart/eyes1.html</a> Sorry if this isn't the correct place. Just curious. Thanks! Frederick. Oh, is "reverting" something somebody new can do? Sorry if this isn't the correct way to add a comment here. So much to take in. (sigh).

<li>I remember there's a script that's implemented to counter linkspamming, not sure if it's still there.
