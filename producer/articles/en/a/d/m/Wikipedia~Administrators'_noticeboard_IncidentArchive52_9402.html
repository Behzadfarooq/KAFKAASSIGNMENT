<p>I want to apologise for all my past vandalisms on Wikipedia. Apologies to Mindspillage, Curps, Android79, every admin on here. I am not going to vandalize Wikipedia EVER again. I am genuinely sorry and won't do this again! Please forgive me. --Sunfazer 10:24, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd also like some input on this. Thanks for bringing it up here, Andy. The constant adding of this tag on the article is quite disruptive, particularly when it is coupled with absolutely no constructive suggestions on what aspects of the article fail to conform with NPOV. I maintain that if the only requirement for an article being tagged with {{npov}} is that there is someone, somewhere, who insists that the article is POV, then eventually every article on Wikipedia will have that tag. If you're going to claim an article is pushing a specific point of view, then I believe you have an affirmative obligation to <i>state what that point of view is</i> and <i>make specific suggestions as to how to improve it</i>.</dd>
<dd>Relevant to this issue, I believe, is the consensus that repeatedly adding the NPOV tag to articles can be considered disruptive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Zen-master" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Zen-master" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Furthermore, your high-handed attitude and complete lack of constructive engagement on the talk page seems to me to be consistent with the description of your activities as "trolling" in the recent <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Pigsonthewing_50bc.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Pigsonthewing">arbitration case brought against you</a>, and fits in perfectly with the description of your activities in your recent <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Pigsonthewing_a37a.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Pigsonthewing">request for comments</a>: "Marking articles with unexplained "tags" as user follows seeming more concerned about being argumentive, more than a concern for Wikipedia." You've shown no willingness to engage the community on those issues, so I can only assume that you agree with those sentiments.</dd>
<dd>I believe we are making progress on the talk page in improving the article. I also believe that describing the existing issues in the article as being point-of-view disputes is absolutely incorrect; this is simply a discussion of what incidents and how much detail to provide in a biographical article. I welcome the input of other editors and administrators on this article. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 18:27, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I formally dispute this.

Ryan, feel free to disagree with my interpretation of the article but what you are doing here is blatant mischaracterization of the controversy.

<dd>Uhh, you've missed a spot. How is adding a {npov} header disruptive? A quick glance at the top and middle of the talk page will show the article is fundamentally disputed on numerous points. So you have to actually establish how I was "disruptive" specifically? <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 02:53, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>No, he doesn't. It's enough that in his opinion, your actions were disruptive. Furthermore, a review of the recent history of the article shows that a reasonable person could reasonably characterize your actions as disruptive; therefore, Ryan's determination is not an abuse of adminstrative discretion. The ban is validly imposed. That said: administrators banning for disruption under probation terms should offer somewhat more than a conclusive statement that the editor being banned was being disruptive; such statements need not be extensive or detailed, however. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 08:29, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So an admin would have to establish exactly where the "disruption" is before article banning would be appropriate, right? If there is an in good faith dispute I dare say {npov} headers are appropriate, the article and larger area of research are fundamentally disputed. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 18:48, 13 November 2005 (UTC)

<p>I am concerned here that Ryan Delaney is an admin involved in conflict with Zen-master, and did the banning himself, without even asking anyone else. After I raised this question on his talk page, he quickly archived it and then emailed me in private. After a total of eight emails, I'm still rather unimpressed by his actions, and disappointed by his response (which was basically nothing, and that it doesn't matter if he is involved, and that he was going to stop reading my emails). I just want to point out that Ryan was the one that was reverting Zen-master here, and has a history of reverting him, so <i>him</i> doing the banning is improper. Myself, I would have been less harsh for just the petty placing of a POV tag. Could someone else uninvolved take more than a quick look and see what you think? <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 19:57, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm disappointed that you chose to frame it in this way. As long as you want to bring private conversation out into the open (I hate doing this), I stopped reading your emails at the point that you stopped being civil ("I feel like I am talking to a brick wall"). I think <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAITH_32f0.html" title="WP:FAITH">WP:FAITH</a> would apply here, and I'm puzzled why you are so convinced that I am in some way punishing Zen-master for being in a conflict with me that does not exist. That I reverted his disruptive edits is only natural. I'm not sure if you would expect the banning administrator to leave the disruptive edits in in the article or not. As for archiving my talk page, I'm curious that you interpret this as a coverup attempt since if I were trying to cover this up I would not have posted it here on <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a>, on the talk page of the article, and on <a href="../../../m/e/n/Wikipedia%7EMentorship_committee_9dd5.html" title="Wikipedia:Mentorship committee">Wikipedia:Mentorship committee</a>. Again, <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAITH_32f0.html" title="WP:FAITH">WP:FAITH</a> applies.</dd>
<dd>I don't feel that I am in any way a disputant in this article. I simply perceived what I felt was disruptive editing by Zen-master and so I warned him. When he ignored my talk page warnings and continued the disruptive behavior, I banned him from the article. Since Kelly Martin confirmed that this ban was appropriately applied, I don't know what further purpose would be served by discussion, especially when when the discussion is already taking such an accusatory tone. It might do you some good to try to understand what happened before you decide that abuse occurred.</dd>
<dd>Still, as I posted on the talkpage for the <a href="../../../m/e/n/Wikipedia%7EMentorship_committee_9dd5.html" title="Wikipedia:Mentorship committee">Wikipedia:Mentorship committee</a>, if they decide to take his case I will abdicate and allow them to handle it however they see fit.

<dd>Ryan, I'm not putting anyone on trial here, and this attitude is exactly why I was so exasperated. I went to your talk page first and expressed my concerns as a fellow (uninvolved) admin. You deleted it hours later; I don't know why, but it gave me the distinct impression not to post there again. I'm not saying you were wrong, which is what you keep defending. But your action was <i>improper</i>. How can you deny being involved when <i>you were the one that reverted him</i>? Actually, if you want to misquote me (not that I can see why you bring it up), after four emails where you said nothing new, and refused to concede even asking another admin's opinion when you are involved, I said "My God, I feel like I'm talking to a wall." That would be my response to this comment as well. You were involved, and regardless of the rightness of Zen-master's banning, the only thing I've been trying to get you to do is to ask another admin or here <i>first</i>, rather than make unilaterl pronouncements when you are involved. I expect administratos to be better at taking criticism. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 21:23, 13 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>"Involved" is too broad a term, and I think the source of this disagreement. I do not believe I am a disputant in a content disagreement with Zen-master.

<dd>(Edit conflict) I guess I haven't been so specific on this page. think he was, because if you take a look at his last four edits to <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_and_intelligence.html" title="Race and intelligence">race and intelligence</a>, all of them were reverting Zen-master <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Race_and_intelligence&amp;diff=28160909&amp;oldid=28159827" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Race_and_intelligence&amp;diff=28160909&amp;oldid=28159827" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Race_and_intelligence&amp;diff=28064892&amp;oldid=28063692" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Race_and_intelligence&amp;diff=28064892&amp;oldid=28063692" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Race_and_intelligence&amp;diff=28059086&amp;oldid=28048988" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Race_and_intelligence&amp;diff=28059086&amp;oldid=28048988" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Race_and_intelligence&amp;diff=27642569&amp;oldid=27638504" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Race_and_intelligence&amp;diff=27642569&amp;oldid=27638504" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>.

<dd>I dispute your interpretation that my edits were disruptive, the only way that could be true is if there is not an in good faith dispute over the article. A quick look at the top and middle sections of talk page will show the article is fundamentally disputed. To summarize just some of the controversies: there is a dispute over the word "score" being potentially loaded, and charges of fundamentally unscientific methodologies and exponentially biasing presentation. Can an uninvolved admin or someone take a look at the <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_and_intelligence.html" title="Race and intelligence">race and intelligence</a> article and note the fundamental criticisms at the top and middle of the talk page and decide whether {npov} or {totallydisputed} is warranted in this case? thx. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 02:33, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You're missing the point. Nothing wrong with reverting Zen-master's notice. What was wrong was banning him when you were involved in editing the article. I don't think you should lift the ban or that you should be sanctioned. Just try not to get involved with an article then ban someone who is on probation. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> 02:40, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Huh? It most certainly was wrong, the <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_and_intelligence.html" title="Race and intelligence">race and intelligence</a> article is fundamentally disputed, when such a situation arises the {npov} template is added to an article. This is basic NPOV policy here. Please take a look at the fundamental criticisms of the article on the talk page for more info on the controversy. There is currently a vote of 2 to 1 to rename "score" to "results", Ryan Delaney hasn't voted or commented which I find suspiciously odd given the fact that he reverted my first attempt at rewritting the intro to change "score" to "result". So clearly there is a dispute, and clearly Ryan is involved, and clearly {npov} should be added (or the article should be substantially rewritten and retitled to adhere to NPOV). <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 02:49, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not involved in editing the article for content. I'm puzzled about why people think I am. I reverted Zen-master because I thought his edits were disruptive.

<dd>You reverted my rewritting of the intro for NPOV (replacing the loaded word "score" with "results") which is precisely one among many fundamentally disputed points, so how can you possibly claim both that {npov} is "disruptive" and that you weren't involved in the article? In my interpretation this situation is repeated censorship of fundamental criticisms by a coordinated clan of editors. The <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_and_intelligence.html" title="Race and intelligence">race and intelligence</a> article is apparently racism inducing and is exponentially unscientific, why aren't more editors concerned and investigating this? <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 08:18, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that edit was disruptive, since it's a radical change that is controversial with the other editors and he implemented it with full knowledge of this fact. I did not revert it because I personally disagree with it, but because Zen-master, true to style, was implementing changes as he saw fit without any regard to the approval of other editors. That is precisely the kind of edit that landed him in RFAr. I appreciate that this edit appears to make me party to a content dispute, but I am sure that it does not. --<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_Delaney_f359.html" title="User:Ryan Delaney">Ryan Delaney</a> <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyan_Delaney_8333.html" title="User talk:Ryan Delaney"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 09:01, 14 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Deep breath now, Ryan. Take it for the moment that nobody apart from <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> disagrees with you that the edits were disruptive (not a judgement, just a premise). The point at dispute then is: was it wise for you, holding this view so strongly that you got to the point where you got yourself involved in reverting the edits, to do the banning yourself? Would it not have been wiser to ask an uninvolved admin to make that call? Beyond that, you might ask yourself were your responses to being called on your actions, both privately and here, the best way to go? My own view is that it would have been wiser to adopt different approaches and that you should now walk away from this whole situation and file under learning experiences. <a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFiliocht_c3e2.html" title="User:Filiocht">Filiocht</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/l/User_talk%7EFiliocht_11a7.html" title="User talk:Filiocht">The kettle's on</a> 15:52, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>It would have been wiser of the arbcom to ask for an <i>uninvolved</i> admin to make the call. As it is, it amounts pretty much to a blanket ban. But there you are, if you get yourself under probation by the arbcom, you are very probably have wikiquette issues that are unlikely to go away overnight. Filiocht has wisely put that no admin is <i>forced</i> to block zm, and it would be a sign of maturity to let someone uninvolved make the call. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 16:01, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I should add here that I don't think that Ryan Delaney's call here was incorrect; it appears to me that zen-master is being disruptive and therefore the ban is validly imposed. That said, Ryan Delaney should, as should all admins, refrain from exercising administrative authority in any dispute in which he is a participant. There are hundreds of administrators on Wikipedia; administrators who get involved in editorial disputes should ask a noninvolved admin to intercede. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 16:25, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Kelly and Ryan's argument doesn't make much sense to me. Ryan admits he disagreed with my "radical" intro change of "scores" to "results" which is ok to disagree, but when an article is fundamentally disputed the {npov} template is added to it. This is basic NPOV policy, if an in good faith dispute exists a simple template is added to an article to signify this fact. Feel free to disagree with my interpretation as always but please don't deny the existence of controversy. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 17:38, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Would it be correct to state that if Ryan thought zen master was being disruptive, he could either, a) become involved simply by reverting the disruptive edits, and ask another admin to ban him, or b) stay uninvolved by leaving the edits as is, place the ban himself, and ask another admin to revert the edits? Mind you, I'm not making a judgment call here, I'm just curious to know if reverting a disruptive edit automatically makes one involved.

<dd>You have to actually establish how any edits of mine were "disruptive", my most recent 4 edits in question consisted of 1 edit reverted by Ryan where I rewrote the intro to remove the loaded word "score" to change it to "results", then three edits reverted by Ryan and others where I tried to add {totallydisputed} or {npov} to the article. So this is a situation where an admin is trying to deny the existence of controversy. Aren't {npov} headers added to an article when an in good faith dispute exists? For an admin to deny the existence of criticism and controversy strikes me as censorship, make no mistake: the <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_and_intelligence.html" title="Race and intelligence">race and intelligence</a> article is fundamentally disputed yet Ryan and others systematically deny wikipedia NPOV policy. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 19:13, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Honestly, I am not upset or trying to be defensive, but I really want to understand this but can't. I am not involved in any content disputes with him. My involvement in the article is strictly administrational. I would really like to understand what people are saying here and make it a "learning experience" and so on, but I just don't see how I did anything wrong. Let me try to break this down so we can find the source of the disagreement:</p>
<ul>
<li>I cannot comprehend how it is that it could be okay for me to ban him from the article for disruptive editing, but NOT okay to revert the edits I banned him for.</li>
<li>That would mean that the people claiming I was "involved" in the dispute think that I should have banned him from the article, but left the disruptive edits in the article.</li>
<li>Instead, I reverted the disruptive edits and offered to explain to him that I was reverting because his editing was disruptive. I warned him that I would have to ban him from the article if he kept it up. I regret using admin rollback for my reverts; it should have been in the edit summaries that I was reverting because I thought the edits were disruptive.</li>
<li>He did not heed my warnings, and continued implementing his edits despite them. Hence the ban.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>As I see it, if I am "involved" in this dispute, then I am just as involved as any admin who could ever ban him under any possible circumstances.</b></p>
<p>Some questions, given that no one but Zen-master is disputing that the edits were disruptive:</p>
<ol>
<li>Would it have been better if I had left the disruptive edits in the article, and simply banned him, to avoid the appearance of "involvement"?</li>
<li>What specifically did I do that made me "involved" and hence inappropriate to apply a ban?
<ul>
<li>If the answer is "reverted Zen-master", then you would have to answer "Yes" to the first question. This is a sticking point for me.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What purpose would be served in asking another admin to apply the ban, given that any other admin has made the same number of content edits that I have, but has not been following the dispute as closely or for as long?</li>
</ol>
<p>I appreciate most of your patience in discussing this. I have a strong feeling that there may have been a miscommunication somewhere about my level of involvement in this article, and I hope to get it cleared up. --<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_Delaney_f359.html" title="User:Ryan Delaney">Ryan Delaney</a> <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyan_Delaney_8333.html" title="User talk:Ryan Delaney"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 20:01, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'd like to formally dispute my ban from <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_and_intelligence.html" title="Race and intelligence">race and intelligence</a>, under what criteria was I "disruptive"? It is standard wikipedia neutral point of view policy that the {npov} template is added when an article (and area of research) are fundamentally disputed on numerous points. Denying the existence of controversy when an in good faith dispute exists is exponentially more "disruptive" and strikes me as censorship. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 22:15, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>No, Radiant!, in this case this is the place. Ryan Delaney instituted the article specific ban on this noticeboard, not the arbcom. The arbcom just gave us the ability to ban him from it. Though the ban has been backed up by several people, including myself. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedwolf24_a12e.html" title="User:Redwolf24"><font color="darkblue">R</font></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedwolf24_a12e.html" title="User:Redwolf24"><font color="darkblue">dwolf24</font></a> (<a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedwolf24_1e7b.html" title="User talk:Redwolf24">talk</a>) <a href="../../../m/e/e/Wikipedia%7EMeetup_Seattle3_b4f5.html" title="Wikipedia:Meetup/Seattle3"><font color="gray">Attention Washingtonians!</font></a> 23:25, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>It is intended that defining disruption and deciding when there should be a ban is up to any administrator who is on top of the situation. An appeal to Jimmy Wales would be an appeal of the decision allowing a ban, not of a specific instance of imposing it. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> 23:28, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Okay, I wrote that a bit too hastily, but according to Zen's RFAR, he may be banned if <i>"in the opinion of any administrator his editing is disruptive"</i>. He asks, "under what criteria was I disruptive", and the answer is that the opinion of an administrator is the criterion. Whether other users agree is irrelevant; according to the RFAR, any admin's opinion suffices. Hence the ban was appropriate and cannot be appealed here, without appealing the outcome of his arbitration. Seems to me it's a pretty clear-cut case. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 23:46, 19 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So you are saying that any reason, including admin malice, is proper according to the "RFAR"? Surely implicit in "opinion" is that the opinion be reasoned. That doesn't mean that everyone has to agree, only that the opinion be a reasoned one. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirror_Vax_6652.html" title="User:Mirror Vax">Mirror Vax</a> 00:17, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>As with any other administrator action, it can be overturned by other administrators. If I were to declare him banned from an article he has never even edited, I have faith that other admins would point this out and veto my ban. Zen is trying to get this to happen here. That said, I believe the ban should stand. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Phil Sandifer</a> 23:55, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't think so. And how will an administrator determine whether certain behaviour is disruptive? I believe that this could be controversial and/or open to misuse. Limits need to be set. Of course administrators would probably disagree as that would limit the influence of their <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrator_f252.html#Administrator_abuse" title="Wikipedia:Administrator">discretion</a>. However, zen's question has not been answered; he asked under what criteria <b>was</b> he disruptive. Not what will be judged disruptive. <i><b>Rex</b></i><sup>(talk)</sup><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Albania.svg_0582.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/3/36/Flag_of_Albania.svg/25px-Flag_of_Albania.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="17" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Albania.svg_0582.html" /></a> 23:56, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Maybe I missed it, but I don't recall the admin ever giving an opinion as to why zen's tagging was disruptive. Surely we don't want to say that any reason at all, including malice, is a proper reason? I don't think</p>

Kevin replaced several broken links in the "Third party candidates" section. He also replaces this unsourced text, which appears to be fabricated: 'Numerous Republican members of Congress called ... the objectors "loonies"'. When asked to cite his source for the "loonies" comment, Kevin refused.</p>
<p>He also seems to be pretending that his edits aren't reverts. Both edits almost exactly duplicate the content of Kevin's edit from November 18, 2005: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2004_U.S._presidential_election_controversy_and_irregularities&amp;oldid=28683786" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2004_U.S._presidential_election_controversy_and_irregularities&amp;oldid=28683786" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>. However these are the deceptive edit summaries he used: "added some info, more direct sources, fixed some wording" and "work towards compromise, keep positive changes, revert loss of info or changes from fact to misleading statements."</p>
<p>I would like it if someone blocked him for repeatedly adding copyrighted text to articles and for using misleading edit summaries. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 23:39, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. How do I report a user who keeps on adding material about a person and this person's book on various pages? He never adds HTML links, so I can't call it link-spamming. He has never contributed anything else. I suspect this user and this book author is the same person. Also, what warning can I give?

<dd>Well, it *was* a line of BS.

I called bullshit.

<dd>I tend to agree, and I find the self-defense bits equally worrying. For instance, I don't like the use of the word bullshit above, not because I care about foul language (I don't) but because I care about <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> and <a href="../../../a/f/g/WP%7EAFG_0e2c.html" title="WP:AFG">WP:AFG</a>. It's not really that admins need to be diplomats, but they need to be considered in their approachs to other users. But it's easier to imply that your critics are censors whose time and energy is clearly less valuable that your own than to actually stop and consider what they have to say and consider if there is anything in your behaviour that would benefit from moderating. <a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFiliocht_c3e2.html" title="User:Filiocht">Filiocht</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/l/User_talk%7EFiliocht_11a7.html" title="User talk:Filiocht">The kettle's on</a> 09:04, 18 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Yet another example of the <b>misuse</b> of the "assume good faith" policy. AGF does not require that one continue to continue to assume good faith when there is clear evidence of bad faith; I am tired of people insisting that it does. This editor's actions were clearly in bad faith; he concocted an elaborate and disruptive ruse to cover for his own ill-considered actions. AGF does not require us to stupidly ignore that or pretend that it did not happen. As to the use of CheckUser: if his account had been taken over, as he alleges, then the alleged edit would have originated from an IP different than his usual addresses; this was not the case. I used CheckUser to investigate an alleged security breach and found no evidence to support the allegation. I disagree that patience is called for in this situation. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 12:19, 18 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Being civil with users you respect is so easy as to be, in a sense, trivial. Being civil with those you do not respect is more difficult, but much more important. There are a number of reasons for this. One is that you might just be wrong. Another is that if you are right, it is important not to replicate disruptive behaviour in the name of dealing with it. A building in which the janitors are routinely rude and abrasive will soon become impossible for the rest of the workforce. <a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFiliocht_c3e2.html" title="User:Filiocht">Filiocht</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/l/User_talk%7EFiliocht_11a7.html" title="User talk:Filiocht">The kettle's on</a> 13:32, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In my opinion there are times where a firm hand is necessary. Some people need to be yelled at. This case involved a deliberate attempt at deception. The RfC that <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">Android79</a> linked to illustrates that this editor has a history of deceptive of this sort, which makes my yelling at him all that more justified. Furthermore, I'm quite tired of speculation as to whether random editors are autistic. If there's an admission by Superdude115 et al. that he's autistic, I haven't seen it (it's not in the linked RFC), and it is high hubris, not to mention extremely rude, for lay people to attempt to diagnose mental illness through the Internet. In any case, autism is no excuse for deception.

<dd><i>If there's an admission by Superdude115 et al. that he's autistic, I haven't seen it</i> – It's on the RfC's talk page under "IMPORTANT development". SuperDude was roundly criticized for sockpuppetry and more-or-less apologized for it. I would not expect him to attempt such deceptive behavior again, which is why I think assumptions of bad faith are unfounded.</dd>
<dd>No attempt was made to diagnose anything. Indeed, that's why I wrote up the RfC in the first place, rather than "accusing" SuperDude of autism, which would have indeed been rude and rather stupid. I'm not a psychiatrist and anyone who <i>is</i> ought not to be making remote diagnoses such as this. I agree that autism is no excuse for disruptive behavior, and I don't think you were making personal attacks, but <i>this was not a deliberate attempt at deception</i>, AFAICT.</dd>
<dd>Of course, there's no way for Kelly to immediately know and understand SuperDude's past history. We can't fault her for that.

<p>The thing that's bothering me here Kelly is that you do not seem to understand the difference between a strong reprimand and an uncivil one. It's one thing to say to a user: "evidence has demonstrated that your account and this account are from the same IP's, which is strong evidence that you are engaging in sockpuppetry, which is a violation of Wikipedia policy. " and something like "what is this shit you are pulling?". You seem to be confusing content with tone. If you spent a lot of time investigating a user which turned out to be a sock, by all means, feel free to state that, but state it calmly and rationally, and not using fierce invective. If the evidence is clear a user is making innapropriate edits, then say the user is making innapropriate edits, but don't cuss them out. There's a way to indicate displeasure and objection to another user's actions without resorting to incivility, and it is extremely important for you to understand that and employ that, as an Administrator and Arbitrator. Your statement <i>"You wanted a diplomat, you hired the wrong BOFH. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 04:13, 18 November 2005 (UTC)"</i> is particularly disturbing to me, considering the meaning of <a href="../../../b/o/f/BOFH_455a.html" title="BOFH">BOFH</a>, which I just had to look up to even understand.

I sometimes wonder why he even bothered. <i><b>Rex</b></i><sup>(talk)</sup><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Albania.svg_0582.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/3/36/Flag_of_Albania.svg/25px-Flag_of_Albania.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="17" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Albania.svg_0582.html" /></a> 23:26, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>KJelly martin I think you should apologize for being so uncivil with all the profanity. it is entirely unbecoming of an adminsitortaor on here and even a member of Arb Committeee. If yuou do not apologize I am serioulsly thinking about doing a Rrequest for comment on this "D.S." and also having you removed from the Arobitratino Com.

<li>Based on my extensive experience with SuperDude, I have every reason to believe that he really is autistic and admitted to being so. He has settles down and has become a valued member of the community. His learning curve may be a bit different than what we may expect, but he eventually comes around. I have learned to assume good faith with him and I'm somewhat flattered that he'd name a sockpuppet after me. &#160;:) That having been said, we may in fact be blowing this out of proportion. As for Kelly Martin's reaction, it's the reaction of someone who cares about the project. While we should try and be civil at all times, there are other times when the gloves have to come off. We all spend a great deal of time and effort improving this site. When someone dumps in the nest, as it were, some firmness tempered with civility may well be called for. - Lucky 6.9 05:01, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Jason Gastrich does indeed have several socks he's using; I won't confirm whether Duncharris' list is complete or accurate, however, because I don't see enough evidence of disruption at this time to justify any action.

<dd>"Uncle Davey" is a sycophant of Gastrich's that follows him around various forums on the Internet to do exactly what he did here, back Gastrich up. I see Gastrich also drug John Wolf into this one. And "Vera Six," a long suspected Usenet sock puppet of "Uncle Davey" made an appearance or two (they're at least friends if not the same person). Not to mention, if you go through the edits that were pro-Gastrich, you'll find several IPs that appear solely for the purpose of backing him up and at least one that came through an open proxy (on what appeared to be an exploited machine no less). Gastrich does have a small mailing list, most of the identifiable people who showed up to comment on his page are identifiable as "the usual suspects" if you've been around him a while.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It'd be interesting for someone to compare the IPs he's coming in on. Particularly with his "Big Daddy" sock with which he went to some lengths to refer to himself in third person. Since proxies (a favorite tactic of his, he went after a site I was hosting with one) are largely blocked here, his IP choices are more limited.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In any case, your Wikipedia is under assault from a spammer. He's done this to other sites. And given the attention the Wikipedia is getting these days, he'll be trying just about everything to wedge his links in. It's a fun ride. One many of us on the 'Net have been through. Especially when he doesn't get his way. And only his way, no compromise is acceptable. You'll all be accused of hating him because of Jesus (you devils you!).</dd>

<p>While having no idea who's in the right, or the wrong, note that Piotrus unblocked Molobo a total of 4 separate times, removing blocks by 2 different admins. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> <a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315">(talk)</a> 00:50, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The original block appears to have been in error, since administrators do not have the privilege of blocking editors with whom they are personally in conflict. I think this is getting to be a repeating theme of recent: All administrators really do need to keep in mind that their access is for specific and limited purposes only. It isn't to allow them to seize control of articles. It isn't even to settle disputes by fiat -- even though it might seem like a good idea at the time, administrative fiat is not part of dispute resolution here.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>An administrator who gets into a dispute with another editor and then misuses administrator powers to "settle" that dispute thereby <i>cedes</i> the moral and intellectual high ground, by choosing to stifle the discussion rather than seek consensus. We need to recognize that. Whenever an administrator blocks someone they're in conflict with, or reverts and protects an article that they've been edit-warring on, that action is <i>in itself</i> an admission of being wrong. It's saying, "I can't argue the point or get others to agree with me, so I'm going to stop you from speaking."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And that's unacceptable conduct for <i>any</i> Wikipedia editor.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Come on, people. It's not hard, when you get into a conflict with someone whom you think is breaking the rules, to call for an outside opinion. Rather than reaching for the block button when you get fed up with someone, bring others in to take a less-biased look at the situation. If someone you're arguing with violates 3RR, that'll be clear to anyone else who looks at the situation: you <i>don't</i> need to break the rules yourself by blocking someone you're in conflict with. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 03:48, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Most accusations of "involvement" on the part of the administrator are frivolous. It's often the only way the party that didn't get their way can dispute the decision. Frequently, and I'm not just talking about myself here, an admin will get accused of involvement merely on the basis that he or she performed an administrative action at all -- because "if you weren't taking sides with the evildoers, why would you act againtst my clearly correct position"? That said, admin revert wars are <i>very</i> bad for the Wiki and should not be engaged in under any circumstances. --<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_Delaney_f359.html" title="User:Ryan Delaney">Ryan Delaney</a> <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyan_Delaney_8333.html" title="User talk:Ryan Delaney"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 19:37, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I find just silently reverting each other's [un]blocks without entering a discussion is rather undignified for both sides. With "both sides" I mean Piotrus and Wiglaf. Molobo is clearly a nationalist troll. I find it very disconcerting that we have an admin going around, reverting blocks of other admins (Chris 73, Wiglaf), apparently because he is in league with the user in a content dispute. While the 'disruption' block may have been arguable, Piotrus' revert of Wiglaf's 3RRvio block is highly questionable. We should strongly encourage both parties to bring matters regarding Molobo to the attention of uninvolved admins in the future. Warring admins are poison for the community. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 13:17, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As FOo mentioned, my unblocking was due to the fact that I think Wiglaf (supported by admins Shauri and Nightbeast) abused his admin powers by 1) violating the <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">Blocking Policy</a> (<i>Use of blocks to gain advantage in a content dispute</i>) in blocking Molobo (not for the first time) as they were involved in the content dispute (not a naming dispute!) with him, and 2) not stating any reasons for their block on his user page (at least not until I asked him to explain his actions). Btw, is there a clear rule that a user should be notified with reasons for his block? I thought that it was but cannot find it today&#160;:/</dd>
<dd>In addition, the sides involve admins on one side and non-admins on the other (at least until I stepped in, which I do very rarely, since I don't like to get involved in nationality-based disputed, as most of involved parties should know), so this presents additonal problem. The first case I used my admin powers to unblock Molobo, about half month ago, involved the <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_4th_Panzer_Division_ace0.html#War_Crimes" title="German 4th Panzer Division">German_4th_Panzer_Division#War_Crimes</a> section in this article and after lenghty discussion Wiglaf and his side conceded that Molobo was right (or at least stopped reverting his additions, allowing the section to remain in the article, which I think is the same as admiting he was right). The block reason Wilglaf used in that case was listed as 'disruption of Wikipedia', a reason described on our Blocking Policy as controversial, and Wiglaf failed to present evidence of Molobo's disruption other then Molobo disagreeing with their side. See <a href="../../../w/i/g/User_talk%7EWiglaf_archive_7_ed26.html#Abuse_of_blocking_rights" title="User talk:Wiglaf archive 7">User_talk:Wiglaf_archive_7#Abuse_of_blocking_rights</a>, <a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html#Blocking" title="User talk:Piotrus">User_talk:Piotrus#Blocking</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/r/Talk%7EGerman_4th_Panzer_Division_7b4b.html" title="Talk:German 4th Panzer Division">Talk:German 4th Panzer Division</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/g/User_talk%7EWiglaf_6cbc.html#German_4th_Panzer_Division" title="User talk:Wiglaf">User_talk:Wiglaf#German_4th_Panzer_Division</a> for more information on this case.</dd>
<dd>In the last unblocking I admit I didn't look sufficiently at Molobo's edit history and I assumed the block was related to the <a href="../../../k/u/l/Kulturkampf.html" title="Kulturkampf">Kulturkampf</a> content edit war that those parties are involved again (note I did not unblock Space Cadet, who is a common and clear case of revert warrior). See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kulturkampf&amp;diff=28449239&amp;oldid=28440250," class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kulturkampf&amp;diff=28449239&amp;oldid=28440250," rel="nofollow">where again references provided by Molobo are targeted</a> and note that Molobo seems to use talk pages extensively, unlike many of his opponents (<a href="../../../k/u/l/Talk%7EKulturkampf_17de.html" title="Talk:Kulturkampf">Talk:Kulturkampf</a>). However, after studing the history of this recent conflict (block war) I see that it relates to Molobo <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AZygmunt_Bauman&amp;diff=28331565&amp;oldid=28317426" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AZygmunt_Bauman&amp;diff=28331565&amp;oldid=28317426" rel="nofollow">removal of comments</a> at <a href="../../../z/y/g/Talk%7EZygmunt_Bauman_3f29.html" title="Talk:Zygmunt Bauman">Talk:Zygmunt Bauman</a>, which indeed means Molobo acted both in a clearly disruptive way and broke the 3RR rule, and that Wilglaf was right in blocking him this time. This might have been avoided if Wilgaf posted info why he blocked Molobo on his user page. I still think that if an admin is involved with a user in dispute A, and dispute B, and the user breaks a 3RR rule on B, but makes good case for A, that the admin should ask somebody else to enforce the block (conflict of interests here). This said, I apologise here to Wilgaf for accusing him of abuse of admin rights, which - this time - was not the case (I thought Molobo was blocked for edits on Kulturkampf).</dd>
<dd>I have advocated to both parties and will repeat it here that since they cannot reach an agreement and their conflicts are repeated again and again, that they should use RfC or even RfA. So far my advice seem to be ignored and various revert wars continue - please consider it now. --<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font color="green">Talk</font></a></sup> 16:32, 16 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>"Molobo seems to use talk pages extensively, unlike many of his opponents." One thing needs pointing out: he uses talk pages to badger, to argue and for the purpose of emotional pleading. His participation here is one of constant friction with dozens of editors (check his talk). His four reverts were repeatedly calling a talk post a personal attack, which is a favourite tactic of his. The other I always like is when he calls you a bigot or xenophobe for no reason. The user is a troll and I can only assume he's avoided an RFC or RFArb to this point because people are so tired of dealing with him.

<p>The way I see it, there are no reasonable grounds for blocking <a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a>, or if there are, <a href="../../../w/i/g/User%7EWiglaf_0500.html" title="User:Wiglaf">Wiglaf</a> is concealing them very well. I can't find any policy which Molobo has violated (I may be wrong of course). Therefore, the block must have been based upon "administrative discretion", which is all very well <b>if a good reason for the block is found</b>. So far, Wiglaf has not even attempted to justify it (as far as I can see). Does anyone know if Wiglaf has been at odds with Molobo, because if he has, then I'd presume <b>admin abuse</b>. If there isn't, but Wiglaf still can't produce a valid reason for blocking Molobo, then I'd presume <b>incompetence</b> and <b>seriously flawed judgement</b>.

<p>If you disagree with someone's block, the proper way to deal with that is <i>not</i> to instantly unblock, but to bring it to the community's attention. <i>Talk</i> to the admin, come here, file an RFC, but certainly don't unblock when you yourself are involved, that's just as bad. And not <i>four</i> times. I still fail to see how you can have unblockede first without full investigation (there was a valid 3RR filed). I think whether or not Molobo is a good person is tangential to the issue. Repeated unblocks when involved, without bringing it to the community's attention, and without full investigation are <i>always</i> wrong. Blocking people you are personally involved with, without asking another admin's aid or bringing it to the community's attention first is <i>always</i> wrong. Nothing Piotrus has said explains away those facts, nor will anything the other admins involved say.

<dd>I was just about to add something different to BP, and it's how I'd respond to Piotrus here. You said "where to post the info." I'm afraid to me that's entirely the wong mindset. You should bring the disputed block to the community's attention <i>beforehand</i>, and in almost all cases, only unblock with the consent of other administrators. We have to remember these are <i>admins</i> we are talking about. That's not to say they are always virtuous, but we give them discretion with blocking and a little button to use all by themselves for a reason. If you think they did something wrong, you better be prepared to ask around first, present evidence, and even follow through with an RFC or whatever is called for. Administrative abuse is not to be taken lightly, but also not to be concluded so easily, from a trusted member of our community, to (nearly) ever warrant a unilateral unblock without discussion beforehand. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 22:34, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

At the same time, "emotional" seems to be your favorite invective against the many editors you have alienated so far. But even if you were right in all of the disputes you have been involved in, the fact remains that we are discussing a clear 3RR violation here. Also, the case in question had *nothing* to do with German war crimes. You reverted another user's longish reply to your question on the dubious account of a "personal attack". He restored, asked you not to do this, you deleted the entire statement again. Another user restored, you reverted 4 times, always repeating the "personal attack" accusation. This *may* be slander, it almost certainly is bad manners, and it is a 3RR violation without any doubt. No lamenting about WP's pro-German bias can change this. Your sentence "I am always ready to discuss my edits on talk pages" sounds great but at least in the present case you were *not* ready to discuss: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Molobo&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=28340267" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Molobo&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=28340267" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>. 80.145.37.35 22:28, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I must say (from my possibly ill-informed point of view), that Wiglaf seems to be spending too much time making accusations and not producing enough evidence. According to the famous (some would say infamous) <a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~kate/cgi-bin/count_edits" class="external text" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~kate/cgi-bin/count_edits" rel="nofollow">Kate's tool</a> Molobo has made c. 765 edits to articles and c. 819 edits to talk pages (both article and user). By selecting a random talk page and a random edit, you can see that Molobo is clearly <b>not</b> trolling like Wiglaf has suggested. Wiglaf has been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADbachmann&amp;diff=28586133&amp;oldid=28583046" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADbachmann&amp;diff=28586133&amp;oldid=28583046" rel="nofollow">calling</a> for Molobo to be banned and has made a personal attack against Molobo and some other Polish users. Quote: <i>Unfortunately he receives support from some Polish users who appear to use him like a kind of pet troll</i>. My first message to Wiglaf would be <b><a href="../../../w/o/r/Wikipedia%7EWords_of_wisdom_e960.html" title="Wikipedia:Words of wisdom">There is no cabal</a></b>, and I would suggest caution before making a RFAr. Arbitration is another of those <i>discretionary</i> processes, where whoever makes the best impression "wins". The old equitable maxim that used to guide the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Court_of_Chancery_0ef5.html" title="Court of Chancery">Court of Chancery</a> was: <i>he who comes to <a href="../../../e/q/u/Equity.html" title="Equity">equity</a> must come with clean hands</i>. As far as I can see, there are serious allegations of Wiglaf blocking Molobo for no apparent reason. The Arb. case, if accepted may reach an unfavourable conclusion from your point of view as well. If they take the view that you have abused your administrative privileges, you may even be "<a href="../../../d/e/f/Defrocked.html" title="Defrocked">defrocked</a>". IMHO, Arbitration should be put off for as long as possible, make a RFC against him if you must. What I want to know is: do you have any evidence over your claims about Molobo and did you have a good reason every time you blocked him (which I think should have been left to another admin)?

<dd>I'm afraid I do not have the time to "look into" extended trolling over months and dozens of articles just like that.

I am concerned enough by the reaction of Wiglaf and others to the user to be prepared to give it some attention: both Wiglaf and Ghirlandajo are very good and respected users, but apart from that they hardly form a tag team. If they agree that a user is an "odious troll", I am inclined to take that seriously. But I'd really need one of the involved parties to collect evidence. Since the problem doesn't seem to go away by itself, now would be a good time to start a clean RFC. I realize this is what Rex just said: I tend to skip his comments, because I consider him a troll (and as opposed to Molobo, I do have some previous experience with Rex). So fwiiw, I am prepared to believe Molobo is a serious problem user, but I really cannot wade through his history myself. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 08:19, 18 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Hello. I'm not an admin here (I just play one on TV:) but Piotrus and Wiglaf have asked me, as someone with a knowledge of English and internet access, my opinion on this dispute. So for what it's worth (inserts 5 cents): Both acted according to what they felt was fair (in the case of Piotrus) and right (in the case of Wiglaf) in their role as admins. Both were mistaken. Both have admitted to and apologized for their mistakes and called in other parties to help resolve this dispute. In this they have both acted properly and honorably. Now all that is left for them to do is to shake hands, like the true gentlemen, scholars and great Wikipedians they both are, and let this dispute pass. Next, we need to decide what needs to be done about Molobo.</dd>

<dd>Rex, I have yet to see anything useful contributed by you. I am not obliged to read what I consider trolling, and I am entitled to have varying amounts of respect for different editors. As RDH says, you are not helping matters one little bit, and this isn't even about you, and the Molobo case would be difficult enough without your little asides. I realize you can edit wikipedia just because you have internet access and could find the edit button, so what? You will earn respect by doing work, not by spreading rants wherever you go.</dd>
<dd>The way we have to go now is to address the Molobo case. He has clearly stirred up tempers more than enough to warrant an RfC. This RfC will probably be a nightmare, but it will be the only way to get this case in the open, and thus assessable by people not directly involved. I encourage involved editors, therefore, to open an RfC page on Molobo, detailing as succinctly as they can the history of Molobo's interactions on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 10:41, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If you had taken the time to read what I had actually written, you would notice that I was discouraging a RFAr in favour of a RFC on the basis that Wiglaf <i>may</i> be not that clean himself and their decision may not be what he expected. I am not calling for him to be defrocked or anything, I have emphasised the fact that I may not know everything and I am describing things as they appear to me superficially. There is a little thing called <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, which I try to abide with, especially considering that I do not know Wiglaf or Molobo. An interesting issue it that your baseless accusations of trolling are in fact personal attacks and you are assuming bad faith. In my post above (which you interpreted as trolling), I am advising against RFAr, which is what Wiglaf proposed on Dbachmann's user talk page. Molobo contacted me about it and I left a post here saying that it may be better to make a RFC as arbitration might be displeased with Wiglaf IF it emerged that he has been abusing admin privileges (they result may be defrocking). As for Molobo, evidence please? This could all be a fairy tale, I cannot find incidents of trolling ANYWHERE in his contributions. You are <a href="../../../a/s/g/WP%7EASG_a382.html" title="WP:ASG">assuming bad faith</a> and should stop it. <a href="../../../t/r/o/Wikipedia%7ETroll_d575.html" title="Wikipedia:Troll">Wikipedia:Trolling</a> is a deliberate attempt to disrupt Wikipedia.

<p>Molobo was also blocked by me some time ago twice for disrupting wikipedia. There is a long standing dispute related to the naming of Gdansk, for which i started a major vote regarding the naming of related places <a href="../../../g/d/a/Talk%7EGdansk_Vote_6c4c.html" title="Talk:Gdansk/Vote">Talk:Gdansk/Vote</a>. The outcome was a large majority for double naming. Molobo disputes this vote on technicalities (i.e. anon votes must be counted because there is no rule that says otherwise), and has been removing double naming in literally hundreds of instances. After repeated warnings i finally decided to block him for going against consensus and disrupting wikipedia. While block for disruptions are controversial, I think a more than 70% majority is a pretty strong argument, and ignoring such a majority quickly leads to anarchy. (On other instances, such a block has been confirmed by another admin). Piotrus unblocked him under the mistaken assumption that disruption blocks are not a policy. To my disappointment Piotrus did not leave me a message on my talk page about the unblock. Nevertheless i respect Piotrus and occasionally ask him for feedback by mail. I still strongly believe my blocks were valid. Other than enforcing the vote I have no interest to edit articles related to Poland and its history.<br />
Molobo is in my opinion not a troll, I think he believes he is making a valuable contribution to Wikipedia. However, I find him to be highly POV and consensus-resistant. He has upset a large number of other users and admins, and is frequently involved in revert wars. He also often misrepresents and distorts facts related to Wikipedia policy. Regarding <i>users should not block those with whom they are currently engaged in an article editing conflict</i>, i am only enforcing the Gdansk vote, and otherwise have not reverted or blocked Molobo, even though I am suspicious of many of his edits and have been asked by others to block him. Recently, he has followed the double naming vote, and there was no need for me to interact.

In some cases have been trying to give neutral names(for example latin versions) to avoid POVs.You blocked me during one such attempt, and as I recall it didn't touch the double naming issue as it was latin name not Polish or German.Also as I pointed out the Gdansk vote is flawed as currently it gives possibilty to name all locations in Poland with German versions(just one of the flaws). I do believe that it should be only applied in clear historical contexts(and Olessi-a German contributor whom I do respect shared that opinion<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Chris_73#Please_stop_from_editing_Pokoj_Torunski_until_the_naming_dispute_is_over" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Chris_73#Please_stop_from_editing_Pokoj_Torunski_until_the_naming_dispute_is_over" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>) However I decided to disengage from edititng those articles until a correction to the vote will be made(and you know that other admins and contributors are pointing out that it is flawed in its formulation in certain aspects).</p>

<p>Molobo is an explosive mixture of unshakeable conviction of knowing The Truth (TM), stoic disregard for anything in his way, and an extreme sensitivity of anything that may be interpreted as criticism of his person, or his views about the sanctity of the Polish nation. Imho, he has a fundamental incompatibility for everything related to wikiquette or npov policy. But that doesn't make him a troll, it just makes him a very difficult editor, and, empirically, a liability to the community. There will be nothing but to tread the course of Dispute resolution. The reason this hasn't happened yet is that every involved editor appears to abhor the prospect of trudging through an rfc with Molobo, and hopes that others will take that upon themselves. The problem is not likely to go away, but it is nothing WP cannot deal with. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 12:56, 22 November 2005 (UTC) ' Molobo is an explosive mixture of unshakeable conviction of knowing The Truth (TM), stoic disregard for anything in his way' Why such harsh words Dab ? I contacted you on your talk page asking for issues you believe need correcting, and edits that are wrong. Please I would like to see your responce. Right now I think your accusation is a bit hard, since I am ready to discuss any problems with any edit. However you didn't point any of my edits that you believe are wrong.As I said-if you believe one to be inaccurat I would be more then happy to serve with resources, references, books if needed. <i>or his views about the sanctity of the Polish nation</i>What made you say that ? I do not believe in sanctity of Polish nations, as it had many flaws-and I am not even a full Pole in the first place, with many of my ancestors of different ethnic background. 'The problem is not likely to go away, but it is nothing WP cannot deal with.' Please Dbachmann I asked you already to contact me on any edits, articles you believe are incorrect-if you could show them I would gladly work together with you on solution to a problem you see.But again I ask you to show me what do you have in mind, since right now I don't now what article or edit you are talking about.Thank you and have good day. --<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 22:47, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I feel that this was an incorrect admin action, please someone unprotect and remove the redirect. This article went through the AfD process and received 26 votes to keep, 22 votes to redirect, and 8 votes to delete. The closing admin closed it as a <i>Keep</i>. During subsequent talkpage discussions some revert warring took place between leaving the article and changing it to redirect. The article was in its full, non-redirect form when an admin reverted to the redirect and protected the page, saying in his edit summary "There was a clear consensus to redirect". I respect and appreciate that the admin felt strongly that the arguments for redirect were strong; indeed, the admin had voted for redirect himself. However, I don't think a "clear consensus for redirect" can be said to exist if the closing admin ruled to keep the article. So, unless I am missing something, I would much appreciate it if the protection is lifted.

<p>I was approached about an edit war resulting from the recreation of <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a> after it had been made redirect following consensus on the Talk page (not the AfD, though the participants had also misunderstood that, and were appealing to an incorrect set of voting figures; <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> (<a href="../../../b/a/b/User_talk%7EBabajobu_72fe.html" title="User talk:Babajobu">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Babajobu_f568.html" title="Special:Contributions/Babajobu">contribs</a>) is still doing it, I see. the correct breakdown is: <b>Delete: 8, redirect (or delete): 23, keep: 22, sock-puppets, vague, etc.: 6</b>; see <a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_Afd-Islamofascism_69f6.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis/Afd-Islamofascism">User talk:Mel Etitis/Afd-Islamofascism</a>). I explained more than once that I wasn't referring to consensus at the AfD but at the Talk page, but as the AfD seemed to support their position they've continued to ignore me. I think that that intellectual dishonesty says a lot about the sort of debate we have here.</p>
<p>I thought that two things needed doing: first, the earlier consensus should be followed until it was determined whether a new consensus justified reversing it; secondly, the article needed protecting in order to try to cool off the edit war and get people talking sensibly (and perhaps finding a new consensus). Unfortunately the result was the arrival of <a href="../../../k/l/o/User%7EKlonimus_90cc.html" title="User:Klonimus">Klonimus</a> (<a href="../../../k/l/o/User_talk%7EKlonimus_1b78.html" title="User talk:Klonimus">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Klonimus_3c5d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Klonimus">contribs</a>), with the inevitable hysterics, propaganda, and rehashing of old battles.</p>
<p>I should say that I think that the article is a steaming pile of racist... er, nonsense, but that that's not the issue; if Wikipedia consensus is to reverse the earlier decision to make it a redirect, then OK, but until then we don't normally think that such a consensus be overturnable by just one editor with a different idea, even when subsequently supported by trolls who were active in arguing against the former consensus.</p>
<p>I should stress that I have no quarrel with <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a>, who acted properly according to his understanding of the situation.

<dd>BYT, I don't think that's really the case. No one begrudges you or any other editor (of any religion) the right to have a position or argue a point on this issue. The biggest source of contention recently has not been anything intrinsic to the topic, but rather frustration at what seemed to some of us as the invoking of a nonexistent consensus in order to freeze the page as a redirect. That's not about partisanship, and there's no reason anyone should resent you for it. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 13:22, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I share BYT's general impression of "naked partisanship". whatever happened to "writing for the enemy"? The happenings on Islam-related articles over the past months are most unwikilike, and are poison to the community. "good faith" has gone down the drain.

<dd>"I explained more than once that I wasn't referring to consensus at the AfD but at the Talk page". The talk page is littered with my requests that you explain where "a clear consensus to redirect" was formed. The only response I received were AfD figures slightly revised from those used by the closing admin. Not once did Mel explain that this consensus was formed in a talkpage discussion rather than in the AfD. Had I and the other keep voters been pointed toward that discussion, this process mightn't have been necessary. I'm happy, however, that you are now engaging the issue a bit. Can you please provide a link to the talkpage discussion where a consensus to redirect was formed? Is it on the AfD talkpage? An archived discussion in the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a> or <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neofascism_and_religion.html" title="Neofascism and religion">Neofascism and religion</a> talk page?

<dd>Assuming that the numbers reported in the above discussion are accurate, I cannot see how anybody can claim that there is any consensus at all with respect to this article. Even, or nearly even, splits in opinion, as seen above, are indicative of a lack of consensus. Consensus cannot exist when there is substantial dissent and it appears that there is, in fact, substantial dissent here. You don't have consensus here to do anything; continue talking until you reach a compromise solution. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 12:23, 22 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Kelly, just like to point out that I never once claimed that a consensus existed. Mel invoked a "clear consensus to redirect" as justification for changing to redirect and protecting the page.

<dd>There are several points I would like to make here: firstly, categorising Babajou as intellectual dishonest is an unfortunate thing to do, as I feel that this is grossly unfair. I can see several reasons (as pointed out to me by Babajou) why this article should not be redirected. I have read the talk page, and can see that discussion was still progressing. I think that the best point made was by SlimVirgin: "the reason editors are wary of having an Islamofascism page is that the opposing "ideological group," as you put it, will use it as an excuse to attack Islam. I'm fairly certain that, if everyone could be assured that the article would be encyclopedic, and would discuss the origins and use of the term in an intelligent way with good references, then no one would oppose it." I see absolutely no reason why we can't in fact do this. Babajou has pointed out to me that this article is currently quite large and may not fit entirely into an umbrella article on <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neofascism_and_religion.html" title="Neofascism and religion">Neofascism and religion</a>. That some folks are using the term in undeniable: I would, personally, would like the opportunity to read a much battled out, working towards NPOV article on such a topic, should the need arise. From my brief understanding, I would agree with Mel that the term itself is a loaded steaming pile of crap, but I also see no reason why we can't document why this might in fact be (with the presumption that we don't hold that position, of course).</dd>
<dd>One problem I see here is the assumption that Klonimus is a troll. I'm not rightly sure I can agree with Mel on this one. For instance, this comment appears to me to be a perfectly reasonable, rational and reasoned argument:</dd>

<dd><b>I know that and agree with you 100%.</b> However as I have explained previously at great length. Our personal opinions about the subject do not matter. If people use the concept, it deserves coverage in wikipedia, even if you think the concept it's self is dumb. I think <a href="../../../j/u/a/Juan_Cole_474e.html" title="Juan Cole">Juan Cole</a> is dumb, but I support him having a wikipedia article.

<dd>Islamofascsim is just an extensivly used neologism to describe a totalitarian Islamic ideology that uses violence to further it's goals of replacing western civilization with Islamic Civilization. In that respect it is similar to the behaior of historical fascist movments. It's also promulgates an interpretation of Islam which supports its activities. And it so happens that alot of people are affected/concerned by the 0.1% of muslims who do support Islamofascism. <a href="../../../k/l/o/User%7EKlonimus_90cc.html" title="User:Klonimus">Klonimus</a> 03:38, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I'm inlclined ot agree that this will sort itself out. There is a value to having the page as distinct from Neofascism and Religion. What perhaps needs more though is where the religious relationships with classical fascism fit. Fascism and religion rediteccts fto Nazi mysticism, eliding the relationships of the major religions adn their instituions with the fascist parties an their ideologies, and the interplay of those forces in the WWII and pre -WWII West. <i><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERich_Farmbrough_93a5.html" title="User talk:Rich Farmbrough">Farmbrough</a></i> 13:08, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I really don't know why this is continuing on and on like this. I'm going to lay out a simple program as I understand it.</p>
<ol>
<li>Islamofascism is neologism used to refer to some abstract "concept".</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>The concept that it is refering are Islamic Ideologoies that seek to replace Western/Secular civilizations with Islamic civiliations and advocate and use violence to futher their goals.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Since <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_4153.html" title="9/11">9/11</a> the term has entered the poltical discoruce in the US and western world. Since its use by POTUS in a major political speech it has entered normative political discourse in the United States, and is commonly used in the political blogoshere.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Because none of us invented this word, speculations as to use of the term fascism are meaningless because the the concept this word refers to does not have a deep connection with fascism (aside from sharing a totalitarian ideology). People who constantly bring this up are being counter productive because no one claims that than Islamic Civilization under sharia law would share all aspects of a classical fascist society.</li>
</ol>
<p>Really, all this editwarring is counterproductive and if we could all focus on limiting ourselves to just describing the what Islamofascism means and how it's used in public discourse that would be just fine. <a href="../../../k/l/o/User%7EKlonimus_90cc.html" title="User:Klonimus">Klonimus</a> 19:47, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Mel, on my talk page you simply said that, along with the vote count, talk page discussions and the quality of arguments play a role in closing AfDs. You did not explain that you thought the AfD had simply been superseded by a subsequent talk page discussion. And as for the talkpage archive, you only claimed that this offered "more discussion of the issue"; you did not say that in the linked discussion you had arrived at a consensus to dismiss the results of the AfD. And when I repeatedly asked you to elaborate on your brief comments, there was only silence. In any case, no such consensus exists on the linked talkpage. Editors have been roughly split down the middle on this from the very beginning. If there was a "consensus", it was a uniquely fractious and disputed consensus. Anyway, the article is once again a going concern. I can't stop you from continuing to accuse us of intellectual dishonesty, trolling, Islamophobia, et cetera, but I hope you will also work to improve the article and make it NPOV.

<dd>I'm willing to believe that that's how you read what I wrote on your Talk page; I'd thought that, especially in the context of your question to me, I'd made myself clear, but if I didn't I apologise. With regard to the Talk page archive, I gave the link; I accept that I left it up to you to follow it and read what was there, but that seemed reasonable to me.</dd>
<dd>Note, though, that the consensus to make the article a redirect wasn't to set aside the AfD; the Afd produced no consensus, so consensus had to be found on the Talk page. To put it another way: if achieving consensus is to set aside a no-consensus AfD result, then yes, it was set aside, and a good thing too, surely. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 10:01, 24 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I have observed ongoing civility issues with this editor (Grace Note) and I support the block. In general the remarks have been milder than those listed above, and spaced out among useful edits so as to make a block questionable. Apparently Dr Zen/Grace Note's conduct has slid further.

<dd>I second dab on this issue. There seem to appear a kind of users whose only mission is to follow your contibutions and to provoke you to unflattering comments. Currently, there is no difference between an editor who made 25,000 edits and the one who made zero.

<dd>I'd say I'm more disturbed by the readiness of people to use the sort of blocks that were formerly reserved for long-term trolls and vandals. I also don't understand the rationale for the extended block - was there further activity <i>after</i> Carbonite's block expired? I only see 5 contributions this month, and they all appear to be before the block. I don't see any evidence to suggest that GN has <i>continued</i> to misbehave after the block. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 19:28, 23 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Dr Zen/Gracenote *is* a troll, and anyone who has followed his edits can testify to.

<p>I am very angry that this guy published my private correspondence, even if it was uncivil. That some other guy has "punished" me for something I didn't even do on Wikipedia is a bit scary. Jtkiefer, I called some kids cunts in the street the other night (they damaged my building). Perhaps you should give me another week for that? I was also a bit rude to my mother in 1982. Perhaps I should be hardbanned for that? It has nothing to do with anyone here what I write to Carbonite in an email. Also, I didn't say "fuck off cunt die" anywhere on Wikipedia. That's quite simply a lie. One thing I'm sad about on Wikipedia is that if you are labelled a troll by Raul or the like, it's acceptable not only for you to be treated to a standard that other editors are held to but an editor who is "in" can lie about you without being challenged. And Raul, as I've explained to others before, sometimes I just don't bother logging in but comment if I see something I've been directed to. No one is obliged to. I'm not hiding because, as you noted, it's plain who it is.</p>
<p>I apologise unreservedly to Halibutt and Marskell for the uncharacteristic aberration. TenofAllTrades, I don't know what you're on, mate, because I don't think I've ever come across you, and I've certainly never been uncivil to you, and rarely anything but civil to anyone else. --GN <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 203.206.87.165 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_203.206.87.165_f273.html" title="Special:Contributions/203.206.87.165">contribs</a>) 23:15, November 23, 2005.</small></p>

<dd>I think you've missed the point. You sent an aggressive email to somebody in relation to something he did to you in WP. I think the block is fully warranted.

<dd><i>Replying to Grace Note.</i> No, I haven't interacted directly with you, but you have participated in a lot of visible processes on Wikipedia. Several of your remarks on WP:RFA have definitely stretched the limits of WP:CIV before now; the comments that earned your recent block crossed well beyond the limits of WP:NPA. With respect to the publication of your 'private correspondence', you were asking for it with your remarks.

The legitimacy of BC or BCE is not the point, jguk is not allowed to make such changes (see <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_jguk_2_e705.html#Temporary_injunction" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/jguk 2">Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/jguk_2#Temporary_injunction</a>).

<dd>Redwolf, please read what we've written in the previous Arbitration decisions. Changing BCE to BC may violate the Manual of Style and is not acceptable under just any circumstances. The policy here follows the same principle as AE/BE: use whichever was there first, except where using one or the other is manifestly inappropriate. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 01:35, 24 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Izehar (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Izehar_9e80.html" title="Special:Contributions/Izehar">contribs</a>) suggested I post this here for review (see <a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html#Nixer.27s_block" title="User talk:Dbachmann">User_talk:Dbachmann#Nixer.27s_block</a>, User_talk:Izehar#Nixer) : I blocked Nixer for 48h, for repeat 3RRvio, this time he reverted six times in 24h before being blocked. I do not consider myself involved in a dispute with Nixer: I consider my reverts of Nixer's edits mere cleanup work. He <i>may</i> be editing in 'good faith', but his command of English, and the confused content of his edits, makes it impossible to be sure, so that fapp, his edits are equivalent to those of a troll. Policy may force us to treat Nixer as an "editor in good standing" in spite of his shortcomings, but if this is the case, it is a strong example of Wikipedia's "anti-expertise" and "pro-trolls" bias (what are the minimal cognitive faculties required of an editor to be considered "in good standing" and capable of being in dispute about anything?). In any case, feel free to reset my block to something shorter if you disagree with any of this. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 13:44, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

He has been blocked for 48 hours for violating the 3RR (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3ANixer" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3ANixer" rel="nofollow">Block log</a>), and the block is due to expire at 10:02, 25 November 2005 (UTC) (tomorrow) (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Ipblocklist?action=search&amp;limit=50&amp;ip=Nixer" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Ipblocklist?action=search&amp;limit=50&amp;ip=Nixer" rel="nofollow">Blocked usernames</a>). According to <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>: <i>after your fourth revert in 24 hours, sysops may block you for up to 24 hours</i>. Nixer has been blocked for 48 hours - the sysop who blocked him wasn't authorised to block him for that long. He has already been blocked for roughly 24 hours (he was blocked 24 hours ago), so could someone please remove the block. You can say "he has served the maximum sentence". Izehar 10:28, 24 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Fair enough, I'll unblock him. I had not realized 24h was the maximum penalty at the time of issuing the block, and I didn't declare the block to be for anything except repeated 3RRvio (the 48h were intended as a cumulation for repeat offences. Note that Nixer managed to get himself blocked for 3RRvios seven times in three months. Also note that the first block I issued for 3RRvio was for 2 hours only). Not that it'll do any good, Nixer very obviously still hasn't learned <i>why</i> we have the policy, and he'll just keep banging his head against the wall. In the future, I will block him for 24h for any 3RRvio (including "aren't-I-clever" 4 reverts in 27 hours) without further comment. Nixer should really be dragged before the arbcom, but I can't be bothered with the bureaucracy involved, since ignoring him is much easier at this point (but I'll commend and support anybody who takes upon themselves to get Nixer before the arbcom). <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 14:50, 24 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree, dab. This must seem like terrible wikilawyering and bureaucracy to an uninvolved party, but from Nixer's point of view they are not. I have heard both sides of the story (from your comments here and on my talk page and from Nixer's e-mails). Nixer seems to think that you're out to get him, revert every edit he makes and block him for the most trivial of reasons for as long as possible; you seem to think of Nixer as a blatant troll who abuses the system (the 4 reverts in 27 hours). Now I don't know who's right and who's wrong here - it is perfectly clear though that you two need some sorting out to do between yourselves; you should consider <a href="../../../r/e/s/Wikipedia%7EResolving_disputes_9a93.html" title="Wikipedia:Resolving disputes">Wikipedia:Resolving disputes</a>.

<dd>he just reminded me of sticking to the letter of policy, that doesn't mean he cannot agree that Nixer's edits needed to be reverted. Izehar is being detached, as, I hope, I am too.

<p>This IP address has over 100 edits. A strange mix of pointless one-liner vandalism, formatting fixes and the occasional really useful content-boosting edit. I believe it is shared, so obviously care should be taken when blocking etc. I suggested they should sign up for accounts to avoid being associated with vandalism.</p>
<p>Because a one-liner is easy enough to revert, practically no one has bothered to put warning tags on the Talk page. But just looking through their latest contribs, I found a dozen odd vandalous edits.</p>
<p>This is not an urgent issue, but if it's possible to "watch" a user or their contribs, that would be great. This kind of slow drip-drip vandalism really shits me.
