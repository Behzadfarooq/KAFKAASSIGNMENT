<li>In response to Sjakkalle, I have blocked both for revert warring, which by its very definition is disruptive, not for the letter of the 3RR. <s>Admins</s>Established editors should be above edit wars, and remember that three reverts are a limit, not a right.

<li>No, I cannot agree with the blocks. I will unblock both of them, although I won't unblock again if someone reblocks (I dislike block wars). At any rate, they should have been given warnings on the talkpages before blocking them for disruption. Besides, they <i>stopped</i> edit warring a long time ago. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 11:57, 19 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>They stopped edit warring about eight hours ago. Okay, I suppose in WikiSpace that counts as a long time. Please note that three hours is a relatively light block, and that both are experienced editors that should already know perfectly well not to edit war. They crossed the line, even if only by an inch or two. Regardless, I am not going to block again, and I hope that they can find a suitable compromise through discussion, or if necessary through the MedCom. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 12:19, 19 October 2005 (UTC)

<p>I didn't edit war at all. Check my edits and you'll see that I attempted discussion on the talk page (repeatedly overwritten by Aaron) and that every single one of my edits was a separate, <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">bold</a> attempt at compromise.</p>
<p>Having said that, Radiant's incorrect block had no effect as I was asleep at the time. I caution Radiant against abuse of the blocking feature.

<li>11:45, 19 October 2005 Radiant! blocked "User:Tony Sidaway" with an expiry time of 3 hours (Revert war on Wikipedia:Votes for undeletion/Vfu header)</li>
</ul>
<p>Radiant, what on earth do you think you were playing at? Not only had I not edit warred, I hadn't even touched that article in <i>hours</i>. This was really a very silly response to a long-dead situation. Having attempted and failed to achieve any kind of agreement from Aaron, who kept reverting every single compromise I made, always to the same version, I gave up. I don't see it as my business to act as a policeman against confirmed edit warriors like him. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a></p>
<ul>
<li>You are incorrect. Aaron didn't overwrite anything, he moved your comments to <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia_talk%7EDeletion_review_3b38.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Deletion review">Wikipedia talk:Deletion review</a>, which is a more suitable place for visibility reasons. Additionally, when you're discussing this with him or indeed anyone, might I suggest that you be more <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> and refrain from calling people liars (e.g. <i>"To claim that it's been arrived at by consensus is to state a very palpable untruth"</i>, and <i>"You've twice falsely claimed that I should use the talk page"</i>). <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 12:41, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>No, I cannot agree that a completely separate page is "a more suitable place for visibility reasons". If I make an edit on a page, I discuss it on the talk page. This is what talk pages are for. I didn't call Aaron a liar, I simply pointed out that he had several time made untruthful statements. He had done so. I can't go around pretending that someone has made a truthful statement when it's obvious that he hasn't. <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAITH_32f0.html" title="WP:FAITH">WP:FAITH</a> has its limits. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a></p>
<ul>
<li>But as a matter of fact, the version Aaron reverted to <i>was</i> established after consensual discussion, which you can find <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EVotes_for_undeletion_c455.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Votes for undeletion">here</a>. I would suggest that you read up on it, and that you owe Aaron an apology for wrongly accusing him of making untruthful statements. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 13:01, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>The version Aaron reverted to may have had some people who agreed with it; however it seriously misstated Wikipedia deletion policy and undeletion policy. VFU isn't a policy page, but it must reflect policy. I owe nobody an apology for correctly pointing out that the notice is contrary to our policies and will be incorrect unless and until we have a site-wide consensus to override our actual deletion and undeletion policies and replace them by the fictions represented in that document. Do not falsely claim that I owe Aaron an apology again. The facts are laid out in our official policy, which cannot be overturned by a small group of editsor claiming that they have consensus to make a statement misrepresenting that policy. And again I remind you that you wrongly blocked me for edit warring, when I did no such thing. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 13:13, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's something of a classic defense round here to say that, when an individual disagrees with something that many others agree with, that "many" is too small a quantity regardless of how "many" it represents. It's actually little more than an attempt to railroad that individual's opinions over the "many" others. As for policy page X or Y being in conflict with a proposal, I don't see anything wrong with that since, if the proposal receives support, it will amend the policy and the two will then coincide. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 13:31, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Um, no. If Fred Bloggs and his mates decide that they can delete articles beginning with the letter Z and write a page about it, and they all agree, this doesn't amend policy in any way. To amend policy you have to, you know, propose the change and then get a proper site-wide consensus, not just Fred Bloggs and his mates. I've no idea how many people support the version of the VFU header that is contrary to policy, but it doesn't matter how many there are since it's contrary to policy and thus unenforcable. There's no alternative really, if you want to change policy, do so, but don't create these little ruritanian fiefdoms outside the policy and expect to get away with it. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 13:48, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>As Splash says. Additionally, take a look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_undeletion/Vfu_header&amp;action=history|the" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_undeletion/Vfu_header&amp;action=history|the" rel="nofollow">page history</a>. At first glance, there is an obvious edit war going on. At second glance, Tony wasn't actually reverting, since all his versions differ from one another, leading to his claim that it wasn't an edit war. However, at third glance, all Tony's versions come down to the same issue, and therefore it <i>was</i> an edit war.</li>
<li>The issue is this: if an admin considers a deletion to be "out of process", should that admin unilaterally restore the article, or should he list it on VFU to determine whether in fact it <i>was</i> out of process? Tony's opinion is the former, consensual opinion is the latter. The Undeletion Policy agrees with the latter - <i>"Wikipedia would be a better encyclopedia with the article restored"</i> is listed as an argument to <i>request</i> undeletion, not to unilaterally do it.</li>
<li>The reason for the debate is that in the past, some admins have taken a very liberal view of deletions being "out of process". Some other admin must have thought the deletion was in process, or he wouldn't have deleted it. And if such controversy exists between two admins, it behooves us to discuss it to find out which of the two opinions has consensus. And that is precisely what VFU is for. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 13:56, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Radiant, if you're going to keep saying "Tony is incorrect" in your edit summary, you're going to have to demonstrate that I'm incorrect.</p>
<p>You falsely describe my example as an appeal to ridicule. Abolutely not. It is simply a fact that you need to amend the deletion policy if you want to do something that it doesn't allow. You can't just get a group of people together who agree to ignore it.</p>
<p>You're going round in circles on the edit war, but at least you now agree that I wasn't reverting. So we move forwards inch by inch. To claim that my version all came down to the same issue is to ignore the fact that the only thing they had in common that they all stated somewhere that VFU operates under the deletion policy and the undeletion policy. WHich is obviously true.</p>
<p><br />
You write: <i>if an admin considers a deletion to be "out of process", should that admin unilaterally restore the article, or should he list it on VFU to determine whether in fact it</i> was <i>out of process? Tony's opinion is the former, consensual opinion is the latter. The Undeletion Policy agrees with the latter</i></p>
<ul>
<li>To make non-admins able to see what their talking about on VFU, I have no problem with such an article being temp deleted until such time the VFU discussion is closed. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 07:53, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Absolutely not. Undeletion policy states that obvious out-of-process deletions can be undone unilaterally. In the past where an admin has attempted to speedy it again I've invariably taken the matter to AfD, where the article is almost invariably kept (you may remember those two Iranian artists, and the jazz drummer). I've also done this when challenged for an <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> undeletion (the latest being the Wolters case which got a very strong endorsement from AfD). These endorsements do make a nonsense of the claim that consensual opinion is against undeletion of good articles that have been wrongly deleted.</p>
<p>You write: <i>"Wikipedia would be a better encyclopedia with the article restored" is listed as an argument to</i> request <i>undeletion, not to unilaterally do it.</i> Not sure what you're saying here. I have not claimed that that an article can be unilaterally undeleted under the undeletion policy for that reason. As you're well aware, the only times I've undeleted an article deleted <i>in process</i> have been under <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>.

<li>Okay, I will once more demonstrate where you are incorrect.</li>
<li>Your argument to <i>"delete articles beginning with the letter Z"</i> is in fact an <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appeal_to_ridicule.html" title="Appeal to ridicule">appeal to ridicule</a>, defined among others as <i>"stretching the argument's logic to an absurd extreme"</i>.</li>
<li>You said above to Sjakkalle that you <i>"might have reverted once"</i>. Apparently you are unsure whether or not you were reverting. In any case, the difference between a <a href="../../../r/e/v/Wikipedia%7ERevert_war_0c13.html" title="Wikipedia:Revert war">revert war</a> and an <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEdit_war_dd06.html" title="Wikipedia:Edit war">edit war</a> is a matter of semantics. You were edit warring. You should know better.</li>
<li>You state that all your edits <i>"stated somewhere that VFU operates under the deletion policy and the undeletion policy"</i>, but that is incorrect, because <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_undeletion/Vfu_header&amp;diff=25874714&amp;oldid=25866326" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_undeletion/Vfu_header&amp;diff=25874714&amp;oldid=25866326" rel="nofollow">this one</a> does not. At any rate, <i>all</i> of Aaron's versions already reference both those policies, so I find it hard to believe that all your edits were merely to indicate that VFU uses those policy (which nobody disputes anyway). Rather, it seems from your edits that you wish to be able to ignore VFU discussion, which your earlier actions also seem to indicate.</li>
<li>You state that <i>"Undeletion policy states that obvious out-of-process deletions can be undone unilaterally"</i>, however right at the top of that policy it says <i>"Reasons why an article might be</i> requested <i>for undeletion * Deletion "out of process""</i>.</li>
<li>You state that you <i>"have not claimed that that an article can be undeleted under the undeletion policy for that reason"</i> (the reason being that "WP would be better with the article restored"), when in fact you have claimed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_undeletion/Vfu_header&amp;diff=25881781&amp;oldid=25880136" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_undeletion/Vfu_header&amp;diff=25881781&amp;oldid=25880136" rel="nofollow">exactly that</a>.</li>
<li>You just admitted that you have <i>"undeleted an article deleted in process (have been) under <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>"</i>, once more showing that you wish to be able to ignore VFU. That is simply improper. People sometimes make mistakes, and claiming that any action is out of process <i>does not make it so</i>; someone else must have considered it in process, or he wouldn't have made the action. If you are correct about an undeletion, then discussing it at VFU will underline that fact, the only difference being a few days' waiting. If you are incorrect, then discussing it at VFU will show that you should not have done it unilaterally. VFU does work.</li>
<li>At any rate it is hipocritical to cite <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> in your defense (twice), when you are accusing other people of breach of policy.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>This is boiling down to discussing semantics, so after this post I will drop the matter. You have been proven to be incorrect several times, and consensus has been shown to disagree with you on the wording of the VFU header. The mature thing to do would be to admit that you were wrong, apologize to Aaron for the conflict, put the issue behind you and continue with the solid contributions that you usually make - for you <i>are</i> a good editor, and we all make mistakes now and then.

<li>Tony Sidaway states or implies above that the discusion on the former VfU page was not sufficiently "site-wide" to constitute a consensus to change policy. (I would argue that it merely clarified policy without making any essential change, but that is another matter). These discussion were announced at the village pump, on RFC, at AfD, and CfD, and I think here, on more than one occasion. The discussion continued for over a month. If that is not enough "site-wide" visibility, I would like to know what is. Tony said "If Fred Bloggs and his mates decide that they can delete articles beginning with the letter Z and write a page about it, and they all agree, this doesn't amend policy in any way." I hardly think then widly advertised discuission on the creation and scope of Deletion Review and the mechanics and standards it would use, is comperable to "a page created by Fred Bloggs and his mates". I think that there in fact <b>has</b> been quite sufficient consensus to consider this a change to any policy that conflicts with it, and that it would be justified to simply edit the Undeletion Policy page in accordance with the discussion held on VfU talk. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 15:31, 19 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have to agree with DES here. I talked to Tony on IRC yesterday and tried to explain all of this. I also have to add that we have been discussing the new scope of VFU for about two months now, <i>and</i> that Splash and I left messages in the talk pages of all editors who had been involved in the discussion, <i>including</i> Tony. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">xd</font></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a>)</sup> 01:35, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously there has been no consensus to change the deletion policy and the undeletion policy such that they'd accommodate the agreed wording of the VFU header (in fact, any and all such changes have been strongly resisted when there have been attempts to change it). I think we have to edit the VFU header to conform with those policies, otherwise decisions made through deletion review on the false assumptions in that header will be regularly overtaken by policy. This isn't a new problem; the old VFU page header also misstated policy. Now I've no great problem with the idea of a clique within Wikipedia that makes decisions that are incompatible with the site-wide deletion and undeletion policies, but I do think it would be nice if instead we had a proper deletion review forum that had the support of those policies instead of having its effectiveness limited and continually finding itself at odds with those policies.</p>
<p>And also of course Radiant falsely accuses me of misrepresenting my edits; all of them were efforts to make the header conform with policy. He falsely accuses me of obfuscating between revert war and edit war; I did neither as he well knows. Every single edit I did was a distinct attempt to find common ground between deletion/undeletion policy and the idea of deletion review. Aaron's version may have referred to policies, but it grossly misstated them and was in conflict with them.</p>
<p>Then we have this priceless gem: <i>You state that</i> "Undeletion policy states that obvious out-of-process deletions can be undone unilaterally"<i>, however right at the top of that policy it says</i> "Reasons why an article might be <i>requested</i> for undeletion * Deletion "out of process""<i>.</i></p>
<p>I find it impossible to believe that Radiant believes that the above means that *all* out-of-process deletions must be taken to VFU. The undeletion policy explicitly denies this, granting administrators the right to undelete them unilaterally.</p>
<p>I am perfectly capable of going through every single one of Radiant's other points an demonstrating how--with a succession of often quite breathtaking bits of illogic, and marshalling citations to edits that don't say at all what he claims they say, he's managed to mire himself into believing that he's proven me to to be wrong. But actually I don't have to do that; I think I've done enough to demonstrate the sheer breadth of the cracks in the class of reasoning that he brings to this forum. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 13:47, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think there is a lot of frustration around. However this doesn't justify the things that have been said. I give a full, indeed <i>exhaustive</i>, response to Radiant's rather poorly researched attempt to make some points on his talk page. The personal attacks that seek to represent my behavior as dictatorial in any manner are simply false; I cannot impose my views on anyone. However since the deletion review is as a matter of fact somewhat adrift from Wikipedia policy, I'm entitled to say so and to take reasonable steps to remedy that. Having done that, I left it there a day or two ago and all I've been doing since then is dealing with misplaced, ineptly composed personal attacks by people who don't seem to be able to understand that people can have legitimate disagreements on interpretation of policy. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 08:03, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Radiant removed the entirety of that as a personal attack.

<dd>Perhaps it would work better to contact the speedying admin first? "I notice that you deleted X, but I don't see what speedy criterion applies. If you think it should go, could you indicate a specific speedy criterion, or undelete it an list it on AfD? Sorry to be picky, but I think Wikipedia would be better off with this article, and the matter needs to be looked at more closely." Incidentally, if you find that you can't honestly and with a straight face say the last sentence–particularly the bit about Wikipedia being better off <i>with</i> the article in question–then is there any reason to ask for the speedy to be reversed? (Don't ask for things you don't actually want done!) If you find that you want/have to undelete the article yourself, please have the courtesy to (politely) notify the admin who deleted it in the first place. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 16:50, 20 October 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I have done that on several occasions, the response is usually no response. And let me be clear, i am quite willing to suggest undeletion for things that I would absouletly suggest to delete on AfD. I really think that the integrity of the process is <b>more</b> important than any single article, becaus the community trust that lets wikipedia work is based on that integrity of process. Out-of-process deletions are violations of consensus, and as such, bad in themselves, no matter what the content of the article. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 17:42, 20 October 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Consensus-building is an important process, but it doesn't always have to happen through individual AfDs. If a certain (perhaps ill-defined) class of articles is regularly deleted through AfD–take articles that advertise non-notable companies, for instance–we find that those articles tend to get speedied more often as time goes by. Sometimes the speedy deletion criteria are updated to reflect this; from what I've seen, usually not. Modifying CSD is time consuming, and it's hard to craft new criteria that are both broad enough to be useful and narrow enough not to cause significant collateral damage.</dd>
<dd>Are the admins who speedy these articles acting outside of Wikipedia consensus, then? It can be argued that they are acting within the wishes of the community. If they are correctly identifying these articles as belonging to a class that is regularly and uniformly deleted by the consensus at AfD, then the deletion itself strikes me as a reduction in red tape rather than a defiance of consensus. Same result, but a lot less time and bandwidth.</dd>
<dd>The danger, of course, is that an admin will not make correct judgements about which articles qualify for this sort of speedy. Since VfU and DR are usually pretty quiet places, I would suggest that this is at least circumstantial evidence that most of these outside-of-policy deletions are nevertheless reasonable and tacitly accepted by most of the community.</dd>
<dd>The flip side of an admin's ability to make such discretionary deletions must be an equal helping of accountability. Any deletions justified by WP:NOT or plain common sense rather than WP:CSD should be reversed when questioned and nominated for normal deletion. Admins who find their deletions questioned frequently should engage in a bit of introspection—and lighten their touch on the delete button. (On the third hand, I'm going to boldly say that deletions shouldn't be questioned <i>solely</i> because they don't meet the CSD. That's just wasting everybody's time.) <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 19:00, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would note as an aside that Wikipedia policy often comes about because of admins who ignore rules. Their common sense actions are tacitly accepted by the community, and eventually someone gets around to writing a formal policy to describe the new state of affairs. Wikipedia policy is inherently flexible and negotiable. The spirit of the rules is far more important than their letter. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 16:50, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I woulkd up blocking both parties for 3RR violations.

<dd>This wasn't a case of one editor not liking a source that another provided. it was a case of one editor adding his own personal opinion to an article and repeatedly reinserting it despite numerous attempts by jredmond to get him to read our NPOV policy and our cite sources policy. Of course it's better to get the community to carry the torch though.(as I've already said on jredmond's talk page) But when an anon repeatedly ignores our policies, inserts his own POV into articles, ignores all attempt at discussion, refuses to cite any sources,and starts atting abusive comments to articles then that's not edit warring, that's vandalism. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">(a tenth stroke)</a> 00:13, 20 October 2005 (UTC)

<p>I'm not so sure this is the kind of conduct we want out of administrators. There's no part of a Wikipedia administrator's duties which permits him or her to "punish" anyone. Neither the <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators_37b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators">Administrators</a> policy, nor the <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">Blocking policy</a>, make any reference to "punishment"; and I'm not aware of any consensus discussions that suggest that anyone thinks it's acceptable to "punish" here. (Hell, even the Arbitration Committee reminds us all once in a while that its role is not judicial or disciplinary.)</p>
<p>Blocking is part of administrator duties for a narrow range of purposes related to preventing disruption or enforcing policy. Blocking a user <i>because one thinks that user should be "punished"</i> is not a judgment administrators are charged with making. Therefore, the threat is empty at best and abusive at worst.</p>
<p>I don't see this as just a matter of "wording", as Who suggests above. It sounds to me like a lack of attention to what the role of administrators is supposed to be here. It's no part of that role to sit in moral judgment over other editors or to decide that they require discipline or punishment. I suggest that Karmafist be warned not to threaten his/her fellow editors with "punishment" which s/he does not have the authority to impose. I recommend review of the relevant policies (linked above). --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 10:00, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I meant mainly that the user could have been blocked for violating 3RR and Karmafist did not do that, "punishment" as they put is was poor wording, but it was an option. This is why I say it was poor wording, as well as the "homework" remarks. I still think that the benefit of the doubt was given, and gave the user a fair warning to decease their activities or they would be blocked. This is not much different from the test templates, except for the poor choice of wording. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Who_d857.html" title="Special:Contributions/Who"><font color="#9999FF">«»</font></a><a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho_d957.html" title="User:Who">Who</a><a href="../../../w/h/o/User_talk%7EWho_fe12.html" title="User talk:Who"><font color="#00FF00">?</font><font color="#FF00FF">¿</font><font color="#0033FF">?</font></a><sup><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Who" class="extiw" title="m:User:Who"><font color="#CC6600">meta</font></a></sup> 10:18, 20 October 2005 (UTC)

<p>What I'm finding amusing in Wikipedia middle management is the way that some admins enforce the rules on editors with scrupulous attention to detail, but feel quite free to take a far more liberal approach when it comes to themselves. Funny, but one would expect admins to be role models rather than exceptions. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 203.51.25.122 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_203.51.25.122_ad19.html" title="Special:Contributions/203.51.25.122">contribs</a>) 11:51, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</small></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>the wording in question was:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>I'm reverting your edit now since apparently you decided to ignore verification before changing most of the edit we reached by consensus above. I should block you for this, but i'll be nice and let you revert again without punishment</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>imho this shows a deplorable misunderstanding of the role of an admin. Or, since the context is the 3RR, a misunderstanding of the 3RR, since the "punishment" would have been for 3, not 4 reverts. It is my general impression that more and more admins begin to think of themselves less like janitors and more like sheriffs or vassals. With a population of nigh 600 admins, it also becomes difficult to recognize problematic patterns early (also since most complains on this page are bogus, so it won't do to inspect the 'most complained about' admins, these tend to be the most valiant troll-fighters). There are several approaches to address this.</p>
<ul>
<li>make very sure that new admin candidates have a good understanding of, and respect for policy and their role. yes, admins' behaviour should be better than average, they do have some responsibility as 'role models', showing what is considered wiki-like behaviour. new admins should understand that this is part of what is required of them.</li>
<li>make it binding policy that no admin should use his powers in content disputes where s/he is involved</li>
<li>maybe instigate an official de-adminning procedure at last. I am not saying that karmafist has done anything to make him a candidate for de-adminning, mind you, but the mere presence of a procedure that makes losing adminship as little a "deal" as gaining it may do wonders for some admins' manners. I know such a thing has been turned down before as a trollish proposal. But even back then I maintained that with the ever growing admin population, it may at some point become necessary.</li>

<dd>I have no interest in this particular quarrel, but it's a bad thing for us all that there are people roving round like Robocop with an attitude problem, and especially when they are supposed to be in a position of responsibility. Administrators do not own wikipedia and have absolutely no right to talk about "punishing" anyone, or to address editors in such a condescending and insulting way (arrogance, petty sniping etc). Even malicious and persistent vandals, as opposed to bona fide contributors with strongly-held beliefs, should be dealt with civilly. This is not the first time I've seen unbridled and even puerile aggression from people (little more than children in some cases) proudly flaunting their "admin" status, and it's just not acceptable. Such people should take some time out to read the documents on civility they like to set as "homework". <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlapdragon_8659.html" title="User:Flapdragon">Flapdragon</a> 16:38, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I haven't had time to read through all the evidence on the RfC in question, I'm afraid, but I've seen enough to draw a few conclusions. First, there's no mention that I could see of a threat by e-mail (as claimed by Karmafist above: "After seeing an e-mail threat from him(copied at his RfC)"). Secondly, Karmafist makes no secret of using and threatening to use his blocking powers on <a href="../../../p/i/g/User%7EPigsonthewing_3a5b.html" title="User:Pigsonthewing">Andy Mabbett</a> at, for example <a href="../../../c/o/l/Coleshill%2C_Warwickshire_f364.html" title="Coleshill, Warwickshire">Coleshill, Warwickshire</a>, when he has been involved in editing at that article; he should either act as an admin and not edit, or act as an editor and not block. Blocking because he thinks that an editor has behaved badly is also not an option; I doubt that many admins haven't been tempted to do this at some time, but we should refrain — it's not what we're here for.</p>

<dd>Thats actually partly on my urging, several people had commented this was strange since her votes were the sole keeps on very clearly deletion material (2 vanity religions! and some other 2 liner crap articles). As she had expressed a strong deletionist attitude previously to yesterday, and had changed from "extreme deletionist" to "extreme inclusionist" on her userpage ... I was questioning as to whether she was 1) hacked or 2) WP:POINT due to her negative RFA reception. I made a comment on IRC and Karma said he would talk to her before anyone blocked her. &#160;<a href="../../../a/l/k/User%7EAlkivar_1b76.html" title="User:Alkivar"><font color="#FA8605"><b>ALKIVAR</b></font></a><a href="../../../a/l/k/User_talk%7EAlkivar_a34a.html" title="User talk:Alkivar">™</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/Image%7ERadioactive.png_1d91.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/f/f1/Radioactive.png/18px-Radioactive.png" alt="" width="18" height="16" longdesc="../../../r/a/d/Image%7ERadioactive.png_1d91.html" /></a> 19:49, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks Alkivar. Ultimately, I used the term "some admins on IRC" to protect any hard feelings she might have towards other editors, all of which were basically just concerned over her viewpoints as of lately, particularly after the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Purplefeltangel2_dc0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Purplefeltangel2">RFA</a>. In a way, she's full of cheer and good will but often trampled upon by more experienced editors who forget that everyone makes mistakes. It'd be a terrible loss if she stopped editing at Wikipedia, she just needs time to grow</p>

<dd>I reverted that edit. However that did come before the most recent talk page warning. His last edit at the moment was to acknowledge the warning. He also seems to have added a few images by linking to their original source and listing them in External Links, but I don't know that that is actually a problem.

<p>Hi there, I think you will all be pleased to know progress is being made, but I don't have a problem with leaving Wikipedia, Not a problem, I am free to go as I please anytime, I came here willingly, take it or leave it. Anyway, for clarification, Duncott is a town near Minersville, that is a fact, I was born and raised in the vicinity so I'm not sure what you are all talking about, It is classified as a patch town, something you might not understand, but it is a real town. Secondly, I cannot delete the pics on the list and FVW knows this, as I am not authorized as an admin and now is the time to do this. Also as for tags of the pics, I look toward your help as I believe they were tagged Ok, If not that can be changed to whatever tags you approve The only problem I have is one person says use GDL and another person says use something else. I'll go with whatever it takes and FVW has been asked several times what to use and I will do what it takes get them on, Although I'm not sure I can just change a tag, Catch 22, if you know what I mean. Let me state for the record and thirdly, Please don't associate me with anyone like POTW Mabbett [personal attack removed], so please understand how I don't want to associate with him, I can't understand why his user page does not talk about him, instead of someone else for all this time, and some admin like yourself does not do anything as he has an RFC against him. Questions? I have a discussion page and I won't talk about POTW, or give him the time of day on my discussion page, I've tried that before and it just does not seem to work, beleive me, I will continue to delete his comments on my discussion page as I was told this is OK, but not proper, well neither is giving this user the attention he wants, and that seems to work better for me. I am really not interested in being harrassed and neither would you, I might add I have not been the only one who has seen this in his past. Have you even investigated his past? That is your job, and it's easy to turn your head than face a real problem, that ony prolongs a problem. I'm more focused on creating a good encyclopedia here, and yes you all should be too, and be proud. There really are real people out here, not with made up handles, and fictious Yahoo message board type names, that they hide behind. There really are people that are open, and that openess is usually held against them by people who hide behind these handles. I ask you, as I am trying to be, try and be honest with yourself, and be fair behind your fun handle without a real name. My apology for the text, but I wasn't aware I was being talked about, As I said I can leave any time, Wikipedia will still go on, with or without you, and I, It's a good concept though and hard work, Keep up the good work!

<p>Over the past several weeks, an anonymous user keeps changing the main picture on <a href="../../../y/o/r/Yorkshire_Terrier_6dff.html" title="Yorkshire Terrier">Yorkshire Terrier</a> to a rather bad picture of a yorkie (gabby). These reverts happen a couple of times every few days, I think we are up to 20 reverts now. We've attempted to have a discussion on the Talk page to no avail. Compromise was attempted by featuring the picture in the article elsewhere. Virtually all the members of the dog project have reverted this user more than once, and the anon won't quit. The main IP address that is revert-warring here is 68.99.130.81. There are other anon IP addresses reverting back to the gabby photo as well, see the <a href="../../../y/o/r/Talk%7EYorkshire_Terrier_b73b.html" title="Talk:Yorkshire Terrier">Talk page</a> for full details, but I think that these are the same user from multiple machines. The original picture uploader and dog owner is User:Arizonaland, both the arizonaland account and the main anon IP address reverter seem to be editing the same two articles therefore I suspect that the 68.99.130.81 user is just the not-logged-in dog owner doing this for vanity's sake. - <a href="../../../t/r/y/User%7ETrysha_c63a.html" title="User:Trysha">Trysha</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../t/r/y/User_talk%7ETrysha_3f4c.html" title="User talk:Trysha">talk</a>)</sup> 19:46, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The user who made them is called Skyring and has been banned by the Arbcom. Under the Arbcomm ruling every one of his edits once made using a sockpuppet during his ban is to be reverted on sight irrespective of quality. The user has been bombarding Wikipedia with upwards of 30 sockpuppets in the last few days. He admitted that he was secretly editing using other identities. He made the mistake of using one of his secret identities tonight to launch a sockpuppet personal attack and was rumbled. As per the arbcom ruling, all his edits made at that IP since his ban were rolled back. Under Wikipedia rules, banned users are not allowed to contribute <i>anything</i> to Wikipedia, whether context, layout changes or even spelling corrections. All articles created for them while circumventing their ban are also supposed to be deleted on sight.</p>

<p>Skyring has also been banned from the Wikilist for abusive behaviour. Due to his continued breaches of his ban, users have restarted his one year ban as and from his last edit.

<dd>I notice Jtdirl blocked the IP who added the above indefinitely as Skyring.

<dd>The 203. IP from optus is open, so there is no point blocking indefinately. The 143. and 144.

<dd>I suppose then we'd better rephrase the sockpuppetproven template, or create a specific one for open IPs.

<dd>We're all human, and I make as many typoos and mistakes as the next person. Me, I welcome correction on mistakes. In fact I wish there were far more people like thee and me, brother. If I'm bored, I need only hit "Random article" a few times, and I'm sure to find about 50% of articles have something that needs at least a tiny tweak. Just looking at those diffs, the word you picked out was mis-spelt, sure, but not by me. I corrected the word next to it, but I shall now proceed to pluck out my eyes for missing "modifiation".</dd>
<dd>My point, as I'm sure everyone has grasped by now, is that reverting good edits is not something that helps Wikipedia. It certainly doesn't incline me to leaving the project, as I would have thought was equally obvious by now.</dd>

<dd>Actually, while I fully support the ban, and the reverting of Skyring's edits while he's banned, I have been wondering recently about the indefinite blocking of some IP addresses. I'm not at all well up on "open proxies" and "dynamic IPs", but I have noticed that Skyring's edits come from lots of different IP addresses, which suggests to me that these addresses are randomly assigned. That suggests that the <i>indefinite</i> blocks on User:203.51.25.229, User:203.51.25.90, <a href="../../../1/3/9/User%7E139.168.158.170.html" title="User:139.168.158.170">User:139.168.158.170</a>, User:203.51.24.117, etc. may be penalizing some innocent users.

<p>Yeah, I'm not sure if I see the logic in reverting minor grammar corrections from anyone, even a banned user. If an IP can be determined to be in use by a banned user, sure, go ahead and block, but why revert? It's a bit petty, not to mention harmful to the encyclopedia. <i><b><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a></b></i><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="green">ndroid</font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="purple">79</font></a> 12:27, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The only reason that anonymous IP edits get noticed as being Skyring's is because Skyring, like a zoo monkey hurling feces through the cage bars, deliberately draws attention to them. He wants the attention: improving Wikipedia is, at best, secondary to him. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 12:34, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Interesting but wrong. As I've mentioned elsewhere, I edit Wikipedia productively under several different registered accounts, and there must be hundreds of anon edits that nobody has noticed. If I highlight an edit as being mine, which I can do in several different ways, then it is to highlight a failing of the system, such as an admin deliberately vandalising another's user page, or reverting good edits in the hope that this will stop me making good edits.</dd>

<dd>

<dd>Wikipedia as a whole is a remarkably good idea, but management and dispute resolution processes need a lot of work. What I find particularly interesting is the rigid enforcement of rules by those who do not see them as applying to themselves. The usual excuse is that suchandsuch is "a good editor", tirelessly reverting vandalism and so forth. Sure, but just as a good cop might arrest a lot of evil-doers, this does not excuse corruption and illegal behaviour on the part of the cop.</dd>

<dd>Boy, the irony of that last sentence is rich: you apparently want us to believe that your minor grammar edits justifies your behaving like a jackass. That Jtdrl has a short fuse doesn't in any way, shape, or form excuse your transparent attempts to provoke him: in fact, since you've been explicitly sanctioned by ArbCom for this jerky behavior, it should be abundantly clear to you that it's not going to be tolerated, and attempting to continue doing so will merely get you further sanctions -- which you will richly deserve. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 04:31, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I followed policy(as shown in <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Pigsonthewing_a37a.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Pigsonthewing">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Pigsonthewing</a>), Pigs had 3RRs on two days(he was not blocked because <a href="../../../g/-/m/User%7EG-Man_797a.html" title="User:G-Man">G-man</a> made it ambiguous whether or not Pigs caused the 3RRs or if both were, guilty of 3RR, so I protected the page and asked for a compromise on the talk page. Apparently it was reached by both sides, Pigs ignored it, and unilaterally reverted it. He will do so again and again if he does not learn to work with others, and the only reason I asked for comment here is because I was unsure if this ban would only lead to another ban in the future, and if he does violate Policy 4 on Key Policies at <a href="../../../r/u/l/WP%7ERULES_e375.html" title="WP:RULES">WP:RULES</a> again, I'll block him for longer, if not indefinately. All I want is for him to learn how to be civil and contribute to Wikipedia. If he cannot do the former, he cannot do the latter. I've seen no reason to stop watching over that article, as at this point, i'm fairly sure that Pigs will cause more problems there and elsewhere, and I request London apologize for his insensitive remarks regarding my disability. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist">Karmafist</a> 13:25, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Karmafist, you will not have to answer for Pigs' actions, but for your own. You are out of line, and you do sound like a 'rogue admin' now. <i>You will not block any established user for longer than one month</i> without violating <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBLOCK_89b0.html" title="WP:BLOCK">WP:BLOCK</a>. No single admin gets to block users for "lack of respect". The most you can do is block people for 'disruption', as an emergency measure if somebody really keeps people from getting work done; repeat offenders, after due warnings, for <i>up to and including one month</i>, not longer. Blocking for 3RR may be done in a detached, straightforward manner, unlike blocks for 'lack of respect' or 'disruption', so you should take care to keep the two separate in your mind. No evidence for 3RRvios have been posted on <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_3RR_4b52.html" title="WP:AN/3RR">WP:AN/3RR</a>. You yourself said that Pigs and G-Man were equally 'borderline' about 3RRvios, and you blocked neither. You do realize, of course, that 3 reverts do not constitute a 3RRvio? This is not clear from your statement. It is true that both Pigs and G-Man appear to be gaming the 3RR, so protecting the article was a sensible move. 15:42, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Agreed.

<p>Thank you for all of your comments. The vandalism comment was from a talk template error, which is my fault, but I still don't understand the hullaballoo here. He was being disruptive and broke several policies, as stated above on <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Incidents_947b.html#Threat" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents">Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents#Threat</a>, I gave him a slap on the wrist that was prescribed under <b>Disruption</b> in <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBLOCK_89b0.html" title="WP:BLOCK">WP:BLOCK</a>, which I quote<br />
<i>For static IPs and user names, such blocks should initially last 24 hours</i>.<br />
Which is what I did. He was being disruptive at <a href="../../../c/o/l/Coleshill%2C_Warwickshire_f364.html" title="Coleshill, Warwickshire">Coleshill, Warwickshire</a>. Since I've stepped in, the disruption there has stopped, and he has limited himself to ad nauseum attacks on myself at <a href="../../../p/i/g/User_talk%7EPigsonthewing_6e18.html" title="User talk:Pigsonthewing">his talk page</a>, which I still think violates CIVIL and WQT, but i'll ignore if it acts as a release valve for him towards acting out on articles and other users.<br />
I don't understand this "Rogue Admin" tag, but regardless of it, I will continue to ask for advice from fellow admins when I feel I need outside assistance in a dispute, such as the beginnings of this thread, and I will continue to take that advice into account as I do my job as an admin. In my opinion, the Mediation system is too unresponsive and bureaucratic to solve problems like Pig's behavior, and I currently don't have the patience to reform it, so I'll do what I can to carry out Wikipedia's policies. My ultimate goal is to help Pigs evolve from his current state of random and frequent anger and incivility towards other users into a model Wikipedian, as I would with any problem user that I think I can help, and I ask any advice towards achieving this goal. My current belief is that he will eventually realize that his negative actions do not get him what he wants, and instead get him the opposite reaction, and he will act within <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> and <a href="../../../w/q/t/WP%7EWQT_eef8.html" title="WP:WQT">WP:WQT</a> as a result. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist">Karmafist</a> 21:05, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm sure you've all heard by now of supposed terrorist "sleeper cells" embedded in the US, seemingly leading normal, everyday, law-abiding lives, unsuspected by anyone, until that one day they get their "call" from their leader to awaken to unleash whatever heinous plot they were put in place to effectuate. I know for a fact that Wikipedia is hosting a similar phenomenon with its many "sleeper" trolls who create accounts and make legitimate edits, create friendships on-line, contribute, opine on policy, and generally become an accepted part of the Wikipedia community -- until they are "called" into action to wreak havoc on this site. Groups of these "sleeper trolls" right now are quietly contributing, not arousing suspicion, and will attack in coordinated fashion once they have won the trust of the general community.</p>
<p>The really scary part of it is that some of these "sleeper" accounts have done such a good job at crafting on-line friendships with other editors and making numerous (mostly minor) edits to articles that they have actually been elected/selected as Admins. I'm not saying that it has happened often, or that a large percentage of the 500 or so admins are in fact undercover "sleeper" trolls, but it is at least a handful -- enough to do major irreprable damage to the servers and stored information when they choose to attack.</p>
<p>I did catch wind of one plan in the works for one of them to quickly block the more dilligent admins while the other "sleeper" troll-admins quickly wipe out as much article info as possible before they are blocked/banned (while the first admin-troll busily keeps the "good" admins blocked and re-blocked from acting against them). It's more akin to a suicide attack, while the trolls know that doing that will get them banned (and negate all that time they spend winning people's trust) but the damage they can do to Wikipedia is worth it. Another thing is the "sleeper" troll-admins are emboldened by the fact that <i>nobody</i> gets de-sysopped on here anymore, nor has been for a long time.</p>
<p>Another version of this "game" is the "sleeper sockpuppet." Here a known troll creates numerous sockpuppet accounts and does <i>only</i> legitimate editing through them for several weeks, being careful to keep these "sleeper" socks very far away from the areas in which the "main" troll account is operating. Then, when matters with the original "troll" account get sticky or he needs some ready reinforcements on one of his schemes, he "calls up" his (seemingly legitimate user) "sleeper" sockpuppet accounts to support him. Since these sockpuppets often have hundreds of legitimate edits in their contribution history, they would not be suspected of being sockpuppets of a troll (since the great majority of sockpuppets are obvious, being brand new accounts with only a few edits to their history). The next time you see an established, respected, editor inexplicably leap to the defense of an obvious troll or disruptive editor, think about that. I think anyone who's been on Wikipedia long enough can think of instances that were puzzling at the time, but are now more understandable as being the work of "sleeper" trolls and sockpuppets.

Anyway, it was just a plan being discussed, I dont know whether it is going to be done; if admins can un-block themselves it'll take some tweaking. Plus, doing legitimate editing doesn't take that much time, the "sleepers" I personally know about do the "10+ a day" plan, where their goal is to make 10 legit edits on Wikipedia each day (one I knew even had it regimented into 5 article edits, 3 user talk edits to garner trust and friendship, and 2 policy page edits a day). That should only take 30-40 mins a day, and it adds up quick...In 3 months a sleeper account would have about 1000 edits, enough to make him a qualified admin candidate... Anyway, if I posted my hardcore evidence here, it would totally give away my identity (and many people would not work with me on articles again), but I think we know of a situation that's going on right now.

<dd>The irony is, that if these "sleeper" editors are contributing in sort-of-good-faith in order to make the appearances of a good-faith editor, they're helping the encyclopedia in the long-term, and when it comes time for them to rise up and wreak havoc, that'll be only temporary.

<dd>An interesting theory, with one obvious flaw: an admin (who isn't a bureaucrat) cannot effectively block another admin, since they could immediately unblock themselves. A bureaucrat could de-sysop an admin <i>and then</i> block them, but suggesting that one of our 20 bureaucrats is a "sleeper" is even more far-fetched than your current theory. <a href="../../../o/w/e/User%7EOwenX_7b06.html" title="User:OwenX">Owen×</a> <a href="../../../o/w/e/User_talk%7EOwenX_e744.html" title="User talk:OwenX"><big>☎</big></a> 20:18, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Actually, bureaucrats can't desysop, they can only promote.

It seems to me extremely unlikely that anyone would go through all that just to be able to get away with very slightly more destructive behaviour than a fresh account or anon IP could. The worst possible scenario would be a whole bunch of that happening at once, a coordinated attack from these sleeper-admins, anons, and vandalbots all at the same time, and... so what? At worst WP would have to roll itself back slightly to its pre-attack state, casing an outage of maybe an hour (we've certainly had worse outages than that for tech reasons). The sleeper-trolls will have put in an enormous amount of work for no real reward, and WP still gets the benefits of all their pre-attack work in exchange for a few minutes of chaos and a brief outage. No great harm would be done to WP or the world at large. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 20:31, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>My "refusal" was simply becasue I wasn't around to see that offer; I just got back from spending time with friends rather than being glued to a computer. Go figure. Compromise is also difficult when in his case, compromise means total surrender and letting unsourced and speculative original research in. In any case, as I have said numerous times, I welcome scrutiny. If TheDoctor10 believes I am overstepping any boundaries, he is welcome to file an RfC and bring it to the larger community.

<p>So, let me get this straight: there was a new user on the site for an hour or two. They created 3 or 4 testing non-articles (a flurry, as you say) and edited 2 other articles (without creating much of a scandal in either of them). You responded by accusing them of vandalism with an official-looking template on their talk page, deleting all their tests, despite one of them being marked {{userfy}}, and bringing their name to public attention making them look like an arch-vandal. Whatever happened to not biting the newcomers? <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_c719.html" title="User:Zocky">Zocky</a> 20:12, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is patently false. If they are not using IP, they can't get here. It is fundamental to the internet. I will further suggest, that they are probably using TCP/IP. They may or may not be using ethernet, but we don't really care about that. If we have vandalism from an IP address, then it came from there (or other extremely clever things were going on, which are beyond the scope of this discussion and unlikely in any event). <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikibofh_f636.html" title="User:Wikibofh">Wikibofh</a> 20:15, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Crawlbots should never have to edit articles.

<dd>Well, no not actually. Google does operate a limited SMS-&gt;google gateway, but as far as I know you can't actually edit wikipedia via it. It would be possible however...

<dd>It used to be possible to edit Wikipedia via the Google WAP proxy. I no longer own a mobile phone, so I can't check this now, but if I remember rightly, it wasn't possible last time I tried this. The same was true for translation sites like Babelfish which would display edits with a Yahoo IP (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Angela/Sandbox&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=2998872" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Angela/Sandbox&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=2998872" rel="nofollow">example</a>). If it is still possible to edit in this way, I think it's perfectly fair to block these IPs since they are effectively open proxies, and search engines shouldn't be indexing edit pages so won't be affected. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 21:31, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

He keeps reverting the article because he disagrees with another user who used the word "eliberated" when speaking about eliberating Moldova from Russian occupation. However, everytime he reverts the article, he not only reverts those edits that he expressed disagreement with, but also my edits. My edits consist of this fragment that I added to the article:</p>
<p><i>"The <a href="../../../m/o/l/Moldavian.html" title="Moldavian">Moldavian</a> chronicler, <a href="../../../g/r/i/Grigore_Ureche_d953.html" title="Grigore Ureche">Grigore Ureche</a> (<a href="../../../1/5/9/1590.html" title="1590">1590</a> - <a href="../../../1/6/4/1647.html" title="1647">1647</a>), established in his "Letopiseţul Ţării Moldovei" (</i>The Chronicles of the land of Moldavia<i>) that Moldavian (Moldovan) and Wallachian (Romanian from Wallachia) are essentially the same language; and that Moldavians and Wallachians share the same ethnicity."</i></p>
<p>I reverted the article back, as have other Romanians; but then, another user, most likely a friend of Node, reverted it back. I asked him to leave my edits in place; I told him that there is no justification for removing them. His answer was to revert the article, again, saying:</p>
<p><i>"rv - two reasons 1 - it's almost 400 years old 2. It's a POV statement 3. you also reverted other things.. Also, please read Wikipedia:Vandalism - what node didn't isn't vandalism. Hardly"</i></p>
<p>Am I insane? Isn't the article about Moldovan language? Aren't we supposed to talk about its history, even if it's 400 years old? Ureche was a respected chronicler and he was given support by the Moldavian Prince. <a href="../../../d/i/m/Dimitrie_Cantemir_365e.html" title="Dimitrie Cantemir">Dimitrie Cantemir</a> would later say the same thing. What's with the POV? I want to know why my fragment doesn't deserve its place in that article.</p>
