<p>Legislators in three states have introduced resolutions calling for the impeachment of U.S. President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney.</p>
<pre>
Wikipedia has one or more articles about 
</pre>
<p>Movement to impeach George W. Bush Public perception and assessments of George W. Bush.</p>
<p>US state legislators Karen Yarbrough of Illinois, Paul Koretz of California, and David Zuckerman of Vermont have each introduced resolutions to begin impeachment proceedings. Yarbrough and Koretz are Democrats, and Zuckerman is a member of the Vermont Progressive Party.</p>
<p>Yarbrough's resolution charges Bush with directing the National Security Agency to perform surveillance without a warrant in violation of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act; violating the torture conventions of the Geneva Convention, and "leaking classified national secrets to further an agenda." Koretz' similar resolution also calls for Cheney to be impeached.</p>
<p>Zuckerman introduced a resolution last Tuesday in the Vermont House of Representatives that asks Congress to "initiate impeachment proceedings against President George W. Bush." The resolution says "George W. Bush has committed high crimes and misdemeanors as he has repeatedly and intentionally violated the United States Constitution and other laws of the United States." Twelve Vermont state representatives (Democrats, Progressives, 1 Independent) have endorsed the resolution.</p>
<p>The Illinois resolution invokes Section 603 of Jefferson's Rules for the national House and Senate, which allows for the introduction of impeachment charges "by charges transmitted from the legislature of a State or territory." Section 604 also states that an impeachment charge brought by any means would be a privileged motion, superseding most other business in the U.S. House of Representatives.</p>
<p>As of April 30, the Illinois resolution has been referred to the Rules Committee and has been sponsored by 17 representatives including Yarbrough.</p>
<p>In response to the Vermont resolution, the state's Republican Party Chairman James Barnett said, "If this is the best they can do at this late hour of the legislative session, then it's time to close down shop and go home for the summer so they can explain to their constituents that they didn't reform health care because they were too busy trying to impeach the president."</p>
<p>According to a CBS poll, the President's public approval rating has steadily declined, and is so far at an all time low of 33%. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrometheuspan_2707.html" title="User:Prometheuspan">Prometheuspan</a> 20:41, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Indeed, given the previous explosiveness of Wolfstar and the near-LT's made before, this is quite too far. I know it's a p.i.t.a., but mediation is the next step, I'd say, unless anyone really thinks that an RFC will be controversial. I note also that the "have dirt" phrasing is familiar.

<dd>Don't even try to rationalise what that vandal did! <b>It is never acceptable for someone to post someone else's personal details!</b> If Alkivar wants to post his phone number, that's fine. It is not acceptable for anyone else to do so, regardless of whether they think it is or not! In my opinion, such vandals should be blocked without warning- they know what they're doing is not acceptable, otherwise they wouldn't put the phone number in the edit summary and post it in the main page featured article. --<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDeskana_5f27.html" title="User:Deskana">Lord Deskana</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDeskana_208e.html" title="User talk:Deskana">Dark Lord of the Sith</a></sup> 07:59, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I bet you didn't ask (oops I mean ASK) him if he minds either. I suspect he does mind, since he could publish his phone number on his user page if he wanted to, and has not. Even if he didn't mind, the rest of us do. Wikipedia edit summaries are not the place to publish phone numbers of individuals, with or without their approval. Quite apart from the privacy and harassment issues, it also involves vandalism of articles prominently linked from the main page.</dd>

<dd>Sure they can be removed. I remove rude or insistent comments on my talkpage now and then, and so do most people. It's not like removing vandalism warnings, you know. Not using rollback would have been better, since you weren't posting over and over (where people do that against my express wish, I do use rollback, and have no apologies for it) but taken together, this has to be one of the pettiest "abuse" complaints I've seen on this page. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 12:55, 7 May 2006 (UTC).

<dd>Still, different people have different opinions on what constitutes "rudeness". It's happened to me many times that people removed my comments from their talk page where I was mainly pointing out that they had made an error somewhere. It annoys me when people call other people "vandals" even though there is no vandalism going on, just an edit conflict. I usually leave a message on the user's talk page asking them not to do this, and then my comment is usually removed, probably because people don't want to have anything critical on their talk page. Personally, I remove profanities, but anything else anyone posts on my talk page stays there until I archive. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacoplane_198a.html" title="User:Jacoplane"><font color="#AE1C28">jaco</font></a>♫<a href="../../../j/a/c/User_talk%7EJacoplane_6d73.html" title="User talk:Jacoplane"><font color="#21468B">plane</font></a> 13:19, 7 May 2006 (UTC)

He is now asking for his contributions to be wiped from the project. Obviously this cannot be done for him, but he's also asking for the pages in his user space to be wiped, including User, Talk, etc. He says he wants to see a "red link" where his talk used to be. This step I'm less certain of. What generally is the policy on user-requested deletion of User space stuff? Delete none? Delete all?

<dd>IMHO, he is welcome back. He should serve a block, definitely, but the total exodus is his choice at this point. Yeah, he did go out in a blaze of vandalism, but it was all directed at one user, who has pretty much ignored the whole thing. But he was definitely a productive editor before this recent meltdown. So while he should definitely take some time off, I have no real problem with him returning under this or another user name at some point in the future after he has cooled off over all this. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasAndroid_b0eb.html" title="User:TexasAndroid">TexasAndroid</a> (<a href="../../../t/e/x/User_talk%7ETexasAndroid_eb8c.html" title="User talk:TexasAndroid">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TexasAndroid_29d7.html" title="Special:Contributions/TexasAndroid">contribs</a>) .</small>

<dd>I see it as a question of, what would have happened to him if he had done all the vandalism he did, but not asked to be blocked and basically left the project as he did? What would have been done to him in that case? Would he still have been indefinitely blocked? For me, personally, especially considering his long history as a valued editor, I would likely have given him a nice block, somewhere from a week to a month, and let that be it. I would not have given an indefinite block for a meltdown like this had he not asked to be blocked. But he did ask, so I did block. But given that I would have given a finite block if he had not asked to be blocked, I cannot see the "indefinite" part as being up to him. Should he return in a few months to a year much calmer, and hopefully repentant of his actions during this meltdown, I would have no problem giving him a second chance. Just my personal view of the situation. - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasAndroid_b0eb.html" title="User:TexasAndroid">TexasAndroid</a> 17:17, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Have I got the essentials right, here?
<ul>
<li><i>Preying from the Pulpit</i> was a six-part series of reports, aired as part of the regular 10:00 news by WJBK in Detroit. <i>PftP</i> was one segment of the half-hour news program.</li>
<li>Linked are audio recordings of five of the six <i>PftP</i> segments, taken from the news hour without permission.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>It looks, in that case, like we've linked to audio of the majority of the content discussed in the article, without the copyright owner's permission. On the article's talk page, a couple of putative 'fair use' arguments have been presented.</dd>
<dd>First is the notion that since the <i>PftP</i> segments linked represent only a small fraction of the week's entire newscast, this constitutes fair use under some sort of <i>de minimus</i> criterion. We've linked nearly all of <i>PftP</i>; it's the subject of the article, and the entire creative work being discussed. It's obviously a complete work in its own right; claiming that it's just a small part of the entire newscast seems irrelevant.</dd>
<dd>The second argument is that since we've only linked the audio, it should be fair use. I suspect that if we 'only' linked to the audio of (for example) two thirds of <i>Star Wars: A New Hope</i>, we wouldn't need to have this discussion. The audio is an essential part of the work, valuable in its own right. As far as the information content of <i>PftP</i> goes, the audio is probably more useful than the video.</dd>

<p>Well, if you search on 'tatu' in Wikipedia search, you come to the site 'Tatu', a redirection page to <a href="../../../t/2E/a/T.A.T.u._40c9.html" title="T.A.T.u.">t.A.T.u.</a>, and that's what it's supposed to be. There's a link to <a href="../../../t/a/t/Tatu_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Tatu (disambiguation)">Tatu (disambiguation)</a> in the beginning of the t.A.T.u. article to differ various uses. On that page, there's a link to a japanese erotic artist called Tatu. Now the user in question constantly reverts the 'tatu' search term to the pornographic artist, which I believe is not what many users seek when they want to search for 'tatu', in the most cases, it's t.A.T.u. they seek, but we also give the chance for other uses. It annoys me that the user don't even uses talk pages to explain himself, he just want this bondage rope artist to be the first thing people must enter when people search for supposedly t.A.T.u. Need help, he won't listen. Thanks in advance. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShandris_1379.html" title="User:Shandris">Shandris</a> 09:22, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>He added those yesterday, too.

<dd>To clarify, Ardenn has acted agressivly, as is his penchant in disputes, to wikilitigate this entire affair. I suggest that an adminstrator might want to look at his editing history and determine to what extent his desire was to resolve a dispute, and to what extent it was to agitate his opposition, and review said block in that light. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClarifier_e4ef.html" title="User:Clarifier">Clarifier</a> 18:38, 9 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Also recommend another admin (I am not one) look this over. I see aggressive behaviour by Ardenn which provoked Tasc into a borderline uncivil discussion with InShanee on Tasc's user talk page. A well chosen calming word combined with a second admonishment on not letting oneself be provoked would have made sense. A 1-2 hour block to make the point might be appropriate. A 48 hour block seems way excessive. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp_7670.html" title="User:Martinp">Martinp</a> 20:26, 9 May 2006 (UTC), an uninvolved party who visited after commenting on another AN:I incident involving Ardenn above.</dd>

<dd>For starters, it might be a good idea to quit deleting other people's comments. Unless a comment is a <i>pure</i> personal attack that does not express a view on any subject at hand, it's probably best to leave it stand. If someone makes dumb comments, that reflects badly on them; if you delete a comment that's not <i>entirely</i> dumb, that reflects badly on you.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It's a particularly bad idea to delete accusations that you have done something wrong. Even if you don't regard those accusations as <i>worth</i> responding to, deleting them makes it appear that you <i>can't</i> answer them. Let petty remarks stand for what they are. By deleting them, you make them appear more important, important enough that you want to silence them.</dd>

<li>Another good rule of thumb: NPA is not a policy, but rather a guideline. However, if it <i>were</i> a policy, all elements of it would need to be followed, and what is often overlooked is that, when a personal attack <i>is</i> removed, it <i>should be archived, with a note left in its place explaining the deletion and linking to the comment's new location.</i> I.e. it's never simple deletion. It's removal (to another location). I haven't reviewed this case and have no opinion on whether any one side's behavior has been an outrage, but it's worth reminding all readers from time to time that personal attack removal is not personal attack erasing. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 23:48, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

I was not doing personal attacks. Someone said these two people are the best here and I obviously wondered why so I plugged them into google and the links I gave are the first google results off wikipedia (mirrors included). Deleting things in talk pages is just plain bad. No matter what one claims as talk page comment is, if someone puts it in talk, that means it's not in the main article. I tried many different versions to please Malber, but all failed. In Malber's contributions, he removes comments from talk pages constantly. In my opinion he's a sock puppet of a more experienced editor who has an intense hatred of certain topics on wikipedia and instead of doing trolling and vandalism on their main account, which would bring it shame, they use a second account for the unsavory alter-ego edits. Malber basically goes around acting like he can do whatever he wants and always get his way. I believe he lied about "I have tried to remain cool" because talk-page-section-blanking-vandalism and harassment with giving a type acronym as the reason in attempt to game the system is not remaining cool nor is his trying to cause trouble for me on this page. One thing he cites of me was me editing my own text I had written, another is me asking the question to the original person I asked in the Brandt article on the original person's talk page (I included complaints about Malber's abuse toward me because I was upset and wanted to explain), another thing he cited was when Malber warned someone for making nonsense vandalism and I looked at the contribution and they only removed some POV adjectives and it looked like Malber warned someone out of sole enjoyment, and the last was Malber doing website-bashing disguised by gaming the system and the edits Malber has made that were attacks on the people who ran the site are notable so I alerted someone to Malber's strong POV.</p>
<p>Also Malber's account is kind of untruthful, he says I reinserted the same thing and it was a much toned down version. I did mention Malber's talk-page-section-blanking vandalism as I felt trying to censor myself to please Malber would make me look bad. Malber so far had just basically at that point been reverting and gaming the system to give a reason--and in my humble opinion he reverts out of sport and enjoyment (this is not something particular to him as I've seen many people do it across the wikis). He claimed he gave a warning and he leaves out that I responded to it, disputing his claims and after. Then I go through his contributions and find he does abuse to everyone. Also he violated the 3RR rule for constant reverts. None of what I put in was the same information. I ask an injunction against Malber for 3RR violations and talk page vandalism, preventing him from blanking my comments. I did not make any attacks--and any criticism was made by others (such as a forum on a website). <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDyslexicEditor_aec8.html" title="User:DyslexicEditor">DyslexicEditor</a> 02:56, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

Even though the user stopped after the last 3RR warning, that could have simply been the user having to stop editing for whatever reason. The edit summaries showed no signs of wanting to seek consensus, and previous warnings had been given. In addition this is likely a sock account, so I'll place a <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFCU_026f.html" title="WP:RFCU">WP:RFCU</a> if they continue. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetros471_bbc1.html" title="User:Petros471">Petros471</a> 09:22, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have stuck my neck right out by blocking 190 Proof indefinitely. His user page, his talk page, his edits, his edit summaries are all chock full of abuse, obscenity, and hate speech towards Muslims. The depth of 190 Proof's hatred and anger really comes across in his contribution history, and it is blatantly obvious that he is unwilling and possibly unable to reign in his emotions to write from a neutral point of view. I have extended an invitation to him to appeal his block if and when he is willing to conform to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>.</p>
<p>I have no idea if my actions are in accordance with policy, but I'm damned sure they're good for the encyclopaedia.

<dd>(IANAA) I almost always look with disfavor on indef blocks (especially for users with few contributions, who may later comport themselves with Wikipedia policy and become productive editors, irrespective of initial volitional disruptions) and almost always oppose blocks that rest in substantial part (this one likely doesn't) on a user's contributions to his/her user page, even where those contributions tend to defame classes (as against individual editors), but, having reviewed the user's contribs, I agree wholly with this indef block.

<p>Just a query — if an anonymous IP or a newly registered account makes an edit saying in the edit summary "Admin Bishonen's home phone number is (telephone number redacted)" (I made that up, by the way, so if it really is Bishonen's phone number, that will be the most amazing coincidence) and putting that text into the edit as well, what is an admin supposed to do (over and above rolling back the edit and blocking the account)? I wouldn't hesitate to delete the page and restore all versions except the offending one if it's a page with a few hundred edits, and I know that one can contact a developer for removal of personal information on larger pages (or for removal of personal information so that even admins can't see it). But there's always the suspicion that it's a time-wasting hoax, and that the editor's number isn't that one at all. Last year, an anon posted my address and phone number to my talk page in the middle of the night (Irish time), and an admin (I wasn't one myself then) very kindly did a big delete and partial undelete. But in fact, it wasn't my address or phone number at all; it was just a made up one. I saw it happening with a talk page this morning (not Bishonen's number, someone else's) — it was rolled back by another admin — and I did a rough count of versions in the history. There seem to be approximately 6,000. I did a deletion/part-restoration of a page with over 3000 versions at the Easter weekend, and my arm was aching at the end. (By the way <i><b>why</b></i> doesn't someone invent a button that you can click that says check all boxes, so that you can quickly carry out the part-restoration?) I don't think I'd have time at the moment to do that job, and I'm not even sure I should with such a big page, as it could cause the server to crash. And, in all likelihood, it's a hoax.

<dd>This was a common problem we were having yesterday. The history that contains the phone number should be deleted, and the article should be restored without that history. This happened to all of the pages that are linked from the Main Page. I think the way to do this is restore only the offending history, move it to another page, and then restore the rest.

<dd><b>Non-admin comment.</b> I just accidentally stumbled upon Avillia's request for unblock, and I hate to go against so many respectable admins, but I have to disagree with this block. I've been fed up with Avillia since day one when he started harassing me about <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVandalProof_b972.html" title="WP:VandalProof">WP:VandalProof</a> and posed serious threats to the project's survival; then I came across the FreeAWB incident and suggested that the user be blocked or taken to an <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERfC_a13a.html" title="WP:RfC">WP:RfC</a>; then I came across the IRC logs incident; then I saw the <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERfC_a13a.html" title="WP:RfC">WP:RfC</a> his opened for Tawker and Essjay; then I saw the personal attacks on his userpage, and I was utterly convinced that the user should be banned. However, since then the user has calmed down quite significantly, has removed FreeAWB links from his page and apologized for the incident, has apologized to me, and he has now actually begun helping me out with <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVandalProof_b972.html" title="WP:VandalProof">WP:VandalProof</a>, providing a lot of very useful input about how to improve the tool. Maybe I'm just assuming way, way, way too much good faith here, but I feel the user may actually be making an honest attempt to improve. I feel he may be able eventually to contribute quite a lot to the encyclopedia, and I certainly don't think he is a lost cause. I understand that he has exausted your patience, and I don't blame you one bit, but perhaps a shorter block (maybe 3 months?) with continued probation thereafter might be more appropriate, rather than an indefinite ban. In any case, it's likely quite inconsequential--I have no doubt that after the user is banned, he will return again anonymously as a sockpuppet, and perhaps he'll continue down the same road or maybe he will actually help to build an encyclopedia. In any case, I certainly don't want this to appear as support for Avillia's actions; rather, I would just like to ask you all to maybe consider a less permanent "punishment." <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 04:47, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Ashibaka (glad to see I'm not the only one who thinks this is harsh!). He did threaten to remove authentication from VP, but as source code was never provided, he never accomplished this. I was also not sure about the anon who vandalized with FreeAWB (I was just returning to ask about that when I saw this comment), as I think that may have just been a rumor. I would entirely support a ban from #wikipedia, but his actions off-wiki should not result in his being banned here. I might also note that, when Avillia first began posting IRC logs, it had not been "officially" made policy that doing so was prohibited--the majority of his actions following that result from confusion regarding the, in his opinion, unprovoked deletion of the logs and threats of being blocked, for something he did not know was prohibited. Naturally, he didn't deal with the situation well, and he is kind of a hot-head, but I'm not sure that's a reason to be banned. Oh, and I didn't see this until the edit conflict--I totally agree that any future attempts to remove authentication from semibots, deface tools, or encourage others to do the same should result in an immediate block (call it a semibot probation). <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 05:03, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Has it? I wasn't entirely sure about that, but I was under the impression that the policies were changed during Swatjester's RfA. In any case, I'll admit that I wasn't particularly involved in the conflict between him and Essjay, Tawker, etc. From the involvement I've had with them, I entirely trust their judgment (especially Tawker); thus, if they feel the dispute they had with him alone warrants an indef block, I will beyond a doubt support it. I just wanted to state that I no longer hold anything against Avillia for his disputes with me, and I don't feel the points about VP, FreeAWB, 3RR, and IRC made above warrant an indef block. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 05:19, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It has. The policy was <i>clarified</i> because rules lawyers like Avillia tried to scream they weren't given due notice, but I personally talked with Avillia before he was given access to #vandalism-en-wp, and outlined our rules specifically. He was told, in no uncertain terms, that he was being given an extraordinarily rare second chance (he'd already been refused access by at least two others), and that it was his responsibility to make himself aware of and abide by all channel policies. #vandalism-en-wp does not operate under the same policies as the #wikipedia channels, and has always had a policy against logging, as evidenced by the dozens of people who came out immediately to tell him he was violating it. <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <font color="#7B68EE">(<small><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">Talk</font></a> • <font color="#7B68EE">Connect</font></small>)</font> 06:52, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I know for a fact that getting banned from <a href="../../../s/o/m/Something_Awful_Forums_a7ce.html" title="Something Awful Forums">some network or another</a> doesn't preclude the privilege of editing... he has been a bit annoying sometimes, and his recent activity might be grounds for a block of some length, but I don't think he has actually harassed anyone. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> <small><a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">tock</a></small> 05:22, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Banning from non-Wikipedia networks is not by itself a blockable offense. Presumably if a convicted murderer was making good edits we would let the murderer edit. On the other hand, disruption of #wikipedia is in its own special category because it is almost an appendage of the Wiki. The best argument for an indefinite ban is that Avillia has simply exhausted the community's patience by his actions. As to that claim, I am not convinced of that (having only actually seen the Wikipedia half of this problem and not the #wikipedia part). I would like to give Avillia one more chance and if any out of the line behavior occurs, an indefinite block will result. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 05:29, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>I agree with JoshuaZ as well. I feel that off-wiki actions should not be grounds for a block here, though his actions on #wikipedia do suggest a threat to Wikipedia itself. In any case, if Avillia is as good a hacker as he has made himself out to be, whether we block him or not will not disable him from disrupting Wikipedia. I also feel that his on-wiki disruptions seem to have been primarily provoked by the fact that no one, myself included, ever even tried assuming good faith. Nonetheless, I am very bothered by his earlier attacks on Wikipedia, claiming it is built upon a "cabal" mentality, and that coupled with his skill at hacking suggests that he may well seek to disrupt Wikipedia. Yet I feel we may just be poking a sleeping beast by blocking him, and his actions on-wiki, though frustrating and annoying, have not been sufficiently hazardous enough to warrant an indefinite block. As I said before, a ban really does nothing--he'll create a sockpuppet and return, perhaps quietly, perhaps not. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 05:41, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>I didn't make the connection until reading it here, but over the last 6-10 weeks I have been getting disconnected from Freenode (with a generic mirc error message), and I think Avillia is responsible. I asked in #wikipedia, and got a message shortly thereafter purporting to be from avillia in which he admitted responsiblity. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> 05:40, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am the #wikipedia channel operator who has banned Avillia on that IRC channel. It was in response to an assertion by a Freenode staffer that Avillia was the user who had been maliciously disconnecting users from IRC using a couple of exploits. I will reiterate that banning from #wikipedia should <b>not</b> be seen as being at all related to a user's editing privileges. They are two entirely different spheres. There is not even 100% proof that Avillia was the offending user. So please do not even consider off-wiki behaviour in this instance. - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_d9f5.html" title="User:Mark">Mark</a> 05:42, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

Avillia claims that someone faked his identity and hostname, and apparently Lilo will be able to confirm/disprove this tomorrow by checking logs. If it is found that he was not actually responsible for the IRC exploits, then the list of reasons for this indef block has been whittled down to: 3RR, IRC logging, and the removal of authentication from <a href="../../../a/w/b/WP%7EAWB_c695.html" title="WP:AWB">WP:AWB</a>, which I personally don't feel warrants an indefinite ban. If he is found to have been responsible for the IRC trolling, then I could support a somewhat longer block, but again not an indefinite one. I might also note that Avillia is a self-admitted member of GNAA, though he has not participated in the trolling of Wikipedia, and he claims to have not been involved in the freenode trolling either. That may or may not influence this decision. I feel that most of the support for this ban has arisen from speculative and circumstantial evidence, and I certainly don't think any decision should be finalized until some of these points can be proven. I might note that two of these speculative points have already been disproven: no anon vandalized using FreeAWB, and the authentication was never removed from VP, and the final point has also been disproven insofar as no one has yet confirmed that Avillia was indeed involved in the DCC exploits.

<dd>What I meant was that I don't want to appeal the ban, but rather I want to wait for more hard evidence to come in, see what I feel after that, and see if the admins here still feel that a ban was necessary. The only reason for taking this to the ArbCom, in my opinion, would be if the admins could not reach a consensus after that point, and if it showed signs of becoming a wheel war (which the preemptive removal of Avillia's block already indicates might be the case). If the admins seem generally to agree that this ban is necessary (which they don't at this point, but may after more evidence comes in), I will certainly drop it. If, after the rest of the facts are made available, the admins generally agree that the ban should be lifted, then I'd assume others would also have the same decency to let it go. I certainly don't want it to appear that I'm debating, I'm just trying to get to the truth of the matter. As I've said before, I totally understand why you so passionately oppose Avillia, as I've felt this same disdain for him as well; however, I still feel it necessary and decent to investigate the possibility that he may have been unfairly treated. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 17:18, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I didn't read through the whole conversation, but it seems like some of the justifications for the block are for off-site incidents. IRC, sourceforge, hacking of other software. None of those activities took place here on en.wp, therefore indefinite ban based on them is wrong (no matter how harmful those activities may be). On the other hand, 3RR here on WP is a clear violation.

<dd>Kelly Martin has blocked Avillia for one week; let's leave it that way for now, please. I personally feel that removing the block entirely went against the discussion here, as I feel there are definitely grounds for blocking at this point and that most everyone here has agreed upon that. The only question is how long the block should extend, primarily whether it should be indefinite or not. Though there do seem to be a lot of people opposed to an indef block at this point (and people, like me, waiting to hear all of the evidence before making up my mind), it would seem few object to <i>at least</i> a week's block (though some have suggested a 24hr block instead). I'd just hope the admins here would refrain from wheel-warring, both from removing the block and lengthening the block, as that just complicates matters further. In a week's time, there may be consensus to unblock, to permablock (though that's looking less likely), or this may go to the ArbCom; in any case, it doesn't seem to make a difference whether she is currently blocked for a week or blocked indefinitely. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 20:58, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If there is serious objection to the block, then we can't consider it a community decision, can we? Since lethe objects, send it to ArbCom to reinstate the indef block (however long that process will take). ArbCom gets it right typically and why should we invite wheel warring when we have ArbCom? (For example, I am happy with how ArbCom stepped up with the new ruling in the StrangerInParadise case, instead of their leaving it to any random admin to decide whether to impose an indef block.) Until ArbCom decides something on Avillia, he can be blocked as any other user can be for infractions, just not indefinitely. In due time, ArbCom will make the right ruling. A one week block seems good for now. <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_ac1a.html" title="User:NoSeptember"><font color="green"><b>NoSeptember</b></font></a> <a href="../../../n/o/s/User_talk%7ENoSeptember_6dda.html" title="User talk:NoSeptember"><font color="green"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></font></a> 21:15, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree. I'd hoped bringing in the ArbCom wouldn't be necessary, but as it's now turned to wheel-warring, this seems to be the only solution.

I can live with a week. Of course, just a comment to you, September: if we do send it to ArbComm, then we cannot reinstate the permban, as Avillia will have to be expected to be able to edit his ArbComm case.

<p><b>Comment.</b> I've been waiting for some time for Lilo to get back online so I can ask him to confirm this (and I will post again once he has); however, as I have come to understand it, freenode officials after reviewing the case today have concluded that there is no definitive evidence that Avillia was involved in the IRC DCC exploits and the malicious and intentional disconnecting of several users from freenode. As there is no evidence to the contrary, I'm going to assume that his story, that someone impersonated him by faking hostnames and identities, is still a possibility; as such, I feel the claim that "A FreeNode official has investigated and confirmed that Avillia has been using IRC DDC exploits that affect [Cyde] and others on the #wikipedia channel" can be disregarded as invalid. I might also note that, again to my understanding, Avillia is not currently k-lined, though he is banned from #wikipedia. In any case, I still feel that, even if Avillia were found to be guilty of this accusation, his actions off-wiki should not result in banishment on-wiki.</p>
<p>With the IRC issue disregarded, the VandalProof claim disproven, and the claim that FreeAWB was used for fast-paced vandalism left unreferenced, unconfirmed, and unproven (not even the IP address has yet to provided), we are now left with the following three reasons for an indefinite ban: (quoted from Cyde above)</p>

(As I said above, the user has actually now approached me with helpful ideas for improving the tool and seems to have recognized that his earlier actions were misguided.)</p>
<p>I might also add that Avillia is a self-admitted member of <a href="../../../g/n/a/GNAA_29cf.html" title="GNAA">GNAA</a> and has participated in trolling on other sites, though he now claims to be inactive in the organization. At the same time, there are several members of GNAA on Wikipedia, even some who troll Wikipedia, who have not been blocked and have had no administrative action taken against them. Anyway, you all know my stance on the issue, so I won't bother repeating it--I just wanted to get the facts straight.

In response he said, "Yeah. It was a really stupid slashdot post...One first post on Slashdot with the GNAA signatory, watching a idiotic but hilarious movie filled with racial and ethnic slurs, and answering 20 questions about aforementioned movie, given by means of IRC bot" (republished with his permission). It certainly doesn't do much to boost his character sketch, but I still don't feel it's a reason for an indefinite ban. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 00:03, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure what the deal with IRC logs is. I note that wikipedia talk pages, wiki-en mail list discussions and USENET discussions are available to the entire internet in perpetuam. Furthermore, the courts have ruled that emails are publishable by either side taking part in the discussion. Given that the IRC cabal sometimes has an effect on WP policy, I don't see any reason why they should expect to have their conversations guarded in perfect secrecy. Just because people don't like having their IRC logs posted doesn't explain why it's a blockable offense. -<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_sig_226e.html" title="User:Lethe/sig">lethe</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_sig_fced.html" title="User talk:Lethe/sig">talk</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" rel="nofollow">+</a></sup> 01:26, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not entirely clear on it either, but apparently it has to do with privacy policy violations and laws prohibiting the unconsensual logging and publication of online, two-party chats. <a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/columnists/23" class="external text" title="http://www.securityfocus.com/columnists/23" rel="nofollow">This</a> is, perhaps, related.

<dd>If you are talking about the prohibition on public logging of #wikipedia, it isn't outlined in depth anywhere. It has just been that way for a very long time. The policy is not made by the note on meta; the note is nothing more than a note. Since the channels are services of Freenode, rather than Wikimedia, they first and foremost follow the Peer Directed Projects Centre policies and <a href="http://freenode.net/channel_guidelines.shtml" class="external text" title="http://freenode.net/channel_guidelines.shtml" rel="nofollow">guidelines</a>. Notable in the guidelines is the following: "If you just want to publish a single conversation, be careful to get permission from each participant." Wikipedia Policy is not <i>made</i> on IRC (or on the mailing list, for that matter), it's made on Wikipedia proper. Taking it a bit further, if admins knew each other in real life and happened to discuss Wikipedia policy on a conference call on the phone, would we not block if someone uploaded recordings of their conversations? I fail to see why one is wrong and one is okay. - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_d9f5.html" title="User:Mark">Mark</a> 15:20, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

Even then, I fail to see how PDPC rules apply to Wikipedia actions. The channel in question is also #vandalism-en-wp, not #wikipedia (AFAIK, going from Pathoschild's DRV comments again). I don't think we should block someone for uploading a recorded conference call either, if they capitulate and do not persist in reposting it (AGF and all that) and I do not know of Avilia reposting the logs on Wikipedia after being told not to.

<p>I don't have much to weigh in on here except the unblock while discussion of the block was specifically ongoing and most people agreeing at least some block was needed is absolutely the wrong thing to do. No one should ever revert another admin's call (much less many admins agreeing with the call) unless there is consensus to do so. Following that would prevent all wheel wars. There are few admin actions so urgent they can't wait for consensus to develop, especially after the least risk option has been chosen. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 05:35, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree that a complete unblock should not have been done, but the way community bans are normally described is that someone indef blocks them and <i>no one</i> is willing to unblock them, since lethe is/was willing to unblock it really isn't a ban then. It would make more sense to block for a week, post here, and if there is support for an indef block/ban go through with it. There is no rush to indef block someone. Even if consensus cannot be reached or there is some bizarre delay you can always reblock for another week them while discussion continues. Kotepho 16:59, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Anyway, it looks to me like you all have been rather aggressive. I can see the politics running through all of your comments, interpreting her edits as politically motivated and responding according to your votes. I can understand bias — only the ignorant masses do not understand bias! But, I can't sit back and just let this happen without standing up and saying something.</dd>
<dd>Hah, silly to think that my words matter. You all are administrators, warriors charging into battle against the vigilant vandal, the persistent POV pusher, and the unctious usurper. You bravely go into the history and block logs, looking for places where the bureaucracy's policies tell you to block or ban. Above all, you do not question, especially when it comes to policy and opinion. You do not care anything for nothing, unless it is in the page or in your heads. That is you.</dd>
<dd>This is me. I'm an average editor. I've made roughly 1200 edits, according to Interiot. I usually don't do a lot of radical things. I'm not stupid, like the masses are. I'm well aware of your love of the block button, your tendencies to quote policy, your official bearing and high stature. I'm even aware that at the moment, your finger is moving towards the "Block Corbin" switch while you prepare to quote WP:NPA, saying "Your post at WP:ANI was considered a personal attack. You have been blocked for 24 hours," leaving me with a note on my talk page and a day of no edits or contributions.</dd>
<dd>The sad thing is, you <b>would</b> think that what I have just said is a personal attack. After reading your posts, I am not so sure anymore whether or not any of you would be capable of leaning back and assuming good faith from me. I am not so sure whether or not you could look at my words and think of them as a critique of the administrator system as a whole, rather than as an attack on each administrator individually.</dd>
<dd>Coming full circle, this is where we reach Thewolfstar. I'm not sure what to say about her. After all, I've only come to know her personally as a result of seeing a fellow Esperanzian under attack. I can't think of anything in official policy that can help her. These words, assuming they are not deleted, mean nothing when compared to the weight of the administrative community's judgement.</dd>
<dd>So, here is what I'd like. This may seem arrogant, and will certainly fly in the face of all the community has ever done or seen. I'd like to try something liberal (*gallery collectively gasps*) for a change. Let's have a talk. Not an attempt at concensus, not an arbitration, not a request for comment, not a plea for unblocking, but just a talk. All I want is for people to bring forth their grievances, and for us to see the entire issue laid out on one page. No attacks, no revenge, no anger, just talking. I want to see how much of the community really believes in the assumption of good faith.</dd>
<dd>After all, I assume that there will be no reprisals for me voicing my view of the issue here, where it stands for all to read and ponder.

<dd>She noticed the same thing that I noticed: There is indeed a high level of corruption here. Her words are much stronger than mine, which is why she was selected for blocking. Of course, the implication that she will somehow get revenge against Wikipedia is against policy, and the implication that there is a cabal (There Is No Cabal) is why she must be silenced. I'm striving to stay neutral here, but the Orwellian implications of what has unfolded here are very hard to ignore. Don't make any bad choices, ladies and gentlemen. Before, I was just going to go to bed and check this in the morning, but now my curiousity is piqued and I just can't wait to see if anything happens after this. - <strong><a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorbinSimpson_55db.html" title="User:CorbinSimpson"><font color="#0033CC">Corbin</font></a> <a href="../../../w/p/m/WP%7EWPM_9a68.html" title="WP:WPM"><font color="red">∫</font></a> <a href="../../../8/w/_/WP%7E8W_03c1.html" title="WP:8W"><font color="orange">1</font></a> <a href="../../../m/e/a/WP%7EMEA_d033.html" title="WP:MEA"><font color="gold">ɱ</font></a> <a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_03e8.html" title="WP:ESP"><font color="lime">p</font></a> <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPATRA_5b5c.html" title="WP:SPATRA"><font color="blue">s</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_CorbinSimpson_9722.html" title="Special:Contributions/CorbinSimpson"><font color="indigo">ɔ</font></a> <a href="../../../w/p/m/WP%7EWPMU_ef61.html" title="WP:WPMU"><font color="violet">♫</font></a></strong> <sup><a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECorbinSimpson_68d4.html" title="User talk:CorbinSimpson">Rock on, dude!</a></sup> 05:09, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Not to put too fine a point on it, Corbin, but from what I've seen, your fellow Esperanzan did most of the attacking, herself. I tried to get her to relax and take a wikibreak last week, when it might have done some good. She wouldn't listen, and went back to calling people names. For chrissakes, she put up images on her userpage comparing wikipedia to Nazi Germany, and she expects to be unblocked?? I tried to get her to shut up and give people time to cool off and forget about it. She wouldn't even reply to my latest attempt. I suppose someone must have told her I'm secretly the cabal's towel boy.  :P Go to bed.

<p>I had a long phone conversation with Thewolfstar. It's my personal opinion that her personal philosophy is incompatible with wikipedia and that’s why she has had so many problems here. We don't need to make up come cabal to explain what happened here.</p>
<p>I had hoped that I had made her understand what was happening here was (at the least) partly her fault. I thought she was going to calm down. It seems like she had corrected some of her behavior. She wasn't making personal attacks any more, right?</p>
<p>Theres alot about the phone call I'm not going to get into but if this comes up again I can offer my two cents feeling that I'm well informed. ---<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User%7EJ.smith_e018.html" title="User:J.smith">J.S</a> (<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User_talk%7EJ.smith_6ef6.html" title="User talk:J.smith">t</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_J.smith_698b.html" title="Special:Contributions/J.smith">c</a>) 16:25, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Quick summary here: a number of IPs and newly-created accounts have been continuously reverting a rewrite of the article over a period of months. After the page was protected, they refused to work on the rewrite to address their concerns in the least, effectively halting all progress on the article. Currently it has been protected for weeks pending the outcome of a CheckUser, which has fallen through.</p>
<p>I consider "these" roadblockers to be one sockpuppeting editor: hoaxer, page-move vandal, impersonator and general troll <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoeCroydon_9af0.html" title="User:ZoeCroydon">ZoeCroydon</a>, based on the fact that no other editors have taken this position, and similarities in style, including some dead giveaways - for example, always incorrectly putting a space after an opening bracket ( like this)<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=44190946" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=44190946" rel="nofollow">[49]</a> and adept wikilawyering (complaints that editors are breaking "the good faith rule" being a favourite). See also Category:Wikipedia:Suspected sockpuppets of ZoeCroydon and Category:Wikipedia:Sock puppets of ZoeCroydon. After these socks were all banned for hoaxing, they seem to have adapted to this more subtle form of trolling, with a host of new socks and a lot of edits from IPs.</p>

<dd>Nah, salting the earth isn't necessary, but you just pointed out a problem with the article. <i>I</i> read "petticoating" as men going out dressed as boys dressed as girls, unfortunately the article makes no effort to distinguish fact and {{<a href="../../../f/i/c/Template%7EFiction_983c.html" title="Template:Fiction">fiction</a>}} and pictures it mothers dressing their sons as girls.

<p>This story may seem longinsh but it seems so plain to me that I decided to post this here rather than to start an user:RfC with this or post it to an ArbCom page. From what I've seen at the ArbCom, such cases get rejected with arbitrators' saying that there is nothing to spend time on as the evident block is in order. I could post this message unaltered to an RfC (and this would have been the first user RfC started by me) but again what's the point of waisting some many people's time on commenting on this? Instead I am posting it here directly to the attention of the Admins, as this seems to be a case clearly calling for an admin action rather then the continuation of the endless discussions. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 06:20, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>AlexPU was blocked 24h for <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> violations on 8 May and has only made one edit since, a defiant but tolerable comment on his Talk page. I suggest a longer block for subsequent violations, and if he continues we can raise a user RfC. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 13:00, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>JzG, while I agree with your suggestion to not rush with a longer block (while I disagree that his message was "tolerable"), I see no point in user RfC should this continue (as it most likely will). The point with the user RfC is to bring the issue to a wider audience. This issue has already received a wide prominence as you can see from how many people tried to talk to the guy at his and the article's talk pages where he scattered his offences. By the post above I simply wanted to let others know that the user needs watched since the Admin who blocked him and was in return accused in whatever may perceive that, as the person being attacked, it is unethical for him to block the offender on his own.</dd>

<dd>As this continues I am prepared to post the diffs above straight to ArbCom as I know that ArbCom members have little tolerance to obvious malaise. It's just that I thought that the case is too obvious to even bother the ArbCom which is already slow due to an overload with the cases much more complex than this. Anyway, let's see what comes next. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 17:20, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's obviously the same person, but I'm inclined to assume good faith for a little while longer (well, to assume stupidity rather than malice, looking at the <i>extremely</i> poor quality of the non-pagemove edits).

<dd>What I want is an option to selectively delete edits, rather than having to delete the whole page and then restoring selectively.

<p>I delete all, restore the bad version(s), move it to /bad and restore the rest. Then I delete /bad. This is quick and works for me.

<dd>I don't understand why anyone would do something so complicated when you can just delete, protect, restore the good edits, and unprotect. If you really want to (I personally think it's a Bad Thing) you can restore the bad edits first, move them and delete them there.
