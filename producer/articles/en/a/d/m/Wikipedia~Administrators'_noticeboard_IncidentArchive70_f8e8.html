<p>An admin caught this but now he is doing more of the same behaviour as you can see looking at his contributions. He has been following around reverting edits I make on purpose just to harass me.</p>

The privilege of editing Wikipedia has nothing to do with freedom of speech. This is a project to build an encyclopedia. Why don't you try going to the <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i> and insist on your constitutional right to insert "flaming communist homo" and "fucking bitch truckstop whore" in it? Everybody is invited to edit here, but the invitation is withdrawn if somebody is a mere drain on the project. I'm sorry Fighterforfreedom feels bad, and I'm even sorrier his sister (who is apparently not too retarded to navigate this site, something many healthy adult new users find quite challenging) talks exactly like he does. Please don't post on my page under any name again, it will only be removed. If you continue spamming this noticeboard with your unreasonable complaints, now that the case has already been fully discussed here, they will be removed on sight, too. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 23:04, 27 January 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>Oh, I feel that I should say some more anyway: all the rank article vandalism to Russia and China seemed to be adding two gold bars under the US category, along with the rank order: Second Lieutenant, Lieutenant, and First Lieutanant, neither of which exist, of course. He also came up with some rank on his own called Podpraporschik (which, as a vandal article, was deleted - that's why that is a red link and not a blue one). This user should have been dealt with a long time ago, and I am sick of this silly "He'll go away" attitude by adminstrators I have confronted.

<dd>I recall that there's an official policy somewheres (I think at <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">WP:FU</a>) that says fair-use images are not to be used in the user: namespace. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 19:11, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is the policy from <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">WP:FU</a>: "Fair use images should only be used in the article namespace. Used outside article space, they are often enough not covered under the fair use doctrine. They should never be used on templates (including stub templates and navigation boxes) or on user pages. They should be linked, not inlined, from talk pages when they are the topic of discussion. This is because it is the policy of the Wikimedia Foundation to allow an unfree image only if no free alternative exists and only if it significantly improves the article it is included on. All other uses, even if legal under the fair use clauses of copyright law, should be avoided to keep the use of unfree images to a minimum. Exceptions can be made on a case-by-case basis if there is a broad consensus that doing so is necessary to the goal of creating a free encyclopedia (like the templates used as part of the Main Page)."--<a href="../../../a/l/h/User%7EAlhutch_2589.html" title="User:Alhutch">Alhutch</a> 19:15, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Yes, I inadvertently fell foul of that a while ago. On that occasion, though, the person who alerted me merely removed the image and left me a polite note in explanation. Gmaxwell has for some time been behaving very oddly and aggressively with regard to image violations (real or occasionally imagined). Here, he's misapplying a rule about fair-use images to the use of public-domain images, and doing so in a heavy-handed manner. Judging by the comments on his Talk page, he's heading for an RfC. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 19:21, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>His behaviour is outrageous. Firstly, where fairuse images are wrongly on user pages it is invariably due to a misunderstanding, not an attempt to break the law. All he had to do was leave a message, not post a <b>massive</b> notice all but accusing the user of being a lawbreaker. Secondly, he is not removing the offending image, but all images, even those that can be displayed. Thirdly, blanking a user's page is grossly disrespectful to other users. Frankly, he is out of control at this stage. This bullying behavour of his has to stop. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:#006666; background-color:orange"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 19:36, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am confused, the original poster (Husnock) says Gmaxwell is declaring user pages using Wikipedia Commons images copyvios, surely Husnock meant fair use images rather than Commons?

<p>OK, his contribs list is beyond the pale. It's vandalism, pretty clearly. You just need to remove the image and leave a talk page message, and you don't need to blank others' userpages. It's behaviour I'd expect from an editor on a rampage, which, frankly, Gmaxwell is. Note in particular <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_Unusual_Files_3aab.html" title="User:Carnildo/Unusual Files">User:Carnildo/Unusual Files</a>, which is merely a <i>list of links</i> to images, and contains no images at all. Evidently, Gmaxwell has blindly been applying his new policy without any thought. I've reverted all his edits (yes, with rollback), and yes, I know that exposes fair use images in userspace. Gmaxwell can jolly well go and remove them as appropriate by hand+talk page if he's that concerned about it. Further, he's been doing ridiculous things with userboxes very recently, and calling people <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AGmaxwell&amp;diff=36231615&amp;oldid=36211348" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AGmaxwell&amp;diff=36231615&amp;oldid=36211348" rel="nofollow">assholes</a>.

<p>Some of these edits seem a little odd. I see clear evidence of good faith efforts made by the blocking administrator and others to raise these edits with the user on his talk page, but no response.</p>
<p>In particular I thought the blanking of <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_Unusual_Files_3aab.html" title="User:Carnildo/Unusual Files">User:Carnildo/Unusual Files</a> looked odd because at first sight it contained no inlines. However on investigating I discovered that it contained "Image" links with no preceding colon--it's possible that Greg is interpreting these as inlines, although in practise the ogg files in question are presented as links. I interpret this as a good faith error, or at least an alternative interpretation of a borderline case, by Gmaxwell.</p>
<p>On the blanking of the fair use pages, I think that's a very laudable objective, but the lack of interaction here is worrying. If one performs a lot of quite provocative edits--even if as here they're clearly reasonable and defensible, it's important to be responsive and available to discuss and defend them and to help repair damage caused by errors. Notices on talk pages explaining the issue and asking for the user in question to remove disputed fair use material would have been wise; I am looking but as yet see no evidence that this mass blanking was preceded by such efforts.</p>
<p>I want to stress again that I regard the objective here as laudable, and I'm certain that "fair use" claims on inline uses of image file on user pages will one pretty soon become a thing of the past on Wikipedia; the legal exposure to the site is too great to ignore for long. This was not the way to advance towards that objective, however. The block was necessary to stop the user continuing his ongoing actions without discussion. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 20:49, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wow! Look what I started! As to my own userpage, are flags a violation of these strange rules and regulations? Displaying a country or city flag on a user page should not be a problem, but some of the flag images come up as fair use. As far as the original user blanking all these pages, it is vandalism as far as I'm concerned. Not the right way to do it. Back to the flags, if there <i>is</i> a problem with displaying them on user pages then <i>we</i> have an even bigger problem since hundreds of user pages probbaly display a flag or two. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 21:36, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't see any evidence of malice here. He sounds bitter and disillusioned but really that is very well founded. As he sees it, some Wikipedia editors are jeopardising Wikipedia for reasons of selfishness and ignorance and his reasonable, patient attempts to protect the Foundation have been rebutted by people whose support he expected. Some of us are very buoyant and thickskinned, and that kind of nonsense is like so much water off a duck's back, while some of us are easily hurt and may sometimes overreact.

<p>I feel the block on Gmaxwell ought to be extended so that he has a chance to reflect on whether he's able to edit within our policies. His behavior is frequently disruptive; this is far from being the first example of it. After being blocked yesterday for three hours for what was arguably vandalism, then for 24 hours for mass blanking of user pages and unapproved use of a bot, he carried on blanking pages using a sock puppet, <a href="../../../m/a/j/User%7EMajorityrule_a69b.html" title="User:Majorityrule">User:Majorityrule</a>, which check user confirmed was him. He frequently makes mistakes (e.g. wanting to delete supposedly orphaned images that are in fact being used in articles) leading to lots of time-consuming arguments during which he is very rude, with users having to undo his work, and people even leaving the project because of him. He also deletes posts from his talk page so that it's hard to keep track of all the disputes he's causing (says he's archiving, but then doesn't). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Gmaxwell&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=36325098" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Gmaxwell&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=36325098" rel="nofollow">[26]</a></p>

<p>Ignoring the strong reek of double standards emanating from some contributors here, it's odd that anyone should hesitate at the notion that Gmaxwell be blocked for any other than practical reasons, given the pile of evidence against him. Those reasons are also fairly minor, though, surely; just about anyone <i>could</i> edit through sockpuppets, and some do — our response isn't to agonise over whether blocking is a good idea, but to block the sockpuppets as and when they appear. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 23:55, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If I could make a comment here -- It seems to me that Gmaxwell's head has gotten extremely big. It's extremely frustrating to see him make so many rude comments and vandalous edits without reproach. "Double standard" is exactly what comes to mind. Anyone else who would've acted as he has would've been dealt with much more vigorously. As an administrator-hopeful, I find it absolutely disgraceful that someone such as Gmaxwell has been permitted to continue on as he has. Wikipedians agree to edit by consensus, and with his recent actions, he seems to think he is above policy. ~<a href="../../../m/d/d/User%7EMdd4696_2098.html" title="User:Mdd4696">MDD</a><a href="../../../m/d/d/User_talk%7EMdd4696_9dbb.html" title="User talk:Mdd4696">46</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mdd4696_369b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mdd4696">96</a> 01:30, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I hope that some recent contributors to this discussion will reconsider their harsh, intemperate and accusatory words in the wake of this incident. This user has currently been unblocked for over thirty hours and has engaged in no further problematic behavior. I find it incredible that editors are seriously suggesting that "more vigorous" action would have been taken against other editors engaging in the blanking of pages containing unlicensed images.

<p>Greg is obviously hurt and angry, and blocking him further now will deepen any feelings he has that Wikipedia has "turned against him", despite it looking like that's what he wants. I'm more worried about getting him to continue doing positive things in the future than I am about stopping him doing negative things right now.</p>
<p>But something needs to be "seen to be done", or alienate people who are not in the cabal. This is the third example of high-profile violations getting a short block in the last few weeks. Last time, I looked over the previous 5000 or so blocks and only found <i>four</i> 3RR blocks of less than 24 hours, for example. Do we expect that we'll have happy Morlocks slaving away forever with this inequity?</p>
<p>A possible (non-punative) measure is having ArbCom issue an injunction stating that Greg is on 0 revert, 0 attack, 0 bot (?) parole, etc etc, with a statement that he's welcome to continue contributing in a positive manner but that damage to Wikipedia won't be allowed. Sadly, this should be paired with an indefinite block of the IP until he promises not to blow shit up, as is standard. If his promise is by IRC, e-mail, or voice, a statement that it has been received should be placed somewhere public. No need for an apology or any of that nonsense, but a clear message that blocks <i>will</i> be applied, and an injunction means that no one has to hesitate to perform them.</p>

<p>I'm reminded of Wik. He was hardbanned for the same kind of thing. I appreciate Greg's concerns about copyright but I'm not sure that the right response to not getting your own way on day one is to start vandalising the place on day two. As he's noted on his talkpage, he's technically adept enough that banning him would not be sufficient to prevent him from carrying out further vandalism but it sure would give him a message.</p>

<dd>To be frank: While Greg is indeed neither an adminstrator nor an arbitrator, one needs only to scroll up a bit to discussions of "collateral damage" to see that he is politburo at the least. If we continue to give senior contributors free ride to wheel war, vandalise, run bad bots, and generally do whatever the hell they want, let's not be suprised that the peasants are revolting. I suppose we could just quote the ArbCom and tell them to fork off, but good luck maintaining 934,826 atricles without them.<br />

<dd>Could you please tone it down? "Wheel war", "run bad bots", "vandalise", "peasant" and did I see somewhere in there a reference to the Cabal and the politburo? Aaron, you yourself must know from your own treatment that respected contributors (whether I regard them as personal friends or not--there is no issue with that) tend to attract more good faith and that the evaluation of a situation is not so blindly evenhanded as to, for instance, block a respected contributor who makes a gross misjudgement but does not seem to present an active risk. I think there is underlying this a suggestion of double standards, which I steadfastly refute. I do regularly (check my block log) reset and remove blocks where good faith can be inferred from email conversations, talk pages, or from reading this forum, and I have no doubt that this is a normal and regular operation carried out by all other conscientious administrators. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 07:47, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As much respect as I have for Greg, I have to agree with Brenneman. We can't tolerate this shit. It's one thing to gawk at punitive blocking. It's another to gawk at <i>preventive</i> blocking to prevent further crap from occurring. The practical problem, of course, is how to get Mindspillage to edit. Presumably she will have to use a proxy, or we'll have to disable the autoblocker for Greg's account, as the autoblocker will automatically block any IPs he has been using. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 06:19, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>John, he is a technically adept user. He can easily circumvent any block. So it's pointless seeing a block as a way of actually preventing him from editing.

<dd>Quite so. There are one or two "official" policies, which must be obeyed: NPOV, Copyrights, Civility. Other than that, written policies are more like guidelines that should almost always be followed. The primary policy, though, has always been "use common sense", and updating policies to fit in with sensible practice makes good sense. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Korn_fe1c.html" title="User:Sam Korn">Sam Korn</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESam_Korn_f7db.html" title="User talk:Sam Korn">(smoddy)</a></sup> 23:38, 25 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>How can you then enforce things that are not a part of the policy? Say that I was a vandal and I would remove warnings about my vandalism on my talkpage. Why would I then risk to be blocked for removing the warning? In fact, how can you define that as vandalism at all? You said above that the wording was wrong and that it would apply to anonymous users that would make the revert. Obviosuly, these admins wouldn't interpret it this way. You guys aren't even on the same page. It seems that there are no requirements on who can add new rules to the policy, as we have seen here. Some dude thought it was good to update the so-called policy and so he did, without anyone objecting it. It makes no sense. Who is shaping this policy?

<dd>As I told you on wikien-l, Wikipedia is not a game of rules. It is a project with a purpose.

<dd>You may think whatever you want of Wikipedia.

However, look at her <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Log/block?page=User:Mistress_Selina_Kyle" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Log/block?page=User:Mistress_Selina_Kyle" rel="nofollow">blocklog</a>. She's been a nuisance ever since she is around. Such an editor makes life hard for people around, and must go.

<dd>Some users may be of the opinion that Selina has been more trouble than she is worth, but it is clear that she has become an easy target, and that admins are taking the opportunity to silence one of their more effective critics. Her edits in this instance were hardly worthy of a warning, and certainly not of the caliber demanded for an indefban to be placed on her account. Tony's "Fuck process" comment is an indicator of the level of discourse at which the administrative staff has chosen to engage MSK. Abusive blocks simply exacerbate the problem.

<dd>For a permanent ban, this may be true. A one month block is absolutely justified and does <i>not</i> need to unanimity.

<li>I'm on welcome patrol when I see this come up on RC, and I have to say that i'm dismayed once again after looking at all of this. Selena's incivil to the point where i've given up on bothering defending her, but I look up at all of this and wonder what her crime was, violating <a href="../../../d/i/c/WP%7EDICK_0b34.html" title="WP:DICK">WP:DICK</a>,<a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>,<a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> and a variety of the other hodgepodge goobledygook that we call "rules" around here,which she has done, multiple times, or pissing you people off, which she has also done multiple times.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If it's the former, that's fine. Just be clear about that here and now -- I think she's gotten to the point that the minimum would be a few months under our current wiki-legal structure. If it's the latter, than she's right, this place is <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascist.html" title="Fascist">fascist</a>, i've seen too many times people ignoring any process to try and harm others under the guise of "helping the Encyclopedia". Replace "Encyclopedia" with "Fatherland", and you have the modus operandi of a multitude of fascist governments and movements throughout history: they ignored all other concerns for the good of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nation.html" title="Nation">nation</a>, and in this case, our nation is the Wikipedian nation, the people who use it and contribute to its articles, images, and yes, culture.</p>
<p>Sometimes those who do things like that feel that there's no other recourse, sometimes those who are on the recieving end of actions like that are instigators and should know that such actions would recieve a due response. Regardless, it's a symptom of a sickness that all of us in the higher echelons of this project have, and few want to admit -- that the way we govern ourselves is in need of a drastic overhaul immediately.</p>
<p>Because if we block Serena out of our own subjective views of her, it's a <a href="../../../s/l/i/Slippery_slope.html" title="Slippery slope">slippery slope</a> before any of us, along with an assortment of secretly contacted colleagues, can get rid of any of us through any justification, regardless of its merit.</p>

<dd>Do you think it would be in order for members of the community to petition the Committee for a permanent injunction in such cases? A quick review of the evidence should be enough to convince the committee of the appropriateness of the proposed permanent block, and with dual support presumably the block would have as strong a legitimacy as any other such block. I'm not particularly thinking about this case, which for now seems to have been settled reasonably satisfactorily, but other possible cases in which strong community consensus but not unanimity exists for an indefinite block. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 19:41, 29 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm fairly certain the committee's mandate limits us to 1 year blocks (or, depending on interpretation, one year blocks per remedy).

<p>I'm all for helping the clueless and the newcomers. You make a mistake, you get warned. You make a big mistake, you get blocked temporarily. If you come back and start making good edits, all is forgiven. You make a second mistake, you get blocked again. You make a few more mistakes, you get blocked again and again and again. And again. And again and again. At some point, we have to ask ourselves, does this person have the intention and/or ability to be a serious contributor? I believe the project is far beyond the point where we need to bend over backwards to accommodate problematic users in order to extract out of them every last good edit that's in them. On the contrary, this extreme tolerance, which may have been fully justified in the past, may hurt us at some point in the future. In fact, this has already happened: I had to help several editors who had strange encounters with some of our more quirky users and who got quite irritated by the fact that they had to put up with some rather bizarre behavior. Our desire to help the problematic users should be balanced with the need to protect those who want to contribute in a stress-free environment.</p>
<p>In the specific case of Ms Selina, I have seen some very trollish behavior and am frankly at a loss as to why it has been tolerated for so long. In order to determine whether she really is a troll, we'd have to read her mind, of course. But, as plenty of ArbCom decisions have affirmed, we do not need to make that determination: if someone acts like a sockpuppet, they can be blocked like one. And if Ms Selina acts like a troll, she should be blocked or even banned like one. I've cleaned up a major mess she made, where she dug in on an unreasonable position and made a number of edits that were arguably in violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. I've seen numerous violations of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>: instead of admitting she might be wrong, she will accuse others of being sockpuppets making a concerted effort to get her. I've seen her level unfounded accusations against users and admins. I've seen her interpret things as personal attacks that ordinary people wouldn't think twice about. I've seen her retaliate with personal attacks. For me, those are the marks of the troll. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a>&#160;<small><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkSweep_9d72.html" title="User talk:MarkSweep">(call me collect)</a></small> 21:56, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>I know that when you want to block an entire AOL range you sometimes use commands like '<i>blocked User:64.23.132.13/<b>22</b> with an expirey time of...</i>' to take out the entire range for 15 minutes,</dd>
<dd>the question is, could you use the same method to <b>clear</b> AOL autoblocks? as in '<i><b>un</b>blocked User:64.23.132.13/<b>22</b></i>'? Or even better,</dd>
<dd>how about '<i>blocked User:64.23.132.13/<b>22</b> with an expirey time of 0 minutes</i>',</dd>
<dd>then just do the same thing for each of the three major AOL ranges, 64.x.x.x, 152.x.x.x, and 205.x.x.x, maybe add it as a daily function for your bot, to clear any autoblocks that might pile up during the course of the day?--<a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.12.117.5.html" title="User:64.12.117.5">64.12.117.5</a> 23:53, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>To my knowledge, that won't work. I use an ISP that is owned by AOL, and I've been hit by the autoblocker because of some of the AOL trolls, and unblocking has been darned impossible. Unblocking other autoblocked AOL IP's has <i>not</i> cleared mine, so I would tend to think there aren't ways of doing that. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 22:02, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure if unblocking range blocks works, but adding a 2-second block on that same range will clear those blocks. Then it's just a matter of clearing all the autoblocks, which can be searched for on the block log relatively simply. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> <a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315">(talk)</a> 20:20, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm attempting to keep blatant violations of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> out of the <a href="../../../d/e/b/Debates_over_Wal-Mart_897b.html" title="Debates over Wal-Mart">Debates over Wal-Mart</a> article. Unfortunately, I'm currently up against the <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">electric fence</a> and have no reverts left.

Note that Mallaby's arguments are endorsed in the encyclopedic voice, and that there isn't even a citation for the blatant POV under "Wal-Mart and Product Controversy". There are areas where reasonable Wikipedians disagree on POV issues, but this blatantly crosses the line. Note that this kind of behavior has gotten KDRGibby <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_KDRGibby_21a7.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/KDRGibby">brought in front of Arbcom</a>.

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The other connection running through the IPs is a focus on Chinese-related articles, specifically negative edits pertaining to the Falun Gong on pages like <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Epoch_Times_4753.html" title="The Epoch Times">The Epoch Times</a></i>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>

<dd>Now, September is when he first became a problem. Initially it was just a matter of his personal attacks and POV pushing, some of which I noticed and reverted. Because I didn't satisfactorily discuss a particular article with him, <i>I</i> was blocked by <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama_da58.html" title="User:Rama">User:Rama</a>. I made a post on ANI about this, which mostly focuses on Rama's actions. I don't have the diff (it was in September) but it's archived. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive44#Don.27t_mind_the_committee.2C_there.27s_a_new_sheriff_in_town" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive44#Don.27t_mind_the_committee.2C_there.27s_a_new_sheriff_in_town" rel="nofollow">[59]</a></dd>

<dd>Meanwhile, the anon IPs started to follow my edits (and sometimes others') and harass and insult various users. Here are just a few examples. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:PainMan&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=22803544" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:PainMan&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=22803544" rel="nofollow">[60]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:PainMan&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=22803761" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:PainMan&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=22803761" rel="nofollow">[61]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Epoch_Times&amp;diff=22655733&amp;oldid=22633876" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Epoch_Times&amp;diff=22655733&amp;oldid=22633876" rel="nofollow">[62]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Epoch_Times&amp;diff=22802457&amp;oldid=22778332" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Epoch_Times&amp;diff=22802457&amp;oldid=22778332" rel="nofollow">[63]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Epoch_Times&amp;diff=22733472&amp;oldid=22695237" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Epoch_Times&amp;diff=22733472&amp;oldid=22695237" rel="nofollow">[64]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Epoch_Times&amp;diff=24236550&amp;oldid=24226036" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Epoch_Times&amp;diff=24236550&amp;oldid=24226036" rel="nofollow">[65]</a> Phrases like, "fuck off and die", "retarded", "Americocrap", etc. One that I recall (but can't find ATM) is, "I piss on your bloody Americrap flag." As you mentioned, one of the IPs was warned several times for this, and blocked. He evaded the block by using another IP, and never discussed or apologized for the remarks. Rama chose to ignore the whole situation once my block was over (and artificially extended), and after a few more weeks I stopped editing because I did not have time to mess with it.</dd>

<dd>It's <b>very</b> common in the UK to refer to people as Scottish/English/Irish/Welsh rather than British. Referring to people as "British" is considered highly unusual.

<p>The problem is simple. Internationally many, particularly in the US, use English when they mean British (ie, from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, eg, saying <i>Queen of England</i> when legally there has not been a queen of England, or indeed a kingdom of England, since 1707). However certainly in the last decade since home rule was granted, British is not used to refer to people in the United Kingdom outside England (and Unionists in Northern Ireland). People from Wales and Scotland take high offence if called British, firstly because they want to be referred to by their own nationality (as far as they are concerned, Scotland and Wales are nations and should be referred to as such, irrespective of legal technicalities) and secondly because given the international tendency to equate British and English, they believe that saying that someone from Scotland is British can be interpreted as meaning they are from England. Calling someone from Scotland and Wales <i>british</i> is seen as POV, offensive and politically incorrect. The only issue is how to categorise people from England. Most English people have no problem with being called British. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:#006666; background-color:orange"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 23:59, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Largely agree aside from <i>Most English people have no problem with being called British.</i>. I personally equate being called British with ignorance. Depending on who the ignorance is coming from I may or may not take offence, for example an American might not know better so it would be ridiculous to take offense, if someone from the UK called me British, I might not take offense but I'd certainly look at them funny - can they not tell from my accent? I wouldn't be offended (but I'd correct them), hell, I'd be more offended if someone thought I was from the South rather than from the Midlands&#160;;) but I would be suspicious. I can only think of one occasion when someone has specifically described themselves as <i>British</i> and that guy had a Scottish dad and an English mum. - <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancisTyers_1664.html" title="User:FrancisTyers">FrancisTyers</a> 00:05, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Dang it, folks!</b> Let's not hash this out here, eh? The warnings I put on the pages was true: it doesn't matter which one is right or true. The fact is that the category folks have argued this for over a year, and they've got some consensus. For myself, I tend to call folks like Wordsworth "English," too. That's because the next word from my pen is "poet," and Wordsworth is an English-poet, and so is Robert Burns, even though the latter was a Scottish person (i.e. English language poet). Again, it sort of doesn't matter whether we can subdivide or not: we settle on the tag that is most inclusive and accurate. Would one want to tag Alfred the Great as a Wessex king and not an English king (I mean in terms of category)? I understand if people want to use an historical designation (English if they were from the time when the kingdoms were separate, British if before they were kingdoms or before union), but I think we've got to distinguish between profession, ethnicity, and nationality. This tag is only the latter. Maybe I'm wrong, but, if I am, let's hash it out at a more appropriate place -- the category talk, the bio MoS talk, etc., and not AN/I, because any way you slice it making a unilateral change on dozens of articles without discussion is blockable. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:50, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am an ignorant American but I thought in one traditional sense British was sometimes used to refer to the pre-Anglo-Saxon inhabitants of the island of Britain, especially the Welsh, Scots and non-Danelaw areas of England, as in the context of Arthur as the quintessential Briton.

<p>(N.) Irish, Scottish and Welsh are usually referred to as Irish, Scottish or Welsh, except when the context is British, such as Scotsman winning an olympic medal for the British team, a Welshman serving in the British government, a N.Irish reporter working for the BBC, etc. Righly or wrongly, "English" and "British" are used fairly interchangably for English people (an English person or someone outside of the United Kingdom, in an international context at least, would rarely give it much thought), so it shouldn't be an issue in itself. - <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalgacus_587c.html" title="User:Calgacus">Calgacus</a> 03:43, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Unusually, I (British passport) was in Britain three years ago or so during the period of collection of info for the census, and even more unusually I was chosen for a more detailed questioning. One question was of the order of: "Which do you consider to be your primary identity? Youkay, British, English, Scots, Welsh [blah blah blah]." I don't think any option covered a wider area than the Youkay. While tempted to say something like "member of the human race", I decided that the poor, overworked fellow deserved a "sensible", non-time-wasting answer, so (thinking of democracy, the Enlightenment, etc.) I truthfully said "European". He seemed very surprised. I don't think the census writers had envisaged that answer. Is "European" a lower common denominator than "British"? -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 05:54, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Can I make a suggestion here? I know it goes against the grain, but I actually think Zephram's got something to offer this project - he clearly has the enthusiasm to keep trying, and it's not like he's <i>always</i> being a vandal as such, and I have seen some of his edits (and had some long conversations with him on my talk page) which lead me to believe - perhaps naïvely - that he could be a considerable asset to the project. Certainly he has a bee (or two) in his bonnet - but, to be candid, he's not the only person round this place like that. I have had a number of long and perfectly civil conversations with him on subjects about which we nevertheless disagree strongly.</p>
<p>A number of admins are spending a huge amount of their time hunting him and his sockpuppets down and blocking them, at the expense of doing something constructive like editing articles. This doesn't seem a good use of anyone's time to me. Wouldn't it be better to swallow the collective conviction and just engage with him, not in an adversarial fashion as has happened before, but to try to agree mutual coexistence - mediation, not arbitration - which, just maybe, might involve some <i>compromise</i> by the project which would see Zephram return as an editor on the site?</p>
<p>Focussing too hard on <b>the rules</b> and <b>the decision of the arbcom</b> (or whatever it was that saw him banned in the first place) or the (putative) <b>good of the project</b> misses the point: the point is we have an enthusiastic contributor who doesn't look like he's going to go away; we have a number of admins who are wasting a lot of time chasing him down. Wouldn't it be better to try and sort this out?</p>
<p>For the record, I'm not a sockpuppet, I'm not a meat puppet, Zephram hasn't put me up to this (nor have I discussed it with him) and I don't necessarily defend or agree with anything Zephram has said or done on this site (though I admit I am less troubled by his attitude that some) - I just think that the project is being unimaginative and is unnecessarily using up its own resources to squash someone who basically has his heart in the right place. A community <i>needs</i> the odd off-the-wall character. A place like Wikipedia ought to be able to see that? <a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElectricRay_93ad.html" title="User:ElectricRay">ElectricRay</a> 23:36, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's funny you should use that example, because that's exactly the point that I think you're missing. As long as you don't negotiate with terrorists, you'll have terrorism. You may notice that when you start negotiating, "terrorists" turn out to be people who feel very strongly about things, differently to you, but who have no other means of expressing their viewpoint - they're disenfranchised. Who the terrorist is - and whether there's a terrorist at all - is a matter of perspective.

<dd>If Zephram wishes to contribute in a positive manner to the project, he simply needs to stop evading his ban for six months and then he may resume editing. These are the terms of the ArbCom decision and by creating sockpuppet after sockpuppet, Zephram has chosen to "disenfranchise" himself indefinitely (the ban's expire date is reset with each sockpuppet). If you truly believe that Zephram can be an asset to Wikipedia, then you should take it upon yourself to convince him to cease editing for six months. If he's unwilling to do so, then there's really not much to discuss. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 00:18, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A coin, equally weighted on both sides, has a fifty percent chance of revealing heads. When flipping the coin only ten times, its standard deviation is loosely constrained. The more we flip the coin, however, the tighter we can predict the average and deviation. In effect, order arises from chaos as more chaos is added to a system. Human unpredictability is the chaos added to the Wikipedia system. Because there are so many people and so much chaos at Wikipedia, it becomes possible to see order. Just as with the individual coin toss, each person at Wikipedia changes the outcome less significantly as the system grows. We can know the stable state of Wikipedia within an extremely small tolerance in the same way that we know the nearly exact result of tossing a coin ten thousand times. Because of its size, all paths at Wikipedia lead, in a relatively short amount of time, to the same outcome: control by consensus, not by hierarchy. Jimbo Wales and his most powerful generals can only avoid this outcome by destroying the project. Seeing the stable state, we can pick the smoothest path to its completion. Projects like Wikipedia only function well through consensus, not control. It pains me to see people like Carbonite fight this inevitability. --<a href="../../../a/y/n/User%7EAyn_Rant_7ab3.html" title="User:Ayn Rant">Ayn Rant</a> 20:34, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not "enabling" anyone's "trolling" - I invited Carbonite to discuss this privately, outside Zephram's view, and Carbonite didn't respond at all. I am simply asking for some perspective to be applied, and failing that, someone - anyone - to address <i>substantively</i> the points I have made. Instead I've had the old Dalek routine: "resistance is useless... resistance is useless", which I think is a poor show. Having said that, it doesn't seem to me as if Zephram is especially interested in coming back into the fold anyway, so perhaps I really am wasting my breath. Ultimately, you can extend Zephram's ban for three million years; it doesn't seem to be stopping him, does it? <a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElectricRay_93ad.html" title="User:ElectricRay">ElectricRay</a> 23:06, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

Your viewpoint should change. If it doesn't, well, then I think you're a poor judge of character.

<dd>While I have every respect for Jimbo Wales, I don't think <a href="../../../d/a/v/Davros.html" title="Davros">Davros</a> is an entirely inappropriate comparison, as it happens. But it was your comparison, not mine. Whether or not I am, or you are, a poor judge of character is not really the point. Who is to say what is "poor"? Zephram's crimes seem to boil down to an idiosyncratic - ok, a silly - take on the distinction between "inalienable" and "unalienable", trenchant (and probably silly) views on terrorism, and the fact that he's been calling Carbonite and his friends names. Sticks and stones...</dd>

<dd>The clerk page says that they will have access to the mailing list. Indeed, other than the title that seems to be the only 'benefit' of this position. The rest of it seems like things which the general community <i>could</i> do, but generally does not. <b>Anyone</b> can 'summarize evidence', make suggestions on proposed principles and decisions, et cetera. I've done those things in the past and I'm not even an admin. Opening and closing arbitration requests theoretically <i>could</i> be done by anyone, but to date hasn't because it is better handled by people who are very familiar with the procedures... which makes sense to continue that way. If they hadn't put a name to the position I doubt anyone would have even noticed. It certainly can't be viewed as a sinecure... rather the opposite. The only potential 'concern' is clerks privately 'influencing' the arbitors... but frankly the position provides little benefit in doing so which couldn't be pursued by non-clerks. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><sub><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></sub></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 20:04, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is somethinga bit odd about it. OK, they volunteered to help — so let them help. Why introduce official titles, a "department" with a "head", and the rest? We're not a state with a government; we don't need civil servants to help our elected representatives. It's not entirely surprising that this looks to a number of editors as though it's an attempt to give chums a consolation prize after they were rejected as ArbCom members. In a way it doesn't matter what the truth is: it <i>looks</i> bad, and I think that it was at best a misjudgement. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 13:03, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I wholly disagree with the clerk position. This has nothing to do with Kelly (although I believe Snowspinner should be as far from ArbCom as possible), but simply with the fact that ArbCom has to read the evidence and form its own opinions, and the clerical position is another filter. I am afraid that ArbCom <i>means</i> getting dirty, getting bored, and going through mountains of evidence, and it is the formation of an opinion <i>through</i> going into all of that evidence that is the very meaning of it. I mistrust <b>all</b> summaries of disputes when I look into them, and, whether ArbCom is democratically appointed or appointed from a slate, the point is that all know who the parties are. It is important, very important, that no one's opinion of a situation take the place of reading the situation. This, though, has nothing to do with <i>which</i> person is acting as a clerk, but merely the position itself. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:10, 29 January 2006 (UTC)

This work that an arbitrator currently has to do and is not likely to be controversial. As for summarising evidence. Let's see how it goes.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> | <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">Taste the Korn</a> 16:36, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm with Mel and Geogre on this. I strongly disagree with the clerk's task of writing summaries of the evidence for the arbcomm from which they'll work. Summaries written by clerks is an all-too-tempting opportunity for the injection of personal view in a case to influence a particular outcome. <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 17:58, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Same here, I also disagree strongly that the clerks should write summaries.

<p>Since people are discussing clerks, I want to mention my more narrowly drawn objection. I am not bothered by someone writing summaries of the evidence, since in principle anyone can do that. However, there is a special case when the person summarizing the evidence is also a former ArbCom member. Apparently, all former ArbComs indefinitely retain access to the arbcom mailing list and hence have access to the private discussions of ArbCom and could potentially even participate in those discussion, even though they no longer have a vote. If a former ArbCom is then acting to present and summarize the evidence. They could use their privileged knowledge to tailor their presentation in response to the reactions of ArbCom. Even if this person never actually abused their power, I find the mere appearance of someone who is organizing the case having unfettered access to the private thoughts of the people judging it to be a dreadful image of potential impropriety. I have <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_arbitration_945d.html#Arbcom_Mailing_List" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for arbitration">argued this point at length</a>, asking that former Arbs serving as clerks should relinquish access to the ArbCom mailing list while in that position, but apparently have failed to convince anyone. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 18:33, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>And you folks think it's laughable, that these are just the whinings of ne'erdowells? That's the kind of attitude that got certain people voted far from ArbCom. Unilateralism is wrong, and saying, "You can't make them" is the logic of George W. Bush. It is not right that ArbCom (the <i>present one</i>) allowed the position "without dissent" and therefore, presumably, with consent and that it is now there for good and all volunteers are welcome. In fact, if I find myself presenting evidence on an ArbCom case, I do <b>not</b> want certain people to present a "summary" of it. Until I'm assured that those persons can read and assess nuance, I do not want to be summarized for others, and I do not want it joked away as just one of those things. If the project is to have any regulation at all, we're not going to manage it with more opacity in our procedings and more good old boyism.

<dd>The community is free to give input to the arbcom, but essentially, the arbcom is Jimbo's representative. If they <i>want</i> Kelly and Phil as clerks, or want an official office for clerking in the first place, the community can't stop them (except through civil disobedience by refusing to abide by the arbcom's rulings). As a clerk, I will personally never remove or even touch a person's comments unless they are seriously screwing up the evidence page. Instead, I'll summarise their evidence in a section of my own and add a note to the original evidence section to the effect that "this evidence has been summarised below by Johnleemk". <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 11:32, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't think any clerk would dare to summarise any evidence that you might give in arbitration, geogre, for your powers of expression are not in doubt. But there are some who before arbitration are as mutes, dumbstruck, or overawed, or simply fail to grasp the importance of verifiable evidence.</p>
<p>In the Maoririder case for instance, I presented evidence to refute the proposal of one arbitrator that maoririder had used sock puppets in an effore to evade blocks. In the Baku Ibne case I sorted through a mass of evidence that was presented in a jumbled form, pertaining to over a dozen sock puppets. The evidence clearly pointed to two sources of sock puppetry at a time when we did not have the organised checkuser facilities available now.</p>
<p>The Committee normally has many cases on its hands and is chronically short-staffed. It does not have the resources to undertake massive refactoring of ill-assorted evidence, and the quality of arbitration findings could suffer from this incapacity. Voluntary clerical work has long been a staple of arbitration cases. Until now purely mechanical tasks such as opening a case have been undertaken by arbitrators because there were no other official appointees available to do the job. Now the Committee has a dozen appointed clerks available to do it. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 23:15, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Because, Tony, no one but the <i>present</i> ArbCom gets to "approve" these clerks. There are people who have a demonstrated history of misrepresentation when their own favorite subjects come up, and there are people who have a history of announcing that the legal proceedings of ArbCom simply don't apply to them, and there are people who have announced that, because, in their judgment, some aspect of Wikipedia's practice isn't right, they intend to delete it, reword it, or just act contrary to it. Anyone with <i>any allegation</i> of that in their past should be automatically disqualified from a clerical position. Instead, though, the office got "approved" (because no one protested) without sufficient thought about how it should work, who should be on it, how wide a scope it should have. In any case of ArbCom, I'd say the <i>appearance of impropriety</i> should be enough to disqualify. This would not be some dark mark, some impugning of character, some agreement with the allegations, but, if we do not wish to validate every word every vandal has ever written about Wikipedia, we need to be sure, absolutely sure, that ArbCom is not only the most rule-bound and legalistic organ on Wikipedia, but that the people volunteering are the same. Folks should advocate changes, but <i>not</i> there. I've never taken a stance on Kelly Martin, for example, but the controversy surrounding her is sufficient to give people excuses for warring against ArbCom decisions and for people thinking (as the original writer did, above) that this is a back door. This is a Very Bad Idea, and the way that it was approved for all eternity by simple lack of disagreement is the worst part of the whole affair. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 01:06, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

There is still hope at the bottom, but we've got to grab it quickly. I would <i>suggest</i> that the project of Clerks be put in abeyance until the new ArbCom is in place, that they ask the people who dislike/mistrust the process to fire their best bullets, and then that they try to craft a project that will be as bulletproof as possible. My motives in objecting are, as they ever are, cranky, but they're also based on what happens when people who "lose" RFar's decide to go to war anyway.

<dd>My dear geogre, we currently have twenty-four arbitration cases in process, and three in the closing stages. Twelve months ago today, there were just <i>six cases, now there are</i> twenty-seven<i>. But there are only now three more arbitrators than there were in the first batch two years ago.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The merest act of opening a single arbitration case, once accepted, involves a complex editing procedure, and the notification of parties and observers. Some of it is automated, some of it not. Closing an arbitration procedure involves even more work, including tallying the votes and writing the final decision, notifying the parties of the results and ensuring that the administrators know what to do about enforcement. There are fifteen arbitrators, nearly half of whom have never done any of this paperwork, and all of whom have a lot more important things to do with the twenty-seven cases that are open.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So you'll see clerk marks on <a href="../../../a/r/b/Template%7EArbComOpenTasks_5ee1.html" title="Template:ArbComOpenTasks">Template:ArbComOpenTasks</a>, you'll see clerks making announcements. There are six clerks, and if you look now you'll see that they're already getting involved in cases, ensuring that evidence is presented in a form that is most useful to the arbitrators. Why are we doing this? Because <i>every second spent by a clerk doing this essential menial work is a second saved by an arbitrator examining cases.</i> Wikipedia has grown fast, and it does need people to do simple administrative work, and do it reasonably efficiently.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>For David Gerrard, I don't know what WP:DRV is, but you have recently made some calls that I regard as wholly illogical and personal. That's my opinion. However, if you have had an RFar against you, or let's say 3 in a year, and you were to come out on the losing side, let's say twice, or let's just say that you had some other kind of public examination and a ton of folks came in to complain, then that would show that there is a significant number of people who mistrust you. If you're mistrusted, then you're mistrusted. If you're mistrusted, and yet you are acting as a filter between evidence and the arbitrators, then you give grounds to anyone who disagrees with the outcome to suggest that you hijacked or sabotaged the matter, and, because you are mistrusted, a great many people will believe it. You have chosen to interpret my comments personally, which is your prerogative, but, if you can believe it, it's <i>not</i> personal. This is about whether the trolls and problem users have a soap box from which to recruit good users to their side.</dd>
<dd>For the others, this is absolutely about one area: summaries. If anyone thought about that issue, they certainly didn't think about it for very long. Allowing clerks to be a filter or to give executive summaries is wrong in every possible way. You can say that people always <i>could have</i> all you want, but the fact is that this is an official non-election of persons who are the preference of current folks for secret, Star Chamber activity. It takes away light from the process and helps this "open source" encyclopedia close its sources and procedures. That's a fantastic way to arm the trolls. <b>Cut out the summary function</b> in every way, and I doubt you'll see much objection any more.</dd>
<dd>And, since people keep wanting to debate this on the grounds of "what harm does it do," let's ask ourselves what <i>benefit</i> we get from the summary? What <i>good</i> does it do? There are lots of cases on the docket. Ok. So? That's why there are more than five arbitrators. The work load is too great? Put more people on the committee. Do not, though, officially sanction people about whom there is disquiet. Nor is this "oh, can anyone have any allegation," but there are significant issues around some people and wild charges about others.</dd>
<dd>If we must be personal, there is a reason I stay away from conflict as much as I can. I have no patience for it, and I have no patience for all the personal defensiveness and "I'm rubber and you're glue" taunting that takes place.

<dd>I echo the concerns raised by Geogre, SlimVirgin, and El_C. The impression given -- at least to me -- by the impressive lack of process surrounding this is that the office of clerk is basically a reward for treating Wikipedia as an IRC social club rather than as an encyclopedia. If the Arbcom doesn't care that it is giving that impression, well, that's fine, I guess.

<dd>If they are so controversial and lack wide community approval then they may not be the best fits for what seems like an influential position. Making sense of incoherent evidence is the essential job of an arbitrator - delegating that job seems strange to me. Delegating it to people who lack wide community approval seems even stranger.

<li>I think this is a tricky balancing act. On the one hand, the ArbCom must not be too susceptible to public opinion because that may interfere with fair treatment of their cases. On the other hand, if they stray too far from public opinion they lose the trust of the community. It is easy to <i>say</i> that Snowy/Tony/Kelly is distrusted by the community and only got the job because they had friends on the ArbCom - <i>but</i> saying so doesn't make it so. Similarly, it is easy to say that Snowy/Tony/Kelly is entirely trustworthy and their opponents are just being nasty for no good reason and should be ignored - but saying <i>that</i> doesn't make it so either. The truth lies in the nebulous middle somewhere. Only such issues are very hard to discuss without devolving into mutual flame wars. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 15:41, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Question:</b> I just want to make sure that I am clear on what people are objecting to. No one is objecting to opening and closing cases, and other menial tasks? Lots of people are objecting to clerks summarising evidence privately. If the AC were to decree that all evidence summaries by clerks were public would that put peoples minds at rest? Are there any other worries that people have? (I just want it straight in my own mind what the percieved problems are. The arbitrators are discussing the matter of private evidence summaries now I will report back here our decision as soon as we come to a decision the matter) <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> | <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">Taste the Korn</a> 16:19, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think anyone, so far as I have seen, objects to clerks performing the routine "menial" tasks, as you put it. But to draw an analogy with the American legal system, the clerks aren't responsible for summarizing and presenting evidence, the lawyers are. I believe that the more the "lawyers" (i.e. clerks presenting evidence) are percieved as either having their own personal agenda or trying to advance the arbitrators' agenda then the more people will be uneasy. This can be mitigated by making that part of the process as open and public as possible, but as long as ArbCom is responsible for choosing and instructing clerks, I suspect there will always be some lingering doubt. Given the lack of alternatives, this is probably tolerable, but not ideal. Ideally, we would have a stronger <a href="../../../a/m/a/WP%7EAMA_ced1.html" title="WP:AMA">WP:AMA</a> and they could serve as independent quasi-professional "lawyers" to summarize and present evidence on users' behalf. So in summary, I think you'll find that it is having to accept the "lawyering" of people that were handpicked by the court that makes people uneasy and the more that process is obscured, the more people are going to worry that it ceases to be fair. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 16:50, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What Theresa says does seem to be the nut of the problem, yes. I don't see why the clerks need write access to the mailing list, for example if they are just ordinary editors doing what any ordinary editor could. If they aren't, if they are to have powers beyond the editorial, then there needs to be a jolly good reason for that. And if they are to have such influence (and let's not weasel it away from such if it's emails to a secret list) then the position should be elected, and not appointed. There was even a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AArbitration_Committee%2FClerks&amp;diff=36553235&amp;oldid=36553056" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AArbitration_Committee%2FClerks&amp;diff=36553235&amp;oldid=36553056" rel="nofollow">comment</a> from one of the new clerks that "we should be able to work privately if we so please". What is it that they (the clerks, not the arbs) might need to work on privately, what might they need to reach secret agreements among themselves on if all they are doing is putting pieces of paper in order? If they are to be arbitrators-lite in either appearance or practise, then they should be elected not appointed via IRC popularity contests. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 17:08, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I hate to be the odd man, but I <b>do</b> disagree with public summaries. I don't think the clerks should be offering summaries in public or private. As courtroom lawyers say, you can't unring a bell, and having someone say something prejudicial or misrepresentative sticks in the mind, regardless of whether it's in public or private. Furthermore, no matter how public or how many other opinions were offered, there would be something "more equal than others" about the clerk's summary. I have no objection to the maintenance, to the contacting of parties, but I have a very strong objection to the summary function. Get rid of that, and I'll keep quiet. Again: the issue for me is not how I feel, but how much the clerical position arms the trolls. (No, I wouldn't decide much on that basis, but this is particularly the troll-dispensing part of the project, and we need confidence in it. If we lose that confidence, we lose all.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 17:29, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Theresa, that's like saying, "We'll see if this absolute monarchy thing causes any problems." The problems aren't going to be minor. They're going to be grave. If we can see that it's a bad idea to start off with, if we can see that the potential problems are very serious, then why on earth gamble? Why, when this is <i>one function,</i> and one of the most fishy? Assessing evidence is the soul of arbitration, and this function is being handed off? Being handed off specifically to three people about whom there is a vast amount of ill will? Why? What on earth is worth risking trolls with justification for? This makes no sense at all to me. Couldn't you folks <i>at least</i> wait until the new group is in before opening up a function that apparently is going to be darned difficult to reverse? Why gamble with stakes this high with these particular people (or anyone) with these particular functions at this particular time? It seems to me that there ought to be something monumental to be gained. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 23:46, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As a clerk, I probably do need write access to the mailing list, and it isn't as if I haven't as an ordinary editor already had occasion to join in confidential conversations on arbcom-l in the past--there's nothing special about that, anybody can write, and sometimes opinions of editors are sought by arbcom with regard to, say, the workability of certain kinds of remedy. Having write access is just a convenience for David Gerard who runs the list and doesn't want to have to check in inbox several times a day just in case there is some incoming urgent email from a clerk.</p>
<p>Suppose I'm investigating a case and I find that there is a claim related to the offsite doings of an editor. The relevance to the case seems a bit dubious to me so, before I toddle off looking for corroboration, I might want to ask the committee whether it intends to take such evidence into consideration. The point is that I'd probably suspect that they wouldn't, but I would want to make sure, and I wouldn't want to ask publicy because it might then be blown up out of proportion by the party making the claim and become something of a cause celebre.. I have to consider the right to privacy of the participants in the case and the interests of all in a fair hearing, and so I probably go to arbcom-l and say "look, party X is saying party Y was involved in Z offsite. Does the Committee intend to hear evidence on this allegation?" It could be a drug scandal, or a pornography website, or allegations of professional misconduct--things that if publicised might have serious consequences outside Wikipedia. Obviously commonsense tells me that arbcom wouldn't want to touch that in a million years, but I should still ask. But if I asked publicly I then give the issue a spin that would be inappropriate. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 18:19, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes, if someone set up an account that had arbcom-l set as its email address. But the mechanism of delivery is immaterial. Whether you send email from a smtp client or via Wikipedia's php interface to smtp, the message arrives in the same inbox. What happens then is a question of whether your sender address is on the mailing list's whitelist. And of course anybody can send such an email. And if it looks to be relevant to arbcom's function it will probably be let through. It's just that, being clerks, they're more likely to have relevant business to discuss. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 19:18, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I meant a clerk could just email an Arbitrator. Imo, there should not be summaries of evidence that are kept secret, and so the very occasional kind of question you have could esily be asked of one Arb, or that Arb could refer it to the Committee if they prefer. The choice of words is revealing as well: clerks should not be 'investigating' cases per se; they should be summarising the evidence. They are clerks, not detectives and not arbitrators-lite. It also isn't a clerks job, imo, to look for 'corroborating' evidence — it's for the clerk to simply arrange the evidence in a manner usefuller to the Arbitrators who should be conducting their own investigations. That directly avoids the need for the clerks to deal with sensitive issues of the kind you describe. This gets to the core of clerking: the kind of thing you describe is, basically, arbitrating if you are to follow evidence trails, decide what is and what is not corroborated and otherwise investigate cases. Let's be plain: are the clerks substitute arbitrators because the arbitrators don't want to do the legwork (then they should resign forthwith) or are they to carry out the menial tasks that any editor could do, but most choose not to? -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 19:53, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>By its nature, I think an email sent to arbcom-l is probably better than one sent to a single arbitrator who may not happen to look at his email that day. And if he does he only has to forward it on arbcom-l. I don't see any point in introducing this risky extra step when it would be just as easy to email the list--as anyone can.</p>
<p>On what kind of evidence one would look at, I think the feeling of the clerks office is that if evidence was referred to and the arbitrators expressed an interest then, rather than leave the arbitrators to do the digging, the clerks would do it. So the clerks would seek direction from the arbitrators rather than going fishing on their own account. This was the purpose of my example.</p>
<p>No matter what we can say to reassure you, you will always have to face the fact that members of Wikipedia as a functioning entity do communicate significant information to one another in manners that are not publicly accessible, and that they always have done. As a Wikipedia editor I have on a very few occasions, contacted the arbitrators on confidential matters and in turn I have been consulted by them.</p>
<p>But because clerks do menial work for the arbitrators, this does not mean that they participate in decisions, except insofar as Kelly being a former arbitrator may participate freely in any and all arbcom-l discussions. Clerks are not substitute arbitrators, they're just the people who do the drudge work. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 20:10, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, and I don't know when the 'drudge' work became that of making recommendations to the committee, examining evidence and doing so behind closed doors. That sounds to me like the <i>principal</i> work of the committee. People have not always been appointed by the arbcom expressly for the purpose of communicating with them in secret. If clerks were not talking about running the arbitration themselves, there'd be no problem. But they are: they want to talk to arbs in secret, they want the ability to present their own view of the evidence, in secret. I don't see the need. I do, on the other hand, see the need to have the simple, menial work such as opening, closing, notifying etc etc done by clerks, and the sanity-checking of e.g. workshops to make sure that the morass of proposed <s>executions</s> remedies stays in a shape that is vaguely accessible to a human. But I don't see why this needs cloaks, daggers, smoke and mirrors. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 21:45, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>By the committee. It's common sense, really, that the head clerk be able to communicate easily with the comittee as a whole. Former Arbitrators keep list access. It's sensible to use someone who already has list access to be head clerk. Really, "head clerk" is no more than an administrative position; I don't believe Kelly actually intends to do clerking work per se. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Korn_fe1c.html" title="User:Sam Korn">Sam Korn</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESam_Korn_f7db.html" title="User talk:Sam Korn">(smoddy)</a></sup> 21:50, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hi Sam, thanks for the reply. It's not clear why the head clerk, as opposed to any other clerk, would need list access, and if they did, they could be given it, rather than having to be someone who already had it. Does the committee realize that there's widespread concern about this situation: about who was chosen, why they were chosen, and what exactly they'll be doing? <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 22:04, 30 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I understand the concerns. I expect the Committee will review the clerks' existance in a few months time. We are working on the principle of "nothing ventured, nothing gained" to a great degree here. In answer to your question about the head clerk: this is not a clerking position. It is a position for someone to administrate the other clerks. Kelly is also the one who has been opening and closing cases. She was chosen basically because she volunteered for the role. This way (having a former Arbitrator as Head Clerk) allows for consistency as to who has access to the mailing list, and who is allowed to comment on cases. It is also very important to have someone who understands the ArbCom process <i>from the inside</i> to administrate its management (eek, that phrase shows what a bureaucracy we can be...) I hope this answers your questions. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Korn_fe1c.html" title="User:Sam Korn">Sam Korn</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESam_Korn_f7db.html" title="User talk:Sam Korn">(smoddy)</a></sup> 22:11, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks, Sam. I'm still not clear about this part: "This way (having a former Arbitrator as Head Clerk) allows for consistency as to who has access to the mailing list, and who is allowed to comment on cases." Anyone who needed list access could have been given it. Anyone who wants to comment on a case is currently allowed to and doesn't need list access to do that. And if there's too much work for the arbcom, more arbitrators could have been chosen. I think one of the concerns people have is that, if clerks really were needed, there was no need to choose them from among people who had just lost an election. This says to the community that what ordinary editors think doesn't matter, and it means the arbcom will have less credibility now, which is a pity, because it's a new committee and it could have been a fresh start. You talked about reviewing the situation in a few months, but I think the damage will have been done by then. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 22:29, 30 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>We do recognise this, and it's clearly a valid point. While a fresh start is good, it's also necessary at the same time to have some consistency. I don't think I explained the situation with the Head Clerk very well. The point about the mailing list is really incidental. The main point is that a member of the office knows how the ArbCom procedure works. As to the point of several of the clerks having recently not been elected in the ArbCom elections, that is not really fair. We chose them because they were the best on offer. I expect we will appoint more in due course. It is like saying that, because someone failed in an election to become a member of parliament, we aren't going to approve them to work in the civil service, even if they're a good candidate. If you take it as read that the ArbCom is still supervising its clerks (and it would be negligent not to) I think you will see why we appointed these people. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Korn_fe1c.html" title="User:Sam Korn">Sam Korn</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESam_Korn_f7db.html" title="User talk:Sam Korn">(smoddy)</a></sup> 22:37, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>I think the major concern that people have is that particular editors, who were disapproved for a role that has influence in the arbcom, have nevertheless been appointed to have influence on the arbcom. What alarms me above all is the evidence summarising. Yes, the evidence can be a mangled heap of scrap, but it's the evidence <i>as presented by the person who is on trial</i>. Also, I don't believe that editors that we expressed our lack of support for should <i>secretly</i> have any input into punishments. If Snowspinner thinks editor X should be banned for the rest of his natural life, I think he should be saying it on the talkpage, just like anyone else. I understand the desire for the arbcom's deliberations to be secret. Judges in those places that try by judge don't deliberate in public. But submissions made to them are public. It's very worrying that users who we don't trust to be arbitrators are given a position of influence by the back door. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 22:36, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Attempting to address various people's concerns.... I have also agreed that the summaries should be public (and indeed, as simple, strictly factual, and neutral as possible—which is not something that parties often do in their own presentations). I have seen evidence summaries by others be useful and I should hope I wouldn't be unduly swayed by them if they're not backed up by evidence. I regard the summaries as helpful but non-essential, and of course anyone outside the clerk's office is also welcome to present them. As for Geogre's concern that no one should—well, people do, already, on the workshop pages, or they send their opinions in email. We give them the weight that they're worth, I hope.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for Kelly's access to the mailing list, she would, as any other former arbitrator, have access anyhow, and would, as former arbs do, be offering advice and opinions. (It's also my opinion that whatever community relations skills she may have, she's <i>good</i> at analyzing cases.) No one else has read access, and any other editor can send a message to the list in private by emailing an arbitrator and asking that it be passed on. I expect the position of clerk if anything to have them under more scrutiny rather than less—as when some people have done similar things independently, and no one made a fuss about it. Write access also is good: it's not getting a special ear, it's getting reminders and questions regarding open cases out to everyone in a timely manner. ("Hey, you voted on all of these remedies but one, go look at this again so we can close" or "hey, editor X has a question/new piece of evidence no one has looked at and he thinks it will affect the decision.")</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't see it as a serious problem that the clerks chosen were not approved as arbitrators, as they're not arbitrating. If the AC makes a bad decision by relying on something inappropriate a clerk has done, it's <i>our fault</i>. Call us on it, please. And if the clerkship bit in general turns out not to work so well, then, oh well, experiment failed, it was worth a shot. I think it's worth trying, if only because opening, closing, notifying, and keeping track of what needs to be voted on by whom is a pain, not a judgment-critical process, and if someone else wants to do that so much the better. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindspillage_87a5.html" title="User:Mindspillage">Mindspillage</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMindspillage_c644.html" title="User talk:Mindspillage">(spill yours?)</a> 23:21, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Some of this makes sense, but the point remains that choosing people who had just been so roundly rejected was obviously going to be controversial, and that it was done smacks of disrespect to the community. The community may repay that with disrespect in return, and there you have a bad situation that no clerk's position is worth, in my view. It would have made more sense to choose the clerks from among the people who just missed out on getting elected (assuming they wanted to do it). Regarding the summaries, the whole point of having them written is, presumably, so that arbitrators don't have to wade through all the evidence. Therefore, the summaries will be relied upon. The commmittee can't have it both ways: on the one hand, clerks are going to write summaries which will helpfully save the committee time, but on the other, don't worry, because the committee will independently read the evidence themselves anyway, so they can judge which summaries to take seriously.

<dd>Sam, I can see that you personally take it seriously, and I appreciate your taking the time to respond, especially given how late it is for you. I wonder if the committee would consider making public the entire decision-making process, and in particular how it was decided that only former arbitrators could become head clerk, and why a head clerk was needed in the first place. The perception is that this was some kind of done deal from the start. If the process could be laid bare, I think that might help to clear up some concerns. If in addition, the plan for clerks to summarize evidence could be abandoned, I think there would be few, if any, concerns remaining. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 00:56, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>I suspect that, had we appointed a non-former-arbitrator as head clerk, we'd now be discussing whether he should have read/write access to arbcom-l. There must be coordination between the arbitrators and the clerks, although in general the clerks do not need, and should not have, access to the confidential deliberations of the arbitrators. A former arbitrator is well placed for the task. I don't blame other former arbitrators for running away screaming, for it involves all the hard work and drudgery of being an arbitrator without the right to have a vote in the final decision. And would anybody have been so much happier if one of the other former arbitrators, say David Gerard or Ambi, had taken the position? Few former arbitrators leave the post without having accrued some degree of notoriety. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 18:41, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Do all former arbitrators retain their rights to arbcom-l? It seems like it would be standard process for former members to be removed from the list. Certainly if there is to be a Clerks office, and there is going to be a head clerk, it does make some sense to have a former arbitrator in the position. It is certainly a valid concern to note the timing and lack of transparency - a head clerk appointed after an abortive bid for arbcom, and within days, is rather unseemly. If the clerks in general should not have access to the confidential deliberations, but the head clerk does, it might put the head clerk into a uniquely difficult position. This person would need to be especially skilled at the arbitrator and clerk duties to be truly effective, and should also be a member of the community held in the highest regard to help avoid even the appearance of bias. --<a href="../../../d/s/c/User%7EDschor_7a19.html" title="User:Dschor">Dschor</a> 18:50, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Yes, all former arbitrators can read an advise on the arbcom mailing list. This is to provide continuity and let the present arbs benefit from their experience. I see no problem with that. It seems to me that most users don't have a problem with clerkhood per se, but with (1) the way clerks are chosen, or (2) individual clerks (indeed, it seems the ArbCom has underestimated the sheer controversiality of certain users). Hence, if community had some say in clerk appointments (by which I emphatically don't mean a vote), this problem would be solved and this forest fire ended. Clerking shouldn't be a big deal, but apparently some people are really not trusted (see proposal at <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia_talk%7EArbitration_Committee_Clerks_6c83.html#Point_of_process" title="Wikipedia talk:Arbitration Committee/Clerks">Wikipedia talk:Arbitration Committee/Clerks#Point of process</a>). <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 20:41, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I think there's a lot of focus on the fact that three of the clerks got, in an arbitration committee election, less than 50% approval for the position of arbitrator. I'd like to point out that six clerks were chosen solely from about a score of people who volunteered. Four of them happened to have stood as candidates for arbitrator, and (as most candidates did) failed to get community approval. One of them is an experienced arbitrator, two of them are experienced in arbitration work from the other side, having completed work on important cases in the recent past in which a large proportion of the final decision issued by the Committee was actually drafted by them. Whatever personal opinion you may have of them, they're eminently qualified and respected Wikipedians. And they volunteered. There may of course be more qualified people who failed to volunteer. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 09:05, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>To my personal recollection, I drafted, on the workshop page, over half of what became the findings of fact and one of the two remedies in the final decision of the Webcomics case. IOthers drew up their own proposed principles, findings of fact and remedies, and some of those were also adopted (the second remedy was drafted by Snowspinner and accepted with an alteration proposed by Aaron Brenneman and supported by me). This is the purpose for which the workshop pages are intended. All proposals on the workshop page were public and subject to comment by arbitrators, participants and others. The amount of scrutiny on that case was exceptionally high and the arbitrators had the opportunity to take into account the opinions of all who commented on the case--and there was a lot of comment. And to answer the question you didn't ask, all my contributions on the case were public. I did not email any of the arbitrators individually or as a group. I cannot speak for the other participants. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 11:28, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It <b>isn't about personalities</b> it is about summaries being drafted by anyone not an arbitrator.

What hole is there at present that this will spackle over? Is this the only possible solution?

<p>I'm not sure I understand your objection to public summaries by clerks, geogre. Anyone can make a summary of evidence. On Webcomics workshop a lot of the proposed findings of fact were in effect summaries of evidence, and not one of them was prepared by a clerk. If a clerk or anyone else produces a summary and someone has an objection to it, then he can post his contrary evidence on the evidence page and his alternative summary in the workshop page. Could you explain what the substantive objection is here? Should the findings of fact that I proposed in webcomics have been rejected automatically where they amounted to digests of evidence? Were I to have produced the same digests while wearing the hat (they promised us all hats) of a clerk, should the proposals then have been rejected, but not when I made them as a participant? --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 17:21, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

Further, you may recall that I did, indeed, reject your findings of fact because you were a litigant, not an observer, and you even <i>signed yourself as a party of the dispute</i> when you claimed to be summarizing. You may see the eventual findings as being yours, but I wholeheartedly disagree. They were, in fact, not your wordings nor your ideas, and they sure didn't match the ArbCom case that Phil brought. But, again, what <i>advantage</i> is there to an official summarizer of disputes?

I'd appreciate an eventual answer to <i>my</i> questions, but I'll address yours int he meantime.because I know the answers and they're probably of more general interest than your answers to mine.</p>
<p>There is no advantage to me in this that I can see. I put myself forward as arbitrator, knowing that it would involve more work than any sane person would accept, out of a sense of responsibility to the encyclopedia. I put myself forward as clerk out of the same sense of responsibility. There was no question in my mind that I should do a job of which I have been proven capable.</p>
<p>You personally may well have rejected my findings, but the arbitration committee did not. You say "They were, in fact, not your wordings nor your ideas." This is easily demonstrated to be false: Rather than give chapter and verse, I'll give two of the most obvious examples.</p>
<ul>
<li>Finding of fact 1 in the arbitration final ruling, which I will refer to as "X's edits to deletion policy" is word for word my proposed finding of fact 1.2, "X edits deletion policy" with the addition of two sentences, one referring to the history of the section edited by X and the other describing a subsequent edit.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Remedy 1, "X admonished" is word-for-word my proposed remedy 3 "X admonished to seek consensus on policy". The whole thing was adopted. This remedy followed from the finding of fact above.</li>
</ul>
<p>But I'm not claiming to be a ventriloquist able to operate the Committee as my own mouthpiece. What I'm saying (going way back to the start of this subsection) is that I'm a reasonable draftsman and I know what kind of material the arbitrators are looking for. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 20:02, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>However, Tony, you should realize that it is reasonable to expect your recusal from any case involving that specific person X you just mentioned. I am not saying that you <i>have</i> a conflict of interest, but because you frequently appear to be in a quarrel with that specific person X it can far too easily be <i>perceived</i> as a conflict of interest. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 20:23, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Absolutely. There would be a gross conflict of interest were I to act as a clerk involving that person. In the case I have cited, I had joined the case as a participant and contributed evidence on my own account against him; there could be no credible claim of impartiality in a subsequent case. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 22:35, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm speaking on behalf of the whole AC when I say this:</p>
<p>The Arbitrators have agreed that under normal circumstances, clerk evidence summaries should be public. They will be placed at the top of the proposed decision page of the cases. Clerks will not post evidence summaries to the private arbitration mailing list unless specifically asked to do so by the AC. (This will only happen in exceptional circumstances) We would like to point out that anyone is free to email an arbitrator privately about any matter. This has always been the case and will continue to be the case.</p>
<p>I'm back talking as myself here:</p>
<p>I know that this announcement will not satisfy everyone's fears but I hope that this will make everyone feel at least a little better about the AC and the clerks office. We do listen to peoples worries and we do do our best to take them on board. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> | <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">Taste the Korn</a> 16:46, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would like this userpage to be deleted. It is pushing a POV, and is factually inaccurate in order to push that POV.

I did, and while edits have been made, the incorrect material is still there. Futhermore, apparently DRV was not where I was supposed to go.</p>
<p>The reason the material is on KJV's userpage in the first place is because much of it was not allowed to be put on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Freemasons_3d63.html" title="List of Freemasons">List of Freemasons</a>. There was either a) no reputable verification (many of his original cites were from evangelical Christian, anti-Masonic, or conspiracy theory sites); b) there was no way to come to a consensus (there was as much evidence against membership as there was for it, i.e. Thomas Jefferson); or c) it was simply wrong (most notably, Bush and Cheney are not Masons, Skull and Bones is not a Masonic organization, and Charles Taze Russell wasn't a Mason either).

<li>Yes, that's exactly what I mean. Psychim62's remark (<i>"No, it's been listed on MfD as a breach of Wikipedia:User page"</i>) is in agreement with listing it for deletion. Therefore your claim that this was "unanimous feeling" is clearly and obviously false, because there was a dissenter. In other words, it is obvious that you failed to read the debate, and as a consequence of your carelessness and a failure to assume good faith you made the false and baseless accusation that people are engaging in "malicious slander campaigns".

<dd>It's an idiotic template that should be got rid of sooner than later. Unlike works of the US government, which are considered PD, works of the German government are copyrighted as a rule. There is a very narrow exception in <a href="http://bundesrecht.juris.de/urhg/BJNR012730965BJNE004501377.html" class="external text" title="http://bundesrecht.juris.de/urhg/BJNR012730965BJNE004501377.html" rel="nofollow">§ 5 UrhG</a> on laws and the like promulgated by the government or its agencies.

<p>After reviewing the discussion on Template talk:GermanGov and the links to the discussion on de, I've concluded that this template should not be used at all. According to the image use policy on de, works of the German government are generally protected, with narrow exceptions for official announcements, laws, court orders, and a few other things that are published in the official register of the government. Works created by German government employees acting in official capacity are in fact protected by copyright, unlike the works of the US federal government.</p>
<p>The nomination of this template on <a href="../../../t/f/d/WP%7ETFD_eab7.html" title="WP:TFD">WP:TFD</a> was rather pointless: it's an exercise in futility to try to decide what is ultimately a legal issue by discussion (let alone a vote, which TFD is not). Note that by deleting this template I'm not trying to interpret German law or to determine how it applies to Wikipedia: If there are any legal questions, they should be directed to the Wikimedia Foundation. The reason I deleted this template is that there is clear and overwhelming evidence that we cannot use the images the template was designed to cover, at least not under the rationale put forth on this template. We have to err on the side of caution here. The images previously tagged as {{GermanGov}} should be reviewed to see if they can be used under some other rationale. For historical images that are hard or essentially impossible to replace, fair use may apply. For others, such as Image:Eastern European hedgehog.jpg, we may need to find free replacements or delete them. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a>&#160;<small><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkSweep_9d72.html" title="User talk:MarkSweep">(call me collect)</a></small> 23:46, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>While I can not speak to German law, I am quite certain that Germany is stricter in allowance for the use of government-created images than is the United States.

<dd>The template is wrong, at least for the majority (if not all) of the images that use it. There is a dispute as to what the correct situation is, which is being resolved. The opinions of those who have been reverting the template are not in accordance with <a href="../../../../de/b/i/l/Wikipedia%7EBildrechte_2cb8.html" class="extiw" title="de:Wikipedia:Bildrechte">policy on German Wikipedia</a>, for what that matters. Although I would usually welcome an overly cautious approach to image copyright, I feel that this is going too far. EN wikipedia has images which have been tagged in good faith with this tag, we must decide what needs doing with them: such a process needs more attention than has been given by those involved in the template deletion or on the template talk page. <a href="../../../p/h/y/User%7EPhyschim62_966c.html" title="User:Physchim62">Physchim62</a> <a href="../../../p/h/y/User_talk%7EPhyschim62_05f3.html" title="User talk:Physchim62">(talk)</a> 21:02, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I replaced this template with {{PUI}} precisely because it is still needed during cleanup. What needs to happen now is for everyon to go back and review the images that were tagged as {{GermanGov}} to decide whether they can be used under some other rationale. I think in most cases this will be pretty easy: the vast majority of them are historical images that cannot be recreated or easily replaced. They should probably all be tagged as {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>}}. The best way forward in a situation like this is to provide as much information as possible about each image: who is the original photographer? who is the copyright holder? what collection or web site was the image taken from? what are the conditions for redistribution? Those are the things that will help us determine if and how we can use the images here. Simply slapping a tag on an image wtihout providing further information is generally not a good solution, as the present situation shows: if the rationale behind the tag is questioned, we have to review all the information we have about the image, and if that information is missing, the job will be that much harder. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a>&#160;<small><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkSweep_9d72.html" title="User talk:MarkSweep">(call me collect)</a></small> 21:24, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't think any wikipedian needs to put up with this persecution, let alone a constructive and useful contributor like DreamGuy (even if he <i>is</i> of less than perfect tact).

<dd>Wow. The idea that I am DG's sockpuppet kind of blows my mind considering some of the rows we've had in the past&#160;:) But, yeah, best someone else reviews this.

I have never had a serious problem with Dreamguy's edits in my own work here, so this entire row betwixt him and Elonka was a bit of a surprise.&#160;::shrug:: Then again, we rarely come across each other in our editing habits. I really cannot imagine how someone could detect any discernable pattern that would link you, Haukur, Dieter, myself, and Dreamguy as being one person considering what our contrib lists are like, interests, language patterns... it makes no sense at all to do so.</dd>

<p>"Fundamentally a good editor, here to improve and protect the encyclopedia". As a person who's been subject to the similar levels of abuse that Elonka has, I actually believe that deep down he is. However he can be counter-productive, in order to achieve to what he thinks is best he's all to happy to throw personal insults and it's no surprise to me that Elonka is going to try and file for a RFC. She went through the steps detailed at the dispute resolution, every post she made was reverted. I advised her to give up because although I thought she was right to want an apology I didn’t think she’d get a resolution.</p>
<p>I can see clearly where Elonka is coming from by my own experiences. I don’t find it nice when I read accusations such as “Unfortunately the sockpuppets were ready this time and they have come back in force, led by Englishrose placing more likely hoaxed info to try to support the article” made against you when you know you’re not involved in sockpuppetry, have already been proven not to be a sockpuppet and haven’t knowingly issued hoaxed information. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Aladin_%28magician%29#Nomination_for_deletion" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Aladin_%28magician%29#Nomination_for_deletion" rel="nofollow">[101]</a>. It’s not nice to be accused of lying. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Aladin_%28magician%29" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Aladin_%28magician%29" rel="nofollow">[102]</a>. That’s only an example of the abuse I’ve received from DreamGuy, Elonka has had similar and probably worse accusations made against her as she documents in her page, which I feel is the correct way to go about it rather than making repeated posts on DreamGuy’s talk page and getting nowhere like she was before. If I was well known and these accusations were branded publicly and not just inside Wikipedia, DreamGuy would be sued for slander and I’d make no hesitation in doing so. Yes Wikipedia is not real life but he should assume good faith. The ironic thing is that Elonka is reasonably notable outside wikipedia.</p>
<p>On one hand he stops people from pushing POV, protects a lot of articles and does a lot of good. On the other hand he can be rather rude to other editors and this can cause low morale amongst them, thus they are less inclined to positively participate in wikipedia and so forth. All Elonka wants it an apology, it’s not a big thing to ask. I can’t really be arsed getting so worked up over DreamGuy cause it’s the internet not a matter of life or death. What really worries me instead of condemning DreamGuy’s personal attacks people seem to praising them, which in a communal environment is very worrying. I don’t think anyone would have a problem with DreamGuy if he toned down his attitude a little.</p>
<p>However, Elonka shouldn’t get too worked up about this because it’s wikipedia not life or death.</p>
<p>Update: As I write this, Elonka’s been blocked indefinitely. I don’t want to stir the boat but that seems a bit dodgy. “clearly not being here to write an encyclopedia”, have you checked her contributions? From my brief glance it seems that before DreamGuy got her so worked up she seemed to be contributing to the enclapedia.</p>
<p>Do whatever you want to me for sticking up for Elonka. Make personal attacks, block me. Do whatever. It wouldn’t surprise me if you did. At the end of the day I’m speaking my mind. Without being too moralistic, it’s not right to stand by and watch people be persecuted for standing up for themselves when they’ve had wrong-doing done towards them. I’ll speak my mind and rest easy tonight.</p>

<dd>Bishonen, you're <i>everyone's</i> sock-puppet! Seriously, looking through Elonka's contributions, she's obviously been doing some good stuff. Equally obviously, the Elonka-Dreamguy situation is very nasty and completely out of control. If blocking Elonka is the only way to end it then fair enough, but I'd be happier if Elonka agreed to stay away from DG in return for being unblocked. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkalexander100_03f8.html" title="User:Markalexander100">Mark</a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkalexander100_f98a.html" title="User talk:Markalexander100"><sup>1</sup></a> 21:58, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As I'm not an admin, and can no-longer really be called neutral in this case, I will not comment on the above.

<dd>You thought wrong. Elonka is blocked. Blocked has got to mean <i>something</i>, right? It means she only gets to post on her own talkpage. Her talkpage is watched by the blocking admin and probably others. She can also e-mail the blocking admin, or any admin, or the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Mailing list</a>, to protest her block. This information will have appeared in the block message that came up when she tried to edit. Petros, what you're doing--acting as "mailman" for a blocked user to get to post in a discusssion--is inappropriate, and frowned on. (I'm sorry I have no link to a policy or guideline that says so--I've spent some time looking for one, without success, but I do know there is one. It's common sense, too.) I have removed the several posts from Elonka that you placed below. Here, instead, is a <a href="../../../e/l/o/User_talk%7EElonka_f038.html#Gender_and_WP:ANI" title="User talk:Elonka">link to her talkpage</a>, where the same posts are easily viewable, right at the bottom of the page.

<li>Something on her talk page does raise a point. I would ask that reviewing admins make a distinction between actions of Elonka and those of Castanea. From reading your post even I got muddled to had made the accusations of sockpuppetry and who had made personal attacks. Castanea made accussations of suckpuppetry and personal attacks. NOT Elonka. So I hope this has been noted. Further more due to this: apart from attempting to file an RFC against DreamGuy and asking for an apology…I can’t see what Elonka has done wrong. <a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEnglishrose_b44b.html" title="User:Englishrose">Englishrose</a> 22:43, 29 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>Elonka has a very legitimate case documenting a long campaign of harassment and verbal abuse by DreamGuy. Indeed she has documented such by him against herself and against several other users here as well.</p>
<ol>
<li>Elonka is one of Wikipedia's most outstanding editors and an accomplished and several-times recognized figure in the United States.</li>
<li>Elonka's conduct has been more than above board and peerless.</li>
<li>All users have a very real right not to be subject to the <b>F-word</b> and other extreme abuse such as she has experienced and documented.</li>
<li>Such abuse and harassment far exceeds what Bishonen admits is a lack of "tact."</li>
<li>All users should feel free to blow the whistle as she has and not be punished.</li>
<li>Whistle-blowing is not harassment.</li>
<li>Documenting use of filthy language used by DreamGuy is not harassment.</li>
<li>Elonka has made no inappropriate comments directed at DreamGuy or Bishonen ever.</li>
<li>Use of third party comments (mine) posted to her for her and into her own personal Talk page alone is irrelevant and inappropriate.</li>
<li>Bishonen misrepresented facts made in plain sight: DreamGuy began a campaign of partial blanking of a hundred or so pages on Wikipedia immediately following my involvement as an observer - within 40 minutes. There was no prior dispute.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Elonka/DreamGuy_dispute/Evidence-1#Section_by_Castanea_Dentata" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Elonka/DreamGuy_dispute/Evidence-1#Section_by_Castanea_Dentata" rel="nofollow">[107]</a></li>
<li>Blocking users for blowing the whistle against harassment and filthy language is censorship.</li>
<li>Retaliation of users for whistle-blowing violates the spirit and expression of Wikipedia policy.</li>
<li>Retaliation for whistle-blowing is unethical.</li>
<li>Punishing Elonka tells all Wikipedians that they will be blocked if they object to abuse and <b>filthy language</b>, document it and complain.</li>
<li><b>Since Bishonen was already a subject of the whistle-blowing, he was already conflicted out from any further association with the matter.</b></li>
<li>All Elonka asked for was an <b>apology.</b></li>

<dd>Nearly everything above is jsut completey wrong. I most certainly did not blank -- partial or otherwise -- a "hundred or so pages" or any page, and claims that Bishonene misrepresented it are false when CD is so blatantly lying is just outrageous. What he is completely mischaracterizing here is that I fixed a template that was ostensibly about Mesopotamian mythology but included inaccurate information and a lot of links that had nothing to do with Mesopotamian mythology at all, and it came up as part of my regular edits an articles on my watchlist -- someone linked to an article that contained grosly inaccurate info, and when I fixed it I saw the template was linking to it, and went to fix that and saw all the other problems. Elonka did not just ask for an apology, she asked for all records to be erased, apologies over things that never happened, a record of this apology across a whole string of articles, and other bizarre things. She got her apology now, copied and pasted just like she wanted, but she still is insisting upon making claims that simply are not accurate. To characterize Elonka's continual haraassment of me as "whistleblowing" is absolute nonsense. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 00:30, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, for what it's worth, my feeling now is that she's probably a real person... after all, she supposedly has an article here about her own accomplishements, but then if that's not her she should be gone for impersonation. But some of the people giving her advice I think were clearly socks of the people who hoaxed the original <a href="../../../a/l/a/Aladin.html" title="Aladin">aladin</a> article (where a sock check was already done on earlier participants and found a ton) and were hoping to use her and anyone else they could get to get at me for helping discover some of the deceptive info in the article. I think her behavior was over the top, but I think she did do some good edits, so if the whole IP thing is sorted out and she wants to give it a rest, I personally have no objection to allowing her back. Up to you guys how it goes though.</p>
<p>For what it's worth, I see she said she'd quit everything if I copied and pasted this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Elonka, please accept my apologies for my comments. My words were hasty, and my remarks uncivil.

<p>Though I'm not going to go put it on the six or more pages she wants it on, that's just silly.</p>
<p>Of course if the checks inadvertantly prove my original belief that she wasn't who she said she was, I guess that might explain why she was was so upset. I don't know. Anyway. If she is who she says, she's an extremely focused personality (code cracker) and maybe that's all this was here: inappropriate focus.</p>

<p>OK, well, apparently neither my running the apology she asked for and trying to put in a good word for her nor the fact that several admins agree her behavior was simply unacceptable hasn't done anything to make her be more contrite or to try to work anything out. Elonka has decided to create a page on her website, <a href="http://www.elonka.com/wikipedia/" class="external free" title="http://www.elonka.com/wikipedia/" rel="nofollow">http://www.elonka.com/wikipedia/</a>, to attack this encyclopedia and is making demands of us: <i>"The attacks generated against me <b>must</b> be removed in order for this matter to be resolved. This is not negotiable."</i> But unfortunately the "attacks" she refers to are just opinions of her bad behavior and not personal attacks at all. The fact that she was harassing me and stalking me is, to her, something that needs to be purged from any page where it was mentioned... OK, pretty much at this point it's clear that she's not really dealing with reality all that well. Indefinitely banned and she's making ultimatums and trying to make herself out to be someone so important that we have to cave: <i>"I am not someone who is going to "go away". I am a public figure. I am a known online personality as well as a professional in a major online field."</i> She's not at all acting in a manner that reflectts the seriousness of what she was doing, and at this point until she learns to be reasonable and want to work with people instead of making ridiculous demands she expects everyone else to follow I think it's probably best she just not come back. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 02:37, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>How is that an attack page? Obviously she's very hurt and has written a page about it. But nowhere in it does she attack Wikipedia or you personally.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Sometimes, I absolutely despair of people here. It <i>hurts</i> to be told you're a liar, a scammer and a sockpuppet. You <i>hurt</i> her, DreamGuy. You played rough. You're not exactly contrite about it either. Why not extend some love to the woman? Remove the comments that have upset her or let me know you agree and I will do it for you. Why not? Is it so essential to continue to hurt another person? Even if you think you were justified at the time in saying what you said, is it really right to keep on saying it?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And if it's not been done, can someone please unblock her? It's <i>utterly</i> wrong to block someone for wanting a wrong righted. Sandbox RFCs are not attack pages when editors who we know better use them, are they? <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 02:53, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But when she responds to the "wrong" by acting extremely wrong herself and then lashing out at several people telling her she was doing wrong and than stalking to try to get the "wrong" fixed and making demands that are wholly beyond all common sense in order to in her mind "right" the "wrong", she's just plain wrong. I'm sorry you don't see that. People have disagreements, adults know how to let trivial things drop instead of obsessing about them. Out of all the problem editors I've run across, her sheer obsessiveness and inability to admit any wrong or deal with things rationally ranks probably up there in the top five. And the worst part is she is a mature adult, allegedly trying to work within the system, she should have known better. But when various admins told her she was not being realistic and being harassing, she accused them of not being impartial and being out to get her and that I had a huge number of admins unfairly protecting me (and, really, from the history here the opposite is probably more accurate). The facts are that I apologized and tried to put in a good word for her, which I did not have to do, and she's still making ultimatums when she now has clear evidence that what she was doing was unacceptable. Maybe she just needs to cool down and then she can apologize and set things right, but the way she's acting now certainly won't win her any support. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 03:14, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For the record, I don't agree with <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">User:Bishonen</a>'s characterisation summarised at the top of this discussion and I suspect blocking <a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">User:Elonka</a> is a mistake. Unless the ipcheck gives good grounds for suspecting the account is actually a sockpuppet or other bad faith editor, it would probably be a good idea to lift the block. This discussion of harassment is overblown. My review of the early part of this dispute is that Elonka wandered into a dispute and got heavily critised for it. All subsequent actions appear to be those of an agrieved editor looking for an apology, trying to follow dispute resolution and in the face of stonewalling moving towards an RFC on DreamGuy. I advised Elonka to avoid an RFC, but to seek assistance if she really needed to bring one. The 'attack page' is really just a subpage to prepare for an RfC. The dispute is significantly complicated by the fact that DreamGuy (whom I regard to be good, if forthright editor) is a frequent target of sockpuppets and other editors of dubious track record - no doubt some of them will have also become involved. -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolipsist_66d1.html" title="User:Solipsist">Solipsist</a> 23:46, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hang on. Did Elonka really get banned for preparing an RFC? Is it now a bannable offence to be sufficiently upset by an aggressive editor that you go to dispute resolution?

<dl>
<dd>I have to ask. Is it okay for an editor whose name we know to call someone a "liar" and a "scammer" -- personal attacks in anyone's language -- and repeatedly be uncivil to another editor but someone who isn't so familiar gets no latitude?

<dd>Well, you'll forgive me for taking the view that that seems to be what David Gerard has actually blocked her for. Her "attack page" is simply a sandbox RfC. I don't see any sign that she's attacked you whatsoever. I can't see any "stalking" either but, you know, if you say shitty things to people, sometimes they're going to be hurt enough to keep asking you to apologise. All you need to do to make it right is remove six edits of yours. They're quite unpleasant and you can't be proud of them, so why not? It seems to me that and an apology on her talkpage should be sufficient. I'm sure in turn she would be happy to apologise for her part in the dispute.

The things she wants removed as "personal attacks" against her are simply cases of me accurately pointing out what she wsa doing, and in the meantime she made tons of personal attacks herself and welcomed other editors to do so and encouraged them yet doesn't feel the need to remove all those. Furthermore if you can't see evidence of stalking you simply haven't read the above or simply do not wish to see it. It gets old seeing the same old people attacking elsewhere as part of Elonka's gang showing up to complain as if she -- and you -- did nothing wrong. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 23:10, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm just coming to this, and I've tried to scan the links presented, but the whole thing leaves me puzzled. If I'm ignorant, maybe at least I'm unbiased. They're both productive editors. It looks like there is at least some hope that mediation might work. Couldn't Elonka and DreamGuy just avoid each other while mediation or arbitration takes it's course? Also, where are the personnal attacks that are the basis for Elonka's block? I don't say they're not there, just that I may have missed the really bad ones. Certainly there's a fair amount of incivility all around, but Elonka's doesn't jump out at me as especially bad. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 03:21, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think we should unblock Elonka. She was doing some useful encyclopedic editing before she tangled with DreamGuy, who was, in my view, somewhat rude and failed to assume good faith.

<p>Elonka seems to misunderstand our dispute resolution processes. Dispute resolution is simply that: to resolve current disputes. They are not set up as a means to get justice for previous harms and wrongs, to force people to apologise, or to purge comments from the Wikipedia. Most Wikipedians get into unpleasant disputes with people at times. Unless it's an egrerious and ongoing problem, the best approach is just to move on and get on with writing an encyclopedia. Elonka wants justice, but on Wikipedia, as in many areas of life, there often simply <i>isn't</i> justice, even for "public figures". To ardently press for justice for an old and dead dispute just ends up being disruptive and unproductive. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 08:30, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have no real interest in pursuing this matter further myself. However, I've exchanged email with both Elonka and Solipsist on this matter, including suggesting (based on my experience of how the Wikipedia social dynamic works) that removing or severely toning down the page linked above would be a very good idea to further a happier involvement with Wikipedia - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 11:23, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well I had hoped some common sense would prevail. Let me clarify some events which I started to outline on DreamGuy's talk page, whilst this affair was rapidly escalating over here. This isn't an 'old history' dispute, it only started ten days ago.</p>
<ul>
<li>There was an AfD on <a href="../../../a/l/a/Aladin_%28magician%29.html" title="Aladin (magician)">aladin (magician)</a>. Its a messy AfD with some highly dubious voting behaviour. Elonka responds to an RFC and lines up on the keep side of the vote, whilst DreamGuy is aligned with the delete side.</li>

<li>eventually DreamGuy asks <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">User:Android79</a> to help prevent further 'harassment' <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Android79&amp;diff=36501237&amp;oldid=36459819" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Android79&amp;diff=36501237&amp;oldid=36459819" rel="nofollow">15:16, 24 January 2006</a>.</li>

</ul>
<p>Now up to this point Elonka appears to be following exactly what we advise in <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">Dispute resolution</a> and is effectively being told to go away. The next recommended step is an RFC, so Elonka approaches a number of other editors, including myself <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Solipsist&amp;diff=36505460&amp;oldid=36494607" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Solipsist&amp;diff=36505460&amp;oldid=36494607" rel="nofollow">16:02, 24 January 2006</a> for advice on what to do next. My recommendation was to ingnore all previous RFCs on DreamGuy, to think twice before bringing an RFC, but if she really feels that she needs to proceed with one, she should seek assistance from someone knowledgable with the process and martial her evidence carefully. But I also have a word with DreamGuy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:DreamGuy&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=36517238" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:DreamGuy&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=36517238" rel="nofollow">18:03, 24 January 2006</a> to no avail <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:DreamGuy&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=36522916" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:DreamGuy&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=36522916" rel="nofollow">[111]</a></p>
<p>Elonka receives a significant amount of contradictory advice, but much of it recommends avoiding an RFC. I was impressed with by <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncyclopedist_b147.html" title="User:Encyclopedist">User:Encyclopedist</a>'s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Encyclopedist&amp;diff=36515954&amp;oldid=36494802" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Encyclopedist&amp;diff=36515954&amp;oldid=36494802" rel="nofollow">response</a>, given that he had previously engaged in some pretty dodgy behaviour against DreamGuy and is now reformed.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, things rumble on for another week. Elonka appears to be getting more and more frustrated and starts to assist other users in dispute with DreamGuy - not a good idea given the dodgy nature of some of the editors who try to oppose DreamGuy. DreamGuy meanwhile stays true to his word and largely tries to ignore Elonka, whilst getting on with his usual round of battling sockpuppets on controversial articles.</p>
<p>Then we end up with this debacle over alledged harassment and attack pages, which is more like an impromptue RFC on Elonka. No worse, an impromptue RfAr, given that the quick solution was to block Elonka for a year. Now it seems to me that most interested parties have made mistakes over the past week, but primarily the dispute resolution process hasn't worked very well, and I don't think we have been entirely fair to Elonka.</p>
<p>I would advocate removing any remaining block on Elonka. DreamGuy has offered an apology above and with luck that might be enough to draw a line under the matter. I don't think either Elonka or DreamGuy typically edits in any overlapping subject areas, so it should be easy for them to avoid each other. If this doesn't satisfy both of them, we should move on to a proper RFC or RfAr to weigh up both sides of the dispute more carefully, rather than argue the point here. -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolipsist_66d1.html" title="User:Solipsist">Solipsist</a> 12:46, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I find it funny that Solipsist here is asking for "common sense" to prevail while quite substantially slanting the history of what happened and glossing over some major important parts. First, that Elonka started the uncivil behavior, acting as if she were continuing an old fight with disparaging comments instead of it being her first comment ever about another longtime editor, which with all the <i>proven</i> sockpuppets running around at that time and making personal attacks made it look like she was either a new sockpuppet (as there were and are new accounts created specifically to continue the fighting after the first ones were blocked) or being strongly mislead by them. She had ideas about the policies and the results of the previoous vote that were simply untrue, and when I tried to point them out she ignored them and continued to make the same false and deceptive comments. Second, that Solopsist here was <i>specifically</i> recruited by her because he was one of few editors in a previous RFC started by a vandal and two people who have since been booted as a result of ARbcom decisions who had suggested that I needed to adjust my behavior. Having people show up here (like Solipsist and Alkivar) trying to act like outside observers when they are merely continuing old disputes is really quite ridiculous. Clearly they do not understand the concept that conflict resolution is only about ongoing conflict and not attempts to have revenge for old behavior, so naturally Solipsist is glossing over the fact that the conflict was over and done with but Elonka was still clearly harassing and stalking me. His view that she was merely following what RFC guidelines suggest is simply inaccurate, because it does not say anything about continuing to post over and over and over even after being told to leave and do whatever she wants elsewhere.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If anything needs to come out of this, it needs to be that people have to be made aware that continuing harassment and escalating conflicts that would disappear if they just let it go and moved on is simply unacceptable. From the comments of Solipsist, Alkivar and others here have made, apparently they do not get that purposefully striking out at people in active ways is a far worse problem that an occasional slip of the tongue -- especially since their bias makes them completely ignore all the extensive personal attacks and uncivil language made by the side that wsa ostensibly complaining about it. I would hope that admins and arbitrators and so forth would clearly state that this behavior is simply unacceptable to make Alkivar and others cool their heels. Otherwise this is just going to flare up again and again as they take their attacks where they can hoping to score an end result to their liking. Continuing harassment is a pretty extreme form of uncivil behavior, and it needs to stop. And with Elonka knowing that she can get out of it by appealing to a admins and others who also do harassment, I'm afraid that nobody will have learned their lessons here. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 18:24, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I know Elonka from many articles to which we’ve been contributing together. I would never say that there were any problems with her and I hope she has the same opinion about me. It doesn’t mean that we always hold the same views, on the contrary. But Elonka certainly is a reasonable person who listens to arguments of other parties and goes along with the will of majority.</p>
<p>Does she have flaws? Certainly, as everyone else. And yes, she’s a contributor who is ready to widely advertise her case if she thinks she’s defending justice (I don’t mean this particular case but another that I observed which didn’t affect Elonka personally). I don’t say she’s right on wrong in her judgements, and I agree with Matt Crypto that Wikipedia is not a place to find justice in. I think that many of us have (sadly) learnt the lesson here, and I guess Elonka will learn it with time too. But for people who have a strong feeling of justice the lack of it is very bothering and becomes stressful with time.</p>
<p>There is a problem and it definitely should be resolved. But this whole discussion focuses mostly on Elonka, not on the problem. Moreover, Elonka isn’t even allowed to take part in it while her opponent is. As I see it, Wikipedia rules are not perfect. It is uncertain if they can be any better. But people shouldn’t be punished for the rules’ shortcomings. I agree that an RfC is not a perfect solution, but if not it, then what is? The usual advice people get is something like: <i>I know that you were treated unjustly and rudely, but there really isn’t any good tool to deal with it, so just forget about it.</i> Well, not everyone is able to forget and Elonka obviously isn’t. Maybe for Elonka an outcome of an RfC would be important even if it didn’t change the reality. Maybe if we can’t make people see that they treat us unjustly, it’s at least good to see that there are some other people who agree with us.</p>
<p>I think that Elonka should be unblocked and a mediation between her and DreamGuy should be made. I don’t know DreamGuy, but as he is said to be a reasonable contributor, I’m sure a mediation made by an objective Wikipedian may be fruitful for all parties involved.--<a href="../../../s/y/l/User%7ESylwiaS_ce3b.html" title="User:SylwiaS">SylwiaS</a> | <a href="../../../s/y/l/User_talk%7ESylwiaS_f9ed.html" title="User talk:SylwiaS">talk</a> 17:59, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agree. Just for the record, does DreamGuy deny having said the things about her that she documents? And if not, doen't that pretty much confirm that he's in the wrong? Unless this dispute goes farther back than the timeline shown above, or I'm misunderstanding it, this started when the two of them disagreed about whether or not a specific template should appear on a long list of relevant articles. He admits to having deleted it from a whole list of articles because he didn't think it was any good; she went around and reverted those deletions because she would prefer that the Mesopotamiam mythology-related pages have a sidebar like the ones that Greek mythology pages do and would prefer that the sidebar be fixed rather than deleted. If someone gives you a long list of pages they've changed in a way you disagree with and you go revert all of those changes, how is that wikistalking? That's an ordinary editing dispute that he needlessly escalated by throwing around personal insults. It looks more to me like it's DreamGuy who needs to be blocked until he learns to play by the rules, because it looks to me like it's him, not her, that violated Wikipedia policy. (Disclaimer: Yes, I know Elonka Dunin personally. It would be an exaggeration to say that we're friends, but I do know her. However, as someone who's argued with her in the past, and whose politics are 100% the opposite of hers, you should not assume that I'll take her side automatically just because we live in the same town and have some friends in common. Nor did I come here at her behest; I came her looking for additional info on the Congressional Staffer Edits dispute and found this by accident.) <a href="../../../j/b/r/User%7EJBradHicks_6c61.html" title="User:JBradHicks">J.

<dd><i>"Unless this dispute goes farther back than the timeline shown above, or I'm misunderstanding it, this started when the two of them disagreed about whether or not a specific template should appear on a long list of relevant articles."</i> You are definitely misunderstanding, as the template was the END thing she did right before her block, and not how the thing started at all. She wsa rude to me, I responded in kind, I pointed out she was breaking policies and either a sockpuppet of someone previously on the article in question or someone who had taken the side of proven puppets/liars/scam artists without researching it properly, I pointed out the policies and the past history, she attacked me some more, I ignored her, she started wikistalking me, and then at the very end went in to revert the template in question (not putting it back on a bunch of pages -- don;t know where you came up withthat at all) specifically because one of many people she contacted from past conflicts with me to sitr up trouble suggested she do so because if he reverted he'd be blocked for violating 3RR and because they both knew it would annoy me. She had no prior involvement in anything related tot hat optic whatsoever, and from the comments he and her made which Bishonene already linked to, the whole thing was to piss me off and undo whatever I was doing elsewhere on the site because I was refusing to respond to her attacks on her page or my talk page or at the page where it started. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 13:03, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Elonka, Hipocrite is not a troll. I've been following the discussions for some time and I must say that Hipocrite did a lot to help your cause even if he doesn't agree with the means you undertook against DreamGuy. And now you undertake the same means against Hipocrite. Calling him a troll and telling on him on other pages really doesn't bring you any profits. You were insulted, I can understand it. I was too, many times. Not everyone here behaves. But well, <i>noblesse oblige</i>, if you don't want to become similar to the rude people, you cannot lower yourself to their level. I checked the changes Hipocrite made to <a href="../../../e/l/o/Elonka_Dunin_e23d.html" title="Elonka Dunin">Elonka Dunin</a> article, there was nothing wrong with them. Everyone can edit Wikipedia, even articles about living persons. Hipocrite tried to mediate in your cause, he was rejected by DreamGuy and insulted by yourself. Yet, he didn't lose his temper. Quite remarkable.--<a href="../../../s/y/l/User%7ESylwiaS_ce3b.html" title="User:SylwiaS">SylwiaS</a> | <a href="../../../s/y/l/User_talk%7ESylwiaS_f9ed.html" title="User talk:SylwiaS">talk</a> 20:29, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sheesh. "Hipocrite is a troll?" Well, I'm not fond of the user, but this kind of heat without light is exactly what testifies to this complaint. Elonka, you got mad. DreamGuy got mad. DreamGuy went about his business. You stayed mad and kept escalating. At which point does a person say, "This is an RFC matter" and at which point does one say "This is an RFar" matter. I agree a block, although a short term one, for cooling off. The message I think you should get from all of this on AN/I is two words: "Calm down." Leave well enough alone. The fact that DreamGuy stopped reading and responding to you really should have given you a clear signal that he was dropping the matter. A fight takes two people, and you kept and <i>keep</i> swinging. Edit articles. Read articles. Research stuff. Do <i>not</i> take it personally or try to triumph. There is no winning on Wikipedia: there is only writing an encyclopedia. Winning is for basketball games, not community editing. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 20:07, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I recently moved Major Taylor (Musician) to <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_Taylor_a4d2.html" title="Major Taylor">Major Taylor</a>; the original "Major Taylor" page was a redirect to someone whose nickname it was, and I thought that someone whose real name it was belonged there (also, of course, the first title was wrongly capitalised). This morning I found that <a href="../../../r/o/g/User_talk%7ERogerthat_5be9.html" title="User talk:Rogerthat">Rogerhat</a> had moved it back with no explanation, even keeping the mis-capitalised form. I re-moved it — and that's where things went wrong. After an "error" page (all too common nowadays) I found that I'd ended up with both <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_Taylor_a4d2.html" title="Major Taylor">Major Taylor</a> and Major Taylor (Musician) as redirects to <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_Taylor_a4d2.html" title="Major Taylor">Major Taylor</a>, and the article nowehere to be found.

<dd>I can't find a user by the name of Mayor Taylor, so I'm having difficulty following your story. And are you sure this Major Taylor (Musician) exists?</dd>
<dd>By the way, there was no need to capitalise the word 'Musician' in that title.</dd>
<dd>Still, I can find no information on a musician by the name of Major Taylor. I did find an <a href="../../../o/t/i/Otis_Taylor_1ffc.html" title="Otis Taylor">Otis Taylor</a> though, and and article on <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marshall_Taylor_b565.html" title="Marshall Taylor">Marshall Taylor</a> (Marshall 'Mayor' Taylor, in fact), a cyclist. <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_Taylor_a4d2.html" title="Major Taylor">Major Taylor</a> at one point redirected to the latter, although it certainly seems little evidence of that fact remains.

<p>There seems to be some confusion:</p>
<ol>
<li>There's no editor called "Major Taylor".</li>
<li>The miscapitalised "Musician" was (as I explained) part of the problem that I was correcting.</li>
<li>The information about the "Major Taylor" concerned was in the article — which has disappeared – from the article and the History – in a page-move glitch. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 13:42, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I know using open proxies around here is verboten and that we are supposed to indefinitely block them when we find them. However, I am very unclear on the processes, if any, are involved. I'm aware of <a href="../../../o/p/_/WP%7EOP_2cfb.html" title="WP:OP">WP:OP</a>, but it looks pretty embryonic to me. I also know what the signs of an open proxy are, but I'm not sure how to confirm them. Should my response for a likely suspect simply be to slap a {{blocked proxy}} and indef., or is there another reporting mechanism in place?

<p>I'm increasingly of the opinion this is an unfortunate incident (= clusterfuck) rather than a symptom of deep malice on the part of either Elonka or DreamGuy. I'm in email contact with Elonka and I've left a note for DreamGuy, suggesting they contact each other directly afresh, and if that doesn't sound workable then offering to mediate, with the hoped-for outcome being two tolerably happy Wikipedians. I've also unblocked Elonka - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 17:07, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I added a space to an archive to satisfy her (irrational, in my mind, probably gaming the system) fear that because wikipedia was so highly google ranked that all of a sudden google searches for "elonka lie" would start hitting on the remarks she found offensive. This space hurts no one, and helps one person. I considered adding a 1 white pixel picture there instead of a space.

<p>I'm not even sure I know where to start. This thing has gotten so big, with so many incidents of abuse, that I'm kind of at a loss about how to keep my reply brief enough to actually be read.

<p>In my opinion, Bishonen has exhibited extremely poor judgment throughout this. She took DreamGuy's initial (highly deceptive) post<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Android79&amp;diff=36501237&amp;oldid=36459819" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Android79&amp;diff=36501237&amp;oldid=36459819" rel="nofollow">[115]</a> to Android79's talk page to heart, evidently because she herself was recently the victim of <i>real</i> harassment. She went straight over to DreamGuy's page to basically say "I'll protect you" (she also said I was worse than Everyking)<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:DreamGuy&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=36503893" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:DreamGuy&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=36503893" rel="nofollow">[116]</a>, and then ran over to my talk page to say, "Stop harassing him or you're blocked."<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AElonka&amp;diff=36508387&amp;oldid=36507059" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AElonka&amp;diff=36508387&amp;oldid=36507059" rel="nofollow">[117]</a> Further conversations between me and her did not go much better.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABishonen&amp;diff=36572921&amp;oldid=36558653" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABishonen&amp;diff=36572921&amp;oldid=36558653" rel="nofollow">[118]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bishonen&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=36572921" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bishonen&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=36572921" rel="nofollow">[119]</a> The next major incident was her starting this thread with the accusation of a "smear campaign". Next, she muddled a set of diffs, putting confusion between what I had said and what Castanea dentata had said.

There's <i>no</i> policy on Wikipedia which said that my behavior was inappropriate -- she was making up stuff as she went along, trying to gag me and prevent me from defending myself against her charges.</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Horse feathers!</b> You'll notice that Bishonen's name commands a certain respect. This is because she has, in all the time I've known her on Wikipedia, always, always, always checked diffs, always gone into the history. In fact, you were harassing, and Bishonen was aware of the dispute from back in the magician brouhaha. Dream Guy might say a naughty word, but he stopped. You didn't. Other people even tried to say, "Look, here's how to build an RFC, if you really want, but stop screaming." You kept insisting that Dream Guy was out to get you, that he was behind every negative comment and rebuff you suffered, and anyone who didn't take your side was deluded. Bishonen has been fair, even handed, and patient. Furthermore, Bishonen was entirely correct in invoking <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBLOCK_89b0.html" title="WP:BLOCK">WP:BLOCK</a>. You can read it yourself to see that acting as the postman for a banned user is frowned upon. Did she delete those comments? No. She moved them and left a link. This is the procedure when someone illegitimately posts to AN/I. No one is telling you not to "defend" yourself, but virtually everyone on the project is telling you to stop attacking. Defense is "I am not a troll." Attack is "Hipocrite is a troll." See the difference? Defend yourself, but attack no one else. No personal attacks. No mischaracterizations of edits. No accusations that someone is taking sides. Just answer for the one person you're actually an authority on: yourself. If you had taken this course earlier, none of this AN/I mess would have occurred, and certainly no block. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:51, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>On Gerard, I'm fairly neutral at this point. On the one hand, his block was inappropriate, and it was clear that he didn't do <i>any</i> research to see if I was a genuine user, aside from scanning an IP log. If he would have made even a cursory glance at my user page or contribution history he would have quickly seen that I was a "real" user. Instead he made a kneejerk decision within a few minutes of Bishonen's single message, and permanently blocked a good user without any debate or even bothering to place a courtesy note on my talk page. It happened so fast I didn't even get a chance to post a rebuttal to Bishonen's attack.</p>
<p>To Gerard's credit, he did realize his mistake and lifted the block in less than 24 hours. I will point out though that there's a subtle threat in the comment that he put on my unblock, "Unblocked for now", with the implication that I'm some kind of problem user that's only gotten a temporary reprieve.</p>

<p>I would say what I really thought about DreamGuy's behavior at this point, but I would just get accused of a personal attack. &#160;;) In fact, no matter what I put he's probably going to call it harassment, but here goes: DreamGuy has been gaming the system. He knows exactly what the rules are, and further, he knows which rules are never enforced. If there's a rule that <i>is</i> enforced, he knows exactly how far he can push it, and he pushes to that limit over and over again. Then if any admin gets wise to him and blocks him for violating the "spirit" of the policy, he goes into wiki-lawyer mode and demands that the block be reversed. This happens again and again. Just check his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User%3ADreamGuy" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User%3ADreamGuy" rel="nofollow">Block log</a>.</p>
<p>DreamGuy is also talented at throwing back counter-accusations and false statements (in simple terms, he lies a lot). He's quick to accuse other people of "harassing him", of lying, of being obnoxious, of stalking, though most of those behaviors are actually his own. DreamGuy knows how easy it is to make a false accusation, to stretch the truth to the point of breaking, and he knows how hard it is for other Wikipedians to know whether or not he's telling the truth, especially when he doesn't supply diffs to back up his claims. As a general rule of thumb, I've learned to disbelieve <i>anything</i> DreamGuy says, unless he has diffs to back it up. He claimed to Petros that he had "four or more admins" supporting him<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:DreamGuy&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=36517238" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:DreamGuy&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=36517238" rel="nofollow">[121]</a> (false). He told Android79 that he'd told me "several days back" to stop bothering him<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Android79&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=36501237" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Android79&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=36501237" rel="nofollow">[122]</a> (false). He claims that I made far worse personal attacks on him (false). He claims that he clearly said to me "live and let live"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=37424289" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=37424289" rel="nofollow">[123]</a> (false). And then he has the cojones to say that "The things she wants removed as 'personal attacks' against her are simply cases of me accurately pointing out what she wsa doing, and in the meantime she made tons of personal attacks herself."<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=37426201" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=37426201" rel="nofollow">[124]</a> (guess) &#160;;)</p>
<p>Whoever it is behind the username of DreamGuy, he seems to love conflict. He craves it, he gravitates to it, and if he can't find it, he makes it. He's been pouring rage into Wikipedia. You don't even need to look at his specific posts -- just look at his edit summaries in his history. He tosses around words like "harassment", "obnoxious", "ridiculous", "liar"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=DreamGuy&amp;limit=250" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=DreamGuy&amp;limit=250" rel="nofollow">[125]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=DreamGuy&amp;offset=20060124113404&amp;limit=250" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=DreamGuy&amp;offset=20060124113404&amp;limit=250" rel="nofollow">[126]</a>. In fact, he even created the "Don't be a dick" redirect page yesterday<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Don%27t_be_a_dick&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=37470754" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Don%27t_be_a_dick&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=37470754" rel="nofollow">[127]</a>, just so he could hyperlink "don't be a dick" in an edit summary.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lolicon&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=37470504" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lolicon&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=37470504" rel="nofollow">[128]</a>. Yes, sometimes he's reverting bonafide vandalism or pulling spam off a page, and those are useful activities. But primarily he's not <i>adding</i> to Wikipedia, he's just <i>removing</i> from it. He's also heaping abuse on people along the way<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3APetros471&amp;diff=36512593&amp;oldid=36511623" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3APetros471&amp;diff=36512593&amp;oldid=36511623" rel="nofollow">[129]</a>, and leaving a wide swath of antagonized users in his wake. Has he <i>created</i> anything recently? Written an article? Added a few good paragraphs somewhere? If so, I couldn't find it, and I looked. I mean I really really looked.</p>
<p>As for an apology, yes he posted one apology in this discussion, where he made it clear that he was just copy/pasting what I'd asked, and buried it in a much longer post. Then within hours he was starting up the attacks again, and saying that I shouldn't be allowed back.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=37300295" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=37300295" rel="nofollow">[130]</a></p>
<p>And if you really want proof that he's just doing everything possible to prolong this conflict, look at the revert war that he and Hipocrite engaged in, at the Archive page.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive68&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=37471904" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive68&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=37471904" rel="nofollow">[131]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive68&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=37390320" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive68&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=37390320" rel="nofollow">[132]</a> Hipocrite tried to change the page to make the insults non-searchable, and DreamGuy took the time to revert his original insults back onto the page. He did this at the archive, and he did this at <a href="../../../e/e/n/Talk%7EEenasul_Fateh_fe45.html" title="Talk:Eenasul Fateh">Talk:Eenasul Fateh</a>.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Eenasul_Fateh&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=37516293" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Eenasul_Fateh&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=37516293" rel="nofollow">[133]</a> So his "apology" means even less. On the one hand, he said that posting an apology in the locations that I wanted was "silly", but on the other, he's willing to take the time to engage in a revert war to get his original insults back on a page, and he clearly told multiple people that he does <i>not</i> want any of his comments removed<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:David_Gerard&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=37392307" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:David_Gerard&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=37392307" rel="nofollow">[134]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:DreamGuy&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=37392876" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:DreamGuy&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=37392876" rel="nofollow">[135]</a>. Are there any more clear examples of bad faith? If he wanted this problem over, if he was genuinely trying to act in good faith, he would either remove his personal attacks, offer an apology in those locations, or allow others to remove them. Instead, he does exactly the opposite.</p>
<p>I ask the Wikipedia community to look at this situation with clarity: DreamGuy has been systematically deceiving the community, causing problems, and then lying or trying to cover up what happened. Anyone that has any doubts about this, ask me to back something up, and I'll give you the diffs. I've got plenty.</p>

<p>Certain things have become clear to me throughout the last week or two:</p>
<p>(1) The Wikipedia dispute resolution process is broken. The well-written pages at <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">WP:DR</a> have little relation to how things actually work.</p>
<p>(2) Wikipedia is not enforcing its policies in a consistent way. The "No Personal Attacks" policy is either not being enforced at all, or it's primarily being enforced against new users -- longtime users know that they can almost completely disregard it, without consequence</p>
<p>(3) There are Wikipedia admins who are exhibiting very poor judgment, and demonstrating a "Shoot first, investigate later" mentality</p>
<p><a name="Suggestions" id="Suggestions"></a></p>
<h5><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive70_f8e8.html" title="Edit section: Suggestions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Suggestions</span></h5>
<p>(1) The Wikipedia community has to make a decision about whether or not they want a civil environment. Is the "no personal attacks" policy supposed to be enforced, or not? If so, there have to be consequences. If there are no consequences, the policy is meaningless.</p>
<p>(2) (Technical suggestion). Though it's obvious that Wikipedia wants search engines to index the actual articles here, I would suggest that there are plenty of pages here which should probably stay off Google, such as internal administrator discussions, and most of the "talk" pages. This is for more than just defamation -- If the "talk" pages are just as easily searched as the articles, the articles are going to be weakened, because people are just going to post whatever info they need to on a discussion page, and Wikipedia's high search engine placement is going to get their information out that way. All of this could be implemented by putting the Meta tags NOINDEX and NOFOLLOW into the source of talk pages and Admin pages. The pages would still be searchable <i>within</i> the Wikipedia community, which is fine -- but they'd stay off the public search engines.</p>
<p>(3) The dispute resolution process needs an overhaul. I'm not even sure how to make suggestions about this, because I'm still not sure how it's working currently, and there's plenty of contradictory information, not to mention "places to ask for help" that do no good. The way it probably <i>should</i> work, is: (1) attempt to work things out directly; (2) invite other community members to participate in the discussion; (3) appeal to a committee that has training on how to evaluate a situation; (4) ensure that the committee has power to actually enforce its recommendations.</p>

<p>And lastly, I'm going to ask for the same thing that I've been asking all along -- I want the personal attacks against me to be removed. They're in places like <a href="../../../e/e/n/Talk%7EEenasul_Fateh_fe45.html" title="Talk:Eenasul Fateh">Talk:Eenasul Fateh</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79">User_talk:Android79</a>, <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive68_8d2e.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive68">Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive68</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/s/Template_talk%7EMesopotamian_mythology_84ce.html" title="Template talk:Mesopotamian mythology">Template_talk:Mesopotamian mythology</a>, and here on this page. Just blank them. Or remove them and say, "Message refactored to history [1]" and link to the diff where it was pulled. Why is this so difficult to achieve?</p>
<p>What <i>possible</i> good is it doing for Wikipedia to keep the attacks there, and prolong this matter?</p>
<p>How about this: Unless there is serious objection (DreamGuy posting 7 messages doesn't count), I'll go refactor them myself, 24 hours after this message. I'll refactor them by blanking them and then adding a link to where they can be read in history, and then I'll come back here to post the diffs of what I did so everyone can make sure I did it correctly. I give you my word that I'll do my best to do it politely and professionally. And anyway, if I screw it up, the pages are easily reverted. Can I get a consensus to do this? I just want the attacks removed, and then to get back to the encyclopedia. <a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 16:07, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You make a lot of good points, Elonka. We shouldn't really have Google indexing every nook and cranny of the 'pedia. Our dispute resolution process ain't all that. DreamGuy is hard to get along with. WP:NPA is very haphazardly enforced. That's all true. I personally don't see any reason why personal attacks in archives can't be removed - even if there isn't a specific policy for doing so. Bishonen has, on occasion, removed personal attacks. I've never done so myself.</dd>

<dd>At the end of the day Wikipedian ethics are very utilitarian (sometimes, I think, excessively so). All anyone cares about when there's a conflict between productive editor A and productive editor B is to get them back to being productive editors. You typically can't have any redress of grievances and seeking it persistently will make you appear disruptive even if you are completely in the right. This goes double if you don't do useful edits to the encyclopedia in the meantime. - <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 17:09, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I trust Elonka's discretion, and if she steps over the line I'll address that issue as well. RPA does include blanking entire comments if the only substance of the comment is to make a personal attack, for instance. But if someone makes a "you asshole" remark in passing while raising a substative point, the "you asshole" remark is all that needs to be removed. To make myself clear: people restoring personal attacks that Elonka is deleting will be blocked for violating NPA. If people complain about that, then I'll just speedy the whole page as an attack page. If you want to talk about policy, I have the policy backing to do both; if you want to talk about doing the right thing so we can have a productive encyclopedia-writing community, I'm fully justified. — <b><a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Phil</a></b> <i><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">Welch</a></i> <small><a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_Poll_b43b.html" title="User:Katefan0/Poll">Are you a fan of the band Rush?</a></small> 18:32, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Has NPA gone over to policy now? It was a guideline recently. I don't support personal attacks of course, and I try never to make them, but I don't support letting the supposed victim of a personal attack be the arbiter of whether or not there has been one, and "who decides what is a personal attack" has been what has kept WP:NPA from getting to be policy all along. All of which is not to say that Elonka can or cannot remove an "asshole" here and there, but blocking for violating RPA would be bad news, too. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 21:17, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Personal attacks and civility are Wikipedia's #1 problem, and we need to start taking it seriously. If someone wants so badly to make a personal attack that they interfere with the removal of those attacks, blocking them is the best option to stop the attacks from recurring. — <b><a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Phil</a></b> <i><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">Welch</a></i> <small><a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_Poll_b43b.html" title="User:Katefan0/Poll">Are you a fan of the band Rush?</a></small> 21:28, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Phil, give me a break -- you somehow missed the total disconnect between Elonka claiming that me pointing out that she lied when she was caught in a lie as being a "personal attack" yet she goes around calling myself and Bishonen and everyone she disagrees with a liar... What she is asking for is all criticism of her to be removed while she is allowed to say anything she wants to about anyone while encouraging other people to do the same thing. Don't let her fool you into thinking this is a simple matter of removing personal attacks, as it is not... And you threatening to block me or anyone for restoring comments that she or people working on her behalf falsely label personal attacks shows sheer chutzpah and naivity. Are you even paying attention to what she is saying? She is calling people trolls and trying to drag down admins with false accusations and censor criticism of herself and you want to help her? Hell no. Wake up. And if you try enforcing blocks for that behavior I would hope you get yourself blocked very quickly, because you'd be violating policy and in a very bad way.</dd>

<dd>Furthermore, civility is clearly not the major problem here, it's people not following rules, making up their own rules, twisting rules and blocking people and so forth for no sensible reason. Someone is not civil to you, let it slide off. Someone is stalking you and threatening to abuse their power to advance their own ends -- that's the problem... along with the constant spammers, POV pushers, hoaxers and sockpuppets we have running around.

<dd>So it isn't policy. Ok. Stopping someone removing a personal attack requires all sides agree that something is a personal attack, agreeing on where the attack begins and ends, and all sides agreeing with what to do with the "removed" attack. Once that's settled, I'll agree with you. (Personal attacks are about #200 on the list of Wikipedia's problems, in my opinion, but perhaps I'm thick skinned.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:54, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Exactly. What Elonka claims are personal attacks for the most part clearly are not, and she has made quite incredible attacks herself and egged other people on to do the same and we're just supposed to let <i>her</i> choose what's an attack and what's not? That's clearly bogus. Anyone buying into Elonka's sob story is not facing facts here... what she's doing in response to perceived problems is far, far worse. At this point I'm surprised she hasn't been blocked again. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 12:52, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Right now we have an article on the motorized bicycle, a harmless and factually accurate (within normal bounds) account of a mundane machine, which is tagged up like Turkish claims on Cyprus or something, just because we won't let one user who has a problem with his local legislature completely change the coverage of the subject to suit his own agenda.

<p>The relevent instructions in the Response section state:</p>

<p>Anyone with RFC experience will agree that you cannot RFC an entire branch of government. By its own terms a User Conduct RFC is only appropriate for a single user. That means that a comment that the RFC is unjustified (as against Wikipedia policy) properly belongs in the Response section. No other comment has pointed out this violation of policy. No other user has complained about the location of the comment. This administrator has unilaterally imposed his view of where another's submission should be located, when that submission is not contrary to the instructions followed by the submitter. DrWitty 01:49, 31 January 2006 (UTC) I will also note that the blocking came without warning and violated the terms of "When blocking cannot be used" according to the <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">Wikipedia:Blocking_policy</a>.

<p>I added a three hour block because he's been keeping it up. This is not a content dispute—it would be charitable to even call it a formatting dispute.

<p>He "kept it up" by splitting his comment to note that the RFC was unjustified in the Response section, but keeping all the rest of the content in the administrator's preferred section. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/United_States_Congress&amp;diff=37452050&amp;oldid=37451991" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/United_States_Congress&amp;diff=37452050&amp;oldid=37451991" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/United_States_Congress&amp;diff=37452050&amp;oldid=37451991</a></p>
<p>It is clear that the administrator will brook nothing but a comment from "Congress" in the Response section despite the clear instructions copied above, and will enforce this decision without warning through blocking. Regardless of how the administrator wants to describe this, it is an article-editing conflict, and the administrator is bound to follow Wikipedia policy as well. Attempting to preserve the original intent of my own submission is not being uncivil, harassing, or being a WP:DICK. No other administrator or user has supported this administrator's single minded attempt to force my submission to conform to his mold. If this was "screwing up", someone else would have come to the same conclusion. The personal attacks are also completely out of line. 71.72.76.217 02:55, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No other administrator or user has opposed my decision to block you, either. The block of Ril, mentioned below on this page, has engendered plenty of discussion, so if I was doing something wrong I'm sure someone would have complained and unblocked you by now. — <b><a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Phil</a></b> <i><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">Welch</a></i> <small><a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_Poll_b43b.html" title="User:Katefan0/Poll">Are you a fan of the band Rush?</a></small> 03:11, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>At some point I would like you to explain what the "or by other users who think that the dispute is unjustified and that the above summary is biased or incomplete" portion of those instructions means. Regardless of how you prefer to characterize this dispute, you are the one that is attempting to alter content in an article on your own initiative, and enforcing that alteration through your administrative actions. You need to justify those changes beyond calling them misformatting. I attempted to correct the formatting by altering the submission, and you immediately blocked me again without warning. The majority of the problem here revolves around that fact that you are substituting name calling, personal attacks, and blocking for the explanation and negotiation that you are supposed to employ when you edit an article. Lack of comment by other administrators does not equal approval. Lack of complaint by other users is a rather different story.
<dl>
<dd>I'm complaining. DrWitty may have participated in revert warring, and for that, should be blocked, but the instructions on the RfC page are very clear. The Response section says: "This is a summary written by the user whose conduct is disputed, or by other users who think that the dispute is unjustified and that the above summary is biased or incomplete. Users signing other sections ("Statement of the dispute" and "Outside Views") should not edit the "Response" section." If DrWitty thinks that the dispute is unjustified, and the RfC was begun against policy, shouldn't his summary go in the response section? It makes sense to me.--<a href="../../../a/l/h/User%7EAlhutch_2589.html" title="User:Alhutch">Alhutch</a> 05:08, 31 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But the *intent* of that is for someone taking the side of the user(s) being filed against, which by my reading, it not what DrWitty was doing. Even if it was appropriate to file his statement under "response", it makes more sense to file under "outside view". That, however, is not the point—the point is this user's needlessly uncivil and confrontational means of addressing this dispute. — <b><a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Phil</a></b> <i><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">Welch</a></i> <small><a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_Poll_b43b.html" title="User:Katefan0/Poll">Are you a fan of the band Rush?</a></small> 05:38, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I am not taking the side of the users, i.e. the U.S. Congress, by pointing out that the attempt to pursue a User Conduct RFC that bans three class B IP ranges violates Wikipedia policy? It sounds like you're rejecting the content based upon the conduct that occured after I submitted the content, and not the content itself. If that's the case, then at what point are you going to dismiss the conduct and focus on the content? This is the first time you've conceded that anything submitted to the Response section may have been appropriate. DrWitty 05:46, 31 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I never conceded that anything submitted to the Response section may have been appropriate, and the comment you're replying to rejects your formatting of the content on its own terms, as well as your conduct on its own terms—I have not "rejected the content based upon the conduct". In summary, I suggest you brush up on your reading comprehension before you try responding to me again. — <b><a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Phil</a></b> <i><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">Welch</a></i> <small><a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_Poll_b43b.html" title="User:Katefan0/Poll">Are you a fan of the band Rush?</a></small> 05:54, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>So it is your position that I cannot post anything about the RFC violating WikiPedia policy in the Response section of the RFC? DrWitty 05:57, 31 January 2006 (UTC) Your edit comment also states "brush up on your reading comprehension" -- how is that not confrontational and harassing?

<dd>You are not arguing that the dispute is unjustified (that Congressional staffers are not editing articles they should not be), or that the summary is biased or incomplete.</dd>
<dd>Your position is that the RFC <b>as a remedy for</b> the dispute is improper. Which is a perfectly legitimate point to make. But does not factually challenge the claim that there is a legitimate dispute in progress, or challenge the accuracy or completeness of the above summary. There is a dispute; the RFC statement of the dispute appears to contain factual edit histories and other content, and opinions that it violates WIkipedia policies, properly for that section. Ergo, any comments you want to make (say, that RFC as a remedy is improper) should go in the Outside Views section. Conflating "there's no dispute" with "this remedy is improper" is what's getting you in trouble. Separate out what you think is wrong, categorize it properly mentally, and the right section is clear. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 06:36, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It violates Wikipedia policy (first portion of first paragraph) 2. It affects multiple users, at least some of whom make legitimate edits (second portion of the first paragraph) 3. It will be ineffective for its intended purpose (first portion of the second paragraph) 4. It will stifle legitimate submissions by others in the affected IPs (middle of second paragraph) 5. It violates the Wikipedia ethos that anyone is presumptively able to edit Wikipedia entries (middle of second paragraph) and 6. that Wikipedia cannot elimitate broad swaths of users, but must contain the individuals creating the problem or sacrifice its mission.</dd>

<dd>Yes, I dispute that hundreds of Congressional employees that will be affected by the proposed ban have engaged in any conduct that violates Wikipedia policy. I dispute that several of the IPs cited in the RFC have engaged in conduct that violates Wikipedia policy, because they admittedly have made legitimate contributions without any illegitimate contributions. It's the inherent flaw in the collective accusation. I see no reason to ignore it. If you want to press the point, I will be happy to provide at least a short list of IPs that are by admission excluded from any ban under current policy. DrWitty 07:12, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am not conflating. The conduct is the prerequisite for the remedy, and the conduct has not been sufficiently proven. The conduct has been proven with respect to a short list of IP addresses, not 200,000 IP addresses. RFC those IP addresses. I dispute the rest. It has no more to do with the remedy than a single user posting "Did not" in their own defense. DrWitty 07:20, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Tim also seems to have been confused about this himself, as his message to Arniep is unclear whether he's blocking for 3RR or for 'your 5th reversion in 48 hours' <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Arniep&amp;diff=37330168&amp;oldid=37277377" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Arniep&amp;diff=37330168&amp;oldid=37277377" rel="nofollow">[141]</a> (not a blockable offence).

<dd>Arniep's continuing reverts on Ian McKellen are becoming extremely disruptive. Also his description of an anonymous editor's edits as "pure vandalism" are false and show a willingness to game the system. I felt the block was appropriate due to the further reverts falling just outside the 3 reverts within 24 hours, for which Arniep was duly warned.</dd>
<dd>I had tried to find alternative forms of words which might have been acceptable to Arniep and 82.4.86.73 such as "British from England" and leaving simply British, but placing the article in English subcategories but Arniep did not accept these suggestions. It is not true to say that the anonymous user has not discussed his edits on the talk page, as he put his reasoning plainly and simply.</dd>
<dd>As to interpretation of 3RR, it is stated "This does not imply that reverting three times or fewer is acceptable. In excessive cases, people can be blocked for edit warring or disruption even if they do not revert more than three times per day." I found Arniep to be gaming the system with a revert just outside the three within 24 hours, with two further reverts. It should also be noted that Arniep has made three further reverts to the Ian McKellen article within 2 hours today:</dd>

<dd>Sorry, but I find your accusation of gaming the system extremely offensive. I devote many hours a day to watching articles and correcting vandalism. When I saw that one user was making unilateral changes by trying to change every single header and category that mentions British to English, this seemed to me to be a clear violation of Wikipedia policy as no discussion had taken place to implement such a change. The point is that every article which the anonymous user has changed should be reverted back to it's original version, otherwise we are saying yes it's OK to make unilateral changes without discussion or consensus and that is OK to use sock puppets to defend those changes.

<dd>I unblocked Arniep the first time, and I would certainly do so again. The issue of "British" vs. "English" is one that I care not a whit about, but the distinction has been endlessly debated on the appropriate pages. A "new user" (not new, IMO) came along from an IP and managed to go through dozens of articles and make <i>only</i> a substition of "English" for "British." This IP did not, under that IP address, justify these changes. In other words, it appears to be someone who was on the losing side of the debate and who has come on as an IP to get his way. That is vandalism. The reversion of vandalism knows no 3RR. Whatever one might feel about the distinction in question, unilateral changes without discussion are not permitted. Whatever one may feel about Ian Mack and Arniep's point of view, reverting an IP's mass change was not an editorial revert. Every other concern about him is a separate matter and was not voiced as a block reason. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:39, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>See my talk page. The ISP evidence doesn't mean much either way. But I thought they were quite different because they have different styles of <i>blowing their top</i>. CheeseDreams appears to actually be batshit insane; -Ril- is basically lucid but can be somewhat brittle (to say the least) in conflict with others. SimonP disagrees and notes some curious stylistic similarities. I'm entirely unsure. I do think it's a pity -Ril- has basically gotten completely out of step with the Wikipedia community, because he does do some good stuff at length as an editor - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 10:30, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ril's centralized discussions on the scope and extent of Bible-related articles (e.g. individual verses) raise some important concerns. I think these are important contributions, whether you agree with the issues raised or not. In particular, <a href="../../../c/e/n/Wikipedia%7ECentralized_discussion_Verses_of_1_Kings_4_and_5_8c5d.html" title="Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Verses of 1 Kings 4 and 5">Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Verses of 1 Kings 4 and 5</a> raises some interesting NPOV concerns that would be easy to miss otherwise. He also seems to have made some good edits relating to ancient mythology. As for his edits in the project namespace, they are unquestionably controversial, but I don't see anything there justifying an indefinite ban. Again, if someone can explain why this was done and cite specific evidence, it would go a long way towards alleviating my concerns. <tt><a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrotalus_horridus_5cc6.html" title="User:Crotalus horridus">Crotalus horridus</a> <small>(<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECrotalus_horridus_e0ed.html" title="User talk:Crotalus horridus">TALK</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Crotalus_horridus_e95d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Crotalus horridus">CONTRIBS</a>)</small></tt> 03:12, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>-Ril- is a long-term major energy sink and needs to snap out of it. Immediately. ArbCom should have given him a snapping-out-of last time they had the opportunity, but opted to say "please change your signature" instead in one of their less impressive rulings. However, an indef block based on 'evidence' that turns out to be either inconclusive or insubstantial should not be left standing. I've lifted it. If someone wants to reimpose it for another reason, adn take responsibility for that reason, they are free to do so. I'm not interested in a block war, and I'm not criticising Phroziac particularly, who made the block while things were very fluid. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 03:20, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Gmaxwell seems to have switched editing mode from 'polite and professional" to <a href="../../../b/o/f/BOFH_455a.html" title="BOFH">BOFH</a>. Mindspillage tried reasoning with him, I tried reasoning with him. He politely points out that he's objectively getting 100 times as much useful work done now for the encyclopedia, even despite getting regularly blocked. Mindspillage has confirmed this apparently, and so simply has no grounds to argue with him rationally (because he won by logic&#160;:-P). I'm having some trouble arguing with his logic too. How DO you argue with that.

<dd>Okay, Kim, it's like this. Let's say I think another user has done a bad edit. It's much quicker and easier for me to simply revert their edit. I could use a tool to do it. The editor might be pissed off, but who cares? <i>I</i> am more productive that way. Or I could write them a note, discuss what change I want to make and why and go through the whole dreary being nice to other editors thing that just stands in Greg's way. But hang on! Those editors might waste their time on firing off notes to me, complaining at my rough treatment, and people who noticed my doing it might write big long messages to the AN and other places... and they wouldn't be so productive, would they? So what's it to be, we just throw civility out of the window and shit on each other because we think we're more "productive" that way or we stick to at least trying to make this a decent place to be? <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 06:01, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Your argument is quite solid. Or would be. The thing is, you're assuming people were always civil to Gmaxwell first. After some particularly hard and unfair campaigning by erm, someone else who I actually also value very much, so I shan't name names, he decided to flip strategies. I'm pretty saddened that he's drawn the conclusions that he has, because I really really need his help in a lot of matters.&#160;:-/ <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> 06:31, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In this particular incidence Gmaxwell has been handled unfairly; namely, his comments were <i>removed</i> by people complaining that he was merely <i>striking out</i> comments made by others. It seems reasonable to remove the &lt;s/&gt;s around the particular votes, but not Gmaxwell's comments, with which there's nothing wrong. Berating him for repeatedly reverting while repeatedly reverting seems a tad unseemly, and as for the 3RR, as far as I'm concerned if someone is restoring comments like that they can do so 100 or 1000 times. <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemi_6641.html" title="User:Demi">Demi</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/e/m/User_talk%7EDemi_ab67.html" title="User talk:Demi">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Demi_a1b0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Demi">C</a></sub> 06:51, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>When someone defaces a page in this manner, the natural reaction is to revert to the last pre-defacement revision. In doing so, it was easy to overlook the fact Greg also added comments of his own (which I seriously doubt anyone intentionally removed).

<dd>They shouldn't be casually, but sometimes they are indispensible. For instance, if an AOL anon vandal goes on a spree over dozens of articles (eg, the "category penis" vandalism of a few days ago), AOL's goofy round-robin IP address allocation means that a range block really is the only way to halt it (and it also means that we don't even have a way to leave a message on the vandal's talk page, since he doesn't have one, not that polite warnings would have helped). It should be used with care, but sometimes it's needed. In the above case, it might have been a bit unwise (I think someone requested or did a checkuser and he's moved around various IP ranges, no?). -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 20:28, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, Curps, I have personally been blocked six times...no, seven...because of your AOL range blocks. I use an ISP that is owned by AOL. I understand the frustration with AOL vandals, and there are lots of them, but, were I not an admin, I'd have been locked out. Let's not do any big range blocks for long periods on AOL. Try&#160;:15 or&#160;:30. Other than that, the collateral damage includes <i>several</i> admins.

<p>Wikien-l is not evidentiary. Most of us don't subscribe. The point is that this was an AfD. AfD decided. It went to VfU. VfU didn't support restoration, and then you went to war. If you or DJ Clayworth want the group discussed, do it in an article on the documentary. Until the group can pass the bar of encyclopedic value, it shouldn't be in <i>our</i> encyclopedia. "Our" means "we," which means the unwashed, inexpert mob deciding. What's more, that mob can even be wrong, and we should just live with the injustice. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:14, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Tony and David, in the past, a consensus has existed at AfD and DVR to ignore the mailing list as a source of authority. This presumably still obtains. If Jimbo wishes to change AfD, or anything, let him do it. If he changes AfD in the way I think you'd like him too, he'd lose my respect, but at least we'd all know that Wikipedia is really only an exercise in ignoring all rules, and including anything you folks like willy-nilly. Until Jimbo does this, vague intimations that the mailing list might bite AfD, in the manner of threats ("...Foundation imposes a nonoptimum solution from above. They have good reason to be pissed off - see wikien-l") are just empty posturing, and will be treated as such by sensible people.

<dd>Wikipedia is one thing, not battling independent nation states. DRV may choose to ignore the list or the foundation, but the list or foundation are not then obliged to ignore DRV. Many AFD/DRV regulars are not happy with what they see as "outside interference", but then consider they have domain over all Wikipedia content and whether it stays or goes; compare this attitude to e.g. a troublemaking editor who just won't work well with others, even if their content is mostly good - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 18:42, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>David, if the Foundation wishes to exert itself, let it. You are not the Foundation. Intimating that you are, and that you have insight into it, is dishonest, to be frank. You may not like AfD, the mailing list may or may not (some evidence below suggest that you and Tony are misreading consensus there, as well as applying it wrongly), but you won't change it by acting like an overlord on matters over which you have no extraordinary authority. Jimbo may do as he likes, but you are not Jimbo. AfD lives as it is, till it changes itself, till there is a broad reform or till Jimbo changes it. Full stop. Saying "mailing list says X" does not implement X, does not support X well, and counterproductively annoys many people who otherwise don't care about X at all. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 02:18, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I really don't have a strong feeling on whether this article should stay or go, but the kind of wheel-waring shown above is IMO highly inappropriate, and <s>Tony Siday's actions detaield above seem to approach a 3RR violation (four restoratuions in less than 28 hours)</s>. I should think that it would have been better for those who want such an article to exist to either incorporate the content into a larger article, or create a rewritten article (different enough not to fall under <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_G4_44ba.html" title="WP:CSD G4">WP:CSD G4</a>) which included as much aditional information on notability as is available and verifiable (with sources, of course). As to the mailing list, it think it would be better if all serious discussion leading to wikipedia policy decisions was conducted on-wiki. I can't see any good reason for it not to be, and I don't plan to subscribe to teh mailing list. I have read the web archives on occasion. I don't, however, consider anything there definitive untill it appears on-wiki. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 16:06, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think that saying "a consensus has existed at AfD and DVR to ignore the mailing list as a source of authority" suggests a fundamental misunderstanding of the role of broad discussion in the formation of consensus on Wikipedia. Discussions on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikien-l.html" title="Wikien-l">Wikien-l</a>, like it or not, do play a role in the formation of consensus on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Could you explain whom you were citing when you quoted that following words? <i>"...Foundation imposes a nonoptimum solution from above. They have good reason to be pissed off - see wikien-l"</i>? The words, and the punctuation, don't look like mine.</p>
<p>In reply to DEsiegel, I ask: would you really, seriously, characterize the above as wheel warring? I see only two restorations,and one of those was a straightforward history undelete. Please carefully examine the facts, lest you jump to hasty--and erroneous--conclusions.</p>

<dd>Yes, I do call the above a wheel-war -- twice undeleting something recently deleted by another admin (and not the same one on each occasion), when the deletion was not by mistake, but in-process in accord with an AfD discussion and then CSD G4. I see no reason why you could not have continued to discuss this at DRV rather then undeleting. However it seems that i mis-read the logs above, and that you restored twice rather than four times, so I have struck out the relevant part of my comment above. This makes the warring rather less extreme, but i still say that this sort of thing is unwise. I would be within policy to re-delete under G4, but I will not do so at this time, as that would only escalate things. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 18:37, 31 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Agreed. This one is obvious. It was deleted by three different admins by the time you undeleted it the second time. If you play by the simple rules there is less stress and more time for editing for everyone. It's really simple. Don't undo admin actions unless they made a mistake that is very clear according to the policy or there has been a consensus established to undo the action. Anything else creates wheel wars. Very simple, effective, no real downside.

<dd>The words in question are not yours, and are David's, wholly appropriate since my comment addressed you both, and your views here, as often, are aligned. You might have noticed this yourself if you had read more carefully.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Each forum and page on WP, in practice, establishes consensus for itself. Barring a system-wide initiative (like an RFC, or an amending of policy through centralized discussion), each practical consensus governs its area. The mailing list makes rules for itself, and no one else, unless Jimbo says differently. If you fail to understand this, Tony, you have failed to notice how the encyclopedia actually operates.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>At AfD/DRV, I further stipulate, an active consensus exists that the mailing list not only does not govern, but often gets things very wrong. AfD is free to ignore it. The mailing list is not policy, is not the 'pedia, and is not Jimbo. If editors in any forum wish to consider it poo, it is treated as poo for those purposes. Given your high regard for the mailing list, I suspect I would find its collective judgment flawed on many things, but I wouldn't know, as I choose to ignore it, and will continue to do so. AfD will, I imagine, likewise do so. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 18:05, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You misunderstand the mailing list and all the other forums. You seem to think of them aa fiefdoms, each with its own little patch, engaging in some kind of territorial fight. Doesn't work. The mailing list, for instance, is just one venus for a whole host of different issues, and its role is primarily as a conduit for broad discussion on matters such as, well, deletion policy. Nothing on the mailing list automatically overrules anything else, but it is a very good way to judge the mood of the wiki.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>AfD and DRV are generally recognised, at the highest level of Wikipedia (and you thought it was just a utopian anarchy? hah!) to be out of control, flawed processes, and since you have cited David Gerard, who was in turn presenting the view of the Foundation, you're clearly aware of that. "<i>I'm placing this here for discussion of real problems so that AFD won't have a <b>solution imposed on it by the Foundation</b>, because that's what's likely coming without some severe internal reform. They are pissed off</i>" But as you say you don't subscribe to the mailing list so it doesn't matter. You can just go back to some little fiefdom or other and pretend it isn't happening. Right?</dd>

<li>From the mailing list, it appears that Jimbo and the board object to the nastiness of AFD pages if read by an outsider, especially by the subject of an article (since the pages turn up on google) and that the solutions proposed include (1) fixing robots.txt so that AFD doesn't google, (2) blanking AFD discussions about living people after conclusion, and (3) encouraging civility. I have not found any support for the claim that AFD needs to reform lest it have a reform forced upon it. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 20:03, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>As for me, Tony, I think that, although you and David believe you speak for the Foundation, you speak only for yourselves. On the questions of process, consensus, and generally any non-unilateral matters, you are so often wrong that your opinion is only worth rebuffing for the sport of it. You say AfD risks danger if it ignores you view, but I disagree. You and Mr. Gerard are eccentric, and (on this question) your view is seriously distorted. You claim that you two speak for the Foundation ("That David here was presenting the view of the Foundation I find reassuring, but not surprising"). I think that is laughable; let's see if the Foundation ever pulls through on David's threat: till then, I call you both full of hot air. You may and will cite the mailing list all you wish, but I will continue to treat these citations as irrelevant. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 22:29, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Er, no one did, and I didn't say I was. What I did say was that Jimbo was expressing his and the Foundation's strong concerns about the matter on wikien-l, that it would be much better if *FD got its own house in order because the Foundation is <i>pissed off</i> and about ready to impose a solution, good or not, and that if *FD/DRV regulars want to stay in the loop about such concerns then it seems to me it's up to them to read wikien-l — Jimbo evidently considers it the place to discuss such matters.

And of course my worst offence was to remove the personal attacks from your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ALicinius&amp;diff=37487330&amp;oldid=37485381" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ALicinius&amp;diff=37487330&amp;oldid=37485381" rel="nofollow">user page</a> which were also removed by other editors. This does not include the list of edits that were reverted by other editors nor did I revert the removal of the comments that were left on your talk pages at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:60.225.202.61&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:60.225.202.61&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">60.225.202.61</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Licinius&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Licinius&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">Licinius</a>.</p>
<p>In going through your edits I found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tommy_Bishop&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=28707207" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tommy_Bishop&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=28707207" rel="nofollow">this</a> where you broke two valid links and I will be reverting. Also, looking at your edits, especially your comments on users talk pages, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Banes&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=37503150" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Banes&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=37503150" rel="nofollow">here</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:BlackJack&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=37637566" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:BlackJack&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=37637566" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tyson2k&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=37484987" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tyson2k&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=37484987" rel="nofollow">here</a>, can only give people the wrong impression that you are trying to intimidate other users. <a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECambridgeBayWeather_aa30.html" title="User:CambridgeBayWeather">CambridgeBayWeather</a> <a href="../../../c/a/m/User_talk%7ECambridgeBayWeather_e92a.html" title="User talk:CambridgeBayWeather">(Talk)</a> 06:56, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
