<dd>Are you kidding me? Review the edit history (and take a good look at the diffs I have provided) and compare the versions and do not make blatantly false accusations - I have retained their edits. The anon(s) in question have been deleting sourced quotations and adding edits that are clearly not NPOV. As well, they have also failed to provide proper citations to back up their claims that "many" historians are against Murray's theory. And again, I do not inappreciate your accusations (ownership issues, eh?) which are clearly not <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civil</a>. I also find it interesting that Angr ignores the fact that the anon(s) have not made a single comment on the <a href="../../../g/i/l/Talk%7EGilles_de_Rais_efc6.html" title="Talk:Gilles de Rais">talk</a> And please do show me what "sourced comment" the anon has been adding?

<p>I am leaving this message to ask that another administrator remove the block of User:Prasi90, as an endorsement of the suggestions I have made here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Prasi90#Semi-_Official_Mentorship_Offer_from_Hamster_Sandwich" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Prasi90#Semi-_Official_Mentorship_Offer_from_Hamster_Sandwich" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. I could un-block this user myself, but I feel it might be in conflict of interest to do so. I am confident that Prasi90 is ready to turn over a new leaf, so to speak. Let's all assume that he is willing to do so, and willing to abide by the terms that I have offered to him, and to other involved parties, indeed to Wikipedia at large that I can help him to become a more productive and community minded editor. Thank you in advance for your consideraton in this matter. <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHamster_Sandwich_8577.html" title="User:Hamster Sandwich">Hamster Sandwich</a> 18:02, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>For the record, this is one admin who is against any unblock and against any unilateral unblock by another admin. I <i>am</i> a neutral party here and have been watching what's been happening with this user for some time and feel any unblock is unwarranted, especially given the extra conditons and demands that Prasi has the nerve to demand. Just my opinion. I'm sure other reasonable admins will disagree....but none have yet commented here....Gator (talk) 18:02, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I consider it is reasonable to go ahead and unblock, and be ready to reimpose block if begins to vandalise again. I think if one more admin agrees here the unblock should go ahead. Hamster Sandwich is going guarantor.--Fil<a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">e</font></a> <a href="../../../b/r/e/User_talk%7EBrendanconway_8120.html" title="User talk:Brendanconway">Éireann</a> 18:27, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHamster_Sandwich_8577.html" title="User:Hamster Sandwich">Hamster Sandwich</a> requested admin review of his request to unblock, so to expedite this I went and had a look at the thread on the user's talk page.

I just want to know what tasks Prasi90 is itching to get done, or just he want to be unblocked because he doesn't <i>like being blocked</i>. In other words, what encyclopedic contributions has he in mind to justify this experiment? I don't see the relevance of the diff you provided (other than suggesting we should tread very carefully, that kind of hatred can't be tolerated - and I'm not American).

<p>I've listed maybe 30% of the edits that clearly demostrate this editor has disrupted, has vandalized, has harassed and has trolled his way around Wikipedia. I believe that Hamster Sandwich has his work cut out for him and also believe that there is a high risk that Prasi90 will open sock accounts once his IP is unblocked. I congratulate Hamster for being so willing to take this situation over, but I can see almost zero evidence that this editor will be a positive contributor to this project.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 18:16, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've never encountered Prasi90 before, but his clear pattern of abuse, apology and recidivism, and the rather low quality and quantity of his article contributions in the time he has edited Wikipedia, suggest to me that he's a permanent block candidate. I've no idea why Hamster Sandwich thinks that mentorship will turn this editor into a useful contributor, but as long as it's understood that we'll stand for absolutely no more nonsense, I don't see any great harm that can be done by letting him give Prasi90 one last chance. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 19:25, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have told Hamster that I will not be involved anymore on this matter as that will hopefully give him the best chance of success in reforming this editor.

<dd>Actually, to say that Jami's poetry "deals extensively with the esoteric topic of pederasty", is simply the interpretation of the English translator of Jami's works. Nowhere is his work, Jami discusses "pederasty".

<p>I find it rather worrying that an admin should semi-protect his page, unless he intends never to interact with anons via blocks, warnings, etc. Do other admins agree? If so, could Nlu be advised to unprotect it? --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 18:12, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Its only been sprotected for a day, right? I've had to do that before when I was getting slammed with Iain Lee vandals. People can still email Nlu through his email link in the meantime.

<dd>Nlu, you are being asked a legitimate question which you refuse to answer. You refuse to answer because you are wrong in your position.

<dd>When questioned on <a href="../../../p/o/o/User_talk%7EPoolGuy_c60c.html" title="User talk:PoolGuy">PoolGuy's Talk Page</a> you succumbed to the fact that your reason for a block was off base.

<dd>I am sorry if you think you are harassed. I think it is harassing to take administrative action against a user when you can not even justify it with a policy violation. Perhaps you have been working so hard to make this issue go away because you can not justify your action. Other admins on Wikipedia justify their action all the time. They simply cite the edit that demonstrated the violation. I don't understand why you refuse to, except maybe, because the violation does not exist. Absent the violation you can't seem to find, please unblock and unprotect the accounts.

<p>In the topic above Nlu has been unable to find the violation of policy. Perhaps someone can help Nlu and actually find the three policies he stated were violated. Just cite the edits to help out Nlu. I have looked and I can't find them. Maybe someone else would have better luck. If Nlu can't even find the violations that he said occurred, I don't know how anyone can. Perhaps the accounts should be unblocked and the pages unprotected since those actions appear to be baseless.</p>

<p>This page is getting serially vandalized by anons, with various RC faces making plenty of reverts in recent history. I don't know much about the subject but he seems to be a whistle-blower, or at least holds controversial opinions on pro-wrestling which might be a cause of discontent. He apparently survived AfD last year and seems to be here to stay, also judging by the banter on the talk the article has been under some kind of protection before.

<p>User ChrisO has deleted template about persecution of Serbs in the middle of the debate, and it was clear that he (who proposed the deletion) was beginning to lose the case. Instead of debating it, he decided to delete it before the period has ended. There were two votes to keep it at the time. From the debate it was clear that NPOV problems can be fixed, and that template has a legitimate place in Wikipedia. Also, his own template about Scientology is more biased than this one, as it slanders the whole religion by attributing a nonsensical doctrine (in a template) to it, while it is claimed that it cannot be proved/verified as it is secret. How can this be NPOV. I think ChrisO abused his privileges. Also, isnt it true that it SHOULD NOT BE THE SAME PERSON who nominates and deletes the page - otherwise, the tags make no sense if noone is to have a say. I think this moderator, who also made personal attacks, has to be investigated for other possible adminship abuses. <a href="../../../c/e/b/User%7ECeBuCCuCmeM_ee37.html" title="User:CeBuCCuCmeM">CeBuCCuCmeM</a> 22:12, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>General consensus after the <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">User:Ram-Man</a> duel lisence thing was that spaming is bad however as <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html#Internal_spamming" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM#Internal_spamming</a> we never put together any solid rules. The problem is in defineing spam and the like. For example putting the same message on a large number of userpages appears to have become ingrained in <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFA_4c83.html" title="WP:RFA">WP:RFA</a> culture. Bulk bot produced unserlictored messages are a key part of our anti copyvio stratergy (or at least a key part of minimiseing complaints about it). So yes the user is correct that there is no rule agaist spaming. If we look at <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBLOCK_89b0.html" title="WP:BLOCK">WP:BLOCK</a> the cloest policy to being aplicable is Users who exhaust the community's patience.

<p>He also sent out spams on the 10th and 12th of March.

<dd>Agreed. Sometimes we don't need hard and fast rules, we just need to do what is right. Asking for specific rules that prohibit a disruptive action is wikilawyering and not helpful. The block is covered under disruption. And finally the spamming is more likely to make people vote against the proposal anyway, but that's not an excuse to allow it. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 13:35, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Although I made an explanation above, my account is blocked, unfortunately. I would like to repeat my response to this accusation again. I hope that I can find some democrat admins here to listen what I am saying. Misbehaving users are no good for Wiki but admins misusing their previliges is even worse and may lead to chaos.</p>
<p>Admins should use their privilages wisely and consciously. Only then it may help to keep the place safe. Warning before blocking is not a luxury, it is a standard. Asking about the reasons for an editor's actions, if not well understood by an admin, is not a luxury, it is so wise. Asking and warning doesn't take more than 5 min and doesn't make Wiki a volnerable place. It rather creates a better and friendly atmosphere. There is no need for strong formality if and only if admins following well-established ethics and standards. The definitions of acceptable and unacceptable should not vary from one admin to another. If there is unclearity on an issue, they need to use extra caution. In a civil environment the standards are not only for poor ordinary users, but also for admins. An admin who is not so careful in his decisions distrup Wiki from functioning as well as a user who do not care about it. Unfairly blocked users are a good exapmle of disruption.</p>
<p>What I was doing was not spamming. I was just <b>letting a selected group of people who might not be aware of the proposal and who might want to know about it</b>. (Babylon - spamming: <b>simultaneous</b> sending of an <b>irrelevant message</b> to a large number of discussion groups on the Internet). I my case I am blocked without a prior warning, and blocked for 31 hours, and blocked on subjective decision of an admin which is extended subjective decision of another. 'Assumeing good faith' should not be just a link for the admins to color their talks, when talking to ordinary users.</p>
<p>I am expecting an apology from the admins involved for their poor behaviour against me and a promise regarding that they won't misuse their priviliges anymore towards anyone. I should add that I would like to see this incident as a mistake which should not be generelized for all actions of the admins involved, neither to the community of admins. I am sure and in fact I know that there are many who are doing their jobs as good as possible.</p>
<p>I checked my account and it was unblocked. I am signing my name as you see here. I hope some admins here won't ask me pay for the flaw in the system, if there is. Thanks. <a href="../../../r/g/u/User%7ERgulerdem_75f6.html" title="User:Rgulerdem">Resid Gulerdem</a> 21:43, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Based on the explanations above, I would like to keep informing a selected group of people who might want to know about the proposal and who might be interested. I would like to make it clear with you that there is no problem with that. Please let me know what do you think about it.

<li>This is not innocent "informing a group of people" so much as astroturfing. It is not kosher to attempt to radically shape polls in the way you have.

<dd>I think it's a reasonable question. I'm afraid I think the block was technically an abuse of admin powers, but I don't think there's any point in taking this further. It would be different if any of the recipients of the message had complained, but there's been no evidence presented of this. And, at the very least, IMO a warning should have been given before the block.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The root cause of the problem seems to be an attempt to gag this user by calling a poll on a policy proposal for the express purpose of getting it rejected. The opponents of this draft policy have declared that, assuming the poll fails (as is IMO certain, the proposal is not nearly ready to be a guideline, let alone a policy) that the proposed policy will then instantly become a <i>failed proposal</i>. What this means is unclear, but unfortunately an admin has suggested (I hope in jest) that they would then be willing to <i>just delete</i> the proposal. IMO the tactic of calling such negative polls is to be discouraged. As far as I can see it does not violate any policy or guideline except perhaps <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>, but it seems a pure waste of time. Assuming that this poll is rejected, that does not IMO prevent the proposers from working further on it, and calling a new poll when they are ready to do so. However the proposer is relatively new, and I think it is understandable that they should be worried about this apparent attempt to delete their work.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Even if all the allegations against this user were true, that would then make it even more important for admins to follow procedures and guidelines, and to encourage others to do so too. See <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiethics_120b.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Wikiethics">Wikipedia talk:Wikiethics</a>.

<li>Improv, you made some assesments but I can not see any retionale behind your conclusions. Can I get your reasoning for your statements like: <i>This is not innocent</i> and <i>something you should not have done and should not do in the future</i>. Besides being impolite, 'it is not innocent' statement seems to be contradicting 'assume good faith' approach. I cannot see any policy, guideline or regulation to disourage this kind of informing procedure. I think it is totally unfair and unacceptable to think that with a single message all Wikipedians will go for the vote as I suggested. As the poll indicated, just a few users voted after my message. The message is clear, and my position in this dispute clearly stated in it. I am not pushing anyone to vote (it is simply impossible), neither hiding my position by using some flowery words to misguide the users. It is natural that my message reflects my perspective. I am ready to follow a consensus (<b>and only consensus</b>) among the admins, but please note that independent from the case, a consensus against this kind of informing procedure will highly restrict users' freedom of speach in Wiki IMO. If it is decided so, than some objective norms will be needed such as 'informing how many users will be considered as unacceptible'. Please note that, existing no-spam guideline is not applicaple to this case. <a href="../../../r/g/u/User%7ERgulerdem_75f6.html" title="User:Rgulerdem">Resid Gulerdem</a> 00:31, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I noticed that a number of long(more than 24 hour) blocks have been put on IPs that have been marked as being shared among multiple users. AFAIK, this is a <i>Bad Thing</i>. I have removed a number of these placed by <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHall_Monitor_050f.html" title="User:Hall Monitor">User:Hall Monitor</a>.

<p>I have no problem with nice long blocks to vandal schools personally (long blocks to other shared IPS is different). If the IP has been a consistent vandal and has produced nothing but vandalism and the students can still use the site for research and education but simply cannot edit, I fail to see the harm. I personally feel it's better to miss out on the one good edit that will likely not come out of that IP then to put up with their nonsense, because we want them to be able to continue to edit and vandalise. The site is still available to them as an encyclopedia and it likely more than one idiot who is vandalsiing if it happenign that often so a one hour or three houtr block ain't gonna do it. I mean, look at the vandalism history...it ain't working! I say well done HallMonitor, we need more vandal fighters like you. My opinion.Gator (talk) 13:42, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>2nded. I have given a few long blocks to school ips as well, and shortened them if/when someone emailed me with an objection. My assumption of good faith doesn't go so far as to believe that there will be a single good edit waiting in the ether, and it will make up for the time that the vandal fighters take away from actually <i>building an encyclopedia</i> to remove vandalism. BTW did you (JesseW) try to discuss this first with Hall Monitor before removing the blocks and bringing it here? --<a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 15:33, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agree with the above, I can't see it as a huge problem when the IP is primarily used for vandalism (bug 550 would help too), people can contact the blocker if they have an issue and I see no reason to believe that Hall Monitor is not receptive to this. Similarly the long blocks tend to invite a system admin to contact Hall Monitor. This seems to be a good way of trying to deal with the problem, see if the school/whoever is willing to try and work with us, rather than just saying it's a WP problem (or rather an RC Patrol problem). I wish people would do the same with AOL, AOL User blocked complain to AOL see if they are willing to help, enough do it maybe they will... --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User%7EPgk_d0c7.html" title="User:Pgk">pgk</a><sup>(<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk"><font color="mediumseagreen">talk</font></a>)</sup> 17:49, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm very affected by long term school blocks. I just had a 2 week block instituted on my school IP (Which was unblocked by request), however after one case of vandalism, the IP was once again blocked for 48 hours. It's a major inconvinence when I want to edit from school, but am unable to due to some vandal. My school IP is shared throughout the entire school, and possibly the entire school district.

Glad I asked here. I ought to have asked Hall Monitor before unblocking, sorry about that. It seems like blocking school IPs for long periods is accepted, but blocking non-school shared IPs is not. Can someone update the blocking policy to reflect this, please? Also, it would be good to have a distinguishing template color for shared school IPs from non-school ones. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesseW_sig_acb0.html" title="User:JesseW/sig">JesseW, the juggling janitor</a> 11:57, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You want to to update the blocking policy bases on what a handful of admins stated despite the fact that several people have stated that there is in fact very real collateral damage?

<dd>I'm happy to remove any private information that might be requested, but the only possible "private information" contained in the three deleted revisions is a three word phrase: "Abhiraj or Rupalee". I fail to see how this is anthing close to a case of "violated privacy and personal copyright"(whatever that might mean). If it was an address, a full name, a location, an employer, a personal ID # of some kind, or something like that, I would certainly agree it should be deleted, but two words? That's akin to saying that the phrase "John or James" is a violation of the privacy of anyone named John or James. I don't credit this. There's no reason to undelete the revisions, but I can't see what the complaint is either. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesseW_sig_acb0.html" title="User:JesseW/sig">JesseW, the juggling janitor</a> 22:05, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To begin; I'm not sure if this is the right forum. If any response could include either a confirmation that this is the right forum to post to, or a suggestion for future queries, I would be appreciative.</p>
<p>I've added speedy delete db-copyvio templates to AV Voice Changer Software and Music Morpher and the templates have been deleted. I know that if a <i>prod</i> template is del, it is to be listed on <i>AFD</i>, but I can't see (from a quick wikisearch) what the best approach is here. I don't want to just edit war. Any advice, please? <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7ECol_tom_e06e.html" title="User:Col tom">Colonel Tom</a> 11:27, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In general, if a legitimate speedy tag has been removed, the thing to do is restore it, explaining on the talk page why you think it qualifies for speedy deletion. In these cases, however, you didn't provide evidence for your claim that they were copyvios. {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-copyvio_e567.html" title="Template:Db-copyvio">db-copyvio</a>}} needs a parameter giving the URL of the site you believe the information has been copied from: {{db-copyvio|url=http://www.whatever.com}}. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angr_14a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angr">contribs</a>) 11:45, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you both for your responses. I now understand when initially applying the copyvio tag, there is a responsibility to provide details of the vio. Fair enough. I must admit that I assumed that the links contained within the article(s), to the manufacturer's site, with the same info, was sufficient. I appreciate your answers and assistance. I'll revisit.

<dd>Actually, they do look like copyright violations, although since the copy was probably posted by the company that owns the copyright the company could technically release the text under the GFDL.

<dd>Licensing under the GFDL never limits the owner's original rights, it only grants others the right to use the material under the GFDL. The originator can use his own material in any way he sees fit.

<dd>Tony is absolutely right and Mike (sorry) you have it the wrong way round. If I write a new article now, I am the author and copyright owner and Wikipedia have the duty to <i>credit me</i>. If I want to go and use the article somewhere else - including publishing it in print or selling it - I can. It's my work, legally and morally. Work submitted here is licenced to the world (including but not exclusively Wikipedia) and Wikipedia no more own the content than any other 3rd party does. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 18:41, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The user Ankaram, is most certainly, and even certainly Sedat Laciner who is very close to the Turkish government who has written a good deal of materials specifically aimed at linking the Armenians with anti-Semitism, while this is not much a problem here, the main problem is that he is self-promoting himself, his organization and his journal in Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Evidences that he is Laciner are clear. First, the anonymous user who added on the anti-semitism article the links to the articles published by Laciner, and all the links from the Journal of Turkish Weekly, who Laciner is the chairman of. This was done on March 10, this anonymous user also added materials relating to Laciner organizations and affiliations, as well as edited the Armenian Genocide article with materials that Laciner has written himself. Not to forget also the fact that this same anonymous user has added a link in the Armenia article to his article and his journal. Here all this anonymous users contributions. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=85.99.161.91" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=85.99.161.91" rel="nofollow">[36]</a></p>
<p>While this anonymous user appeared in March 10, on March 11, the login Slaciner was created and he started contributing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Slaciner&amp;offset=0&amp;limit=500" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Slaciner&amp;offset=0&amp;limit=500" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>, on his user page, he rightly say who he is etc. He also created the page about himself. On 13:30 of April 1, 2006, he stop contributing with this acount, another account appear the same day, which is Ankaram and continue the work starting with the alias Slaciner and his attempt to place his works links and his journal everywhere he can find. Right now of course after that anonymous edit of his on the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_Genocide_187a.html" title="Armenian Genocide">Armenian Genocide</a> article he has not edited there, but this is probably due to the fact that the article is now locked for new users.</p>
<p>The thing is that his newspaper is not notable, neither it has the credibility to be used as a source for anything. This man consider Armenians to control the world public opinion and has written works with titles such as&#160;: "Armenian propaganda" etc, the newspaper also in various occasion been exposed to have manipulated and fabricated others statements, just recently a Courier writter was threatned with legal actions just because he has reported one of those fabrications. I was advised by Golbez and Bertilvidet to place Laciner cases in the administrators noticeboard, but I haven't done so because after my message on Ankaram talk page, he has stopped doing that a little, but he started back again adding another link to his newspaper at the entry on Turkish invasion of Cyprus. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Turkish_invasion_of_Cyprus&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=47381290" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Turkish_invasion_of_Cyprus&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=47381290" rel="nofollow">[38]</a> <i>Fad</i> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 17:59, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Now that the three entries are removed, I do agree with you about two of them being not-vital to the encylopedic nature of the Wiki.</p>
<p>Then, too, the citation of a Honeymooner's TV sitcom quote at "carpe diem" =is not valid either= and should be excised.</p>
<p>So should all near-contemporary references to a subject word like "carpe diem", such as it's being employed in classical or modern poetry: not needed, so you state, to convey the (unimportant?)present currency value of the term in popular culture.</p>
<p>I would state that, vanity aside, which I have surrendered inasmuch as is possible, the antidis.. verse is completely relevant to the its subject-word.</p>

":Because the quote or poetry is vital to the understanding of the subject. "Carpe diem" was used in ancient poetry, and that is useful to understand its meaning. And it wouldn't matter if someone else inserted it, it's still not a proper addition."</p>
<p>I do not see the distinction made except that you apparently feel that "vanity" is my purpose in wishing for the antidis.. verse, only, to be reinstalled.</p>
<p>This verse is not ancient but it is quite useful in helping to impart an understanding of antidisestablishmentarianism, ca. the 1860's.</p>
<p>And it defines the word, contains the word and makes the word very simple to understand, in a palatable, amusing way.</p>
<p>In every sense the "anti..." verse meets the criteria you yourself are now promulgating, except that the author is living.</p>
<p><br />
Here it is for the record, for reconsideration. I would gladly surrender copyright and even author name to have this practical verse applied to the entry "antidisestablishmentarianism"</p>

<dd>Wikipedia is an encyclopedia. We have articles, not poems.

<p>"...but do not create them because new ideas (and all poetry includes new ideas,..."</p>
<p>I cannot make the leap that there is a genuine distinction between the anti... verse, vs. and other poetry, though old, which is printed in various Wiki articles.</p>
<p>There are no new ideas in the anti.. verse.</p>
<p>It is a summation of existing knowledge put into an exceedingly compact and memorable (utilitarian) form.</p>
<p>As such, it is of educational value as clearly as is a prose article, but set apart from mere prose by being art, and art is the iconography of a culture.</p>
<p>So that is that.</p>

<dd>It has value in that other editors are more likely to support you if those edits were reversed without good cause. It won't prevent other people from reversing without citation though (although such an action might well be difficult for them to justify).

"Removing warnings for vandalism from one's talk page is also considered vandalism." Here comes the question:</p>
<p>When a user commits a Personal Attack, and they are warned with an npa template, is it considered vandalism for them to remove the npa template from their user talk?</p>
<p>I don't have an username I usually edit under. I have dozens of usernames. <a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFiguringItOutAgain_f721.html" title="User:FiguringItOutAgain">FiguringItOutAgain</a> 03:50, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The answer to your question is yes. All of warning templates are listed on <a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETestTemplates_41b8.html" title="Template:TestTemplates">Template:TestTemplates</a>. Instead of listing every single warning template, <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVAND_6593.html" title="WP:VAND">WP:VAND</a> does have a link to that page. <a href="../../../z/z/y/User%7EZzyzx11_e7c4.html" title="User:Zzyzx11">Zzyzx11</a> <a href="../../../z/z/y/User_talk%7EZzyzx11_0d23.html" title="User talk:Zzyzx11">(Talk)</a> 06:37, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Well that depends on the exact situation generally for properly placed warnings, yes. Clearly there are disagreements about if a personal attack occurred and if the warning was placed in good faith, so if it involves you personally it's sometimes better to ask someone independent for anoter opinion about the specific circumstance, rather than escalating any "hostility". --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User%7EPgk_d0c7.html" title="User:Pgk">pgk</a><sup>(<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk"><font color="mediumseagreen">talk</font></a>)</sup> 08:01, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This isn't the place to discuss it but I can't help myself :-) The problem with that is that record labels tend to be very inconsistent, exactly the same song can be named in multiple ways over the years. The other thing is, the diff provided is simply "<i>Foo</i> Remix" - it's <i>not</i> the name of the song (it's the remix called Foo), but it ought to be title case because <i>by extension</i> it <i>is part of</i> the song title! :P Now, perhaps I've just proven that right and wrong is hard to define here and we should close this as "no case to answer"? :) --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 21:41, 8 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I was told by an editor that it shouldn't. Regardless, the anon has been changing things like <i>"Dirrty" featuring Redman</i> to <i>"Dirrty" (Featuring Redman)</i>, which goes against the MoS as the word "featuring" definitely isn't part of the song's title. <a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtraordinary_Machine_f897.html" title="User:Extraordinary Machine">Extraordinary Machine</a> 21:48, 8 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The problem, of course, is that AFD regulars who know the guidelines and actually read my rationale (the first wave of ""voters"") agreed with the nomination. Then along came the second wave who presumably saw the AFD tag on the article and immediately considered it an attack on schools. Consider such comments as "Keep and subdivide list if necessary, but absolutely do not delete this content from Wikipedia" (I proposed placing the redlinks in the Schools WikiProject, which I thought an admirable solution) and (cough) "Obviously, we want this. It's a list of schools and we do articles on schools." (an experienced editor that one but contribs show many education-related edits). Oh well, I tried, and no doubt it will get attempt #3 at some point. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 22:36, 8 April 2006 (UTC)

<p>Good Day. I would like to support the inclusion of <b>Gah</b> in Wikipedia. This term originated within a PC gaming enthusiast website called www.totalwar.org. Newcomers sometimes ask what Gah means and we would like to lend the term some credibility. Furthermore, the use of GAH! is expanding beyond totalwar.org into the english vernacular. Members of Totalwar.org can view a discussion on this here: <a href="http://forums.totalwar.org/vb/showthread.php?t=63385" class="external free" title="http://forums.totalwar.org/vb/showthread.php?t=63385" rel="nofollow">http://forums.totalwar.org/vb/showthread.php?t=63385</a>.</p>

<p>Hello, I am the bot operator. I am asking for an admin to look and see if the bot is fully unblocked.</p>
<p>The original blcok was placed by <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>, 1 day later <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">User:Grutness</a> also blocked the bot. Both blocks were indefinate. Upon my request, and after I had changed the coding in the bot, I asked <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a> to unblock the bot. He did, but when I try to test it on my user subpages, I trigger the autoblock... Please someone explain to me what is wrong. My theory is that Zoe removed his block, but forgot to also remove <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness'</a> block.

<dd>Probably happened because you tried to edit after the main block had been lifted but less than 24 for hours after it had been placed so since we use an absolutely stupid autoblock system you got hit with a still present autoblock. Maybe you should file a bug report and see if a dev can rectify it so autoblocks autolift when the main block lifts even if it's say 1 minute later or something like that. <small><a href="../../../p/e/g/User%7EPegasus1138_bb01.html" title="User:Pegasus1138">Pegasus1138</a></small><sup><a href="../../../p/e/g/User_talk%7EPegasus1138_96b0.html" title="User talk:Pegasus1138">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Pegasus1138_f4b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pegasus1138">Contribs</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Pegasus1138_eec2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Pegasus1138">Email</a></sup> ---- 09:53, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>On the front page, in the current events section, it says that an act was passed making NZSL an offial language of New Zealand.

<p><s>Please help, there seems to be some kind of monopoly going on with the <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capture_bonding.html" title="Capture bonding">capture bonding</a> article. I've been trying to add a simple paragraph on capture bonding by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Money_ac35.html" title="John Money">John Money</a> and User:Maureen D (see: <a href="../../../m/a/u/User_talk%7EMaureen_D_619e.html" title="User talk:Maureen D">User talk:Maureen D</a> to see her other revert wars) keeps reverting back to some unknown horribly sloppy version and basically throwing all of my contributions out the window? Furthermore, there is someone named <a href="../../../k/e/i/Keith_Henson_dfaf.html" title="Keith Henson">Keith Henson</a>, i.e. <a href="../../../h/k/h/User%7EHkhenson_a554.html" title="User:Hkhenson">User:Hkhenson</a>, who seems to think he invented the concept, and its copy-pasting whole chunks of article from his own research. And they both seem to have some kind of connected relationship of Scientology? What I am to do? This has been going on for weeks now.

<p>I have the similar problem. Only the main namespace shows up. Nothing in any other namespace does. I can't find any link or button to check other namespaces. This happens for both my contributions and other users' contributions.

I don't see any contributions to any namespace in the English wikipedia.

<p>OK, there is a "Namespace: all" dropdown box on all search pages now, apparently -- Watchlist, Contributions, Recent changes, anyway. However, it doesn't seem to be working -- the all doesn't do anything, even if you click on "Go". However, I used the dropdown box to change it to "Wikipedia" and clicked "Go" and got a fatal error, but since having done that, I can now see all contributions. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 16:06, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>An AfD was recently raised against <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_flower.html" title="County flower">County flower</a>; the claim of two very vociferous opponents of the article was that, first, the system of county flowers was created more or less whole by a national charity, and secondly, that the charity used (quite openly) an old-fashioned system of counties.</p>

<p>No, I do not know the facts/citations are for every single county. What I was requesting was that someone with detailed knowledge of each area perhaps produce a reference showing how, or if, Plantlife's suggestions had been adopted in their "county" or city. Failing such citations of real-life adoption then all references to "county flowers" (sic) are just spamming for the charity <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plantlife.html" title="Plantlife">Plantlife</a>. User:Mel Etitis claimed, I believe inaccurately, that an internal link was a reasonable substitute for putting an external reference for the neologism "county flower" in context. WP:CITE clearly states that internal links are no substitute for proper sourcing. I was most certaonly not making a point. I was very genuinely asking if any editors knew the facts in their area, rather than the facile inclusion of a one line reference to some novel "county flower" that no-one has hitherto heard of. As it happens, several editors have backed up my approach and either put the statement in context, referenced it, shifted it out of the Introduction section, or even deleted it altogether. I chose not to delete the info, but rather find out if it had any basis in fact. Is that not what Wikipedia is all about: fact conquering fiction? --<a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">Mais oui!</a> 10:27, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, that is just not good enough. You have totally misrepresented the situation here. If readers look very, very carefully at Mel Etitis opening accusation against me, you will see that it is composed of 100% opinion and 0% evidence. The fact is I added the "citation needed" template to about 6 or 7 articles. Citations were duly supplied for most or other editors removed the simple sentences altogether (<b>this was all happening while Mel Etitis was blocked for 24 hours for 3RR</b>). The next day, I added "citation needed" back onto 2 or 3 articles that Mel Etitis had removed them from. That was it! No edit war, no incivility, no nothing. This whole jumped-up case against me is totally outrageous, and I await a full apology, and for Mel Etitis to be reprimanded. --<a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">Mais oui!</a> 11:17, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You cannot restore all these references to "county flowers" without some source. A charity or any other private organisation can say anything they like about various former administrative divisions: it does not make it true. Perhaps, at a pinch, it is worth a wee footnote saying that as part of a marketing campaign <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plantlife.html" title="Plantlife">Plantlife</a>, in <b>2002</b>! (long after the abolition of nearly every county concerned) invented a number of "county flowers" (sic). But c'mon, they are not really county flowers unless a proper county (of which few remain, and none in <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>) actually adopts and uses it.

<dd>That's more than a little unfair. I brought a question here, asking other admins to help out (two have commented, both supprioting my view). Mais Oui! has filled the section with emotional ranting. That is pretty much his usual technique, as a look at his Talk page indicates; he's used it successfully a number of times — he produces an avalanche of posts, pesters admins, and eventually swamps the original issue so that people give up and let him do what he wants. It's not clear to me that I've any cooling down to do (well, except that your comment has got me a little hot under the collar), and the vast majority of what's above comes from Mais Oui! --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 14:25, 9 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>To clarify, my agreement above is based on a fairly supeficial look at the situation, and is a basic agreement that should someone persist in simply repeating an action can be disruptive and can be a legitimate block reason, this is the basics of not edit warring, getting those involved to discuss it calmly and rationally. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User%7EPgk_d0c7.html" title="User:Pgk">pgk</a><sup>(<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk"><font color="mediumseagreen">talk</font></a>)</sup> 15:06, 9 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>But I was not involved in Edit warring. In fairness, that is not what Mel Etitis was accusing me of. And I was most certainly not making a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> either. I was simply making a request for suitable citations to be provided (<b>I only repeated the request twice</b>, at 2 or 3 articles).

<p>They're both fairly difficult to work with, but in this case it seems that Mel Etitis is doing some sort of subtle advertising campaign for a charity, and Mais Oui! is trying to rein it in. <a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoisy_bc7b.html" title="User:Noisy">Noisy</a> | <a href="../../../n/o/i/User_talk%7ENoisy_7db1.html" title="User talk:Noisy">Talk</a> 09:03, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Frankly that's ludicrous (and I notice that you've been joining in the peculiar campaign to remove mentions of county flowers froma rticles, with the same accusations). I have no connection with and little knowledge of the charity. Like many editors who contributed to the AfC I was aware of the campaign at the time, and saw that it was supported by my County Council, local newspapers, other local wildlife charities, and many individuals who voted and disucssed the issue. Mais Oui! and Bwithh's over-the-top reactions to the article and mentions of it drew my attention when it came up on my Watchlist (<a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxfordshire.html" title="Oxfordshire">Oxfordshire</a>), and I joined in discussion at the AfC. I neither started the article nor added references to the counties, but I can see no problem with either.</dd>
<dd>I'm puzzled that this issues has aroused such emotions and accusations of bad faith. Is there something about this that I'm missing?</dd>
<dd>I came here with a request for advice from other admins concerning dubious behaviour by two editors. Could we stick to that? --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 12:41, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>State flowers and other state symbols are chosen by the state's legislators. There seems to be a confusion between "county flower" and "candidate for county flower selected by Plantlife". Flowers legislatively or by executive order legally adopted as county flowers are one thing while flowers selected as candidates for that position various parties are clearly something else.

<dd>I'm not sure if there's a confusion here between U.S. states and counties, or if "state" is being used to mean "naion". Either way, it's not really accurate, I'm afraid. In many if not most countries national flowers (and other objects) are the result of long traditions. In the present case, the county-flower campaign was supported by my local country council, who included it in their own publications. I doubt that they were alone in this.</dd>

<p>The person controlling the account already asked to be unblocked once, and was, and stated that the password had been changed, but the account committed vandalism again within hours (or minutes, depending on how you interpret blanking the user talk page).</p>
<p><br />
On the other hand, come to think of it, I'm fairly sure that old sessions don't automatically get logged out when passwords are changed. I remember one time a vandal account of the type "My password is <i>&lt;&lt;password&gt;</i>&gt;" was blocked by me, and another admin logged in to the account using the given password and changed it, and then unblocked the account (in the name of efficiency, since at that time the blocking code was inefficient and could only support a small number of simultaneous blocks). The vandal then posted a mocking message about being unblocked, clearly having read the message posted (to WP:AN or AN/I) by the unblocking admin, obviously still logged in under the old password. So this could be the case here. Is there any way to prevent this and boot off all the old login sessions when a password gets changed? -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 18:25, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
