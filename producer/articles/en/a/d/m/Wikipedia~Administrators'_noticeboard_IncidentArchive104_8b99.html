<li>Unfortunately, IP addresses from AOL often have vandalism histories.

<dd>It's realistic when you consider that AOL changes the IP address you use every time you open/close your browser. If you are the one paying the bill, you have the power to change this. Other ISPs aren't like that and you'd be a <i>lot</i> less susceptible to a block for something you didn't do. I'm only trying to give constructive advice here, please consider it as such. I'm sure the admins don't want us talking about this here, please stop by my talk page if you want to have a talk about it. I'm only suggesting what I think would be best for you. Please take some time to stop by the link that I posted above (important note: there is even a method of bypassing the proxies that doesn't even require you to change your ISP). There are many many reasons why AOL is generally considered bad.

<dd>I took the unusual approach of overturning Bunchofgrapes' original block and replacing an identical one of my own. I left some rationale behind the decision <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:EddieSegoura&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=55206298" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:EddieSegoura&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=55206298" rel="nofollow">here</a>. At the moment, I think we need to decide what would be the best thing to do. At the moment, I think what would be best to do is to leave the block as is, and any administrator who wishes to take responsibility for shortening the block can do so at their own volition. At minimum, the block should stay for a little bit, but in deference to the original blocking sentiment, I'd like to get more opinions and see what others think about the situation.

<dd>The recent activities of his sockpuppets show that he still doesn't understand how to work within Wikipedia, or else he's been trolling us all along. And the cross-project exic*nt fun suggests the latter. But in either case, it's been six months, and I think the community's patience is thoroughly worn out.

<dl>
<dd>That would require a separate checkuser on every project; if there is reason to think he's active on another project, then I'm happy to hand the IPs off to a steward so they can check, but outside that, I doubt you're going to convince a steward to set permissions on hundreds of wikis and spend several days checking each. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <font color="#7B68EE">(<small><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">Talk</font></a> • <font color="#7B68EE">Connect</font></small>)</font></span> 21:47, 26 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>A recent request came in and user Fluffy/whatever felt that <a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamac_3b4a.html" title="User:Damac">User: Damac</a> was giving him <b>unwanted</b> special attention like continually editing his work the minute after he did saying his work was plagarism, unencyclopedic ect. Here's his statement:</p>
<ul>
<li>The problems raised by this user with my work do appear on face value to have merit, but are a result of my inexperience. This user doesnt subject anyone else to the same scrutiny or same standards.</li>
<li>Since making my edits to "his" articles, (which arguably raised the articles to a higher acedemic standard), he has been on my back constantly. He has discovered "problems" with spelling, grammar, capitalisation of filenames uploaded, "copyright infringement", my "plagarism", my personality, etc. This has all been played out on the respective talk pages.</li>
<li>As part of this behaviour he has introduced two deliberate errors into articles. One I challenged him on, generating work for myself in doing so, the other remains in the article.</li>
<li>He is constantly hovering over edits I make, clearly watching my contributions page. For example he had reported "copyright infringement" in the images I uploaded yesterday within thirty minutes.</li>
<li>He had threatened me with "you'll have some editors down on your back once they pick up on it [the supposed copyright infringement](and they usually do without being told as they monitor what's uploaded."</li>

<p>Despite me asking him why he is picking on me, and involving an admin, he refuses to explain or stop. Taken individually these actions may seem reasonable on their own, but as part of a campaign to harass it is becoming old and making my experience editing wikipedia a nightmare. I would like arbitration or something to make him stop this. Please help, thanks. User: SockPuppetFluffy999 10:55, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Also Fluffy999 was even to scared to come to the admin. noticeboard b/c he felt that the user in question had so many friends that no one would listen. Any help would be appreciated also I want to know what options we have in this such as having them seperated somehow b/c this is horribly unfair to Fluffy <font color="black">Mahoga</font><font color="red"><b><a href="../../../x/c/h/User_talk%7EXchrisblackx_2c59.html" title="User talk:Xchrisblackx">ny</a></b></font></dd>

<dd>It's a bit early for arbitration. I see he has been asked to stay away from you on his talk page. I'd like to see if he does just that. I'd advise fluffy999 to stay away from Damac's favorite pages too, so that he doesn't see anything on his watchlist. Hopefully that alone will resolve the matter. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> | <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">Taste the Korn</a> 20:41, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hello, the problem is that his "favourite pages" are the pages i've created or worked on. Pages he has shown zero interest in before. I have dbauthored all the images I uploaded to wikipedia- around 30, in protest at his treatment. If I dont do this, he will just challenge them all in an effort to harass. He had already been asked to give me a "wide berth" but ignored it, he is obsessed! <a href="../../../f/l/u/User%7EFluffy999_df6b.html" title="User:Fluffy999">Fluffy999</a> 13:47, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>:I haven't had any contact with User:Damac, but Fluff999 has been less than helpful in resolving confusion over image licencing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Fluffy999#Image_Licence" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Fluffy999#Image_Licence" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<dd>Hello in response to the above comment by Seabhcan; Damac has now escalated his campaign by threatening me again, check his talk. I decided to withdraw my vouch for the copyright status of images previously uploaded to wikipedia as Damac will just report them all as copvios to bait and harass. My contributions to wikipedia are entirely serious and im not prone to tantrums or infringing copyright. My offence appears to be having a slightly higher awareness of the facts in articles Damac believes he "owns". He cannot stand this but nevertheless I really would like to go on making contributions without Damac perched on my shoulder the entire time- no one else receives this level of attention or scrutiny from him. <a href="../../../f/l/u/User%7EFluffy999_df6b.html" title="User:Fluffy999">Fluffy999</a> 15:20, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The user keeps removing sourced material, 90% of his edits are reverts, which he does almost never discussing it. He was warned that this is against wikipedia policies, and keeps removing the warning after it was explained to him by an admin that such behaviour is considered vandalism. Very disruptive users, inflamed many edit wars, where more reasonable Croatian users like Zmaj have for instance edited the paragraph about attacks on people from ex-Yugoslavia, he blanks the whole paragraph, despite the fact that it is well sourced (including UNHCR links, and both Croatian and Serbian newspaper articles). Next, he removes, completely without discussion, the whole paragraph about minefields, that was agreed as a compromise version by many users - CRoatian , Serbian and third party, on the page minefields and tourism section. He uses misleading edit summaries (saying that there factual inaccuracies, while there are none - especially strange since the thing is well sourced and not disputed by other Croatian editors). In short, a very inflamatory edit warrior that constantly reverts, removes warning and completely and blatantly disregards wikipedia policies that he is warned about. Also, removes comments of other users, which is not very civil. <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMostssa_0c86.html" title="User:Mostssa">Mostssa</a> 15:32, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am having a lot of trouble editing these days because User:SynergeticMaggot is throwing almost insane numbers of <span id=".7B.7B.7Bref.7D.7D.7D" class="citation">{{{author}}}, <i>{{{title}}}</i>, [[{{{publisher}}}]], [[{{{date}}}]].</span> and <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> tags on any page that is critical of Aleister Crowley. The worst problems have occurred on the [[Aleister Crowley][ page itself of course, and details aout the dispute can be seen on the talk page, but now he is asking for cites on the page <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abramelin_Oil_635f.html" title="Abramelin Oil">Abramelin Oil</a>, where he is threatening on the talk page to remove material that briefly mentions plant symbolism in natural magic by calling for cites -- to what i estimate to be 1,700 different socioogical studies of the magical practices from 250 different cultures, comprising the works of 1,500 authors. He has asked for cites rather than look up simple things. For instance, he asked for a cite to the book, chapter, and verse containing the quoted text of a recipe for Holy Oil in the Bible, which any editor could check at google if he sincerely wanted to IMPROVE Wikipedia. I am waaaay past assuming he is editing in good faith. Even articles that contain references to cited sources within a paragraph of text are being citation-tagged by him, resulting in TWO cites -- one in the text and the other in a footnote -- and then he goes back in and asks for a third and a fourth cite for each sentence in the pargraph. If the cites are not forthcoming, he deltes -- no, not the uncited sentence -- not the insufficiently cited parapgrah -- he deletes the entire sub-section! It is maddening, frustrating, and uncivil, and his intentions are obviously to censor any ngative comments about Aleister Crowley, as well as anything that i am writing hat even remotely alludes to Aleister Crowley. Meanwhile, other Crowleyites have called my edits "garbage" and "vandalism" and implied that i have fabricated false cites when, in actualiy, he was referring ANOTHER editor's cites (and they were not false, but were made to an edition of a book that these folks did not have). Then there are the specious claims that WP does not allow an author's own writings to be quoted as evidence that he is a racist, but that a second partty must be quoted to make the claim.<a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatherineyronwode_cae5.html" title="User:Catherineyronwode">Catherineyronwode</a> 10:16, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I wasnt threatening actually. Although I may challenge material as Wikipedia tells me. I gave a list of examples, it was voted on, and then removed (Aleister Crowley talk page). The user who wrote it (King Vegita), did not care. The complaining was from another editor (CAtherine). As for the <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abramelin_oil.html" title="Abramelin oil">Abramelin oil</a> page, I never put cite tags on that article. I merely gave examples to someone who claimed that every statement on the article was perfectly cited (it wasnt and still isnt). Then the user Catherine began cursing at me, and Tom Harrison removed it. I also commented on this on his talk page (<a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html#Aleister_Crowley" title="User talk:Tom harrison">User_talk:Tom_harrison#Aleister_Crowley</a>. I think i've been more than fare here, seeing as how I wished to discuss the matter, instead of having some sort of edit war. The fact of the matter is that there needs to be citation for alot of comments and statements on the Aleister Crowley page, and I've brought them up as talking point. And as usual, no one discusses anything until action is taken. So how long do I have to wait before I add fact tags and start removing information with no sources? <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">Wikipedia:Citing sources</a> tells me i really dont have to wait.

<dd>Though I don't wish to have to bother with this, I would like to point out point 2 of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, one of the three overriding policies of of Wikipedia. "2. Editors adding new material to an article should cite a reputable source, or it may be removed by any editor."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Further on, when it explains this policy: "Any edit lacking a source may be removed, but some editors may object if you remove material without giving people a chance to provide references. If you want to request a source for an unsourced statement, a good idea is to move it to the talk page. Alternatively, you may tag the sentence by adding the {{fact}} template, or tag the article by adding {{not verified}} or {{unsourced}}."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>When someone adds citation needed, on an uncited statement, they are already being nice. They could outright delete it right then and there, and no one would be allowed to touch them for it. If it needs to be readded, it should be done with a citation. Now, if they are kind enough to simply add {{fact}}, then how can you simply remove the requests for citations and protect the page? Let's look at policy here, you cannot simply decide you don't like the policy and decide to prevent <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> from being enforced here.</dd>

<p>This is a response to the above. It is long, as it describes a lengthy series of events. It will take a good, honest admin to read it and understand it .</p>
<p><b>As for the Abramelin oil page, I never put cite tags on that article.</b> <a href="../../../s/y/n/User%7ESynergeticMaggot_5ec3.html" title="User:SynergeticMaggot">Zos</a> 21:50, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This "correction" by SynergeticMaggot|Zos is a belated and transparent attempt to self-whitewash his inexcusably bad (and bad-faith) behaviour. Look at <a href="../../../a/b/r/Talk%7EAbramelin_oil_f1f7.html#Citations_Needed" title="Talk:Abramelin oil">here</a> for the proliferation of ridiculous citation requests that SynergeticMaggot|Zos has conveniently overlooked. There was one citation request on the <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abramelin_oil.html" title="Abramelin oil">Abramelin oil</a> page itself but ELEVEN more on the <a href="../../../a/b/r/Talk%7EAbramelin_oil_f1f7.html" title="Talk:Abramelin oil">Talk:Abramelin oil</a> page.</p>
<p>Now, you may think that making suggestions for <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> tags on a talk page is innocent, but in the case of this user, it is not.</p>
<p>First, check out pages he has edited himself. here's an example, from Mental Gender. he is referring to a hermetic revival book published anonymously in English in 1908 and his lead paragraph is</p>
<p><b>Mental Gender is a Hermetic concept which relates to the masculine and feminine principles. It does not refer to the physical gender of someone, nor does it suggest that someone of a certain physical gender necessarily has a certain mental gender. Ideally, one wants to have a balanced mental gender. (Three Initiates pp. 193-211) This is very similar to the Taoist concept of Yin and Yang, and one may have been created from the other.</b> Mental Gender</p>
<p>No citations are given to clue the reader that the pseudonymous 20th century English-language book by the "Three Initiates" is called "The Kybalion" (there is no book called "Three Initiates"), which is poor form, but then he struts out the unproven and highly novel theory that this "Mental gender" concept, derived from an uncited book "is very similar to the Taoist concept of Yin and Yang..." Fair enough, until he goes off the deep end of speculation with the zinger: "and one may have been created from the other."</p>
<p>Yes, he is actually saying that "the Taoist concept of Yin and Yang" "may have been created" from "The Kybalion," a pseudonymous book by "The Three Initiates," published in English in 1908!</p>
<p>I am sure that the Chinese would be quite surprised to learn of this.</p>
<p>Is there a <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> tag on this fantastic B.S.? Nope. Not at all.</p>
<p>And why not?</p>
<p>Because SynergeticMaggot|Zos ALWAYS approves the factuality of his OWN pages. It is only the work of others that he patrols with his endless supply of <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> tags.</p>
<p>Later on the same Mental Gender page, he writes:</p>
<p><b>A few organizations consider The Kybalion as the essential foundation of their beliefs and have translated the original text into many languages.</b></p>
<p>The "few organizations" are, of course neither named nor <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> tagged. Yet, for all we know, they only exist in this so-called editor's mind.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abramelin_oil.html" title="Abramelin oil">Abramelin oil</a> page is actually the lesser of SynergeticMaggot|Zos' two venues for employing abuse of the <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> tag tactic against me. He pioneered using <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> as a tactic in edit wars on the <a href="../../../a/l/e/Aleister_Crowley_151e.html" title="Aleister Crowley">Aleister Crowley</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/e/Talk%7EAleister_Crowley_766e.html" title="Talk:Aleister Crowley">Talk:Aleister Crowley</a> pages.</p>
<p><b>The fact of the matter is that there needs to be citation for alot [sic] of comments and statements on the Aleister Crowley page, and I've brought them up as talking point. [sic]</b> <a href="../../../s/y/n/User%7ESynergeticMaggot_5ec3.html" title="User:SynergeticMaggot">Zos</a> 21:50, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sure, "as talking point." Yep. Check out the history of both the <a href="../../../a/l/e/Aleister_Crowley_151e.html" title="Aleister Crowley">Aleister Crowley</a> article and its talk page and talk page archives.</p>
<p>People were posting (and had been posting for years) that the page was a "fan" site and incoherent at that. I didn't wish to spend time working on the incoherence problem (i do most of my writing in the fields other than occult biography -- namely folklore, folk magic, African Americans, hoodoo, anti-Semitism, racism, and blues music -- but i had recently collaborated on writing short bios for the new category Occult writers, and when i came by to add a piped link to the new cat to the Aleister Crowley page, i figured i could provide a small bit of counterbalance to its chaotic and disorganized fannishness. And so this edit war all started when i put a simple external link to a four-page site documenting Crowley's racism, gender-bias, and nationalism.</p>
<p>The external link was falsely (and repeatedly) called a "source" and removed as being not a PRINTED source. This escalated the edit war, as the text at the linked-to pages was repeatedly attributed to me, despite the fact that five credited authors had a hand in it. It was whip-sawed on and off the page repeatedly.</p>
<p>Once the simple external link was deemed too anti-Crowley to stand, i decided that it would be just as easy to bring the data itself to the page.</p>
<p>So i did. It was taken down. Then KV wrote a synopsis of the material at the site i had linked to, but in the process garbled some of the page references.</p>
<p>After that the relatively new user Frater5 called my edits "crap" and "vandalism" and then the equally new editor SynergeticMaggot|Zos put <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> tags on all the portions of the article that i wrote and that provided a non-adulatory view of Crowley -- specifically the subsections about Drugs and Racism. Weirdly, he also put a <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> tag on a Miscellaney item he erroneously attributed to me (about the Number 11). Meanwhile, he was not putting <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> tags on such remarkable claims that Crowley learned to play chess at the age of six or that Crowley was a "sexual revolutionary" -- nor, needless to say, on his own wild claim that ancient Chinese Taoist concepts of Yin and yang were "created" out of some pseudonymous neo-Hermetic book from 1908.</p>
<p>Check the <a href="../../../a/l/e/Talk%7EAleister_Crowley_766e.html" title="Talk:Aleister Crowley">Talk:Aleister Crowley</a> pages out, all multi-mega kb of them (and don't forget the Talk page's archive). Read them through, as i was forced to do day after day, and read the record of how people objected to SynergeticMaggot|Zos's abuse of what should be a polite request for a citation.</p>
<p>After having been reprimanded for abuse of <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> tags the first few times, he took to posting an announcement of his intention to slam the page with <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> tags on the page's talk page, and, when his impossible-to-fulfill demands for citations -- in the case of <a href="../../../a/b/r/Talk%7EAbramelin_oil_f1f7.html" title="Talk:Abramelin oil">Talk:Abramelin oil</a>, for THOUSANDS of cites with respect to all magical traditions that make use of plant materials, and all writers producing books within or about those traditions, and all instances of botanical items being given symbolical ascriptions -- could not be met, he started to move onto the page itself and to light it up with <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> tags.</p>
<p>I responded as i did -- with an attempt to get an admin (<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">User:jpgordon</a>) to help me -- but it soon became clear that i had run up against a clique -- INCLUDING THE ADMIN, who was sending private Thelemic cult "93 and spoon" messages to Frater5's talk page and claiming "we have a very similar take on the real meaning of Thelema; and I imagine if you've spent any time with organized Thelema in the Bay Area, we've got some people in common"</p>
<p>SynergeticMaggot|Zos and the cozy admin jpgordon made repeated and heated false complaints against me for three days straight, claiming that i had made additions to the page by quoting books that did not have proper citations, although i was NOT the person who made those additions (two others did), and even though i repeatedly told them i was not the person who had done that work. They did this despite the fact that KV and <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBoboroshi_a169.html" title="User:Boboroshi">Bo-Bo</a> were responsible for the additions and (more tellingly to me) despite the fact that the material, which was from old books, could be easily found online in digitized form and any minor page number errors corrected. All through this, admin jpgordon backed the Thelemites up.</p>
<p><b>I never once accused her of anything, but fact checked her sources and asked (I'm not the only one asking here either) which book version she was using.</b> <a href="../../../s/y/n/User%7ESynergeticMaggot_5ec3.html" title="User:SynergeticMaggot">Zos</a> 22:07, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The archives of the Talk page make it quite clear that i was using NO book version, not having been the person who uploaded the KV edits to the page, and that despite the simplicity of using an online digitized version of the book to correct any page number errors that KingVegita or Bo-Bo had made, SynergeticMaggot|Zos, admin jpgordon, KingVegita (who uploaded the original errors) and others were not interested in fixing whatever KV and Bo-Bo might have done incorrectly, but spent all of their time diddling about with shifty mentions of ME, alluding to "accusations" and lack of "trust" in edits that they falsely attributed to ME, carrying their accusations to my talk page, and back again to the Aleister Crowley Talk page, despite my continual corrections of their slander -- because i was NOT the person who had put those page citations onto the page.</p>
<p>The stalling and obfuscation surrounding the citation tag edit war did not only involve SynergeticMaggot|Zos and me. Here is a choice sample of dialogue on the Talk page between <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBoboroshi_a169.html" title="User:Boboroshi">Bo-Bo</a> and <a href="../../../9/9/9/User%7E999.html" title="User:999">User:999</a>, starting on May 28th, when 999 wrote</p>
<p><b>catherine, let me know if you file a complaint against Zos. I'd be glad to support a user-conduct RfC. He's being incredibly pushy, and not just on this article.</b> <a href="../../../9/9/9/User%7E999.html" title="User:999">User:999</a> 18:04, 28 May 2006 (UTC))</p>
<p>999 seemed very helpful to me in that remark, but that message, on the 28th, was as phoney as a three-dollar bill. The next day 999 showed the true colours of a member of the pro-Crowley tag team:</p>
<p>Bo-Bo, as i have explained, was also working on adding material about Crowley's racism and anti-Semitism to the article. On May 29, he responded to a message from 999 in which 999 claimed that printed, published secondary sources supporting claims of Crowley's racism could not be found.</p>
<p>The message that follows begins with Bo-Bo quoting the relevant portion of 999's complaint and includes a reply, namely, to use the Lawrence Sutin biography of Crowley, titled "Do What Thou Wilt" -- a source that had previously been mentioned -- and QUOTED -- as one that confirms and documents Crowley's racism as a writer and in deed. Bo-Bo was protesting that 999 and others were attempting to avoid Sutin's bio and substitute a shorter bio that whitewashes Crowley. He was accusing her of special-interest editing. He began by quoting 999's comments:</p>
<p><b>from above: "I have, unfortunately, been unable to find anything yet either supporting or refuting the allegations of racism in this source;" -- Try "Do What Thou Wilt...." by Sutin. look in the index, under 'Crowley' and within that biographical section for 'racial views of'. from there you should also be able to find your way back to Confessions, Magick Without Tears, and 777. why you would now wish to shift to AMBIGUOUS SECONDARY SOURCES Crowley's own expressions and Sutin's clear and referenced text pointing to Crowley has been placed before us is *highly* suspicious, possibly obscurant -- this is the manner by which objectionable material is removed from the bios of mystic masters. E6 64.142.90.35 02:35, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</b></p>
<p>999's reply to Bo-Bo was a choice example of obscurantism:</p>
<p><b>Because original research and the opinions of Wikipedia editors are not suitable material for Wikipedia per WP:NOR. There must be an citable person or source for the opinions. As racism is a subjective, rather than objective, subject matter, a citable source is required per Wikipedia policy. This is, by the way, true of all encyclopedias - they summarize the research of others, they do not create new material. -999 02:42, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</b></p>
<p>Yes, 999 replied to Bo-Bo's suggestion to use the Sutin biography (which is not "approved" by the "master's" church) by making the asinine response that Sutin's bio is "original research" -- and, when Sutin's printed bio provided the source material 999 claimed "could not be found" -- 999 acted as if Sutin's bio was a "wikipedia editor" and therefore not "citable." This was disingenuous, to say the least, as Sutin's bio of Crowley had been cited with publication data and is obviously a citable book and not a "Wikipedia editor."</p>
<p>The claim that the Sutin bio is "not suitable material for Wikipedia per WP:NOR" was false and was simply another stalling tactic.</p>
<dl>
<dd>You are completely misinterpreting my answer. I was not making a statement about Sutin. I think he is a perfectly reasonable source. I was answering the question "Why would you now wish to shift to AMBIGUOUS SECONDARY SOURCES?" You let your mistaken beliefs about people colour your understanding of what they have written. Unless you can discuss and clarify with other editors rather than jump to bad faith conclusions, you are completely unfit to be a WP editor. I have repeatedly stated that I am not a member of any Crowley cult and that my objections to your original research is that it violates WP policy. I don't care whether Crowley come off as a racist or not, as long as the information comes from a biography and not from your big mouth. -<a href="../../../9/9/9/User%7E999.html" title="User:999">999</a> 14:38, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I thought it was dreadful of 999 to act in this way and said so. Therefore SynergeticMaggot|Zos claimed:</p>
<p><b>Catherine, is also attacking <a href="../../../9/9/9/User%7E999.html" title="User:999">User:999</a></b> <a href="../../../s/y/n/User%7ESynergeticMaggot_5ec3.html" title="User:SynergeticMaggot">Zos</a> 00:13, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>True. I called 999 a "parasitic asswipe <i>and this is essentially what i think of 999.</i></p>
<p>In fact, i will go farther and state that i now think EVERYONE at Wikipedia at this time who is not a sincerely duped gullible professional writer labouring as a self-demoted "editor" and witnessing his or her creativity being continually sucked out and mucked up by cult-mongering religious cliques, teenaged vandals, spamming self-promoters, grammar-deficient amateurs, and sociopathic nutcases is a "parasite."</p>
<p>Wikipedia is collectively parasitizing the work of writers, labelling them "editors" and, in the case of religious articles, subjecting them to obviously agenda-driven "sanitization" of all that they contribute in the way of good encyclopedia writing.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is allowing the work of good writers to be twisted and perverted by phonies like 999 and SynergeticMaggot|Zos and the Crowleyite admin jpgordon in order to promote special agendas such as "Aleister Crowley is a great guru" -- and allowing the uncited and completely speculative fictions of writers like SynergeticMaggot|Zos to stand.</p>
<p>When the admin jpgordon joined the others and was -- three days after the row started and after three days of my politely correcting the assaults against my reputation -- still making fake charges against me (that i had uploaded the citations that had page-number errors, which actually had been uploaded by KV and Bo-Bo), i went to the Wiki Community Portal in an attempt to find some sort of advisory page -- and i saw the newly posted Concordia project page on community civility.</p>
<p>I was pretty sure by then that SynergeticMaggot|Zos's eleven calls for citations on the Talk:Abramelin page and one call for a citation on the page itself indicated that what SynergeticMaggot|Zos had done to my work on the <a href="../../../a/l/e/Aleister_Crowley_151e.html" title="Aleister Crowley">Aleister Crowley</a> page and the <a href="../../../a/l/e/Talk%7EAleister_Crowley_766e.html" title="Talk:Aleister Crowley">Talk:Aleister Crowley</a> page was about to spread to the <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abramelin_oil.html" title="Abramelin oil">Abramelin oil</a> page. So i made a good-faith attempt to get the Concordia group to help me out --</p>
<p>Ten seconds after i posted to the Concordia civility page, i saw that the project page itself was proposed for deletion. That's when i realized that Wikipedia is exactly the kind of irresponsible moral cesspool i had been told it was during the rumour-scandal a few months ago, when that poor old guy got accused of being in on the Kennedy assassination for FOUR MONTHS and no one would remove the slander.</p>
<p>I removed my watchlist, left an angry message with the phoney Concordia jerks, and decided that although every other page i had worked on at WP had been collaborative, the one page i had written myself -- and which had been accused of consisting of "Original Research" -- was the <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abramelin_oil.html" title="Abramelin oil">Abramelin oil</a> page and that i would not wait for 999 and Frater5 and SynergeticMaggot|Zos and jpgordon to disassemble it piece by piece -- i would leave the Crowleyites EXACTLY what they had been claiming all along was the truth -- that Abramelin Oil is noteworthy solely on the basis of its association with their guru, Aleister Crowley.</p>
<p>I wrote a new, shorter page, and took my ORIGINAL RESEARCH and left.</p>
<p>I then htmlized my Abramelin page, carefully excising all the dumb and inaccurate and syntactically incorrect pro-Crowley changes they had made over the past week, and i uploaded it to my own 6,000-page site on occultism. It is at <a href="http://www.luckymojo.com/abramelin.html" class="external free" title="http://www.luckymojo.com/abramelin.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.luckymojo.com/abramelin.html</a></p>
<p>At that point i found out that Tawkerbot2 had reverted my edits and that i had been blocked for "npa".</p>
<p><b>[Catherine is] trying to delete everything she has put on wikipedia ([Here]), as well as accusing others of being a sock puppet.</b> <a href="../../../s/y/n/User%7ESynergeticMaggot_5ec3.html" title="User:SynergeticMaggot">Zos</a> 00:13, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>That's a simple lie. I am not trying to delete everything [i have] put on wikipedia." The page to which SynergeticMaggot|Zos provides a helpful link proves him conclusively wrong. I wish to have the <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abramelin_oil.html" title="Abramelin oil">Abramelin oil</a> page reverted to the pro-Crowley stub written by <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshami_0cbd.html" title="User:Ashami">User: Ashami</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrater5_6a4f.html" title="User:Frater5">user:Frater5</a>.</p>
<p>The truth is, it doesn't matter what SynergeticMaggot|Zos says now -- the <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abramelin_oil.html" title="Abramelin oil">Abramelin oil</a> page -- the ONLY one i am attempting to get taken down, contrary to SynergeticMaggot|Zos's typical lies -- WAS original research and should have never been uploaded to WP. It violates the WP:NOR rule.</p>
<p>How can you tell it is my "original research"? Well, you can look at the page history before i got there and after i made my last rewrite, and you can research my career and easily learn that i am a professional occult perfumer, 59 years old, and have been working with these materials for decades, and have written two books, totalling 656 pages of 9 point type, on botanical herb lore and magic, whereas people of the ilk of SynergeticMaggot|Zos can't even perform a simple google search in order to improve Wikipedia by adding a citation to the Book of Exodus in the Bible.</p>
<p>So all i am asking is that the <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abramelin_oil.html" title="Abramelin oil">Abramelin oil</a> page be reverted to ether the inaccurate and panderingly pro-Crowley flack that <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshami_0cbd.html" title="User:Ashami">User: Ashami</a> created on 02:32, April 17, 2006 -- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abramelin_oil&amp;oldid=48786746" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abramelin_oil&amp;oldid=48786746" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abramelin_oil&amp;oldid=48786746</a> -- or the equally fumbleheaded and totally Thelemified version updated by <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrater5_6a4f.html" title="User:Frater5">user:Frater5</a> on 20:10, May 5, 2006 at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abramelin_oil&amp;oldid=51730032" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abramelin_oil&amp;oldid=51730032" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abramelin_oil&amp;oldid=51730032</a> -- and i am taking my proverbial marbles and going home.</p>

<dd>It's pretty easy; Thanks to our brilliant law, we have no rights until we are given them by the owner. The exception is fair use; Refer to the current fair use templates we have for the general scenarios that they need to mold to and the general guidelines needing to be met. Basically, if the pictures are being used to show the subject of the picture, it's cool. Otherwise, we can't use them. --<a href="../../../a/v/i/User%7EAvillia_e750.html" title="User:Avillia"><font color="#228B22">Avillia</font></a> <a href="../../../a/v/i/User_talk%7EAvillia_20cb.html" title="User talk:Avillia"><sup><font color="#228B22">(Avillia me!)</font></sup></a> 21:55, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Humans tag images as unsourced, not the bot. It just tracks down tagged images and notifies you that they've been tagged. Also, while you have been correctly "pestered" over Image:Wibi Soerjadi.jpg (which has no source), other deleted images like Image:Patphelan.jpg and Image:Sen16.jpg were tagged by you as a "don't know", so they were recognised by the bot as lacking licensing data. It asked you to add it, but you didn't, so an admin deleted them. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 17:41, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A paragraph from the article <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-French_sentiment_in_the_United_States_2cfe.html" title="Anti-French sentiment in the United States">Anti-French sentiment in the United States</a> has been deleted by User:Tocquevil. The paragraph is about "popular anti-French allegations" and lists several news events relating to France which Americans have objected to.</p>
<p>He just deleted it with no explanation and no comment in the talk page. He doesn't seem to have a user page either; I'm not sure if he even exists, since user pages are normally deleted when a user leaves. I reverted it and it was deleted again. I believe this deletion is questionable, but if I keep restoring it it violates the 3RR. Exactly how can I handle putting the paragraph back?</p>

<dd>The information is already present in the <a href="../../../m/u/m/Mumia_Abu-Jamal_fb96.html" title="Mumia Abu-Jamal">Mumia Abu-Jamal</a> page. It isn't sourced there, either, but it's a recent news event and deleting it for being unsourced strikes me as very disingenuous. I can Google for a random newspaper article about the subject and add it again with the source, but somehow I doubt that'll help.</dd>
<dd>And of course the list is there to make a point. The point is "these are some things done by France which people don't like". That is, after all, what the section is about. It doesn't violate NPOV to give a list of reasons why people don't like France, in an article about people not liking France. (And since User:Tocquevil gave no reason why he was deleting the paragraph, any claims that he deleted it for NPOV or lack of sources are purely speculation.)</dd>
<dd>But at any rate, that isn't the problem. The problem is that a user has repeatedly deleted a section from a controversial article with no comment and nothing on the article's talk page, where the user's contributions show that he has no user page, has only been around for two days and has edited nothing other than this article and a closely related one. This shouldn't be happening. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_Arromdee_cac5.html" title="User:Ken Arromdee">Ken Arromdee</a> 01:36, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I don't want to go three months down the line and see him chortling all over Wikipedia about being let back despite all the crap he unloaded on us.

<p>While I won't say that we should -not- use off-wiki material for on-wiki actions, we need to apply it everywhere or nowhere. Blu Aardvark's account on WikipediaReview could have been compromised, it could be a impersonator, we have no way of knowing because it is not tied to Wikipedia by technical or legal means. We need to look at his history on Wikipedia and the history of his <i><b>confirmed</b></i> sockpuppets (via CheckUser) and decide on that. If his socks are disruptive by no other means than the fact they exist to allow a banned user to return (IE: No voterigging, vandalism, etc), and some time has passed...

<dd>I question the "success rate" that <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinuxbeak_c86a.html" title="User:Linuxbeak">Linuxbeak</a> mentions. A similar case is that of <a href="../../../j/a/r/User%7EJarlaxleArtemis_f75f.html" title="User:JarlaxleArtemis">user:JarlaxleArtemis</a> (JA). He had been in the middle of a second ArbCom case when he lashed out so horribly that he was immediately and permanently banned. Subsequently he contacted Linuxbeak and pleaded for a second chance, promising to do a number of things if allowed back. Linuxbeak (who had borne the brunt of JA's anger) generously allowed him back under a strict mentorship and based on JA's completion of several steps, including apologizing, undoing previous vandalism, etc. Once back, JA did none of the things required of him and after a short period of good behavior went back to behaviors that had led to his previous ArbCom cases. Linuxbeak had gotten busy with Wikimani, and two other appointed mentors had lost interest, which left JA unsupervised and he took advantage of it. Eventually I noticed the trouble, asked Linuxbeak for help, but he was still too busy to do anything, so I intervened, which took considerable time. I'd like to ask Linuxbeak how this mentorship will be handled differently from JA's in order to prevent a similar problem. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 23:04, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As one of the administrators involved with Blu Aardvark, I think it is a good idea that we offer him a shot at being a good Wikipedian again. I don't believe he is intrinsically a bad person, because he has shown some evidence in his Wikipedia career of being a decent Wikipedian; he has just made a series of recent bad judgements, and undertaken less-than-acceptable actions as a consequence. I don't believe that should make him persona non grata as regards Wikipedia, and thus I think we should offer him another go. So long as we watch his account carefully, and expeditiously block him again if he partakes in unacceptable behaviour, I see not a scrap of harm that could be caused by allowing him another chance provided his behaviour is watched assiduously. Yes, it is true this wasn't arrived at by direct consensus, but the present ban was in fact only arrived at via de facto consensus - as in, no dispute, versus a prior decision that a ban was necessary. After all, bans are meant to be merely a necessary mechanical means versus a punitive action, and so I see no reason why a last crack of redemption would be inappropriate. So as a consequence, I call on all Wikipedians to give this a go, as Linuxbeak suggests, and evaluate the results. We may well, of course, gain a possibly good Wikipedian as a consequence. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicholasTurnbull_9d8a.html" title="User:NicholasTurnbull">Nicholas<b>Turnbull</b></a> | <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENicholasTurnbull_45f8.html" title="User talk:NicholasTurnbull">(talk)</a> 23:08, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Linuxbeak is completely trustworthy. He's one of our best people and I am sure he'll make a great job of this. Best of luck. Nothing I've said here is intended to she doubt on his judgement. It would be nice to see a bit more publicly what is going on, but in the end if Linuxbeak is prepared to block his protege in a case of serious problems, or at least not get in the way of normal administrative action without giving a full account of his interventions, that's okay. I'd love to see Blu Aardvark back again and not doing the troll thing. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 23:13, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have reblocked MSK because she was highly disruptive and made no good contributions. Linuxbeak, it's inappropriate of you to unblock such controversial users without discussion, and in particular given what's happened to Katefan0. These two users are staff members of Wikipedia Review, not ordinary posters. They have shaped the way the website has developed, and both have the power to make sure that the material that damages individuals isn't posted. It seems bizarre to respond to the recent serious attacks on Kelly, Phil, Tony, and Katefan0 by allowing the people in charge to post here again. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 23:35, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

Also, while I grieve what has happened to Katefan0 (I went into a mini-rage earlier today over it, which is something that never happens to me), that wasn't Wikipedia Review as a whole. That was Daniel Brandt. Selina has plenty of good edits, as well: see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Mistress_Selina_Kyle?oldid=47363392#A_list_of_some_positive_contributions:" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Mistress_Selina_Kyle?oldid=47363392#A_list_of_some_positive_contributions:" rel="nofollow">this</a>. Also, Selina has asked to reply to this, so I would like to unblock her so that she can do so. I know that this might seem totally whacked, but you know me.

<dd>It wasn't the good edits that were the problem. Can you describe your conversations with these users? Did they acknowledge that what they did previously was wrong? What did they say thet led you to believe that their future behavior would be different from their past behavior? These two editors are owners/operators/moderators of WR, so they are responsible for its content. Have they made any comments about the realtionship of WR and WP? If we had more informaiton it'd be easier to understand this proposed arrangement. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 00:07, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, absolutely. I talked to Blu Aardvark on IRC this afternoon. I approached him, saying that I know that there are problems with Wikipedia, and I'd like to help find solutions, etc. He and I had a very civil and intellegent conversation, and the subject of him being blocked came up. I mentioned that we have a mentorship process to handle things such as this. Blu Aardvark acknowledged that he had violated our policies and rules and that it was not appropriate for him to act as such. He also apologized. His acknowledgement and repentance for what he had done in the past is a sign that there's a possibility of being an active part of the community again. We have done this in the past (remember <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_03fe.html" title="User:Michael">User:Michael</a>?) and it has worked. Blu Aardvark has agreed to be civil. As far as Mistress Selina is concerned, I would like to direct your attention to <a href="../../../m/i/s/User_talk%7EMistress_Selina_Kyle_04f4.html#Welcome_back" title="User talk:Mistress Selina Kyle">User_talk:Mistress_Selina_Kyle#Welcome_back</a>. I would also like to make note that I informed Jimbo of this decision, to which he did not have any problems (he told me "good luck"). If I am given the chance to prove to you that these people can be let back in, I won't let you down. Just give me the chance. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinuxbeak_c86a.html" title="User:Linuxbeak">Linuxbeak</a> (drop me a <a href="../../../l/i/n/User_talk%7ELinuxbeak_c40b.html" title="User talk:Linuxbeak">line</a>) 00:17, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Blu Aardvark should have been making those representations to the community, not just one well-placed person. I'd want to see a comprehensive mea culpa from BA in which he lists all his sockpuppets and publicly renounces his contempt for our policies and values before I'd even consider giving him a chance. Too many intentional disruptions and hurtful personal attacks have come from a site he's significantly responsible for while under his watch. We lost one of our better admins last week due to harassment in real world because some of his friends on his site contacted her employer, and he did not even bother to speak up, much less intervene. He needs to account for that. We need more than your word here. <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 00:32, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>LB, look, it has started already. See below: "what SlimVirgin is saying is blatantly false and just an attempt to smear me as some kind of vandal." These people don't acknowledge that they have done anything wrong. MSK has posted on WR that I pretend to be a Jew on Wikipedia because I am really a neo-Nazi trying to compile accurate lists of Jews to attack, or something (forgive me if I have it slightly wrong, but it's hard to paraphrase craziness). She has referred to that conspiracy theory very recently, so this isn't old news. How can you let someone like back onto Wikipedia? If she had been a great editor, and you were asking me to overlook eccentricity, then maybe I'd consider it. But she was never a good editor either, so how does this benefit Wikipedia or any of its editors? <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 00:51, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

&lt;rabbit2&gt; its just the people that post most make the forum basically, without the people it would just be me and an empty website o-o<br />

<p>I think this is a bad, bad idea, and we're going to regret it soon enough. Do you guys even remember what Blu Aardvark <i>did</i>? I can't think of many things to do that would've made it worse. He was using a combination of personal attacks, sockpuppetry, disruption, and oh yeah, anti-semitism. Why do we think that every user can be rehabilitated? Even assuming they can, why should we? It takes a lot of work and we're writing an encyclopedia here, not running a rehabilitation clinic. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><span style="color:#ff66ff;cursor:w-resize;"><b>Cyde↔Weys</b></span></a> 00:51, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
This all strikes me as very weird, and I have a few questions. Does anyone have valid statistics on how much time (how many edits?) admins spend actually creating encyclopedic content versus other activities? I get the impression (maybe in error) that vandal fighting has replaced encyclopedia creation as the number one task of admins. Is Wikipedia becoming one third encyclopedia making, one third free blog, one third free first person shooter game ("blocked a vandal; woohoo"). Does letting loose the caged fox make the fox hunt fun? Are people let back in because of it is good for building the encyclopedia or other reasons? Can't banned people make suggestions for improvements via e-mail to concerned persons who then implement them? What's the rush? Will waiting six months be a problem? Why? <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 00:55, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This unblocking is outrageous. These are the creators of WR, who could easily have used their power to end the harassment of Katefan0, and all of the misongynistic etc. conversations on that board, yet they instead <i>at best</i> did nothing, and often egged the main miscreants on. I see no hint that they are in way reformed, nor deserving of being unblocked; nor do I see any sign that there is a consensus on Wikipedia for this unblocking.

<dd>I do trust Linuxbeak. But I distrust Blu Aardvark even more. We shouldn't be wasting our time trying to rehabilitate users who were banned for some pretty serious infractions (Blu Aardvark, for instance, made over a dozen sockpuppets and went on an unmitigated spree of vandalism, in <i>addition</i> to all of the anti-semitic remarks). We're an encyclopedia, not a rehabilitation clinic. When someone has proven that their presence is not in the best interest of writing the encyclopedia they need to be gotten rid of, not given endless chances to reform themselves, in the mean time pissing off lots of productive users (who may end up leaving) and wasting lots of time. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><span style="color:#ff66ff;cursor:w-resize;"><b>Cyde↔Weys</b></span></a> 01:39, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

What's next, are we going to give Rgulerdem a <i>third</i> chance? Unblock Willy on Wheels?

<p>We shouldn't pretend to ourselves (or some people shouldn't pretend to <i>them</i>selves) that these two editors are suddenly transformed into good company by banning a couple of other trolls or clearing a few posts from a board. That doesn't change the fact that both have been a time, resource and emotion and editor sink for a long time, particularly MSK, and that they have a nearly-uncontrollable disposition to making such comments and taking such actions in the first place. There is often the possibility of rehabilitating poor editors: but some people, like people in jail for life without parole, are simply unfixable, and unwanted. They tried editing here, couldn't cut it, many of our finest people tried to help them, and couldn't do it, because they simply didn't want to be helped. Wikipedia is not therapy, is not a rehabilitation clinic, is not infinitely forgiving, does not need every last one of their carefully-placed 'good' edits, and is not a suicide pact. To allow either of these users back without an extensive period of near-sainthood, would require Wikipedia to be all those things at once. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 02:01, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Also, it doesn't make sense to grant editing privileges back in response to administrative actions on another site which we have no control over. What would happen if, a week from now, MSK unblocked AMorrow, or if he started editing from another account name and that one wasn't blocked? Would we reinstate MSK's block here? It just doesn't seem workable to me. Blocking users on external sites can't be a condition for editing privileges here: only the user's own actions can be. And I haven't seen anything from these two editors that leads me to believe they're suddenly magically reformed. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><span style="color:#ff66ff;cursor:w-resize;"><b>Cyde↔Weys</b></span></a> 02:15, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm in favour, <i>in principle</i>, of letting sane banned users back onto the site. Someone like amorrow is utterly unwelcome and must never be allowed back here; but those with some semblance of sanity (Selina, Blu Aardvark, Lir, perhaps) are theoretically capable of being good users. The question is, are they <i>willing</i> to do so? Selina wasn't so bad, before she was blocked, that I'd be unwilling to countenance her return. Blu Aardvark ... eee ... I'll leave <i>that</i> question to the ones he was antagonising. However, I suspect they aren't quite ready to be civil and behave themselves here. Selina's note, pasted above, is I think a good example of what we can expect from her and BA: nonsensical abuse and a complete unwillingness to work <i>with</i> us. I'd like to see some evidence that they won't behave as they have done on Wikipedia Review before they're allowed to return. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">befuddle me!</a>) 02:34, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Looking over the history - neither of these users was banned by the ArbCom, Jimbo, or other 'binding' resolution. They were indefinitely blocked by individual admins and nobody chose to dispute that... until now. The only basis in blocking policy for an indefinite block <i>without</i> action by some sort of official party is the 'community ban'... which to date has meant that their actions were so bad that no admin is willing to unblock them. Since an admin <i>is</i> willing to unblock these two a community ban is <b>not</b> in place and reblocking them is inappropriate wheel-warring. If you want these people gone the proper course is appeal to the ArbCom or Jimbo.</dd>
<dd>As to the actual individuals - I don't know much about Blu Aardvark so I won't comment. MSK was always a handful... we first met when I reverted a picture she added to the <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Wales_abf5.html" title="Jimmy Wales">Jimmy Wales</a> page, not of Jimbo, and she made disparaging remarks about my appearance... naturally we became fast friends. :] However, she also made some useful contributions and received some... questionable treatment from others. On this page, in the comments above, several admins have clearly violated civility and personal attack standards - as some did prior to her banishment. It becomes difficult to blame users for bad behaviour when those of us who are supposed to represent the best sometimes fall well short of the goal. Few people respond well to any sort of provocation... and MSK definitely isn't one of them. Do I expect all sunshine and flowers if she is let back? No... but if that were the standard there are some admins who'd be perma-banned too. I suspect that if MSK were given one 'free' incivil remark / personal attack / rule bending for every one directed <i>at</i> her she could never be blocked again... and that's a problem. We're not supposed to be harassing people to the point that they set up anti-Wiki sites. It may be 'easier' to kick 'problem' users around, but it is still wrong and we all end up paying for it. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBDunkerson</a> 03:15, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>What happens on WikipediaReview <b>stays</b> on WikipediaReview.</i> I must say that the pure sophistry of this statement is mind-boggling: WikipediaReview isn't some J. Random BulletinBoard that happens to have some Wikipedia editors on it, its <b>very reason for existence</b> is Wikipedia, the alleged monitoring (snort) of what goes on here. And their track record (institutionally and of its members) is, to put it mildly, sufficiently disgusting to put them beyond granting them the slightest sliver of the benefit of the doubt. MSK and Blu Aardvark can't edit on Wikipedia? Too bad, so sad, actions have consequences. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 04:24, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What happens on WikipediaReview most definitely does not stay on WikipediaReview. I've had complete strangers contact me, offwiki, in a highly unpleasant manner, who could only possibly have "discovered" me through Wikipedia Review. My sins, apparantly, are that I am a Wikipedia administrator and a woman (horrors!) who took a strong stand against a disruptive user. Said disruptive user, after being blocked here, was welcomed with open arms at Wikipedia Review and allowed to spread toxic comments and lies to his heart's content. Nobody questioned any of his statements there: as long as he was virulently opposed to Wikipedia, he was embraced, and I was demonized. I am a person of some public stature in my country, and I make my living on my reputation. People who run a Google search on my real name, seeking professional credentials, will now find toxic comments and lies spread about me, under my real name, at various random-seeming websites across the web, solely because of the vengance of a disgruntled banned user. This is real world damage, and Wikipedia Review had a hand in it. If we block people for legal threats because legal threats deter people from editing and getting involved in Wikipedia, we should block people for other forms of real, offwiki damage. I do not stand for the opinion that the right to edit Wikipedia is an inalienable human right. --<a href="../../../w/o/g/User%7EWoggly_b7b8.html" title="User:Woggly">woggly</a> 07:54, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Allow me to weigh in on this one. It seems MSK has given a negative impression on the Wikipedia community, however, I feel some people are not looking at both sides of the story. To begin with here, I don't recall there ever being an RFAr or a mentorship against MSK, it just started with Sean Black's indef block of her stating she was a <i>"troll, virtually no positive contribs, etc. etc."</i> Not to pick on Sean here, but that is just not true (as he is probably aware of at this point), and if I remember correctly his block went through a series of unblockings/re-lenghthenings/so on and so forth. I feel it could have been handled differently, as I'm sure others do too. I would like to direct your attention to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Pilotguy/Archive1#Welcome" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Pilotguy/Archive1#Welcome" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>. If this helps <i>at all</i>, it proves that MSK has made some positve contributions, and can show friendliness at times. Also to note MSK does have <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asperger%27s_Syndrome_18a6.html" title="Asperger's Syndrome">AS</a> although the general agreement between us is that AS is to not interfere with editing Wikipedia. Those points being said, I'm afraid it's too late for a mentorship to be done on this user. MSK is unique in that she tends to be a bit more bold than usual when it comes to editing which is an issue. I would also ask ALL admins to remain civil as best you can as I have sat behind and watched the aforementioned admins (I won't name names) try to deal with her, and I feel the civily line was crossed too many times. As for WR; as it relates directly to Wikipedia it does affect us. I would recommend further talks with MSK about your concerns and I'm sure she'll comply if at all she wants back in on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilotguy_59e8.html" title="User:Pilotguy"><font color="#000000"><b>Pil</b></font></a><a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilotguy_Esperanza_42a9.html" title="User:Pilotguy/Esperanza"><font color="green"><b>o</b></font></a><a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilotguy_59e8.html" title="User:Pilotguy"><font color="#000000"><b>t|</b></font></a><a href="../../../p/i/l/User_talk%7EPilotguy_51fb.html" title="User talk:Pilotguy"><font color="#0000FF"><b>guy</b></font></a> 13:25, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's nice to see that so many think Linux is a "trustworthy" editor and I note that I have no reason to believe otherwise. It's also nice to see that he has decided to set himself up as Mother Teresa, the Messiah or Betty Ford or whatever holy or not so holy redeemer one can think of. If such a mission lights his internal spirit-fire then, soibeit. But as Cyde noted -- this is an encyclopedia not a rehab clinic.</dd>
<dd>In any case, Linux showed himself to have one significant flaw: He did not exhibit the level of judgment that is expected from Wikipedia's administrators, in fact he appears to have given little though to the past actions of Blu or MSK and absolutely zero thought to how unblocking them would effect the community as a whole.</dd>

<dd>I'm going to have to ditto FloNight here ... Wikipedia needs to choose which to value more: its contributors or banned users. We're not some damn experiment in rehabilitation, we're an encyclopedia. Giving rightfully banned editors unlimited chances to "rehabilitate" is just causing lots of disruption. Has rehabilitation ever actually worked? Let's look at some previous cases ... MARMOT, Jaraxle, Shultz ... this is not a good track record. It's not worth losing actually valuable contributors due to harrassment from returning indefinitely banned users. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><span style="color:#ff66ff;cursor:w-resize;"><b>Cyde↔Weys</b></span></a> 04:57, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yep. This whole debate is a microcosm of a much wider debate on justice and crime. Why do criminals get punished? To avenge their crimes? To discourage others from committing the same crime? To rehabilitate them? To protect the community from them? How should we balance the rights and welfare of the criminal against the rights and welfare of the victim? How should we determine that a criminal has been punished enough? People have been grappling with these questions for thousands of years. The probability of Wikipedia resolving them here is zero. We must abandon this arrogant quest to be the perfect rehabilitative justice system, and just do whatever will best get the encyclopaedia written. All things considered, it seems to me mind-numbingly obvious that the encyclopaedia will be better off if these people remain blocked. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnottygobble_915d.html" title="User talk:Snottygobble">Snottygobble</a> 06:08, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I abhor wheel warring but absent an explicit order from Jimbo that came out and said exactly what the circumstances of their return was, I would reblock them both. Yes I trust linuxbeak but I think he's been bamboozled. This whole thing of what happens in one place doesn't affect another place has come up in other communities and it can destroy them.

FloNight, SlimVirgin, KateFan0, Phaedriel... these are some of our very best. The cost is too high. Keep them banned. Whether there is cause to seek legal action against WR or whether that is a good idea is a different matter, but editing here is a privilege, not a right. This community has no need of the contributions of disruptive editors who agitate, foment trouble and trash good editors on other sites.

<p>"Yes, absolutely. I talked to Blu Aardvark on IRC this afternoon. I approached him, saying that I know that there are problems with Wikipedia, and I'd like to help find solutions, etc. He and I had a very civil and intellegent conversation, and the subject of him being blocked came up. I mentioned that we have a mentorship process to handle things such as this." -Linuxbeak</p>

<dd>Just as a response to what Blu Aardvark said on IRC ... I think Linuxbeak has been misled. Yeah, Blu Aardvark <i>is</i> capable of being civil in short doses. Once he gets into protracted discussions he just reverts to his same-old, same-old, though. I've interacted with Blu Aardvark before ... it started off civil and it ended with him getting kicked from #wikipedia after various anti-semitic remarks. Just because he says a few sentences that aren't incivil doesn't mean that he has rehabilitated.

<dd>Linuxbeak, I don't doubt that you intended to do something positive, and that you did not intend SlimVirgin to leave, but using language like "left in a huff" to describe the departure of a valuable and conscientious admininstrator who was subjected to some horrifying abuse while the two people you have welcomed back stood by and watched when they had the power to do something about it is not helping the situation. SlimVirgin is, of course, responsible for her own decisions in whether she goes or stays; but you must certainly carry some responsibility for the fact that she felt undermined by your unilateral decision to unblock people who had enabled the posting of such filth about her and about people that she tried hard to help. And the timing of this unblock, when many of us are not just angry, but <i>grieving</i> about what happened to Kate can at best be described as insensitive. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 08:47, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Not discussing the matter beforehand with those editors who have been the target of months worth of harassment is disrespectful. I agree with FloNight; that makes it a perfectly reasonable decision to not want to invest further in the project.

Were I a victim of harrassment from these people, I don't think I'd see wide condemnation here.

<dd>Linuxbeak, I don't doubt you meant well; this can't be the outcome you intended. You hoped to eliminate enemies by making friends. I'm sure you still mean well; What do you hope to accomplish this time, with your "sincere and humble" non-apology? Is it supposed to make it easier for FloNight or SlimVirgin to come back, or to reassure others who are on the fence, or get some part of the encyclopedia written, or what? Sure, you are not solely responsible for their leaving. Others have left recently as well. It's not all on you that the project has trouble retaining good volunteers, and trouble getting rid of jerks. But your actions aggravated both problems, and some here support your actions.

<dd>I was not going to get involved in this, but Slim's reaction makes it necessary. If for no better reason than keeping Slim here, I strongly favor indef blocks of Selina and Ardvark. Even if Selina and Arvark's only edits were their few productive ones, Slim would still be orders of magnitude more useful to the project. Unblocking these two users is simply ridiculous.

<p>I am rather saddened by the display of poor faith here relating to Linuxbeak's mentorship attempt of Blu Aardvark and MSK; especially since I was, technically, the blocking administrator of Blu Aardvark and have voiced my support towards mentorship - although, in actuality, it was Kelly Martin who was the blocking admin. The point is that nobody has yet explained how placing these users on mentorship probation could be dangerous to Wikipedia provided the users' contributions are watched with adequate assiduity. I cannot emphasise this enough, why cannot we just show some compassion and common amicability and assume good faith that these users are willing to reform? Has <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> been neglected in the great stampede that is the onslaught of expediency over consideration? To hell with policy. Policy is not gospel. It is negotiable; Wikipedia is not some rule-ridden mechanism that operates solely according to the rules - which would, after all, be untenable since the block was applied in the first place with only <i>de facto</i> consensus. I don't think Linuxbeak was at fault over the matter; sure, perhaps more talk page messages would have helped... but that is no reason why the idea of rehabilitiating these users is out of the question. The day Wikipedia becomes hell-bent on creating enemies, and refusing reform, is the day the ethos that drives our project rots to a horrible inferno of self-immolation. Cultivating enemies is suicide for any project. I would please implore you, ladies and gentlemen, to look at the bigger picture. This isn't anything to do with compassion: it is to do with the willingless to permit change. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicholasTurnbull_9d8a.html" title="User:NicholasTurnbull">Nicholas<b>Turnbull</b></a> | <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENicholasTurnbull_45f8.html" title="User talk:NicholasTurnbull">(talk)</a> 02:03, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Nichoals, you can't ignore common sense and you can't ignore the harm that WR inflicted on valued editors. I'm saddned that you go on at such length without touching on these crucial point (as you failed to on IRC, before and after you kicked me), instead you appear to centre on rather legalistic arguments regarding AGF. This <i>is</i> saddening.

<dd>ElC: Please inform me of how I am ignoring common sense. The issue over the actions of Wikipedia Review editors is entirely separate to the matter of the behaviour of people on Wikipedia. The point is those editors might as well edit as anon IPs, but would they still be a "harm" to Wikipedia? We cannot go around judging people's actions outside Wikipedia in order to determine whether they are banned or not here - else we would have an endless witch-hunt of people dredging up each other's private lives in a justification of the other party being blocked (as we get on many RfCs/RfArs). People's activities outside of Wikipedia are frankly immaterial. With regard to "the harm that WR inflicted on valued editors" - WR has been trollish, I agree; but not intrinsically harmful, and as I describe above, external activities are not within our purview - and neither, I might point out, is IRC activity. Regarding "legalistic" arguments, it is the exact opposite that I wished to convey - that policies are negotiable - but when it comes to matter such as good faith I see no reason why it should be suspended. The double standard you refer to in relation to Talrias eludes me; please elaborate further. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicholasTurnbull_9d8a.html" title="User:NicholasTurnbull">Nicholas<b>Turnbull</b></a> | <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENicholasTurnbull_45f8.html" title="User talk:NicholasTurnbull">(talk)</a> 02:18, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Have you <i>seen</i> how many chances both editors have had in their block logs, MSK most particularly? What suggests that this time things will be different? Editors have spent vast quantities of time and emotional resource on these two trolls before, to absolutely no avail. We certainly can take account of actions outside of Wikipedia when the very existence of those actions is conditioned on what happens on Wikipedia. We shouldn't pretend that WR has nothing at all to do with Wikipedia, or that the actions taken there are in any way unrelated to what happens here. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 02:24, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I feel it doesn't really matter whether this time the editors behave differently, provided they're properly watched and hastily rebanned if they renege upon their promise to behave. I see nothing to be lost in so doing, since the moment they misbehave they can be banned again, and any bad contribs rolled back. That's the glorious thing about a wiki: everything, including bans, can be changed on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. Whether events happen as a consequence of Wikipedia or not really makes no difference - it is still not within our sphere of operation. We could otherwise claim that any action relating to Wikipedia that occurred elsewhere could be scrutinised towards a ban, which is frankly incorrect. Wikipedia Review does, in fact, have nothing to do with Wikipedia - the Foundation doesn't run it, and frankly their own little exercise of mutual trollish stimulation on their message board is their own business. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicholasTurnbull_9d8a.html" title="User:NicholasTurnbull">Nicholas<b>Turnbull</b></a> | <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENicholasTurnbull_45f8.html" title="User talk:NicholasTurnbull">(talk)</a> 02:29, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What is lost, clearly, is the time and energy that will, we can presume with near certainty, be spent on watching them, and having to justify to certain groups of people why a troll has been re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-blocked (and that's probably not enough re-s for MSK). What has already been lost is vast quantities of such time and energy (perhaps not yours, thus your enthusiasm to have them around again). If these editors have suddenly become loving little pussycats, they should have absolutely no trouble getting themselves some new usernames. If nothing else, this would demonstrate, quietly and without fanfare, that they are miraculously now dedicated to Wikipedia. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 02:45, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Recently, I have come under considerable controversy for the temporary unblocking of two previously blocked users: Mistress_Selina_Kyle and Blu_Aardvark. This action was supported by some and strongly opposed by others. I will address this issue first.</p>
<p>While I believe that both users are in fact redeemable and able to be brought back into the community, there are those who strongly disagree with me. Some include some of the people that I put the utmost respect in. Others that I have the utmost respect for have supported my efforts. Still more people that I respect have stated that they are indifferent to the situation but wish me the best of luck.</p>
<p>The recent discussion on the admin noticeboard has been one of typical drama. This was expected, although the specific outcome of said drama wasn't totally expected. I feel that there has been some shifting of focus from the discussions of the blocks to SlimVirgin leaving. Before I continue, I will say this right now: I apologize for acting in such a way as to offend people. I'm sorry that my actions have caused harm, however slight, to people. It wasn't my goal or purpose, but apparently it was an unpleasent side effect.</p>
<p>SlimVirgin decided to leave about 7 hours after I posted my intent. Several people have placed responsibility on me, citing my actions as a direct result. To this, I strongly object. My actions were at the most a catalyst or the straw that broke the camel's back. It might have contributed towards her deciding to leave, but I was in no way responsible for her deciding to leave. As a matter of fact, I take no responsibility for her actual action of leaving. Some people have told me to apologize to her, but while I will do so, I feel that this is a matter of people wanting to place the explosion of the gunpowder magazine on a spark.</p>
<p>SlimVirgin: if my actions contributed to your decision to leave Wikipedia, I apologize that it was so, and please take comfort in the fact that I meant no harm. However, if it be your choice to leave, then I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors.</p>

<dd>Sure. These people were involved with Wikipedia Review and either directly or indirectly flung attacks at you. I know how it is to be harassed. As a matter of fact, I've been harassed over Wikipedia in real life. It's stressful, annoying and insulting. I've also been harassed online (an example: a ton of those usernames at Special:Listnames). My experience with being harassed is that when people who have harassed you are willing to make amends, it is in everyone's best interest to give them this chance. That was part of my logic, at least. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinuxbeak_c86a.html" title="User:Linuxbeak">Linuxbeak</a> (drop me a <a href="../../../l/i/n/User_talk%7ELinuxbeak_c40b.html" title="User talk:Linuxbeak">line</a>) 16:05, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>I just want to give Linuxbeak my strong support for being brave enough to be forgiving. None of us really knows whether these two users he unbanned can be remediated, but the only way we'll ever find out is by trying. I'm glad he was willing to try, even though nobody else was.</p>
<p>We all know that <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBLOCK_89b0.html" title="WP:BLOCK">WP:BLOCK</a> insists that blocking is not a punishment, but let's be honest and admit that it is often used as such. I'm very happy to see that at least one admin is willing to follow the spirit and letter of the rules by giving people a second chance.</p>
<p>I <i>am</i> sorry that <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">User:SlimVirgin</a> and <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFloNight_10cf.html" title="User:FloNight">User:FloNight</a> would rather leave than participate in such an effort, but with all due respect, maybe it's all for the the best.

<dd>Al, I think your comments about SlimVirgin and FloNight are unnecessarily inflammatory and off-topic.

<p>I think you've misread my comments, then. I'm not saying that Slim and Flo are horrible people who need to go at any cost. I'm not even saying they're generally bad admins.</p>
<p>All I've said is that they were very wrong to take offense at Linuxbeak's efforts to show forgiveness. I would much rather that they understood and accepted what LB is trying to do. It bothers me very much that they have apparently decided they'd rather give up on the project than accept the fact that LB is acting in good faith and deserves a chance.</p>
<p>In short, if you think my comments are inflammatory, then I guess I wasn't clear enough initially, though I think I've clarified things now. As for being off-topic, I'm not sure how you mean that. As far I can tell, I spoke directly on the topic. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Al</a> 17:48, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have to agree with Alienus's sentiment. I really praise the actions of Linuxbeak. He acted in the true spirit as a bureaucrat to heal the problem and assume good faith, by personally mentoring and recuperate users who made mistakes in the past. If we allow previous good editors to have a try and edit on a contigency basis and it still fails, then they will be re-blocked, and any harm can be undone. So, there is no danger. Since there's little to be lost and much to be gained, there is no reason to oppose this logically--only emotionally and out of a sense of being vindictive. This is what we want to get away from. Indefinte bans mean without a time period set, it does not mean permanent, forever. No one should be banned forever. People change. If any trust was violated it was the trust we owe to Linuxbeak who asked that others trust him. We should do just that. Those who want to punish editors for being bad in the past and threaten to leave if they don't get their way are the ones who are wrong, not those who try to give people a chance to prove themsleves worthy of being a good wikipedian again. We should be an inclusive community that welcomes all potencial good contributors. The potencial is always there and specific acts of wrong doing should be taken care of only as a means to prevent their re-occurance. When there is reason to believe they will not re-occur, there is no reason keep the users banned. They shoould be tested out with a mentorship. This is about forgiving and forgetting and healing. Those who can't let go of the past are the ones that have the problem. I applaude Linuxbeak for his forward thinking and think we should not abandon trust, or hold him responsible for those who can't deal with what wikipedia is really about: writing an encylopedia, not forming a members only elite club of friends.</dd>

<dd>Btw, FloNight has already returned and its just a matter of time before SlimVirgin returns as well. I really don't think SlimVirgin is going away. She seems like a good editor and from my interactions I have no complaints. However, I've had very limited interaction with her so others complaints may be true. I don't know but they are not really relevant in this case. I truly believe that SV is only bluffing, that it's a bit of an emotional outburst, which is a rather rash. I think as soon as she cools down she will be back. This threat of leaving is a well-known phenomenon and it has served a purpose to make her protest known in the strongest terms, and help to get what she wants in the conflict she is having with other admins. I think this is a classic example of this: <a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?GoodBye" class="external free" title="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?GoodBye" rel="nofollow">http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?GoodBye</a> So, SV will be back after a break, and all this posturing blaming LB is not warranted.<a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">Giovanni33</a> 14:08, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Alienus, it sounds just lovely to talk about "being brave enough to be forgiving" and "giving people a second chance". However, there is nothing "brave" about "forgiving" someone who was abusive towards <i>someone else</i>. If I hear about a molested altar boy or his mother forgiving the offending priest, I might be impressed at the courage. If I hear about a bishop forgiving him and giving him another chance, without even consulting his former victims, I do not feel overwhelmed with admiration. And it is extremely inaccurate and misleading to talk about "a second chance" for people who have had second, third, fourth, and fifth chances. And it is nothing less than offensive to imply that the problem is that Slim and Flo are harbouring grudges and don't have thicker skins — <i>especially</i> coming from someone who has already shown (admins can see the deleted edits from KHM03's talk page and from Alienus's talk page as well as Alienus's comments on SimplePilgrim's talk page) that he doesn't have a problem with websites being set up to harass editors. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 09:24, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I support El C's line of reasoning. There is no bigger slap in the face of constructive editors than finding administrators willing to intervene against them, making themselves the tools of vandals like Mistress Selina Kyle. So long as admins act appropriately—protecting constructive editors and showing incompetent and disruptive editors the door—vandals are manageable nuisances. (Personally, I'm mildly amused by the attacks on my edits by the crackpots and LaRouche cultists at Wikipedia Review<a href="http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=924" class="external autonumber" title="http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=924" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>.) The problem only becomes unmanageable when admins fail to play their proper role. Some adminis intervene on behalf of vandals out of mere naivety; worse, others protect vandals because they truly have an affinity for them. As we saw with the lynchmob berating Kelly Martin and Snowspinner last year, there is a large contingent of admins, particularly the teenagers uninterested in content editing, who conceive of Wikipedia in exactly the same manner as users like Mistress Selina Kyle: as an <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_social_networking_websites.html" title="List of social networking websites">social networking site</a>, not an encyclopedia. In the end, these adminis probably cause far greater harm in the project than the vandals themselves. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> | <a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.html" title="User talk:172">Talk</a> 23:27, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<b>An outside opinion</b>. Maybe I should not have posted here – I am not an admin, and I do not have full knowledge of what these banned users had done. However it seems to me that the campaign against LunixBeak grew completely out of proportion to what he did. (Which, at worst, is a courtesy violation of not discussing his unblock with the blocking admin).</p>
<p>I have deep respect for what LunixBeak tried to accomplish. Whatever these banned users did, I believe it is never impossible to make amend (on their part) and forgive (on our part). If LB agreed to supervise/mentor them, I would have given him (and them) a chance. I do not see what big harm it could have done – but I see big potential benefits, including making WP Review a less hostile site.</p>
<p>Finding some offensive comments on WPR and blaming them on these users on the ground that they allegedly own WPR is the same as finding some offensive comments on WP (which I am sure can be found) and blaming them personally on Jimbo as WP site owner.</p>
<p>If I can make a slightly off-topic comment, it seems to me that while WP goes out of the way to give multiple chances to clear vandals (multiple warnings before even short blocks), for controversial editors (those who argue with admins, defend unpopular viewpoints etc), situation can escalate to full ban very quickly. If WP were more forgiving, maybe we would have fewer hate sites? And are we sure that difficult editors would necessarily have negative impact on the articles?</p>
<p>SlimVirgin was probably a very efficient, “no-nonsense” administrator, but it seems to me she was rather eager to use her ‘Block” button. If I had to stand a trial, I would not want her to be my judge! But I wish WP had more admins like LunixBeak. Please, let us not start a witchhunt against him?--Vlad1 01:57, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

You could complain to the Foundation (e.g., Jimbo), or perhaps one of the stewards (not sure about them). On a more technical level, the people who currently hold privileges sufficient to remove operator status from someone are: grunt, sannse, cyrius, Apple, Xirzon, karynn, Linuxbeak, James_F, Raul654, TimStarling, Mark_Ryan, FennecFoxen, DavidGerard, Angela, Essjay, JimboWales, Anthere, Snowspinner, and AdamBishop (all those being their IRC handles, of course, but most of their enwiki identities are pretty obvious).

<dd>For completeness, I have to point out that there are also a number of *closed* irc channels however.

<p>That summarizes my reaction to those Wikipedia Review goons driving out Katefan0, Phaedriel, SlimVirgin, and FloNight, among others. I have to say, allowing those goons onto Wikipedia isn't worth losing those admins, which is why I'm glad that Selina and Blu Aardvark were blocked again. Wikipedia Review has always been a charming cauldron of simmering hatred and resentment, but they've crossed the line. I'm tempted to push for banning everyone on Wikipedia who posts on WR until they ban Brandt from their forum and formally apologize to the Wikipedia community. — <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Philwelch</a> <a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">t</a> 01:29, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I still refuse to accept the proposition that Selina should be punished for not <i>actively</i> suppressing such activities' occurrence on her website. Brandt happens to frequent WR, but he's targeted Wikipedians before he joined it and would continue if banned from it. Compelling editors to take feel-good measures against people on their own websites is too much.
<p>If you want to bring out things that Selina and Blu have actually done <i>themselves</i>, fine. Selina has insinuated that SV isn't actually Jewish and is really a neo-Nazi; when I confronted her (Selina) on IRC with the analogy of saying someone is Hitler because they're a vegetarian, she conceded that I did have a point there. Saying things like that is frankly stupid, but it's not so harmful that it mandates repercussions on Wikipedia itself; note how soundly <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>-offline got shot down. (MSK didn't call SV a cunt, by the way; that was <a href="http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=1536&amp;st=0&amp;p=8358&amp;#entry8358" class="external text" title="http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=1536&amp;st=0&amp;p=8358&amp;#entry8358" rel="nofollow">sgrayban</a>.)</p>
<p>Off-Wikipedia <i>insults</i> are not sufficient to merit action on Wikipedia itself; stalking, harrassment, sure, but not just insults or dubious accusations. Libel, too, might merit action, but do keep in mind that <i>libel</i> is defined quite narrowly: it must be demonstrably false, it can't be clearly cast as an opinion, it must be made either with knowledge that it was false or reckless disregard for whether it was false. Suggesting that SlimVirgin <i>might</i> be a neo-Nazi based on house-of-card logic is ridiculous, but unlikely to be libelous under US law. And frankly, SlimVirgin has made some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image_talk:Anime_by_nima.jpg&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=55687840" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image_talk:Anime_by_nima.jpg&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=55687840" rel="nofollow">rather dubious accusations</a> herself on occasion, to the tune of suggesting a conspiracy on the part of IRC users to support the illegal actions of certain posters at Wikipedia Review.</p>
<p>I would say: when it comes to off-site activity, only ban people for either illegal and Wikipedia-damaging activity, or lawsuits targeted against the Foundation or its contributors. When there's doubt about whether something's illegal, let the alleged perpetrator have the benefit of the doubt. Is this extremely forgiving? Sure. But I think it's the only way to avoid chilling valid criticism of the project and its members. Things like "libel" are, to laymen, far too vague to be applied without great care. —<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimetrical_0dc0.html" title="User:Simetrical">Simetrical</a> (<a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimetrical_7ff0.html" title="User talk:Simetrical">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simetrical_1b33.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simetrical">contribs</a>) 03:10, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Put it this way. A rational person <i>could</i> believe that banning the Wikipedia-haters (i.e., shutting down the forum) would have no effect, because it's plausible they'd go start another forum. That would, if anything, likely be worse than WR, which is run by comparative moderates (i.e., they don't really hate Wikipedia). Therefore, there's no reason to assume that MSK and Blu are in any way endorsing the views of various harrassers and defamers. They may (Blu Aardvark told me something to this effect) believe, in good faith, that banning these people is totally pointless and would accomplish nothing. If that's the case, is it reasonable to ban them indefinitely?
<p>But to be honest, we fundamentally disagree. I'm strongly in favor of free speech as a principle, and I'm strongly against holding people accountable for their associations alone. You object to (quasi-)defamatory statements more than I do, and you judge people by whom they associate with. I think you're being unjust and repressive, you think I'm supporting harrassment and defamation. We're not going to agree, and there's not really any point in continuing this vein. —<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimetrical_0dc0.html" title="User:Simetrical">Simetrical</a> (<a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimetrical_7ff0.html" title="User talk:Simetrical">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simetrical_1b33.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simetrical">contribs</a>) 07:12, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

Back when it was just banned users whining about their bans we could safely ignore them. But what they did to Katefan0 crosses the line. Katefan0 was never controversial, and never did anything to deserve what happened to her. She is the victim of a vindictive attempt to attack Wikipedia itself. So far, no one on Wikipedia Review (and I've read their forums) has denounced this action. At best, they've objected on tactical grounds. Instead, they encouraged Brandt, egging him on to interfere in Kate's life even after she left Wikipedia.</dd>

<dd>I can't believe that we've lost some of our best admins, including SlimVirgin, to this ridiculous situation- it saddens me beyond any measure of believe.</dd>
<dd>However, it doesn't surprise me. Wikipedia is huge- and its getting larger every day. Given the vast number of people that are involved in the project, it's to be expected that disgruntled and off-kilter individuals will create things like the Wikipedia review. That it hasn't happened sooner is a blessing, but now that it HAS happened, it's something that Wiki needs to address.</dd>
<dd>There are people who are advocating ignoring the events that have transpired, claiming the mantra "What happens outside of Wikipedia has no bearing here". However, that's not the case, as is clearly evident in the past few days. The actions of WR have without a doubt had a damaging effect here, and (given that Wiki will continue to grow) this is only the beginning. Unless we can find a way to protect Wiki from the actions of former disgruntled users, more sites like this will pop up, we'll keep losing more and more good admins and the project will suffer immensely. --<a href="../../../t/i/n/Image%7ETinyducksig.jpg_d58b.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/8/85/Tinyducksig.jpg/20px-Tinyducksig.jpg" alt="" width="20" height="17" longdesc="../../../t/i/n/Image%7ETinyducksig.jpg_d58b.html" /></a> <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoom127_c0b1.html" title="User:Doom127">Daniel Davis</a> 03:37, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Silencing critics won't help a thing; If WikipediaReview dies, another will spawn in it's place, until we die off or become the perfect project. However, there is something to be said for that mantra. We have always held the belief true and close that what happens off of Wikipedia (aside from foundation affairs) shouldn't have a bearing here. Many controversial decisions have been made because based on that belief. If there is consensus to extend evidence and such to Off-Wiki interaction (Which there clearly is /not/ at this time, judging by the poll relating to <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>), then let's apply that globally and re-examine major actions taken on these grounds.

In short, we must distinguish between insult and injury. Once we draw this line, we must then <i>completely ignore</i> all actions that are allowed, no matter how much they offend us.</p>
<p>If we fail to do this, then Wikipedia admins will continue to punish people for their constructive (and, yes, sometimes not so constructive) criticisms, which will have a chilling effect on the voluntary contributions of visitors. Remember, we're not paying these editors (or admins), so we have to be gentle with them. People will contribute only to the extent that they believe the system is fair and reasonable. Yes, we can and should stop people from harming Wikipedia, but we can't stop them from criticizing it, however rightly or not.</p>
<p>I say that we must grow thick skins and focus on our true goal, which is to improve Wikipedia, not punish the infidels that dare insult us. More than that, we should filter out the nonsense and listen for valuable suggestions hidden inside the complaints. There is much we do wrong and much that we can do better. And remember, even the <i>perception</i> of unfairness by admins causes harm. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Al</a> 04:30, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Well, then, we're all hosed, because the world is full of people with authority issues (as well as people with a faulty understanding of the purpose of Wikipedia) that will automatically intepret any corrections of their behaviour on Wikipedia as unfair and will start crying like children deprived of their rattles no matter how carefully we try to handle things. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 04:47, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't think the problem lies in regard to Wikipedia critics, nor do I think anyone here is proposing that we "silence the critics". In any kind of an organization or "coming together" of the minds, the words of a critic can be oftentimes crucial in lending an ear to things that need improvement and change. Using that information can lead to improvements and fixes that might otherwise go unheeded. In that way, a site's harshest critics can be one of its strongest assets. In reality problem lies in those who are hell-bent on the destruction of Wiki and/or the volunteers who work on it, and who are actively attempting to destroy the site via intimidation, personal information posting and other such things. And, as my previous post addressed, it needs to be addressed by the Wiki community before it gets worse. These aren't merely people who are critical of the site. --<a href="../../../t/i/n/Image%7ETinyducksig.jpg_d58b.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/8/85/Tinyducksig.jpg/20px-Tinyducksig.jpg" alt="" width="20" height="17" longdesc="../../../t/i/n/Image%7ETinyducksig.jpg_d58b.html" /></a> <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoom127_c0b1.html" title="User:Doom127">Daniel Davis</a> 04:51, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

All I think needs to be said is this: I am a critic of Wikipedia and some of the unpleasant powertripping that passes itself off as interaction here, but I've never felt it necessary to join Nazis in slagging off the Jewish editors nor have I engaged in campaigns of hatred against particular editors. As one of those editors though, I'd be willing to give Blu and Selina another chance on my behalf. I am pretty toughskinned and I know I helped wind them up. I believe Blu feels he is working for the best of Wikipedia and I think Selina's more silly than bad. I don't see why though an editor of the standing of SlimVirgin should be expected to AGF of people who have subjected her several times to abuse that she has found very distressing. This is not a question of "silencing critics" but of protecting good contributors from the depradations of not so good contributors.</p>
<p>I think though that at an absolute minimum Selina should remove posts from her trollboard that contain personal information or harassment of editors here. You cannot be a party to that and claim you want to be a member of this community in good faith. Selina should also consider more strictly moderating the abusive comments on her board. It's possible to criticise Wikipedia, and the contributors to it, constructively, without trying to hurt anybody. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 06:03, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm glad these issues are finally coming to a head as I felt the Gator1 incident passed without the outcry it deserved. We have a username policy that recomends people use their real names when editing here and yet on the other hand I know of admins who have changed their usernames to hide their identity and use g-mail as it doesn't give an originating IP address. There are problems here with nuts who resort to serious real life harrassment of people, their families, and places of work when they feel agrieved. Wikipedia is NOT therapy - these people waste everyone's time and I seriously doubt if the knowledge base of the encyclopedia suffers in the long run from their absence. I also believe in free speech but this is not a license to disrupt - with that freedom comes responsibility. If someone hosts a website that allows personal information or harassment to continue they do not deserve a chance here until they have gone away for a few years and grown up a bit even if they clean it up now. To expect established respected editors to happily work side by side with editors who have harassed them is naive and egalitarian to the point of stupidity. Wikipedia does have problems and criticizing anything - especially admin actions - is liable to cause the editor with the grievence more grief even if they have a valid point. That however is life and if the user is not prepared to work within the system to improve it and worse still resorts to real life hassle of the "offending parties" then they should be banned pure and simple. This is Jimbo's "baby" and real people are suffering for working for him for free - he needs to take the lead on this one. If as been claimed above he personally approved the unblocking of these accounts without consulting the victims of their harssment then I shall follow SV and Flo as I have no wish to be part of some social experiment. <a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESOPHIA_915a.html" title="User:SOPHIA"><font color="purple"><b>Sophia</b></font></a> 07:52, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Good way to put it -- I never really meant it to be exactly so precise when I coined "Wikipedia is not therapy", but in this case, it's quite accurate. Sophia -- Wikipedia has always been, to some degree, a social experiment; trying to get an encyclopedia "anyone can edit" created by a universe that includes a remarkably high number of nasty people is, whether intended or not, an experiment. Me, I think it's likely to fail because of inescapable teen boy cultural bias; as one departed editor told me, there's a limit to the number of times one can tolerate being called a cunt. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 14:39, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Let's be pragmatic for a second. We're here to build an encyclopedia. And the encyclopedia isn't going to be built very well if abusive users are allowed to continue their harrassment of legitimate editors through various unblocks, "mentorships", and chances at rehabilitation. There's a choice to be made here: what do we value more, attempted rehabilitation of bad editors or good editors? I think the correct solution is quite clear. They can't all coexist. You seem to just think this was a simple act of one user calling another a cunt. Not so! It's much more insidious than that.

<p>The interesting thing is that if someone is banned, they <i>can</i> come back, under a different name and agenda. That's what we expect people to do who have a shift in attitude and decide to be constructive. For example, if the guy/gal who originally created "Willy on Wheels" came back, and the first thing they posted was "I am the original Willy—sorry for all of the people I hurt" they would immediately recieve an indef. But if they quietly come back, and lie through the absence of statement, they recieve a welcome mat and everything. I'm wondering if there's a healthy in-between that can be worked out between those two options, because I never like shutting the door on someone forever, yet I don't like seeing people hurt. However, I don't like the idea of giving someone a chance while they still have connections to the WR and hivemind. There's too much of a chance that they are stormtroopers for these groups that have established themselves as malicious organizations out to destroy our free encyclopedia.

<dd>This has been discussed for several days. Most of the opposition I see amounts to (a) lumping Selina and Blu together (which is not fair), and the evidence against Blu himself is, frankly, not all that convincing.

I'm not sure how it in any way condones harassment of her, but Blu nonetheless responsed on WR.</dd>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>...I did not work with FloNight, although (s)he did raise a good question towards me on WP:ANI. I was not intending by that post to encourage Amorrow to continue to harrass MusicalLinguist or other admins. First of all, I had a misconception was that it was amorrow that was being harrassed. And I also have an interest, of a sort, in seeing whether or not admins look at what they are reverting before they revert it. In retrospect, however, I can see that first of all, Amorrow was rightfully banned from Wikipedia, for harrassing and bullying many users. And second of all, my comment was innappropriate to post in that form, and publicly. I do not see a problem with encouraging admins to look before they rollback, but I did not intend to encourage a troll to harras the admins.<a href="http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?s=&amp;showtopic=1550&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=9068" class="external autonumber" title="http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?s=&amp;showtopic=1550&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=9068" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>.</p>

<dd>An indefinite block <b>does</b> equal an indefinite block. According to my dictionary, "indefinite" means "without fixed or exact limits".

<p>Oh, I'm sure Brandt is having a good laugh over this. And I don't give a damn. He's entirely irrelevant. He's reduced to putting a list of admins on a page with <i>*gasp*</i> real names and pictures! And then he tries to blackmail people with that info! Oh no! I'd rather do what is right in the long term for Wikipedia than worry about what some insignificant <i>external</i> factor like Brandt thinks. He doesn't run anything here. What we need to work on is a strict <b>No Quarter</b> policy for trolls. We should never be siding with banned trolls over our fellow administrators, and regrettably, that is sort of what this conflict is turning into. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><span style="color:#ff66ff;cursor:w-resize;"><b>Cyde↔Weys</b></span></a> 13:37, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Whether he intended to do any harm is irrelevent, that he was utterly incapable of thinking through his potential impact of his actions <i>is</i>. "Your Honour, I was just trying to get home fast, I didn't realize that blowing through a red light at 90 mph would cause the deaths of the people in those 3 cars I hit. Besides, Your Honour, they weren't wearing seatbelts so it's their own fault." Yeah, fuck that. (And don't tell me to be civil. Civility is more than not cursing, it is also taking into consideration the potential harm one's actions can cause to others). Quite frankly, Linux definitely needs to be booted as a bueaucrat, and possibly as an admin.

<dd>I often disagree with Zoe, but in this case I'm in complete agreement. I'm appalled that Linux started this off and then when it got hot dropped it in our laps to wait for it to blow over. This shows a disturbing lack of maturity and judgement in a crat. And we must not forget what has happened to Katefan and others during this trying time. And Geni, given Blu's and Selina's vocal support and cooperation with Brandt and related WR editors, it is very much related. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 02:30, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>He may not need them, but we don't need his cheering section either. By inviting them back, Alex endorsed what was done to Kate. He endorsed what they have said about Sarah. Alex's actions amount to endorsement for that behaviour. Simple enough. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 03:16, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The logicaly justifcation for that claim is going to have to be very impressive. From where I am I can't see one. I don't endorse homeopaths. Should I block them from wikipedia?<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 03:19, 31 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Don't be silly. To begin with, you'd have to be unblocking them, and they would have to have been blocked for their venonous homeopathy, and they would have gone from being homeopaths in WP to facilitating homeopaths at WR. After what MSK and BA did over at WR, Alex invited them back, without requiring that they disassociate themselves with what they did and encouraged over at WR. He invited them back, despite their dirty hands, without even asking them to wipe their hands off. So, in effect, he said "your dirty hands are welcome here", and thus, endorsed all that they had done. It would be different if there had been some attempt to rehabilitate themselves. But inviting them back, right after what they had done to Kate, can only be seen as a reward for their misbehaviour - in other words, an endorsement of their actions. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 03:56, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I lack the imagination to play word games and split hairs. They were complicit in what was done to Kate. Alex invited them back fresh from their victory. You can use your imagination to concoct a fantasy scenario in which they took Alex's action as a rebuke, or whatever else you choose to. But imaginative fantasy is no substitute for reality. Alex may just have been incredibly insensitive, he may just have acted with no thought of the consequences, but his actions <i>still</i> amount to a slap in the face to a whole lot of editors, and it <i>still</i> amounts to a reward for what they helped do to Kate. Now, you might think that's a good idea, that they deserve the reward Alex offered them. But that's no reason to try to argue that it wasn't a reward for them and a slap in the face for their victims. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 22:37, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My reaction was due to Linuxbeak's storming out of here like he is the aggrieved party, after all of the damage that was caused by his unilateral actions. If he had even made any attempt at a meaningful apology, and had left because he was sorry for his actions, I would not have responded as I had. But his repeated protestations of innocence and being the victim are nonsense. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 02:44, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Let me add one more thing: I was only tangentially attcked by Amorrow in his various incarnations, nowhere near as much as MusicalLinguist, and have not seen the wrath of Brandt as have others. Having a "thick skin" and being able to take criticism is one thing, and you have to put up with a lot of criticism as an admin on Wikipedia (and in emails). That comes with the territory. But to have your personal life affected by these people goes beyond the pale, and then to have somebody come in and say that he's willing to forgive all of that (even though he, personally, was not affected), is a slap in the face to those who <i>were</i> personally, real-life, affected. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 02:47, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

The apology is arguably understated and inadequate (see my post above about real-life consequences), but here's someone who tried to take some initiative and saw seemingly the whole admin community strike back, including several announcing they were leaving. This editor strikes me more as someone putting his tail between his legs and cowering in a corner than someone trying to laugh off the results.

<dd>Not terribly impressed. An apology like that is, at best, a "I'm right, but I regret that my actions hurt you". It shows no willingness to own up to the fact that he has hurt (and the project) far more than anything I have experienced in my almost two years here. Alex has caused us a huge loss. He won't own up to what he did. He doesn't try to fix the problem. He just leaves in a huff, with his feelings hurt, as if he is the victim here. Don't give me that "We need to stop the bleeding" crap. I haven't seen any evidence that Alex is willing to admit the insult of his actions. Have you ever read the filty at WR? Have you read the stuff that's been written about Slim and Ann and all the rest? People who had a part in that shouldn't be here. How much time did this take that could have been spent writing an encyclopaedia? Any clue how much Slim did to solve problems and defuse crap? The calibre of people we have lost, the energy we have spent here, and cost to morale of this is huge.

<dd>It's funny...politically, I'm a liberal, but I've never been smitten by the bleeding heart bullshit. Given that Linux' fuck-up was caused by a complete inability to think through his actions (and who knows what the underlying causes are), and given his utter refusal to admit that he has caused significant, if not irreparable harm to Wiki, and more importantly to other <i>people</i>, I don't see how anyone can or should be predisposed let him walk off into the sunset for a bit only to return as if nothing happened. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FF2400">•Jim</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#F4C430">62</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">sch•</font></a> 09:26, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Good intentions don't excuse bad results. The admin who started this, and the entire community, need to figure out where the error was and make sure it isn't repeated. "My solution" is to request those that violated policy to acknowledge that they did so, and to acknowledge the consequences or their actions. The "bleeding" is not limited to one admin.

<p>I found an unsubstantiated allegation on <a href="../../../l/e/s/Les_Aspin_335f.html" title="Les Aspin">Les Aspin</a>'s bio. It accuses him of shoplifting while he was Clinton SecDef. There was no source. I removed it per policy. The tidbit was added by an anonymous IP in March. I have not been able to verify it so I removed it. It is disturbing that it could have been up there for that long (and with many subsequent edits) without challenge. I am not sure if Wikipedia Administrators can take any actions that would help cleanse the mirror caches or Goolge searches.</p>

<p>I don't know if there's a speedy deletion criteria for pages created purely for shock value, but Bumfun probably belongs on that list. Basically, the page is only there to show a large picture of two people having anal sex. The image itself is probably a copyvio from some porn site. Two users, User:Meinbratwurst and User:Analcrusader, are responsible for this page. I resized the image down to 4 pixels so it's far less intrusive, but I still think someone should delete the page, protect it, and enforce whatever can be enforced against the creator(s). --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElkman_f6c6.html" title="User:Elkman">Elkman</a> 04:06, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not sure if there is a violation here but Alienus has recently (or at least since I've come back to wikipedia) been posting comments on talk pages of articles such as <a href="../../../h/o/m/Talk%7EHomosexuality_a60b.html" title="Talk:Homosexuality">Homosexuality</a> and <a href="../../../a/b/o/Talk%7EAbortion_3254.html" title="Talk:Abortion">Abortion</a> for different articles loosely related such as <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexual_Agenda_ef52.html" title="Homosexual Agenda">Homosexual Agenda</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Pro-choice.html" title="Pro-choice">Pro-choice</a>. I believe this is in an attempt to tip the scales of the article away from a 50-50 balance to his POV, however I can't prove this. He has also accused me of making POV hot-spots (even though I am trying to maintain a version preceding my arrival at the article and am helping preserve valid points).

<p>The comments are usually pretty neutral "Editors of this article may be interested in the events on pro-choice." however they are posted on articles where (I believe) he feels he'd find a large group of supporters. I think of it as a form of wheel warring myself, but I'm not positive about what the rules say. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChooserr_aa51.html" title="User:Chooserr">Chooserr</a> 05:12, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi. My name is Alienus and Chooserr has chosen to report my actions as an incident <i>instead</i> of talking to me about them. This lack of good faith is disheartening, but the content of his accusations is even worse.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In any case, I'm definitely "guilty" of posting messages on main articles about activity on related articles. For amusement, compare this with Chooserr's practice of sending messages to editors who he hopes will be sympathetic (such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:CovenantD&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=55682367" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:CovenantD&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=55682367" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>]).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think it's entirely reasonable to alert editors to changes that might interest them. If they decide to follow the link, they can then decide for themselves just how to respond, regardless of anything I suggest (and, actually, I rarely suggest anything). Note that this is not any sort of vote-stacking, both because there is no voting involved and because I'm inviting everyone equally.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In short, I'm not violating either the spirit or letter of Wikirules. If anything, I'm doing a good deed by getting more editors involved in these controversial articles to avoid edit-warring.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyhow, I think this whole thing is a non-issue that could have been entirely avoided if Chooserr had assumed good faith and simply messaged me directly. Sorry for the trouble he's caused you. 05:15, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Alienus,</p>
<p>I haven't sent any messages looking for support since I got back, and really don't intend to, however even if I am guilty (these things hang around a long time) that doesn't mean you have to do the same thing...does it? Any way, since you want me to message you directly I will. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChooserr_aa51.html" title="User:Chooserr">Chooserr</a> 06:11, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Oh Aleinus,</p>
<p>That isn't requesting support (he'd already voted against me) I just wanted to make sure that he knew about the subject at hand because it is possible that he didn't look at the talk page recently. Also I hardly expected support from Dcovenent(?). <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChooserr_aa51.html" title="User:Chooserr">Chooserr</a> 06:14, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Repeatedly blanking a section of the article you don't like is vandalism. If you think you can find a better source for the material on proponents of the phrase why don't you find some? That would be the good faith thing to do. Instead you blank a section on proponents of the term leaving only the section on opponents of the term. You also make other very POV changes like changing "analogy" to "false analogy" and changing "phrase" to "propaganda phrase" thus trying to rewrite the article as a POV attack.

As Mr. Lefty says, though, a talk page note (phrased more decorously than that which SqueakBox left) is surely in order; if he didn't make the offending edit, he'll surely be glad to know that he ought to be more careful about signing out when on a computer accessible to others who might be inclined to vandalize. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 22:50, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Not blocking people aeven for a few hours even when they know what a sick term it is for calling others niggers is totally unacceptable in my opinion and I suspect in that of the majority of people.

<p>Racist comments are absolutely sufficiently disruptive for a block. I can't think of anything that is more inflammatory. Maybe give a warning first, but certainly persisting in making such comments in and of itself is enough to block the user. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 15:04, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not an admin, but I agree with SqueakBox and Postdlf.

<p>I find SqueakBox's behavior in this incident actually <i>more</i> offensive than Alexzr's. Alexzr uses a term loaded with negative racial connotations in a benign way, while SqueakBox responds with personal attacks loaded heavily with vitriol directed at a fellow editor of wikipedia. What makes "stinking racist scumbag" more acceptable than "nigger"? I'm not saying using the n-word should be tolerated. It can cause offense to people even if it's not intentional or directed against someone, but I find the personal attacks more offensive. SqueakBox, consider this a warning. -<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_sig_226e.html" title="User:Lethe/sig">lethe</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_sig_fced.html" title="User talk:Lethe/sig">talk</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" rel="nofollow">+</a></sup> 15:17, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In the last 24 hours, <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChooserr_aa51.html" title="User:Chooserr">User:Chooserr</a> has filed an incident report on me in bad faith and has encouraged another user to file a bogus 3RR violation report on me. Now, he's been violating the consensus on <a href="../../../c/o/n/Condom.html" title="Condom">condom</a> and leaving dishonest edit messages.</p>
<p>If you take a look <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Condom&amp;diff=55846249&amp;oldid=55797065" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Condom&amp;diff=55846249&amp;oldid=55797065" rel="nofollow">here</a>, you'll see that this Roman Catholic opponent of condom use has modified the text against consensus to make condoms seem riskier. His first edit comment was blank, while his second misleading claimed to be "rvv". There has been no vandalism, just a few editors who happen not to agree with him.</p>
<p>Any of these incidents on its own would be annoying, but his pattern of edits as of late has been, well, obnoxious. It is my understanding that Wikirules require us to leave honest edit comments, and Chooserr has clearly failed to do this. His bogus report also violated <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> and wasted the time of admins.</p>
<p>I'm not asking for a block, although I wouldn't argue against one. I'm asking that he be warned about his behavior and discouraged from continuing it. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Al</a> 02:12, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is a content dispute. From the relevant talk page, it appears that you two are talking, so hopefully you can reach a suitable compromise. You may find it useful to find a <a href="../../../t/h/i/Wikipedia%7EThird_opinion_ae73.html" title="Wikipedia:Third opinion">third opinion</a> about the matter at hand but at this moment this does not require administrator intervention. <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsopropyl_2165.html" title="User:Isopropyl">Isopropyl</a> 02:20, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>With all due respect, it's not a content dispute. Rather, it's a pattern of behavior that violates wikipedia rules. I can handle content disputes just fine, but he's gotten the admins involved twice so far, and he's likely to do it again.</dd>
<dd>In short, even if you're not going to even give him a warning about <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> and misleading edit comments, I'm glad I put this out here for the record.

<dd>Well I suppose that I'm being talked about again, so I'll just make a quick reply. I haven't trying to make condoms seem riskier than they are just mention the chance of failure up front. I did not file a false report against Alienus, or encourage anyone else to do so (please give me some proof otherwise). Besides that I've been using "rw" for R[e]W[rite] for a very long time. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChooserr_aa51.html" title="User:Chooserr">Chooserr</a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_Vatican_City.svg_caee.html" class="image" title="&lt;no wiki&gt;&lt;/no wiki&gt;"><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/0/00/Flag_of_the_Vatican_City.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_Vatican_City.svg.png" alt="&lt;no wiki&gt;&lt;/no wiki&gt;" width="25" height="25" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_Vatican_City.svg_caee.html" /></a> 08:33, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Here's the false report: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents#Alienus" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents#Alienus" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents#Alienus</a></dd>
<dd>Here's the false 3RR report by your buddy: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR#User:Alienus_reported_by_User:CovenantD" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR#User:Alienus_reported_by_User:CovenantD" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR#User:Alienus_reported_by_User:CovenantD</a></dd>
<dd>I think that's entirely clear. As for "rvv" using "rw", the two look almost identical in the default font, so it's an unwise choice. It's also no excuse for making major changes to an article without even a meaningful summary.</dd>
<dd>On top of that, you've started an edit war with me over <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexual_agenda.html" title="Homosexual agenda">homosexual agenda</a>, and you admit to intentionally edit-warring: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Alienus#Pay_attention_and_don.27t_make_accusations" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Alienus#Pay_attention_and_don.27t_make_accusations" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Alienus#Pay_attention_and_don.27t_make_accusations</a></dd>

<dd>Can I suggest you both stop clogging up this noticeboard, stick to your talk pages and start an RfC if necessary? Chooser began this public spat and I can understand Al's need to set the story straight but I think this approach is counter productive to both editors and an unsympathetic admin could decide you both need a cooling off break. <a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESOPHIA_915a.html" title="User:SOPHIA"><font color="purple"><b>Sophia</b></font></a> 08:47, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Endorse.

Using a sock to get around the ArbCom restrictions would seem to suggest that he has no intention of ever following our policies. I note that Lou has fewer than 100 article space edits, all but one to <a href="../../../s/o/c/Societal_attitudes_towards_homosexuality.html" title="Societal attitudes towards homosexuality">Societal attitudes towards homosexuality</a>. (One was to <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_troll.html" title="Internet troll">Internet troll</a>; go figure).

<p><b>Comment</b>: I believe Lou is a good example of <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/MPOV" class="extiw" title="m:MPOV">m:MPOV</a>. Here's my analysis of how he stacks up to MPOV:</p>
<table class="wikitable" style="text-align:left">
<tr>
<th>MPOV item</th>
<th>Lou franklin's behavior</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>You know you're acting in good faith, but assume many others involved are acting in bad faith.</td>
<td>Guilty. He thinks that editors opposing him are homosexual.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>You believe that all other versions of the article are biased.</td>
<td>Guilty. He often refers to edits opposing his view as "vandalism".</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>You refer to your preferred version as the "NPOV version" in edit summaries.</td>
<td>Not guilty ostensibly, although he repeatedly uses words like "propoganda," "advocacy," "bias," etc. to justify his reverts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>You believe it is necessary for you to revert the article more than three times a day.</td>
<td>Guilty. He believes that 3RR doesn't apply to the {{<a href="../../../n/p/o/Template%7ENPOV_75c8.html" title="Template:NPOV">NPOV</a>}} tag.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>You accuse others of conspiring to produce a bad version of the article.</td>
<td>Guilty. As above, he thinks there is a "gay cabal" behind the SATH article.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The other editors say you act as though the article is somehow yours.</td>
<td>Guilty. Lf has been described as "stubborn" and has even openly admitted this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>You threaten to quit Wikipedia for good if you don't get your way — yet you don't actually leave.</td>
<td>Not guilty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Upon reading this list, you are convinced that most of the people you deal with are suffering from MPOV.</td>
<td>Guilty. When he was introduced to the MPOV article, his first reaction was to ask whether the article was controlled by gay editors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Accusing others of forming a cabal or conspiring against you.</td>
<td>Guilty. As above.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Being dragged in front of the Arbitration Committee and beaten with a cluestick.</td>
<td>Guilty. That's exactly what happened when the ArbCom banned him from editing SATH.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Accusing the Arbitration Committee of pursuing a vendetta against you.</td>
<td>Not guilty ostensibly, although he has referred to the decision as "dereliction of duty" from the top.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Launching an arbcom case against the Arbitration Committee.</td>
<td>Not guilty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Producing a website solely and exclusively about the evils of Wikipedia.</td>

<p>I want to report a serious incident. While checking in my watchlist the changes made in external links, my computer became infected with VBS Malware (Script). What happened ? When adding an external link to an article one adds first (between brackets) the url of the site , then a blank space, and then the description of the url. A vandal switched the url with another url with an inconspicuous name, but leaving the description unchanged. When checking this change, this new url proved to be a sex site, that immediately tried to take control of my computer. By breaking off the internet connection at once (the only thing I could do because my computer didn’t react any more otherwise), I could minimize the damage but it took still more than two hours to clean up my computer. Off course, I gave the vandal User:194.22.238.192 an indefinite block. Luckily, I KNEW a change had been made and could react quickly, but an unsuspecting viewer would only see the description of the (original) url and would not suspect foul play.</p>
<p>I don’t know if this has happened ever before, but this is serious enough to warrant our attention to this problem : Wikipedia can infect our computers with a virus through an (innocent looking) external link. This is reason enough for us all to be double alert and certainly check all changes to the external links of the articles in our watchlist. But then I wonder, how many of such malicious changes would remain unnoticed ? I think we have a serious problem at hand. <a href="../../../j/o/j/User%7EJoJan_2b10.html" title="User:JoJan">JoJan</a> 15:44, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

Jeff asserts that Luo blanked a section without discussion (at 14:50 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falun_Gong&amp;diff=49664438&amp;oldid=49664144" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falun_Gong&amp;diff=49664438&amp;oldid=49664144" rel="nofollow">[36]</a>), which Jeff reverted as as a vandalist act (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falun_Gong&amp;diff=49665699&amp;oldid=49664438" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falun_Gong&amp;diff=49665699&amp;oldid=49664438" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>). Luo eventually did post on Talk over the disputed section, but this was at 15:26 (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Falun_Gong&amp;diff=49669547&amp;oldid=49667368" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Falun_Gong&amp;diff=49669547&amp;oldid=49667368" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>), well after the edit war between himself and Jeff had started. So... it occurs that Jeff has a point to say that blanking without comment is vandalism, especially on a controversial article. Up until such time as Luo decided to accede to starting a talk page discussion, his blanking could be considered vandalism, the reversion of which is not considered reversion for the purposes of <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>.

<dd>Because Jeff has refused to drop this since it happened. A month ago he made a request for an advocate in the matter, which was rejected by Mahogany on the grounds that, if I may oversimplify, I was right, and it has apparently now been picked up at last by Keith.</dd>
<dd>There was a content dispute on <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falun_Gong_9fb1.html" title="Falun Gong">Falun Gong</a> in which both Samuel and Jeff violated 3RR and were blocked by me for an hour each to cool down. Jeff claimed that because Samuel was removing a section of an article, his edits came under the definition of 'blanking vandalism'. I reject this defence. Samuel is not a vandal, he has never been a vandal, and he was removing that section in good faith (whether he was 'right' is something entirely different, and something I, as an administrator, do not pass judgement on - the fact that he was remiss in providing a full explanation does not mean he was acting in bad faith either). The reason the block was only for an hour was because I thought Jeff did honestly believe that his side of the edit war was exempt from 3RR - and I couldn't very well give Jeff 1 hour and Samuel 12 or 24.</dd>
<dd>I will not accept the claim that no-one may remove a section of an article without being accused of vandalism. Ever. If you have any more questions, Keith, ask me on my talk page. I did not submit the block for review on any of the admin noticeboards. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 23:12, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Mahogany mis-handled the matter and shouldn't have been involved as an advocate if he couldn't <i>advocate</i> for Jeff. At this point I agree it is mostly a moot issue. I wonder though if a one-hour page protect wouldn't have provided the same result as the one-hour punitive action without any additional fallout?

<dd>Why would anyone think a Word file constitutes a reliable source? Though the one given has footnotes, none of them are actual sources. This file seems to have been produced for a language class. It's not presented for being accurate history, but as a reading exercise. A Word file is a rather extreme case of "self-published", and we don't accept even self-published <i>books</i> as sources. (The Florescu book is...how shall we say... not terribly scholarly, as well, put at least it cites an occasional document.... ). The Russian text of the Word document obviously is taken from <i>somewhere</i> rather than generated by the teacher (It's attributed to Efrosin, a monk in the Kirillo-Beloozerskii monastery and dated 1486 to 1490 AD). Find out where that <i>somewhere</i> is, and you'd have a decent reference to include. Of course, it would hardly represent recent research! - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 22:09, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>Could someone talk to this user please? She/he has a serious problem with incivility. Take a look at the <a href="../../../h/a/l/Talk%7EHalle_Berry_908d.html#Can_anyone_source_this_section.3F" title="Talk:Halle Berry">Halle Berry talk page</a>.

<dd>I don't think an indefinite block is appropriate. Were the user being disruptive passim or serving, in general, as deleterious, such a block would be in order; here, the user appears to contribute valuably and substantively (a mitigating factor), and, even as the user has been <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">incivil</a>, such incivility appears limited to interactions with a few users and apropos of one article. To be sure, a brief block, in order that the user might <a href="../../../c/o/o/WP%7ECOOL_e649.html" title="WP:COOL">cool off</a> and properly apprise him/herself of our user conduct policies and guidelines, is appropriate, but anything more, in the absence of further disruptive behavior, would seem unnecessary. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 03:48, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've been noticing that a user (or group of users) has been spamming links into various articles on <a href="../../../m/m/o/MMORPG_6790.html" title="MMORPG">MMORPGs</a> for their website, "IGSKY.com". It hasn't been constant, but the intermittent insertion of the advertisement into the external links section is annoying and probably illegal in terms of the games' companies' end user agreement. I recently assisted in getting an actual article for the website deleted, but after seeing the MascotGuy page, I realized that a similar action can be taken against this user. As of now, he's only used sockpuppet IPs in various articles, that have been blocked before. The situation hasn't occured within a few weeks, but such an extended line of vandalizations should require some action against him. Below is a list of some of the more recent IPs and the official user name this person has used. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryulong</a> 05:07, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

To avoid another possible block for 3RR homey promised to avoid tendatious edit warring on these same articles, yet as soon as he was unblocked for another offense he immediatly recommenced these same actions. He also has improperly blocked another user for a conflict that he was the main participant in. All of this is just the tip of the iceberg for an editor who seems to have gone on a rampage.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 05:59, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Moshe is engaging in the logical fallacy of attacking the messenger. He is criticising me for having taken action against another editor who I was in a conflict in when he violated his probation (another admin subsequently banned this editor for the violation). Now he is criticising me for *not* taking action against an editor I'm in a conflict in but instead presenting admins with the evidence and asking someone else to act if he or she sees fit. In other words, Moshe damns me if I do and he damns me if I do not.</p>
<p>In any case, the operative issue is Humus' edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apartheid_%28disambiguation%29&amp;curid=5330414&amp;diff=56077011&amp;oldid=56073750" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apartheid_%28disambiguation%29&amp;curid=5330414&amp;diff=56077011&amp;oldid=56073750" rel="nofollow">here</a>. If admins consider this edit to be non-tendentious then fine. If admins consider it to be tendentious then action should be taken. I do not wish to take action myself as I might be seen as being subjective so I'm asking for other admins to examine the edit and make their own judgement and take any needed action whether that be reverting the edit, warning Humus or whatever is deemed necessary.

<dd>Jaret, there was an attempt to resolve the edit dispute by using talk and by using a snad box. Instead of participating Homey violated 3RR (5 reverts), blocked other editor who disgaree with him (twice) , used sources which do not fit <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and whenother editors changed one of his 45 edits (in one day) he reverted tham accused them of "Vandalsim" nad tried to have them blocked.

<dd>It is an IP shared by students at <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newington_College_17c1.html" title="Newington College">Newington College</a> (it is actually a boys school K-12, not a college). Out of dozens of edits, I only found a couple that are not vandalism. I think the good edits may have been a fluke, as every single other diff I check is vandalism. The IP isn't very active, though. It has at most about 6 edits a day and does not edit every day. Therefore, I think only a longterm block would be noticed. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 09:50, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay, I've tried to explain fair use as best I can, but he just doesn't seem to get it.

<p>Indefinitely blocked user Rgulerdem has come back to edit the "Wikiethics" proposal that is currently in his subuser page User:Rgulerdem/Wikiethics. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott">Netscott</a> had put a rejected tag on it about six days ago. Then an IP user removed it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ARgulerdem%2FWikiethics&amp;diff=56081673&amp;oldid=55037010" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ARgulerdem%2FWikiethics&amp;diff=56081673&amp;oldid=55037010" rel="nofollow">[50]</a> and added a proposal box <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ARgulerdem%2FWikiethics&amp;diff=56081785&amp;oldid=56081673" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ARgulerdem%2FWikiethics&amp;diff=56081785&amp;oldid=56081673" rel="nofollow">[51]</a>. <a href="../../../a/k/m/User%7EAKMask_da48.html" title="User:AKMask">AKMask</a> restored the tag <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ARgulerdem%2FWikiethics&amp;diff=56091844&amp;oldid=56081785" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ARgulerdem%2FWikiethics&amp;diff=56091844&amp;oldid=56081785" rel="nofollow">[52]</a> and then another IP user reverted him <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ARgulerdem%2FWikiethics&amp;diff=56112711&amp;oldid=56091844" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ARgulerdem%2FWikiethics&amp;diff=56112711&amp;oldid=56091844" rel="nofollow">[53]</a> saying "Please do not revert on my user page - at least here." The IP addresses used are from the 216.248.***.*** range, the University of Iowa IPs that Rgulerdem has used on several occasions. So I figured I'd report this and ask: can we consider this subuser page as a Miscellany for Deletion? It is a rejected proposal that waas almost completely worked on by Rgulerdem. Now that he is banned, should this stay? It only gives him a reason to come back and edit, as he did today. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 12:53, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, it can be considered at MfD. If it serves no purpose but to attract banned users, then it may be speedied; banned users are not entitled to a userspace. If disruptive editing continues from this range, then an abuse complaint (see <a href="../../../a/b/u/WP%7EABUSE_39ee.html" title="WP:ABUSE">WP:ABUSE</a>) to the University of Iowa would be appropriate, and should clear up the problem immediately. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <font color="#7B68EE">(<small><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">Talk</font></a> • <font color="#7B68EE">Connect</font></small>)</font></span> 13:26, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>Well, I hace confessed to vandalizing for the past several months, and for permanently scarring my reputation. I want to state now that Tex's contention that I haven't left is entirely false, I only came back on the 23rd to voice my opinion against RobChurch, and his RfA. Well, my attack: I am sorry for being the CIyde vandal and for my attacks on John Reid. I am sorry that I came here, stressing myself, and others out. To further emphasize this, I did create an account with the intention of it being constructive after a three month long meltdown. Hopefully, I will be able to edit constructively, and I am sorry for all the trouble I cause. Yes, people reform, and to be honest, the point of the vandalism was to attract attention to what I see as incivility, and the reasons several of my friends have left here. But vandalism is vandalism, so I better quit before I get in trouble. I am sorry I was ever apart of the project. I DONT want to be a Brian Chase. But, at least I did edit here constructively for a year and three months before I went haywire.<a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#000000"><i><b>ε</b></i></font></a><a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncyclopedist_b147.html" title="User:Encyclopedist"><font color="#000000"><b>γκυκλοπ</b></font></a><a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncyclopedist_baa9.html" title="User talk:Encyclopedist"><font color="#808080"><b>αίδεια</b></font></a><a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia"><font color="#808080"><b>*</b></font></a>14:34, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
