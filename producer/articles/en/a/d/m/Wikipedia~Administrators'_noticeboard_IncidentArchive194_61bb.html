<li>Indeed. Radiant appears to be engaged in a good faith effort to reduce the Byzantine complexity of our rule base. More power to his elbow.

<li>Funny, I see Radiant as being engaged in an effort to simply force his view of the project on everything, regardless of whether consensus exists or not. Whether I agree with your (or his) intents here is irrelevant - those seeking the change have not made even the slightest bit of effort to gain consensus, and that's a major problem. Unless consensus is being abandoned along with everything else here. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 02:57, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>That's interesting, as I would describe Radiant's efforts as moving in exactly the opposite direction, increasing the redunancy and complexity of the rule base, coupled with an obsessively bureaucratic attitude that strikes me as surprising and disappointing. Further, the comments here alone demonstrate an unhelpful personalization of this conflict on the part of both parties. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 06:23, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>And there we have the problem: I am quite willing to discuss this, but Jeff is more interested in making derogatory remarks than in actual discussion, as should be obvious from his comments here. That is precisely why mediation didn't work out. Last week, Jeff stated that he would basically continue his harassment until I gave in regarding the underlying issue. As long as he keeps up this destructive approach, I don't really see this debate going anywhere. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 11:31, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Kind of have to agree with Peter here. Look, both of you have been around for a while. You know enough about how this place works to sort this out yourselves without kicking off more pointless wikidrama. No one seems to be assuming much in the way of good faith, which might be a good start. You both have the best interests of the project at heart: bear that in mind and work from there.

<li>There has not been a single moment where you've shown any willingess to discuss anything, Radiant.

<li>You've said that you want to distance yourself from your past at Encyclopedia Dramatica, but ironically your edit patterns with respect to this issue are quite similar to those associated with ED. For instance, making allegations about the issue but not substantiating them, denying facts because "you don't see them that way", persistenyl attacking the people who disagree with you, and forum shopping are all indicative of wikidrama. I just said that I was willing to discuss if you would lay off the harassment; you respond by denying that I want to discuss, and adding a personal attack.

<p>Part of the problem is that editing and getting change to happen on policy and guideline pages is so slow. That is as it should be, but something does need to be done about the complexity of the existing set of pages. If anything, I would suggest that Radiant (and maybe jeff if he wants to) draws up an overall plan, and identifies key pages that need working on, and more discussion. Maybe we could even set up a way to have a permanent&#160;!vote disucssion page for policies and guidelines, so it is clearer at a glance how consensus is changing from one month to the next. People who read the page and talk page and agree to it, can 'sign up' to it, and those that have concerns can address them. If people later feel the page has changed, they can come back and recast their&#160;!vote. Kind of like an indefinite, open-ended RfC on the consensus status of the page, with subsections for specific changes. The talk page would be used for discussing changes to wording, and things like that. Keeping the&#160;!vote disucssions open indefinitely would avoid a small group coming along and changing things, but would make clear if consensus really is changing. Would anything like this work, or would it go too much against the spirit of 'voting is evil'? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 12:31, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That might not hurt, but you've reached the crux of the argument - consensus. I'm not opposed at all to the slow burn of the way policies/guidelines evolve, because it assures us that consensus is being reached. It's why I originally reverted the change, and continue to implore Radiant to actually discuss this on the talk page, which he's failed to do. If there's no consensus for such a change, we shouldn't be making it. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 12:43, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>We have RFC/Policy and we have the <a href="../../../v/p/p/WP%7EVPP_9f2a.html" title="WP:VPP">WP:VPP</a>. The main problem appears to be that Jeff is working under a different definition of "consensus" than most of us; his definition appears to boil down to "if he disagrees with something, there can not be a consensus". Similarly, he has the habit of citing "consensus can change" if he wants to ignore precedent, and claiming "we need consensus for changes to the long-standing version" if he likes the precedent.</li>
<li>The WP:BIO/WP:MUSIC issue boils down to Jeff making a sweeping change to a page stable for over a month, and demanding consensus from the people who disagree with his change, because he claims there was no consensus for the stable version. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 12:40, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The WP:BIO/WP:MUSIC issue boils down to w.marsh making a sweeping change to a page stable for years, and not discussing it on the talk page.

Many have agreed that we need consensus for such a massive change, only one person is ignoring consensus in order to implement a preferred version. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 12:43, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

An entire range of IPs was blocked in the Cplot incident, so maybe the same can be done here.

<li>I really need to make a template explaining to people what a negative Checkuser results shows. When it says "No IP evidence" it means exactly that: there the editors in question have not used the same or closely related IP within the period under examination. It means, "no, checkuser does not prove sockpuppetry". It does not in any way disprove sockpuppetry. Checkuser is a useful tool for <i>proving</i> sockpuppetry. Not the opposite. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><sup><small><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a></small></sup> 04:53, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Technical means are a supplement to the decision process, they're not conclusive. What you've got is an IP address, you have no indication of what is behind that address. I happen to know that the address that I'm on at the moment has some 300,000 possible people behind it, the argument that Jefferson and Frater have used in the past. Equally the IP gateway that I'm behind is located some 200 miles away from my present location and provides service to the entire UK. My home IP address is located about 10 miles from my current geographic location and I could edit from it within about 20 minutes of leaving work.</dd>
<dd>Equally it is possible to work through two geographically discrete IP addresses from the same physical location. In the space of about 10 metres I have choices of the address visible through this edit and several other systems, one of which would give me an address on a different continent and 8 times zones away.</dd>
<dd>It depends on how the Secure Managed Interfaces are configured as to how much information you can get from them about what's behind.</dd>
<dd>The point is, a technical check supports other evidence, which is why the SSP case emphasises behaviour and style.</dd>

<p>Hi, I am having real problems with a Vandal or a group of Vandals who keep deleting, reverting and changing things on the article. The things they keep deleting are refrences and verifiable facts.

<dd>I see it has been fully protected. In anticipation of your next question, you will not be able to edit it until it has been unprotected, even though I know you feel the wrong version has been protected. What you are supposed to do now is try to engage the other parties in a discussion on the article talk page and reach an agreement on the contents of the page. However, my guess is the anon ip's will not discuss. If that proves to be the case, you can ask for the page to be semi-protected and at least the anon ip's will not be able to edit war with you. --<a href="../../../i/d/e/User%7EIdeogram_de1d.html" title="User:Ideogram">Ideogram</a> 14:38, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It's always <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/The_Wrong_Version" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/The_Wrong_Version" rel="nofollow">the wrong version</a>... Just an FYI, semi-protection is only to stop ongoing pure vandalism to an article from many IPs. It should <b>never</b> be used in an edit war between a registered editor and IPs because doing is basically just penalizing one side of an edit war. The idea of protection is to make both sides step back and discuss changes before making changes.

<p>Iamaacountname and anonymous user User:80.41.86.208 have engaged in a "more advanced" form of vandalism of the article for <a href="../../../f/a/l/Fallibroome_High_School_81bc.html" title="Fallibroome High School">Fallibroome High School</a>. In short. The anon user first vandalised the article, then Iamaacountname appeared to revert it, but <b>at the same time</b> as this, introduced a new incidence of vandalism to the account. This second vandalism could not have been done in good faith, since it involved uploading a new photo with which to replace the school shield, which was done by Iamaacountname just prior to the apparent reversal of vandalism. The photo appears to be solely constructed to be used in some vandalism attempts, and the non-anon user's only account activity is to vandalise <a href="../../../f/a/l/Fallibroome_High_School_81bc.html" title="Fallibroome High School">Fallibroome High School</a> and upload this photo.</p>
<p>I corrected the entire vandalism, and placed notices about warning them of their blatant vandalism on their respective talk pages. This has resulted in this anonymous user (User:80.41.86.208) replacing my talk page with one million digits of pi. The non-anon user has not had any retaliatory action taken against their pages by this anon user.</p>
<p>I wonder if (a) both the user and anon-address should be immediately blocked, and (b) whether the image should be immediately deleted. I did try to go through the correct process to ask for deletion of the image, but the reason did not appear, so i have included it on the image's talk page. I also wonder if my talk page can be protected? I had to protect my user page from very similar retaliatory action after I corrected previosu vandalism of this article page. I could not see how this kind of vandalism should be reported except by a message here, and my apologies if it is in the wrong place. <a href="../../../d/d/s/User%7EDdstretch_3ca8.html" title="User:Ddstretch"><span style="border:1px solid DarkGreen;padding:1px;"><font style="color:White;background:DarkGreen" size="0">&#160;DDStretch&#160;</font></span></a>&#160;<a href="../../../d/d/s/User_talk%7EDdstretch_65ba.html" title="User talk:Ddstretch"><font color="DarkGreen" size="0">(talk)</font></a> 18:43, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is more of a question or a request for clarification than anything. Has the policy at AIV changed significantly in the last few months? I reported this obvious vandalism-only account Jwgray (<a href="../../../j/w/g/User_talk%7EJwgray_db7a.html" title="User talk:Jwgray">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jwgray_4b4b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jwgray">contribs</a>). Three edits and all of them are pretty clearly some kid. The listing was deleted with edit summary "hasn't been warned sufficiently and hasn't edited in three hours". I've reported blatant vandalism-only accounts there in the past, but it seems like all of a sudden folks are refusing to block based on circumstances.</p>
<p>It seems silly that an obvious vandalism-only account can't be blocked simply because of "insufficient warnings". Can't admins make a judgement call and block accounts that are obviously out to casually vandalize the project and provide nothing helpful? I really don't think any of these edits <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Jwgray" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Jwgray" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> could be thought of any anyone as "mistakes" or in good faith, and I doubt that there are very many people out there who would bother to do this kind of thing without understanding that it's wrong. Any thoughts? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheQuandry_2564.html" title="User:TheQuandry">TheQuandry</a> 19:24, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think it varies from person to person. Personally, I wouldn't hesitate to block someone regardless of the warnings if the infraction is so atrocious (for example, I've blocked a couple of harassment accounts posting to someone's talk page without so much as dropping them a line, just a block-on-sight). <a href="../../../e/v/u/User%7EEVula_5373.html" title="User:EVula">EVula</a> <span style="color: #999;">// <a href="../../../e/v/u/User_talk%7EEVula_6eaa.html" title="User talk:EVula">talk</a> // <a href="../../../e/v/u/User%7EEVula_admin_63be.html" title="User:EVula/admin"><span style="color: #366;">☯</span></a> //</span> 20:03, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>O hail, mighty Administrators-</p>
<p>In lurking on Wikipedia, I came across an Article on a current TV show, in which is stated: "Downloadable episodes are available for purchase at the iTunes Store".</p>
<p>Given the popularity of iTunes, I wasn't bold enough to delete it peremptorily, without first checking with Your Majesties to see if such a commercial notation is indeed proscribed.

<li>You give no actual evidence of stalking, just of two articles that apparently both of you have edited. Contribs logs are public for good reason, and even if he had looked through your contribs (which is not a given; you'd be amazed at the amount of stuff some people have on their watchlist) that isn't necessarily bad. For instance, in the Jester case, he appears to remove a non-standard header, in that most articles don't start with a "description" header; is that problematic? Is that an attempt to improveme of the encyclopedia, or an action made solely to annoy you? <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAITH_32f0.html" title="WP:FAITH">WP:FAITH</a> suggests the former. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 12:38, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

I also tried to tidy the article whilst I was threr. Why did Friday then go to that page and revert my edit?

<p>I'm actually at a loss as to what to do about Light current. He's obviously a very intelligent person, but his inability – feigned or genuine – to respond to any sort of criticism in a productive way is poisoning his ability to participate in Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Gentle suggestions, polite reminders, and detailed explanations of why his behaviour is problematic have all failed, repeatedly. His response to any such advice is almost always rudeness (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Light_current&amp;diff=105068553&amp;oldid=105064887" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Light_current&amp;diff=105068553&amp;oldid=105064887" rel="nofollow"><i>rm less than useless post</i></a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Light_current&amp;diff=104941748&amp;oldid=104941331" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Light_current&amp;diff=104941748&amp;oldid=104941331" rel="nofollow"><i>rm noise</i></a>) often with a dash of I-dare-you-to-block-me-so-I-can-cry-admin-abuse-again thrown in for good measure: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Light_current&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=104948298" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Light_current&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=104948298" rel="nofollow">"Gonna block me again?"</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Light_current&amp;diff=104949905&amp;oldid=104949336" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Light_current&amp;diff=104949905&amp;oldid=104949336" rel="nofollow">"Why so impatient my furry friend?"</a>.</p>

<p>A word of caution; Light current takes a very active hand in the maintenance of <a href="../../../l/i/g/User_talk%7ELight_current_53e6.html" title="User talk:Light current">User talk:Light current</a> (check out that history tab) and it may be rather difficult to follow the conversations there. While he does not alter anyone's signed remarks, he does freely rearrange comments and delete remarks that he doesn't like. While it is probably permissible for him to do so, it may give the casual reader a somewhat skewed perspective of what conversation actually took place.</p>

<dd>Since persuasion hasn't worked, the remaining option is coercion. Various forms of coercion are available, such as civility parole, revert parole and general probation. They <i>could</i> conceivably be applied by community (admin) consensus, but I'm sure Light Current would not respect that. So that leaves us with arbitration, which <i>can</i> apply those coercive remedies. Arbitration would also give Light Current a chance to contest the blocks he thinks were inappropriate. I'm not sure that the case wouldn't turn into a train wreck, but I don't see the (admin) community being able to apply any useful remedies, short of a permanent ban, which seems much too drastic at this point. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 16:04, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You seem to be assuming that admin comments are biased, LC; that in itself is an assumption of bad faith. Ok, here's a non-admin observation. Your talk page has been on my watchlist since November 6, when you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Saddam_Hussein&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=86148990" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Saddam_Hussein&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=86148990" rel="nofollow">dumped</a> an off-topic debate onto <a href="../../../s/a/d/Talk%7ESaddam_Hussein_b739.html" title="Talk:Saddam Hussein">Talk:Saddam Hussein</a>. I reverted it; you reinstated it. I went to your <a href="../../../l/i/g/User_talk%7ELight_current_archive8_39e1.html#Why_did_you_move_that_debate_to_Talk:Saddam_Hussein.3F" title="User talk:Light current/archive8">talk page</a> to explain to you why I was deleting it. Your response was aggressively argumentative. I've been looking in on your talk page from time to time since then, and I'm at a loss to understand the situation. It literally does not seem to ever occur to you that you might be wrong and that someone else might have a valid point. What I see here is a textbook case of <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAN_eb66.html#Community_ban" title="WP:BAN">exhausting the community's patience</a>.

<dd>Read the whole thread, please, and don't think of this as a debate in which you are trying to score points. Think of it as an adult conversation in which the community is trying to show you how you are repeatedly going wrong. A few points to consider about that particular situation: What makes you think that everyone on Wikipedia knows what "RD" means? And what made you so utterly sure of your position that you continued to argue it after I removed the thread dump twice, then repeatedly explained to you that off-topic talk page postings could and should be deleted? You were so focused on your perspective (moving a thread from the reference desk) that you found it literally impossible to consider that the person you were talking to might have a valid point. It <i>still</i> does not seem to occur to you. Even now, you appear to be trying to score debating points, as opposed to considering what I'm telling you with an open mind. -- <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim_Douglas_5faf.html" title="User:Jim Douglas">Jim Douglas</a> <a href="../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJim_Douglas_038e.html" title="User talk:Jim Douglas"><sup><font color="green">(talk)</font></sup></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jim_Douglas_9618.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jim Douglas"><sub><font color="gray">(contribs)</font></sub></a> 17:01, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(edit conflict) Another non-admin opinion here: I agree with Jim Douglas above. From my observations (reading here and other boards, as well as watching the reference desk debates), it seems that LC obviously perceives a conflict with a number of admins sparked from the reference desk concerns, and when challenged on those conflicts immediately goes on the defensive. I personally find his responses to many of the comments that people make regarding his actions to be rather unnecessarily argumentative, even when people are trying to offer positive assistance, and would agree that he could do well to take some time and think about the situation before continuing in that fashion. Barring that, arbitration may be the next necessary step to clear this up. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Fox_1932.html" title="User talk:Tony Fox">(arf!)</a></small> 16:53, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would hope an RFC would be unnecessary, but you are able to open one on yourself if you so choose, Light current. In fact it would be a sign of good faith in the community's ability to police itself if you did so, since you seem to believe that the administrators are biased against you. I believe that you are intelligent enough to see that what you are doing is at times disruptive and rules lawyering without an RFC, but it's up to you (or some other user) to take that step if necessary. -- <i><a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae</a>'<a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">blis</a></i> 17:34, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My non admin opionion is that for some of the blocks I would not have blocked as soon. However, given the repeating cycles of bahviour the blocks were probably inevitable. No one action leads to these blocks but rather a persistent nipping at the heels. Such behaviour becomes less and less tolerable as time marches on. It is certainly disruptive as seen by the reams of discussion devoted to general behavior on the ref desk (admittedly not all due to LC). LC is always looking for loop holes in the rules. The problem is that in wikipedia the rules are interpreted but not necessarily literally. This seems to be a lesson that LC refuses to learn. Another lesson that seems to not sink in is that persisient niggling is a culmulative offense. The slate is not clean after each block but rather patterns of editing are acted on to prevent further disruption. In LC's case the patterns are so clear that he is no longer has the benefit of the doubt given to other editors. Yet, he seems to think he should be treated as a newbie for each new interaction despite his huge block log and masses of experience here it wikipedia (&gt;30,000 edits). To say that LC does not adapt to the wikipedia environment would be an understatement. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_D._77aa.html" title="User:David D.">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_D._d1e6.html" title="User talk:David D.">(Talk)</a> 18:01, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

And he's never really been blocked at all, as he uses his talk page as a soap box through his blocks. He appears to have been a valuable contributor for a year before the civility issues started last August. It may be that he has personal issues that he needs to work through. I've had almost no contact with him, so I could be completely off-base here. But <i>if the admins who have been dealing with his crap</i> think there's any possibility of salvaging him as a useful contributor, then we should try a longer block, for at least a month or two, with his <a href="../../../l/i/g/User_talk%7ELight_current_53e6.html" title="User talk:Light current">soap box</a> locked down, with a clear understanding on his return that the community's patience has run out. -- <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim_Douglas_5faf.html" title="User:Jim Douglas">Jim Douglas</a> <a href="../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJim_Douglas_038e.html" title="User talk:Jim Douglas"><sup><font color="green">(talk)</font></sup></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jim_Douglas_9618.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jim Douglas"><sub><font color="gray">(contribs)</font></sub></a> 18:41, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would tend to support a longer cooling-off period, so that Light current can deal with whatever demons he has at the moment. There is no question that when LC is being productive, he is an asset to the encyclopedia. (Note, however, that the edit counts above may be somewhat misleading—LC doesn't seem to make effective use of the preview button or the minor edit tick box.)</dd>
<dd>After Light current's initial 3RR block last August, it <i>looks</i> from the block log like he got himself rather worked up and started making additional personal attacks, which led in turn to longer blocks. It appears that we have a similar situation here. Light current failed to respond to warnings, was blocked, and then decided to climb the Reichstag. In the August case, he eventually cooled off and went back to being a productive contributor. As short blocks haven't been working here, perhaps a month will allow him time to gain some perspective. I hate to write him off completely at this point.</dd>
<dd>Note that it will probably be best to leave his talk page protected during this period. As Jim Douglas has noted, Light current has a history of using his talk page to rant, soapbox, and work himself up while blocked. (Sometimes this behaviour has led to extensions of his blocks.) Looking at his edit history, the last couple of times he was blocked he was racking up about a hundred edits per day on his talk page before it was protected. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 19:06, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I second <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades's</a> assessment. As someone who has been keeping a close eye on LC for a period of time now, I believe he needs a significant time away from WP to realise that this isn't a game. Moreover, I also think any block now, or in the future, should be accompanied with by talk page protection, as he uses that to build up an head of steam which makes the problem worse. I would support a month block and, on its expiry, it being made clear to LC that should his disruptive behaviour continue it will be indefinite next time. <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockpocket_2e94.html" title="User:Rockpocket"><font color="green">Rockpock</font></a><font color="black">e</font><a href="../../../r/o/c/User_talk%7ERockpocket_62af.html" title="User talk:Rockpocket"><font color="green">t</font></a> 19:42, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I support this course of action, although I think it is rather unlikely to work, because I see no reason not to try. Maybe a month or two off, with a clear statement that he's going to be indef blocked if he continues his previous pattern of behavior, will change, his mind. I don't want him gone if it's at all avoidable—and if he comes off his block and behaves poorly, then he'll be just as indef blocked as he is now. Perhaps we should also consider a community ban from pages that lead him into trouble, if that's possible—although I think it would be difficult, since the page that leads him into trouble the most is his own talk page. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 21:25, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with SCZenz's comments on Trebor's talk. If all of you would like to spend your time <s>babysitting</s> looking after this editor instead of, well, writing a quality encyclopedia, it's not my business to tell you not to. In the case that we do not have consensus for a ban, which I still think is the sensible thing to do, I support SCZenz's proposal: a longer cool-off period, combined with the prospect of an immediate indefinite block in the case of any further disruption. Consider, though: It's quite apparent from his behaviour that Light current has not just poor social graces, but substantial personal issues (of whatever sort). <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not therapy</a>, and I'm not sure that his continued stay here would be of benefit to him (let alone to us, of course). <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 22:43, 3 February 2007 (UTC) — <i>Addendum:</i> "Babysitting" was a poor choice of words, sorry. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 22:46, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have several comments:</p>
<p>1) If somebody files a complaint at AN/I, the responses should either be to support the complaint or oppose it, but in no case should the user who issued the complaint be blocked as a result of having made the complaint. Such an action makes people feel they can no longer request assistance here. This is a disturbing pattern I've seen here. Remember, just because a user may have engaged in uncivil behaviour doesn't mean they lose the right to complain if they are, or feel they are, in turn, treated uncivilly. This should be a "safe place" to voice concerns, not a place where issuing a complaint gets you blocked. This is an important safety valve.</p>
<p>2) An indefinite ban should only be used on people who solely engage in vandalism. This is not LC, he has made thousands of useful contributions.</p>
<p>3) If LC's complaint about Friday doesn't fall within the technical definition of Wikistalking, perhaps the def should be a bit broader. If I, for example, followed Friday around and made trivial changes to each of his contributions (added a comma here, changed a word to a synonym there, etc.), this wouldn't qualify as Wikistalking either, but it would likely annoy Friday, so I wouldn't do it. Think of real world stalking. If a person follows you into every public place you go, wouldn't that make you nervous ?</p>
<p>4) To take an example, if Friday hadn't reverted LC's insertion of the "Description" header in the <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jester.html" title="Jester">jester</a> article, what would have happened ? Perhaps another user would have removed it, or perhaps they would have improved the situation. I do tend to agree with LC that the detailed description of the clothing of a jester wasn't appropriate for the intro, yet some intro did need to remain. Had Friday left LC's addition in place, we may have ended up with a better article, with a new intro that didn't go into that level of detail on the clothing, and the detailed description properly listed under the "Description" header LC added. Friday should try to see what LC was trying to accomplish and assist him (by writing a new intro that didn't get into clothing details, in this case), rather than just deleting LC's contributions.</p>
<p>So, to conclude, can't we all just be a bit more patient with people who disagree with us and try to cool things off rather than trying to escalate conflict ?</p>

<dd>I absolutely agree that if the end result when user A issues a good-faith complaint at AN/I about user B is that user A gets blocked, that's exceedingly unfortunate and gives the appearance of punishing whistleblowers, etc. Unfortunate as the pattern is, though, we can't just say that "no one who issues a complaint at AN/I may himself be blocked", because we would then set ourselves up for (a) endless abuse by trolls who would issue good-faith complaints and then turn into royal pains in the neck, and (b) people issuing non-good-faith complaints.</dd>

<dd>However, a bit more needs to be said about the allegation of stalking. All of us care about this encyclopedia. If I (or anyone) notice a conspicuously bad edit, I/we are quite likely to check that editor's contribution log to see if any similarly bad edits have been made by that same editor elsewhere. If so, I/we are going to fix them. What else can we do? Tie our hands and avoid fixing them, let a pattern of bad edits continue, just to avoid being labeled a stalker? No, of course not. It's a wiki, anyone can edit anything at any time in order to make it better. How you got there doesn't matter.</dd>

<dd>I have elaborated in his talk page, but I wanted to note here that StuRat's interpretation of the build up towards this action is not accurate. LC's block was not in response to his complaint here. A number of admins have been discussion a solution to LC's disruption for a while now, one recent exchange where indef blocks were discussed (see <a href="../../../s/c/z/User_talk%7ESCZenz_5641.html#Blocked_Light_current" title="User talk:SCZenz">User talk:SCZenz#Blocked Light current</a>) started before LC's complaint was made. <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockpocket_2e94.html" title="User:Rockpocket"><font color="green">Rockpock</font></a><font color="black">e</font><a href="../../../r/o/c/User_talk%7ERockpocket_62af.html" title="User talk:Rockpocket"><font color="green">t</font></a> 04:27, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I concur with Physicq's comment on point 2; Wikipedia policy in regard to community bans is well-established, and for good reasons.

<dd>Come on, now. There has been no mention of LC here since a thread way back in the archives that started Jan 18th (again in response to a complaint about another user, in this case one I added). Then, immediately after LC made a complaint here, there is talk of an indefinite community ban on LC. It's even titled as a subsection of the original complaint to show that this ban is, in fact, related to his complaint. To say that this is all just a coincidence and LC would have been blocked at the same time had he not issued a complaint here simply isn't credible. Issuing a complaint should not be seen as even a partial cause for blocking the complainer, all that does is silence the discussion, which isn't healthy at all. And LC, in particular, hasn't been making large numbers of complaints here, in any case. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 02:24, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

What they're not free to do is belligerently argue about it, repeatedly delete relevant commentary, and tell other editors to drop dead. Anyone who does so risks being blocked.

<li>I also do not consider a community ban to be an adequate resolution to the issue at this stage. The block seems ok; I may even reduce it to two weeks, as one month still seems a bit harsh to me. But I <i>do</i> think that perhaps the best solution to this may be for it to end up in ArbCom's <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basketball_court.html" title="Basketball court">court</a>. I'm not sure how helpful an RfC would be, and there have been repeated attempts to bring closure to the RD debate, and all the issues that sprang up from it, by unaffiliated third parties. The lack of results from those discussions tells me that mediation will not work. I sure would hate to lose a qualified user over this, but there may be a need for gradual, enforcable restictions to be placed on him. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito<span style="color:#008000;">xd</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a>)</sup> 03:59, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I agree with StuRat. Indef is absurd, and a month is harsh. As for it being a reaction to his filing a complaint here, hey A then B. Amazing time correlation for it to be a mere coincidence.

<dd>Indef isn't "absurd"; it was a reasonable proposal, and it may still become necessary. In my opinion, though, it's premature to write off a contributor who has made valuable contributions in the past, and may still do so in the future. The block was not a reaction to LC's posting here; it was in response to a long history of civility problems. Blocking him for a month is a reasonable compromise under the circumstances, and I hope it will give him the time he needs to gain some perspective. It's not punitive in any sense; it's a measured response to a history of disruptive behaviour. -- <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim_Douglas_5faf.html" title="User:Jim Douglas">Jim Douglas</a> <a href="../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJim_Douglas_038e.html" title="User talk:Jim Douglas"><sup><font color="green">(talk)</font></sup></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jim_Douglas_9618.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jim Douglas"><sub><font color="gray">(contribs)</font></sub></a> 06:00, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Of course it's not just a coincidence, Edison. Light current was having substantial civility problems, and he decided to post here to counter what he feels is harassment (namely, administrators intervening with regard to his behavior); he behaved rather uncivilly in the process of the discussion itself, which brought his behavior to the attention of various users, who looked at his contributions and proposed that an indef ban might be appropriate. A month is harsh for any particular action he's taken, but not at all when taken cumulatively. Unless you've gone through the literally thousands of edits, since August, that some of us have been dealing with, and believe that Light current does not have a substantial and continuing civility problem, it would be good of you to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> and not make barely-veiled allegations of administrative misconduct.

<dd>To be clear, Light currrent was making a concerted effort to raise the hackles of several other editors – I was one – through a series of attacks and insults. (A non-exhaustive list appears at the beginning of the section <a href="#How_do_we_get_Light_current_back_on_the_straight_and_narrow.3F" title="">#How do we get Light current back on the straight and narrow?</a> above.) Having seen that particular pattern of behaviour before, <i>we were ignoring it</i>, in the hope that Light current would cool off and go back to constructive editing. We were trying not to indulge his penchant for wikilawyering and wilful ignorance of the problems with his behaviour. When presented with criticism, Light current's response is often very hasty and often rude. This happens even with neutral third parties who attempt to give him good advice. This incivility tends to get worse if one gets sucked into the discussion; we hoped to turn off the taps and encourage him to calm down. I know that <i>I</i> considered posting about the problem on this page, and I imagine that some others did the same. Nevertheless, it didn't strike me as likely to help Light current calm down—so I refrained.</dd>
<dd>Instead of finding more constructive pursuits, <i>Light current</i> decided to bring his message here. <i>He</i> decided to cast the dispute as solely a problem with him and Friday. <i>He</i> decided to argue with the advice of several other editors, and <i>he</i> decided to refuse to let the matter drop. At that point it seemed reasonable to broaden the discussion to properly include Light current's own conduct. Yes, I'm sure that Friday <i>was</i> watching Light current's edits; no, I don't think it was stalking. It was an administrator keeping an eye on an editor who had been engaging in very rude behaviour, and who in the past had deliberately damaged articles (while angry) to make a point (see the history of <a href="../../../y/o/u/You_have_two_cows.html" title="You have two cows">You have two cows</a>). No editor should be particularly surprised to find that posting on the Administrators' Noticeboard might prompt an admin or two to look at their behaviour—<i>particularly</i> bad conduct that has happened in the preceding twenty-four hours. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 16:42, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Ten, I just don't think that's proper behavior.

<p>I'd like to chime in. I'm not an admin, so I don't know if I'm "speaking" out of turn, but because LC is (between the sniping) a generally positive contributor on quite a prolific level, I'd like to suggest a shorter block <b>if</b> LC agrees to the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>not debating issues regarding his behaviour to date (ie letting it lie - and it would help, good behaviour permitting, and be fair if everyone else did the same)</li>
<li>accepting a parole period with full knowledge that any flagrant bad behaviour will bring an extremely lengthy or indefinite block</li>
<li>accepting mentoring from an admin not previously involved in this conflict for the duration of the parole period</li>
<li>not posting to any Ref Desk at all, (or talk page thereof!) for the duration of the parole period</li>
</ol>
<p>I would hope that such restrictions will help LC focus his attention on productive editing to the mutual benefit of all. I would hope that those who have been in conflict with him would avoid edits that may provoke him. Please do consider this proposal. --<a href="../../../d/w/e/User%7EDweller_2ebf.html" title="User:Dweller">Dweller</a> 11:04, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Of course</i> you're not speaking out of turn; this page is used by everyone to discuss issues requiring administrative action. Proposals on ways forward are definitely appreciated, since we're kind of out of good ideas.</dd>
<dd>I support all those conditions once he's unblocked, but I do not support a reduction of the block time, or at least not a substantial reduction. The reason is that this block is <i>not</i> punitive; it is rather a chance to give Light current a chance to cool down and reflect on his participation in Wikipedia, and it is my opinion that his chances of successfully turning over a new leaf are much higher if he takes a substantial cool down period. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 11:22, 4 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Here's the challenge. (I'm speaking generally, not trying to disagree with any of the above.) The hypothesis is that admins have <i>not</i> been ganging up on Light Current and that the block is <i>not</i> punitive. The problem, of course, is that when a user has become convinced that admins are ganging up on him, it's next to impossible for that user not to believe that blocks are punitive. It's also next to impossible for that user to ever realize that the admins were not ganging up on him in the first place. Therefore, as we've seen all too many times, these things usually go from bad to worse, with Arbcom cases and bans at their end. I wish this outcome weren't so inevitable; I wish there were some alternate path along which the disillusioned editor could realize and accept the more positive reality of the situation. —<a href="../../../u/m/m/User%7EUmmit_38d5.html" title="User:Ummit">Steve Summit</a> (<a href="../../../u/m/m/User_talk%7EUmmit_97c6.html" title="User talk:Ummit">talk</a>) 13:56, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Part of the problem is the language we use. There may not be any "ganging up", and the blocks may not be punitive, but the whole tone of the debate is that the disillusioned editor is <b>wrong</b>, that his behavior has been <b>unacceptable</b>, that he needs to <b>change</b> whether he wants to or not. There's a subsection above titled "<a href="#How_do_we_get_Light_current_back_on_the_straight_and_narrow.3F" title="">How do we get Light current back on the straight and narrow?</a>" which is an example of this. In the previous paragraph I wrote of the disillusioned editor needing to "accept the reality of the situation", which is another example of this. (I tried to soften it by adding the words "more positive", but it's still too harsh.)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Someone who firmly believes that he is in the right and his detractors are in the wrong, and who for whatever reason entertains the thought "and they're ganging up on me" before ever considering "but I might be wrong", can very easily fall into a trap in which every new voice that's trying to help him, no matter how gently and compassionately, is heard to be yet another gang member joining the chorus of "you're wrong and you need to change". The disillusioned editor does need to change, and in many cases the change isn't even a big or difficult one, but the editor needs to make the change because he wants to, not because he's being told he has to. And it's not easy, in that situation, to get to the point where you want to make the change. —<a href="../../../u/m/m/User%7EUmmit_38d5.html" title="User:Ummit">Steve Summit</a> (<a href="../../../u/m/m/User_talk%7EUmmit_97c6.html" title="User talk:Ummit">talk</a>) 14:11, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, that is the problem. Since he <i>is</i> wrong, his behavior <i>has</i> been unacceptable, and he <i>does</i> need to change, I am not sure how to solve it.

<dd>I understand the limitations of Light current's ability to get along with other users (especially those offering harsh but civil criticism), but I think there's a limit to how much we can treat him with kid gloves; whether we expect he'll react badly or not, <i>he</i> is still responsible for his reactions. You are right, of course, that we should be as diplomatic as possible, but I am at a loss for how to be very diplomatic at this point. I would love to have your suggestions to how to handle our current situation:</dd>
<dd>The situation, in brief, is that Light current has a pattern of uncivil and agressive behavior toward other users; he has exhausted the patience of many community members, and the consensus is to block him from the site for a month and then give him one more chance. If upon his return he demonstrates that he is either unable or unwilling to understand the problems with his previous behavior, and modify it appropriately, he will very likely be indefinitely blocked in short order. Now, how do you propose to present this situation accurately but more diplomatically? -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 15:33, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>LC is intelligent and has admitted to being occasionally been out of line. The admins have also made admitted to occasional mistakes. But I believe that the real key here is to <b>draw a line and move on</b>. There's no point in a to and fro debate on what's gone on. The steps I've suggested above (now flatteringly named after me, lol) are intended to restore a status of useful contribution without conflict. It's also about perceptions of reality on both sides, as much as objective truth. To summarise:</p>
<ul>
<li>The admins need to <i>feel</i> that LC won't be disruptive</li>
<li>LC needs to <i>feel</i> that he is not being stalked</li>
</ul>
<p>Debating endlessly the rights and wrongs of behavior by all parties to date won't solve either of those situations. --<a href="../../../d/w/e/User%7EDweller_2ebf.html" title="User:Dweller">Dweller</a> 14:44, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Your thoughtfulness regarding the situation is appreciated, as is the effort you've put into your analysis. I'd like to offer a couple of observations that might affect your suggestions above, however. First, Light current has a definite tendency to not only assume bad faith, but even when given opportunities essentially identical to what you describe, he keeps sniping at the people he disagrees with. It's not always in the form of posting to their user pages, but he'll make snide little "asides" when talking to other people, he'll post rants on his usertalk, and in the end result is that he's actively poisoning the community. I don't think he intends to do this, but for whatever reason, he seems unable to stop. Look at the edits he makes to his user_talk whenever he's blocked. He begins "churning", for lack of a better word. The pace of his vitriolic edits escalates to a fever pitch and never abates. He'll rules-lawyer things well past resolution when he doesn't like the answer, makes progressively worse attacks on the people he feels have 'wronged' him, and more than one person has ended up protecting his page to, as has been noted above, protect him from himself and prevent further disruption of the project. Before meeting him, I didn't realize it was possible to disrupt the project from a single user talk page, but Light current has enlightened me.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Based on my experience with this user, I predict that the following would happen if your proposal was adopted directly:
<ol>
<li>He would start out by thanking everyone and promising to edit good. And he would, for about a day. Maybe 10-20 articles about electrical engineering would see improvement.</li>
<li>He'd begin to assert within a day or so that the decision of the abusive administrators had been overturned, using his shortened block as example.</li>
<li>He'd start injecting snide comments into user_talk pages about how he was "banned" from RefDesk, and imply that the man was keeping him down. At this point, he'd be working himself up about the subject.</li>
<li>After 5-6 days, he'd start posting to user talk pages or AN/I messages to the effect of "Hey, look at how good I'm doing, can I come back to RefDesk now?".</li>
<li>If folks said "No", he'd escalate the pitch of his corrosive attacks on the people he feels have 'done him wrong'. He'd start making references to how he's going to RfC them, but won't follow through. Any time someone calls him on this downward spiral, he'll aggressively rules-lawyer them. "Tell me specifically what part of that sentence was in violation of the rules" is a sentiment anyone who interacts with Light current encounters, and it sometimes seems that no matter how many times you answer, he'll ask for the same information again the next time.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I worked with Light current last year to try and get him back onto the path so he wouldn't fall off the cliff. There was a one week block involved. but I kept up the assumption of good faith, I actively worked with him via e-mail to try and keep his spirit up, I did everything I could to make it clear that it was not punitive, and explained the community reasoning behind it. I treated him with respect and kindness, but I stuck to the plan. At the end of the block, his page was unlocked, he was unblocked, and he did great for a while. I think the elements of success are clearly defined in the current plan that the blocking admin is following. At this point, a reduction in the block length will reinforce the feeling that he was 'wronged' and the blocking admin was 'chastised' and will result in a poisonous mood when he returns. But if community consensus remains behind the admin making the difficult decision (which I fully endorse, an editor with such a rich block log really can't assert that he or she 'doesn't get it' at this point), then it has a better chance of being successful when it concludes (defined as Light current returning as a productive editor who has a real understanding of the community's disapproval of his recent actions who can grow as an editor and improve the health of the project, not hurt it). I know Cardinal Richelieu said that, given a letter written by an honest man he could find something in it with which to hang him, and I'm sure I've said something above that will spark controversy, but I'm writing from the perspective of someone who has experience with the user and would like to try and help him get on track again. I've asserted to Light current before that many other users doing the same things he has might have been indef blocked and forgotten ages ago, but it's important that he understand that we really _do_ want him here as a productive, healthy editor because we value his contributions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Readers digest version of the above:</b> Let the current block duration stand. Don't shorten it, it will hurt Light current's chances of coming back healthy because it will reinforce his belief that he was unjustly blocked in the first place, and this is based on past interactions with him. I like him and don't want him kicked off the project, but he's on a train to perdition without thoughtful admintervention. I support the current blocking admin because I think his plan is the best for bringing Light current back from the precipice. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChairboy_157e.html" title="User:Chairboy">C<small>HAIRBOY</small></a> (<a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChairboy_882d.html" title="User talk:Chairboy">☎</a>) 15:57, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Here is how. When the idea of ignoring LC's talk-page lawyering in response to warnings was floated, LC himself suggested that "If you cant provide expalnations, you shouldnt be accusing me in the first place. Lack of explanation shows fuzzy thinking and of course cowardice" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASCZenz&amp;diff=104982286&amp;oldid=104968022" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASCZenz&amp;diff=104982286&amp;oldid=104968022" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>. In other words, he refuses to accept the validity of requests for him to change his behaviour unless you fully explain your position. This appears reasonable, unless one is familiar with LC's unique brand of lawyering on his talkpage. Every explanation leads to another attempt to point out an imagined flaw (usually involving his interpretation of some policy). This has sucked God knows how many hours of my time, not to mention Friday, ToaT and SCZenz.

<dd>So any insult which isn't actually true is only a mild insult? I can call people c**ts and because they are clearly human beings it only becomes a mild insult? --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 12:39, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To clarify, I'm not saying anyone has or hasn't done the latter, I haven't looked into this debate just a passing comment on a post I saw. Insults are most normally just calling someone something you think they will find offensive, and I would suggest in most cases that will entail the insult being untruthful. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 12:41, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>One of my intentions, as I posted to SCZenz was to show LC that there's no admin plot to "get" him, but if there's prior form for that pattern of behaviour, your words are persuasive. Thank you for the detailed reply. It does seem as if there's a strong consensus for one month. I want a positive LC back on the Project.

<ul>
<li>(No admin, but have been interacting with LC for a couple of months). I think Dweller's proposal is worth considering (all four bullet points, including the comments in parentheses) regardless of whether the duration of LC's block stands or is reduced. ---<a href="../../../s/l/u/User%7ESluzzelin_c586.html" title="User:Sluzzelin">Sluzzelin</a> 20:04, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I agree with Chairboy's summary of the situation. I support a one month community ban, enforced by a block and talk page protection, aimed at giving Light current time to realise that the community (not just a group of admins) are serious about not tolerating this kind of behaviour. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 23:34, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I will be brief (for me ... grin!)... I too agree with Chairboy's summary. I've interacted with LC a bit in the past as well. I do think he's funny, sometimes, and a contributor who wants to contribute positively, but that he has issues he needs to deal with. A month is the right duration this time. (Dweller's restrictions are certianly worth considering after he comes off that month, though) A month... not to be punitive, but because I really think he needs that much time away from the project to contemplate how he can consistently contribute productively and successfully. Please do not reduce it, the consensus for a month seems clear to me. And keep his talk page protected as well so he doesn't spin himself up per previous behaviour. This is an editor that the community has invested a lot of time in trying to save, but it's time for a last chance, and if that fails, time to cut our losses and move on, not throw more good time and effort in after bad. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 13:31, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I don't often chime in here, but since I tried to help LC above, I will: I support the one month block and would object to shortening it. I was on the fence about an indefinite block before seeing his contribution patterns, and think there is a way this editor can come back to the fold of reasonableness. I would like to see him find a mentor/someone to bounce things off of when he starts to work himself up (I tried to perform the same function for Cool Cat last year, and I think it helped, some). I think Dweller's suggestion is worth considering, with the knowledge that if he starts acting up again, considerable weight has already been expressed for an indefinite block. -- <i><a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae</a>'<a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">blis</a></i> 17:04, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>The user above has requested that their recent block be reviewed a bit further, and his talk page has been fully protected so that he is unable to request that he be unblocked under the conditions that he only edit to a RFC against another user he intended to make for a week. I have no opinion on the matter myself, but the block for a week and the subsequent protection of his talk page just seemed to be something that should perhaps be reviewed by a larger group of administrators, so I'm bringing this here. <a href="../../../c/o/w/User%7ECowman109_5ea9.html" title="User:Cowman109"><font color="DarkGreen">Cowman109</font></a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/w/User_talk%7ECowman109_260b.html" title="User talk:Cowman109">Talk</a></sup> 20:40, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This user is clearly aiming for a community ban, just judging from the talk page alone. Looking even slightly deeper, I see more reasons to confirm the block and some justification (not taken) to extend it. I think a week as a defensive block to allow the user to calm down seems fine.

<dd>Ugh... well looking at the previous version it appears to have huge tracts of ancillary information that is trivial to the subject as well as an "essay"-esque writing style... not to mention only part of it appears to be sourced and there is a legit <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> concern here.

<p>It appears I am am being stalked. I have repeatedly asked JuJube to refrain from personal attaks and to keep to discussing the article. I always use 'please" and "thank you" but injust the past 5 minutes JuJube has left the following posts:</p>
<p>The only person risking getting blocked here is you. There are already two reports about you on. JuJube</p>
<p>That would be helpful, instead of simply reverting without discussion, being belligerent and overall risking getting blocked. Stop. JuJube</p>
<p>He's not going to do that, because only "wikigeeks" cite policies. JuJube</p>
<p>And this has anything to do with the article how? JuJube</p>
<p>More nitpicking. But that's hardly a surprise. JuJube</p>
<p>Yes. Now take your own advice, and stop doing it! JuJube</p>

Isotope23 I do agree with your decision on the baseball player Clint Hartung. I would never have believed that just by appearing in the major leagues meats the notability requirements. I'll probably suggest that be changed. Ballog 22:41, 6 February 2007 (UTC)Ballog</p>

These were left in the next 5 minutes:</p>
<p>Wrong again. When you state that you yourself have done "Two years of research", that is the definition of original research. Stating otherwise is more of the disruption you are quickly becoming known for. JuJube</p>
<p>Nitpicking. This is just wikilawyering in an attempt to make other editors look bad. JuJube</p>
<p>This is your last warning. If you continue to make personal attacks, you will be blocked for disruption. JuJube</p>

To answer your question I will paraphrase a great Supreme Court Justice who, when asked "what is the definition of pornography?" answered, "I may not be able to define it, but I know it when I see it!" Well, I may not be able to define a personal attack but I know it when I see it. And I believe most people do too.<br />

I think it's best if people remember the following Wiki guidelines:<br />
<i>Insulting or disparaging an editor is a personal attack regardless of the manner in which it is done. <b>When in doubt, comment on the article's content without referring to its contributor at all</b>. The prohibition against personal attacks applies equally to all Wikipedians. It is as unacceptable to attack a user with a history of foolish or boorish behavior, or even one who has been subject to disciplinary action by the Arbitration Committee, as it is to attack any other user. Wikipedia encourages a positive online community: people make mistakes, but they are encouraged to learn from them and change their ways. Personal attacks are contrary to this spirit and damaging to the work of building an encyclopedia</i>.<br />
Keeping this is mind, people will concentrate on an article's content and not the author. In this way, we can all improve Wikiworld. Ballog 01:37, 7 February 2007 (UTC)Ballog</p>

A few hours later, he made another subtle change to the article (from "leet" to the less-readable "l33t" (that is, less-readable for those not in the know)) and then "pwned" my user page.

NPOV is about presenting all significant POV, not suppressing one to favor another.</p>
<p>The foul and abusive language that is quoted is from an osteopath who takes the same position about the article as <a href="../../../i/27/c/User%7EI%27clast_cb31.html" title="User:I'clast">I'clast</a>, IOW opposition to a good article they don't like.

<dd>No, I do mention it above, but I'll explain it more here. The quote is from a response to the article, not the article itself, although it is in a box on the same page. (At Quackwatch they usually collect related material on the same page, including selected reader responses.) It is symptomatic of the anti-Quackwatch POV suppression that's going on here, that it was this quote that was chosen and used as an excuse for deleting the link to a good article. It is an echo of the original foul attack made by the irate osteopath! It's certainly not a Wikipedia-relevant policy argument. Whatever the case, it shows that the real motivation for the deletion is POV suppression of opposing POV, a practice that is in conflict with NPOV policy. Editors should ensure and enable all POV to be represented. They must not suppress them. -- <i><b><a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFyslee_abcc.html" title="User:Fyslee"><font color="#004000">Fyslee</font></a></b></i> (<b><a href="../../../f/y/s/User_talk%7EFyslee_First_law_33a5.html" title="User talk:Fyslee/First law"><font color="#990099" size="1">First law</font></a></b>) 23:04, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's an obvious attempt to suppress the opinion of the QW article itself, and thereby (whether he agrees with the rhetoric or not) supporting the anti-QW sentiments of the attacker. The QW article represents a POV that is pretty much lacking in the sales-brochure-of-an article we have here at Wikipedia.

<p>Let's see. A scurrilous author adds forum page material <a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/quackdef.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/quackdef.htm" rel="nofollow">(or worse)</a> to """his""" <s>blog</s>page that also contains obscenities from unverified sources. After <b>five rebuffs</b> on this point (originally from Levine), I <b>politely expurgated</b> (no obscenities directly written in <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Osteopathy&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=106127557" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Osteopathy&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=106127557" rel="nofollow">my</a></i> quote) a penetrating example from the unsuitable page in case other editors failed to notice. Then Fyslee, an avid longtime supporter of said author and his attack sites, files an <b>AN/I on me</b> for abuse and language<b>?!?</b> Then Fyslee questions my recent edits, which I assiduously summarized and explained, summarized below. This AN/I sounds pretty desparate and probably contravenes NPA and AGF.</p>
<p>It is up to the controversial page author, who is very Wiki aware, who totally controls his page's content, with WP already observed as a major link farm for said author, to attempt to deliver non prejudicial content. Even if he can justify his personal pov as "mainstream" (an ill defined, measured and reported, free floating concept). In principle, the author's website control makes *his* QW page combined with unverifiable commentaries even less acceptable than a forum page.</p>
<p>Re Fyslee's representations about me and my edits: <i>"...osteopath who takes the same position about the article as I'clast..."</i> entirely speculative, wrong and also unverifiable as to the "forum" writers. There are conditions that I would accept a Barrett article; this one fails. <i>"The article itself is perfectly fine, well-referenced, and presents another POV than those who use such language."</i> <i>fine</i>? - mixed format obscenities that poratray an unverifiable author, and perhaps his whole profession, as ignorant &amp; crazed?? with known misrepresented science cases?? <i>Well-referenced</i>? +- opinion. And oh yes, definitely <i><b>POV</b></i>. Hammering me? [48][49][50][51][52] - these are <b>fluff</b>. For the record, I consider myself anti antiscientific about pseuodoskeptics and I move pretty carefully on QW related edits.</p>
<p>Q: If the author's views are so mainstream why are there not better sources for reference? I think that preference must be accorded for the <i><b>best</b></i> not the <i><b>loudest</b></i>.</p>

<p>Level-headed editors, especially admins with knowledge of relevant guidelines, are needed over at [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment/User names[]], where the atmosphere is becoming a bit febrile. It's reached the point where verifiably perfectly respectable foreign names like User:Shitomy are being jumped on because they contain rude bits... It's very likely to alienate new Users who arrive in good faith only to have their name essentially rejected because some users think that it's vulgar. Some new eyes and fresh voices might help. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 23:29, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not exactly related, but the upsurge in longer and more unusual names must be due to, in part at least, a lack of shorter, simpler names and now we have the usurp policy, it might be time to think about clearing out all the unused usernames which could be usurped under the present policy and free them up for new users to register. <font face="Arial">-- <b><a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHeligoland_92a7.html" title="User:Heligoland"><font color="blue">Heligo</font></a><a href="../../../h/e/l/User_talk%7EHeligoland_4c54.html" title="User talk:Heligoland"><font color="red">land</font></a></b></font> 00:25, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you want to request a checkuser, <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFCU_026f.html" title="WP:RFCU">WP:RFCU</a> will set you straight. However, checkuser is not for fishing out users, a proper request is to find sock puppets backed up with evidence to support the need for the CU. So I wouldn't bother there. The user might be in need of indef blocking, but I'm differing that to another admin as I'm not quite sure what to make of the post. <a href="../../../t/e/k/User%7ETeke_11ee.html" title="User:Teke"><font color="maroon">Teke</font></a><sup><small>(<a href="../../../t/e/k/User_talk%7ETeke_b34c.html" title="User talk:Teke"><font color="gray">talk</font></a>)</small></sup> 03:11, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm confused. What was the death threat? Usually a Death Threat includes a threat and all I saw from the diffs was a movie recommendation. I haven't seen the movie though, but it stars Mel Gibson so pretty mainstream. Is there some pop culture reference that I'm missing that says "go watch Mel Gibson" is translated to "I'm going to kill you?" --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 04:14, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>BTW, unwanted UserPage edits (that aren't enforcing policy like copyright or BLP) is entirely unacceptable and a warning or short block is certainly warranted. But this doesn't appear to be a death threat even in the echo chamber. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 04:22, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I believe the issue is the 'think about the fact that payback's a bitch' message implicit in the posting. It's not 'I'm gonna fuck you up', but it IS a dick thing to do. Might not be a death threat, but it is definitely harrassment. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 04:23, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Very creative. Not strictly a death threat, but definitely intended as a veiled threat of some sort. ("He doesn't get mad. He gets even."; "Payback's a bitch, ain't it?").

<p><b>Thanks to all the admins and editors</b> who showed concern over this threat and helped out. Out of all the numerous admins and editors who contacted me both privately and publicly about this, <b>only one</b> didn't see this obvious threat as a threat, and actually claimed that it was genuine good-faith movie recommendation! This editor ain't stupid either. Hmmmmm. I wonder what his motivation could have been? If it was just animosity .... I'm OK with that.

<p>My apologies if this is in the wrong WP reporting page.

<dd>Any user with a username can move any unprotected page by clicking the "move" tab at the top of the screen, so an administrator is not needed in most cases. In this case, SqueakBox properly moved the page per your request. <a href="../../../w/o/d/User%7EWODUP_a3ae.html" title="User:WODUP"><i><b><font color="#4169E1">W<font color="#191970">odu</font>p</font></b></i></a> 09:03, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Wodup is right on the admin/non-admin issue, admins don't have any special privileges on content issues, we are all equal. I note that there was a discussion on this move back in late 2005, and the article has been moved back and forth twice over the past two years, so your instinct to discuss it first was also a good one. <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_Signature13_6820.html" title="User:NoSeptember/Signature13"><font color="green"><b>NoSeptember</b></font></a> 09:22, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
