<p>I added info to the article and I am being accused of "disruptive" and I'm being told I have to "persuade" others before I edit. I already took it to the talk before I edited. I fixed the wikiboxes, added more detail, and added more sentences along with references. This is a very serious matter. Removal of info back up by sold references without justification or validity could be preceived as vandalism too. I want administrative assistance into this matter. Is this behaviour by other editors allowable?&#160;:) - <b><font color="#669966">Mr.Guru</font></b> (<font size="1"><sup><a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuackGuru_872f.html" title="User talk:QuackGuru">talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_QuackGuru_3717.html" title="Special:Contributions/QuackGuru">contribs</a></sub></font>) 02:43, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Quack, I explained on your talk page to please take it slow. there are 7-10 different editors all RVing you heavily with all the aggressive changes... it's not a race. your suggestion was posted on Talk under 70 minutes before you put it in.

<dd>Yeah... you kinda missed the point of taking it to the talk page. The point is to <i>discuss</i>, not simply state things on the talk page as if they are established fact and then say "but I did go to the talk page!" And even then, you have to wait for people to comment.

<li>Given the disruption caused by canvassing, I remain of the opinion that people who do so should be blocked until the relevant discussion (RFA in this case) has ended. Despite possible ignorance of our guideline pages, I find it hard to believe that anyone who canvasses is not aware that this is deliberate distortion of the process. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 10:52, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I would also note that as an anon (yes, he's obviously the same person) this user <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Tuskegee_Airmen&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Tuskegee_Airmen&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">disrupted</a> the talk page of <a href="../../../t/u/s/Tuskegee_Airmen_f325.html" title="Tuskegee Airmen">Tuskegee Airmen</a>.

<ul>
<li>Support block, at least throughout the duration of the RfA. I feel bad that Clawton is not being given a fair go because of this user's disruption. – <span style="font-family:trebuchet ms"><a href="../../../r/i/a/User%7ERiana_7579.html" title="User:Riana">Riana</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/i/a/User_talk%7ERiana_2fc6.html" title="User talk:Riana"><font color="seagreen"><big>ঋ</big></font></a></sup></span> 10:59, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Fully agree with the above 3 statements - he's still going for it <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_adminship_Clawson_8ba6.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for adminship/Clawson">on the Rfa talk page</a>, this has biased the whole Rfa, support block <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanpostlethwaite_bb6d.html" title="User:Ryanpostlethwaite">Ryanpostlethwaite</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ryanpostlethwaite_1aae.html" title="Special:Contributions/ryanpostlethwaite">contribs</a>/<a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanpostlethwaite_d7e9.html" title="User talk:Ryanpostlethwaite">talk</a> 11:00, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
</ul>
<p>The user's canvassing is disruptive. If he continues to canvas, a block is a no-brainer. If he's stopped canvassing, it seems to me that a block would be punitive, as it cannot dampen the impact of the canvassing already done. If checkuser show he's otherwise disruptive as an anon, he should be blocked for that. I'd also strongly support admin roll-back of as much of the canvassing as possible, to prevent more users from seeing it. --<a href="../../../d/w/e/User%7EDweller_2ebf.html" title="User:Dweller">Dweller</a> 11:02, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>The point is, he's still disrupting it on the Rfa page, seams he has more of a personal vendetta against the candidate <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanpostlethwaite_bb6d.html" title="User:Ryanpostlethwaite">Ryanpostlethwaite</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ryanpostlethwaite_1aae.html" title="Special:Contributions/ryanpostlethwaite">contribs</a>/<a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanpostlethwaite_d7e9.html" title="User talk:Ryanpostlethwaite">talk</a> 11:04, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I don't believe that the comment in question is violative of Wikipedia policy, and so should be allowed to remain (perhaps marked with a {{<a href="../../../u/n/s/Template%7EUnsigned_e4f5.html" title="Template:Unsigned">unsigned</a>}} tag). --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 14:06, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I also agree with the comment that Giano links to: of course Wikipedia is not a reliable source and should not be cited in a scientific paper. Jimbo said as much also, I think. That's not a slight on Giano's editorial abilities, but simply a reflection of what we are - a general encyclopedia. And of course we don't delete comments in a discussion; that would be vandalism. Giano, if you disagree, just make a polite reply. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 17:03, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The particular article may be very good (for sure!). All Giano-heavily-worked-over articles may be very good (right?). Other individual articles may be very good (of course). But it's still much too early in the day for teachers to treat Wikipedia as a reliable reference work, as opposed to a useful research aid/starting point.

<dd>Just another case of people whose imaginations and understandings extend from A to B, I'd say. No, Wikipedia is not extremely unreliable. In fact, it's extremely reliable. It is not totally reliable, of course. As the <i>Science</i> editorial review showed, Wikipedia <i>can be</i> the best source of information available to a student. Professors who allow no citations to Wikipedia are morons or think their students are. Those who allow Wikipedia to serve as proof of anything are as bad. Wikipedia is an invitation to research more, but it <i>is</i> research. It can never be the last word, but not allowing it at all is foolish. The "extremely unreliable" edit is vandalism, Giano. It should be treated as vandalism. It would be no more to the point than someone going in to the Pol Pot article and inserting, "a very evil man." He may have been a very evil man, but we're NPOV, even about ourselves, in article space. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:29, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A comment on a talk opining that Wikipedia is not a reliable source cannot possibly be construed as vandalism, seeing as vandalism is defined, narrowly, as a "deliberate attempt to compromise the integrity of Wikipedia."

<dd>No it is not vandalism in the traditional sense, but it is certainly undermining the integrity of the encyclopedia. If the whole project is "<i><b>extremely</b> unreliable</i>" because it is the encyclopedia anyone can edit - what are we all doing here? - What is the point? Why bother with text at all - why not just print a catalogue of suitable published references under each title and leave it at that. Of course there will always be mistakes - that is a risk everywhere in anything - but if we think and believe the project is <b>extremely</b> unreliable - then that is very concerning indeed. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_II_8fcc.html" title="User:Giano II">Giano</a> 13:10, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, but it's <i>adding it</i> that looks like vandalism. There are already pages that say that Wikipedia is not 100% reliable. We already put that in footers. To then go in and <i>add</i> "extremely unreliable" looks like an opinion being inserted, not a modification of a policy page. I'd read that as an insult to my article, if I were writing it, myself, and a bit of spray paint that I'd have to scrape off the walls. Imagine you were writing something on <a href="../../../g/o/o/Goober.html" title="Goober">Goobers</a>, and someone comes along and adds, "Really, really, really, really speculative" to a statement that said, "The origin of the word is speculative." Maybe it's a clueless edit, but I can see it being highly unwelcome and insulting (hence vandalizing). <a href="../../../u/t/g/User%7EUtgard_Loki_9cc9.html" title="User:Utgard Loki">Utgard Loki</a> 15:48, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think AnonEMouse - you are rather missing the point. It is not question of putting up and shutting up - it is a question of - is there any point at all writing a page, if the second it is finished complete with references etc, someone can come along and say on the talk page this is "<i>extremely unreliable</i>" - if it happened anywhere lese the editor would be asked what specifically is unreliable? If we the people writing this are happy to be branded "extremely unreliable" then there is little hope for the project. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_II_8fcc.html" title="User:Giano II">Giano</a> 17:27, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You know, I looked for "Giano is extremely unreliable" in that edit, and couldn't find it. I merely found "Wikipedia is extremely unreliable". Taking a look at the number of articles which have been edited to consist of the equivalent of "<a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/GAY" class="extiw" title="m:GAY">Eric is gay</a>" in any given 24 hours, I'd have to say that's pretty much correct. Despite that, most of us still, somehow, find the will to live, and soldier on. Sigh. It is a hard and lonely road we walk, we few, no more than a million or so of us, Wikipedia editors. So defamed. So troubled. So misunderstood. On that last point, being misunderstood, I didn't mean to write anything about shutting up <small>(and, in fact, can't see where I did - but heck, that's two things I can't see. I must need a new prescription. Do you know a good optometrist for mice?)</small>. If you wish to rebut on the talk page, and mention the Science study, or a dozen other good things about Wikipedia, go right ahead, and you'll find lots of supporters. That's why they call it an Article Talk page. Just don't call people who disagree with you in good faith vandals. <small>At most, visigoths, please.</small>--<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 19:22, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>This is an on going dispute and general mess. A, very, short version is that a new editor user:DrParkes made some sweeping changes to the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazilian_Jiu-Jitsu_8a36.html" title="Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu">Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu</a> article, these were reverted with a requests for discussion by several users, including myself.

After reaching my 3rd revert on the BJJ page, I decided to look into the other articles edited by DrParkes, and I added citation requests &amp; removed some POV comments, these edits were reverted again without discussion, then when sources were added my attempts to format were reverted, can't be sure of the exact order but DrParkes 3RR ban came into force and the same patten was followed by an IP [[80.34.17.209]. At this point other editor involved in the <a href="../../../b/j/j/BJJ_534f.html" title="BJJ">BJJ</a> article had also looked at it and edited, as some of the edits DrParkes had made to BJJ had linked to them. At this point <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKentkent_e537.html" title="User:Kentkent">user:Kentkent</a> started editing in a similar manner to DrParkes, but with comment on talk pages, claiming to be a friend, an edit war to maintain the AfD tag started.

<dd>Image:479240555_l.jpg "Back of Verdict" pretty much settles it: Oakster Oakster is clearly a sockpuppet. He admits to it. Not very opaque, is this fellow?

<dd>With approximately 80 known sockpuppets and many more waiting in the wings, I've started fully protecting articles this banned user targets. If he is threatening you, I advise that you simply delete the threat. If he emails you, don't respond. He starts with minor intimidation, moves up to threats of physical violence, then eventually he'll express a desire that you die or maybe even threaten to kill you himself. He was also caught violating privacy (an action for which oversight was required). He will also likely claim that you are stalking him but note that <a href="../../../s/t/a/WP%7ESTALK_e55b.html" title="WP:STALK">WP:STALK</a> does not apply if you are following submissions of a banned user so you can undo them. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 16:34, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just like the note above, I'm not sure where the appropriate place to report this is, so I'm putting it here.

I can't figure out how to determine which, other than to ask experienced editors such as the admins here to take a look.

<dd>A bot is just a user. When someone hits the Edit button, he gets a copy of the current revision. When someone else hits Edit at the same time, he gets the same. The problem occurs when both editors try to save their revision; the database gets two different versions based on the current revision. The first is accepted, the second editor gets a warning that there is an <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edit_conflict.html" title="Edit conflict">edit conflict</a>. Now... Databases can be slow. That means it takes time for an edit to be fully entered into the database. If the software sees a second edit being presented, while the first is not yet completly saved, it might not see the edit conflict and try to save <i>that</i> revision as well; overwriting the first edit. --<a href="../../../e/d/o/User%7EEdokter_4a5a.html" title="User:Edokter">Edokter</a> <small>(<a href="../../../e/d/o/User_talk%7EEdokter_9869.html" title="User talk:Edokter">Talk</a>)</small> 00:27, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I'm having problems with this user. Recently, I closed <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Gianna_Michaels_%282nd_nomination%29_64a4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Gianna Michaels (2nd nomination)">an AfD</a> which he started as keep. He didn't like that, and left me a rather rude message saying "Just letting you know that you failed your duty as a wikipedia administrator today. Not only did you not care to acquire an overview of the debate, which would have lead to no consensus, you also failed to really read it." I didn't particularly like being told I "failed", since I didn't, and no admin can "fail" since we're all volunteers. I told him this, but despite that he continued telling me I "failed", even though I explained my reasoning he wouldn't have it. This discussion is located <a href="../../../m/a/j/User_talk%7EMajorly_3c0f.html#Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion.2FGianna_Michaels_.282nd_nomination.29" title="User talk:Majorly">here</a>. I told him to take it to deletion review if he was unhappy with the result. I thought that would be the last of it.</p>
<p>I then came across <a href="../../../t/w/s/User%7ETwsx_Log_6306.html" title="User:Twsx/Log">this page</a>. I saw this AfD closing had been logged, and I had been labelled as "incompetent" (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ATwsx%2FLog&amp;diff=114097036&amp;oldid=114096649" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ATwsx%2FLog&amp;diff=114097036&amp;oldid=114096649" rel="nofollow">here's</a> the original adding of it).

<dd>I did drop it after trying to convince him to at least explain his decision for. I have lost my temper in the first message and acted uncivil to a certain extend. This is unforgiveable and i apologized for it 5 minutes later and once again yesterday. All of this happened within a timespan of 3 hours <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Twsx&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Twsx&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>, after that, for my part, the topic was done. I "log" my actions and participations on a subpage for later use (comes in hand with a couple of things, such as re-created speedy'd newpages as example). I understand that as with every other page, personal attacks are not welcome, so with some reluctance, i removed them. As it is now, the "log" reflects pure fact without any personal attack, which is why Majorly's last edit definitely constitutes as inproper. I would also like to note that Majorly did not behave perfectly innocent himself, such as calling me a whiner (which is relatively irrelevant, as i never made any move to have his decision evaluated or similar) and saying i was "making ad hominem attacks" while the only person pushing the topic was he himself.<br />
In conclusion; Majorly made his decision, i accepted it right away, but told him my opinion about it anyway, which lead to a discussion that kept going on for 3 hours. Eversince i was fine with what happened. The person keeping the discussion up, is Majorly. I will give my comments to whatever may come up in this discussion here, but for now, this is everything i have to say. ~ <span style="white-space:nowrap; color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">| <small><a href="../../../t/w/s/User%7ETwsx_4b21.html" title="User:Twsx">twsx</a></small> | <small><sup><a href="../../../t/w/s/User_talk%7ETwsx_08e7.html" title="User talk:Twsx">talk</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Twsx_df58.html" title="Special:Contributions/Twsx">cont</a></sub></small> |</span> 17:53, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Twsx should definitely try to be more civil from now on but we should also let bygones by bygones. However, in the future, I would suggest before you post your opinion of other people's actions, I would seriously recommend you consider whether it is constructive or not... <b><a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESasquatch_97db.html" title="User:Sasquatch">Sasquatch</a></b> <a href="../../../s/a/s/User_talk%7ESasquatch_36e0.html" title="User talk:Sasquatch">t</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sasquatch_3b68.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sasquatch">c</a> 18:02, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The problem of his <a href="../../../t/w/s/User%7ETwsx_Log_6306.html" title="User:Twsx/Log">"Log"</a> remains. He insists on retaining the language, "Incredibly competent decision to <b>keep</b> against policy." ("against policy" being the key words, and the dripping sarcasm notwithstanding).

If you believe the closure was against policy, <b>open a <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">deletion review</a></b>.

If you continue to refuse to have the deletion reviewed, you must stop immediately. I think we all know why you won't do it — you'll find out that it was an acceptable closure and an accurate reading of consensus — so you continue to snipe from afar.

<dd>To be entirely fair here, the vast majority of 'keep' arguments were specifically based on criteria which were listed as "dubious" notability criteria at the time, and which are now explicitly listed as outright "invalid". The remainder of the 'keep' arguments weren't backed up by anything other than personal assertions, or the desire for journalists to treat porn more seriously.</dd>
<dd>In short, no actual valid arguments for 'keep' were really made.</dd>
<dd>Consensus isn't supposed to be counting the numbers (10 keep, 7 delete, in this case); it's supposed to put significant weight on the strength of the arguments themselves.</dd>
<dd>I'm not saying that I necessarily disagree with the decision anyways. I'm mostly an inclusionist that thinks that the policy is too strict. However, it's pretty hard to deny that notability was <i>not</i> proven in that afd, as defined by the policy at the time, and that it <i>definitely</i> wouldn't pass the test if it were based on today's current notability criteria.</dd>
<dd>Nobody is obligated to take it to deletion review unless they wish to <i>reverse</i> the <i>action</i> taken in the afd. But a person is more than entitled to say that it was a wrong decision. Wikipedia doesn't support the level of censorship that you're proposing.</dd>
<dd>The 'incompetant' arguments were uncalled for. I think even twsx admits that now, right? However, he certainly seems to genuinely believe that the decision was contrary to policy, and, objectively, I tend to agree. I'm allowed to say that: It was against wikipedia policy. Big deal.</dd>
<dd>The 'incompetant' (and 'competant') problem: that was a serious problem. But arguing about whether or not a person is allowed to say they think a decision actually followed policy? That's just silly. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBladestorm_00c0.html" title="User:Bladestorm">Bladestorm</a> 19:38, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The relevant notability guideline is <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORNBIO_e966.html" title="WP:PORNBIO">WP:PORNBIO</a>, which allows for more subjectivity in determining notability than I am normally used to because of the genre's general lack of coverage by normally reliable sources, and the keep votes were in line with that guideline, unless I'm misreading something. At any rate, this isn't deletion review, so this isn't the place to debate that. Saying, "I don't believe the result was an accurate reading of consensus" is different than "KEPT AGAINST POLICY" (especially since notability guidelines are just guidelines) and saying that the administrator is incompetent (which, until earlier today when he removed it due to this thread, his Log page stated clearly). —<a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell"><span style="color:#555;font-weight:bold;">bbatsell</span></a> <a href="../../../b/b/a/User_talk%7EBbatsell_7978.html" title="User talk:Bbatsell"><span style="color:#C46100;font-size:0.75em;">¿?</span></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bbatsell_a457.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bbatsell"><span style="color:#2C9191;">✍</span></a> 19:53, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Just to make sure it's clear: All accusations of 'incompetance' were entirely inexcusable. Not arguing about that part; only whether or not a person is allowed to believe that something was 'against policy' or not. (basically, the extent to which wikipedia should be censored)</dd>
<dd>As far as the guidelines are concerned, the primary arguments were based on the number of google hits, the number of films, and the nomination for an award related to her chest.</dd>
<dd>The google hits and # of films are explicitly declared "invalid" criteria for notability in the current draft of the guideline, and they were labelled as "dubious" at the time of the afd. The award that was cited in the "keep"s wasn't even notable in and of itself, so even if she'd won, it wouldn't really have mattered. But, in this case, she didn't even win. She was merely <i>considered</i> for a non-notable award. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBladestorm_00c0.html" title="User:Bladestorm">Bladestorm</a> 20:26, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For those interested, there is some interesting, at least tangentially related discussion of whether it constitutes a personal attack to call an administrator's decision something like "incompetent" (as opposed to calling the admin himself or herself that) in the workshop of the InShaneee arbitration case. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 23:09, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>AfD close = valid; I would have done the same. Even if it ended up as no consensus, I would have kept the article by default. The personal attacks by Twsx were uncalled for. The user is allowed to comment on admin actions, but it really shouldn't resort to namecalling and such. In the future, I advise Twsx to be more careful with his words, and to politely discuss a situation with a user. <b><a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENishkid64_5481.html" title="User:Nishkid64"><span style="background:#009;color:#7FFF00">Nish</span><span style="background:cyan;color:#009">kid</span></a><a href="../../../n/i/s/User_talk%7ENishkid64_b4d4.html" title="User talk:Nishkid64"><span style="background:orange;color:navy blue">64</span></a></b> 00:19, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I noticed a user recently moved an article into a user's namespace recently as a way to avoid needing to suggest the article was a candidate for deletion (See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Persons&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Persons&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">here</a>). Is this an acceptable practice? --<a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebroad_730a.html" title="User:Rebroad">Rebroad</a> 18:41, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>While very much good faith move, I dont know about it. I think it opens the doors for alot of possible bad faith. If it needs to be deleted, it needs to be deleted. There have been many proposals for expiremental deletion but i think the way ti stands, regular deletion is the current acceptable practice. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">-- Chrislk02 (Chris Kreider)</a> 18:44, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>No, it is not acceptable. 'Userfying' an article is only permitted once a page is about to be deleted once it has followed proper procedures, usually for the purpose for improving the article. Moving it for the purpose of (speedy) deleting, bypassing <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a>, <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> or <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a> is simply not done.

<li>Oh please. This article would stand less than no chance of surviving an AfD, userfying and leaving a message on <a href="../../../w/a/l/User_talk%7EWalljordan_6ab0.html" title="User talk:Walljordan">User talk:Walljordan</a> it was just someone trying not to bite the newbie.

<p>Joel Leyden (who used to edit as <a href="../../../i/s/r/User%7EIsraelbeach_1341.html" title="User:Israelbeach">User:Israelbeach</a> and numerous other sockpuppets) appears to be canvassing off-wiki support for a concerted push to "send Arab propaganda anti-Israel news groups and blogs to AFD", apparently in revenge for the deletion of the Wikipedia article about his own website. He's using his Yahoo group to coordinate this push with "several Israeli and Jewish groups." It would be worth keeping an eye on AfD for a week or two to see if this amounts to anything much.

<p>Read all of Geuttarda's comments to Otheus' talk page over the last few weeks. He's been trying to get Otheus to stop making personal attacks. Then when Geuttarda leaves in disgust Otheus removed the redirect of his talk page to his user page Guettarda made and left an oblique personal attack in which he gloats at his leaving: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AGuettarda&amp;diff=116588407&amp;oldid=116566476" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AGuettarda&amp;diff=116588407&amp;oldid=116566476" rel="nofollow">[26]</a> Guettarda was one of the few admins who's bothered to stand up to Otheus' chronic subtle trolling and abuse of the system, so it's not surprising I suppose. I stand by removing it and the "comment" from FM's page in which he trolls FM, again gloating over another perceived victory over someone who has stood up to him and won. Otheus has been one of the least honest editors I've come across, as his bogus framing of the issue above demonstrated. 151.151.73.169 22:16, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Apparently this is the same user. Many of his criticisms above are factualy incorrect, and at best, assume very bad faith:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>The <i>only</i> attack Guettarda complained to me about was one he mistakenly thought I made toward him and nonetheless apologized for. (There is a caveat to that; FM AfD'd several user pages I created, which I intended for evidence pages in an ongoing dispute, "attack page"; Guettarda repeated FM's claim these were attack pages, a claim I fully contend is invalid. The pages have since been deleted per his nomination.)</li>
<li>Second, I did *not* remove the redirect of Guettarda's talk page. It was still there and intact and functioning.</li>
<li>Third, there was no chronic trolling! I don't know <i>where</i> this user gets this idea, and frankly, that's very offensive. I'm not even sure what he means by trolling here; the WP policy page on trolling certainly does not apply to me.</li>
<li>Fourth, there is no abuse of the system. Wow, that's pattently offensive!</li>
<li>Fifth, how can I gloat over someone who (paraphr) "stood up to me and won"?</li>
<li>Sixth: "as his bogus framing of the issue above demonstrated [his being one of the least honest editors]". An anonymous IP user removes two messages I had left on User_Talk pages, and I had just been on the scalding receiving end of something similar. Removing one page was offensive, but doing it twice to different users is a <i>pattern</i>.</li>

<p>Right. I found Calton's forcing tags and comments, especially "obnoxious article," to be pushing various letters of the WP alphabet a bit too far. Admins decide, I just report. As for as User Antaeus Feldspar, you find what you need in the User's talk and history. I think the admin response was good on that.

<dd>Thanks Jayron32. Very helpful. I'm witnessing the same pattern. User Calton has since taken charge to revert the edits, and override decisions, of admins, see <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jeanne_Marie_Spicuzza_f698.html" title="Jeanne Marie Spicuzza">Jeanne Marie Spicuzza</a> history. Reverted tags removed by admins. Added article to his personal AfD list, which was around for years, before I even arrived. I'm sensing COI all right, from User Calton. Other Users experienced this problem (see history) and have left it, probably out of sheer frustration. So, a bunch of editors get deterred from fixing an article and then the article gets dumped because it can't be fixed. Not much you can do if you're getting blocked and accused of this or that because you simply disagree, on principle. Call on admins for assistance. I've done all I can.

Guys, I came into this because I came across the article. Regardless of how silly he is, it's a pretty mediocre article and deserved to be redirected, which is why I did it. There's nothing on the article that isn't already in the main one and the AfD was only no consensus because a handful of people wanted to give it a chance. It's not looking any better so I redirected. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 23:09, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry -- you are not qualified to make that decision. I have been called in; it is too late. Your edits on Star Wars Galaxy have implicated you in a wiki-stalking invesitagtion that far exceeds only your minor contributions.

<dd>WormwoodJagger, under what authority are you making these claims? You can't be claiming this authority as a member of <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssociation_of_Members%27_Advocates_d8b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Association of Members' Advocates">Wikipedia:Association of Members' Advocates</a>. That page clearly states that "Advocacy is not mandatory" and "Advocacy is NOT an official Wikipedia procedure." You state "I have been called in..." could you please inform as to who called you in. You also state "...please do not compromise this investigation any further, and follow protocol by contacting me on my web page." Could you provide details of what investigation, who set it up and under who's authority and where the protocol is posted on Wikipeda. I also find it very odd that you do not edit from September 2006, ignoring <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:WormwoodJagger&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=112377140" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:WormwoodJagger&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=112377140" rel="nofollow">Magonaritus</a> comments, until the 16 March. Just out of curiosity, do you deny that 74.110.212.198 is your IP?

Well I guess I violated a whole lot of policies... I thought I was following correct protocol... I'll recuse myself. Good luck! <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWormwoodJagger_c7e5.html" title="User:WormwoodJagger">WormwoodJagger</a> 16:40, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

I thought I would clear the air —— I honestly thought I was an admin. I was notified about this affair by Blunders (phone). Neither Jonawiki, Magonaritus nor G2bambino contacted me. You can see here I have protected a page while I was advocating on August 25 (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neurofunk&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=71784370" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neurofunk&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=71784370" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neurofunk&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=71784370</a>). I guess I'm not anymore, given that I was afk for a few months.</p>
<p>Nonetheless: I'm obviously recusing myself. I thought, however, that, for whoever takes my place, I would offer the findings from my investigation:</p>
<p>There are several indications that place non-trivial doubt on the assertion that Jonawiki and Magonaritus are sockpuppets.</p>
<p>(1) G2bambino placed a request for checkuser on Magonaritus as a suspected sockpuppet. His request was declined on March 10, 2007: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser&amp;diff=114171374&amp;oldid=114171183" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser&amp;diff=114171374&amp;oldid=114171183" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser&amp;diff=114171374&amp;oldid=114171183</a></p>
<p>(2) G2bambino asserts that Magonaritus and Jonawiki "always supports the opinions... of the other" (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:G2bambino/temp" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:G2bambino/temp" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:G2bambino/temp</a>). However, this assertion is untrue. They have disagreed 4 times:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Star_Wars_Galaxies#Emulators" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Star_Wars_Galaxies#Emulators" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Star_Wars_Galaxies#Emulators</a>: Jonawiki wanted to keep emulators in the Controversy section despite objections from Antman. Magonaritus agreed with Antman and moved it to a new Developments to Watch section.</li>

<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Star_Wars_Galaxies#Freeman_.22Controversy.22" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Star_Wars_Galaxies#Freeman_.22Controversy.22" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Star_Wars_Galaxies#Freeman_.22Controversy.22</a> Jonawiki argued that the Bioware rumor should stay in the article. Magonaritus disagreed and argued that it should be deleted from the article.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Upper_Canada_College#G2bambino:_Stop_Hiding_UCC.27s_Dirty_Laundry" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Upper_Canada_College#G2bambino:_Stop_Hiding_UCC.27s_Dirty_Laundry" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Upper_Canada_College#G2bambino:_Stop_Hiding_UCC.27s_Dirty_Laundry</a> Magonaritus lightly chastises Jonawiki's demeanor with "no comment".</li>
</ul>
<p>(3) Previous to the articles on Upper Canada College and Star Wars Galaxies, both Magonaritus and Jonawiki have a long list of different non-intersecting editing interests:</p>
<ul>
<li>Magonaritus edited O Rly?, Elephant, List of Internet slang phrases, Dragon, Harvard University, AOL, ICQ, Edgar Allen Poe, Urban Dictionary</li>
<li>Jonawiki has edited Harvard College, Old Ones (Buffyverse), Roma people, Green tea, Auction, Monomyth, Teras Kasi, Carl Jung, Monarchy in Canada</li>
</ul>
<p>(4) Per the "100 edit rule" as one possible test for sockpuppets (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wp:sockpuppet#When_questions_arise" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wp:sockpuppet#When_questions_arise" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wp:sockpuppet#When_questions_arise</a>), the results do not really indicate that they are sockpuppets:</p>
<ul>
<li>Magonaritus has about 70 edits on pages other than Upper Canada College and Star Wars Galaxies</li>
<li>Jonawiki has about 97 edits on pages other than Upper Canada College and Star Wars Galaxies</li>
</ul>
<p>(5) On <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:G2bambino/temp" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:G2bambino/temp" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:G2bambino/temp</a>, G2bambino makes a decent case that 66.208.54.226 is Jonawiki. There's no crime in a user forgetting to log in every once in a while. Then he tries to show that Jonawiki and Magonaritus are the same user because they both made edits to articles about Harvard, however this link is pretty weak.</p>
<ul>
<li>Jonawiki edited Harvard College to create a new section list of famous alumni. Magonaritus never touched this article. 66.208.54.226 never touched this article.</li>
<li>Magonaritus edited the Harvard UNIVERSITY article to add a pop culture reference. Jonawiki never touched this article. 66.208.54.226 never touched this article.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, G2bambino has displayed what seems to me to be disruptive behaviour, and proprietary interest in the UCC article, given his several hundred edits on the article.</p>
<p>(1) G2bambino has been accused of lacking <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>:</p>

</ul>
<p>Re: Wikistalking</p>
<p>(1) G2bambino has been warned by an admin of violating 3RR in an edit war against Magonaritus (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:G2bambino#UCC_Revert_War" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:G2bambino#UCC_Revert_War" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:G2bambino#UCC_Revert_War</a>).</p>
<p>(2) Per <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a>, G2bambino did not have the "courtesy... [to]... inform other users and editors if they are mentioned in a posting, or if their actions are being discussed." A check on the discussion pages of both Jonawiki and Magonaritus will demonstrate that G2bambino is attempting to get them blocked with as little notice as possible.</p>
<p>(3) Reviewing several thousand contributions from G2bambino, there were no contributions to any articles on gaming or Star Wars previous to his most recent contributions to the article on the Star Wars Galaxies game. The vast majority deal with monarchy, Canadiana and sexuality.</p>
<p>(4) His contributions displayed no knowledge of the Star Wars Galaxies game, just very generic edits.</p>
<p>(5) It seems his sole interest in the Star Wars Galaxies article was because of the presence of Jonawiki and Magonaritus. He even admits as much at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:BaronJuJu#SWG_edits" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:BaronJuJu#SWG_edits" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:BaronJuJu#SWG_edits</a>: "I was merely drawn to the issue as I've had to deal with Jonawiki (talk • contribs) and Magonaritus (talk • contribs) inserting POV and highly baised edits at Upper Canada College, and noted "they"'re doing the same at SWG."</p>
<p>This seems a possible case of wikistalking per <a href="../../../h/a/r/WP%7EHAR_a671.html#Wikistalking" title="WP:HAR">WP:HAR#Wikistalking</a>. Because of the past history of edit wars between Jonawiki/Magonaritus versus G2bambino, it seems per <a href="../../../h/a/r/WP%7EHAR_a671.html" title="WP:HAR">WP:HAR</a> that G2bambino's edits in the Star Wars Galaxies article and his accusation of sockpuppetry have the "purpose of causing negative emotions in a targeted person... for the purpose of intimidating the primary target... to make editing Wikipedia unpleasant for the target, to undermine them, to frighten them, or to encourage them to stop editing entirely." G2bambino's edits in Star Wars Galaxies seemed only for the purpose of inciting and harrassing Jonawiki and Magonaritus. Per <a href="../../../h/a/r/WP%7EHAR_a671.html#Types_of_harassment" title="WP:HAR">WP:HAR#Types_of_harassment</a>, his behavior fits wikistalking.</p>

<p>First off, I'll note that <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWormwoodJagger_c7e5.html" title="User:WormwoodJagger">WormwoodJagger</a> (<a href="../../../w/o/r/User_talk%7EWormwoodJagger_fae9.html" title="User talk:WormwoodJagger">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WormwoodJagger_f3f9.html" title="Special:Contributions/WormwoodJagger">contribs</a>) stated originally that he was contacted within Wikipedia; he has since contradicted that claim by stating he was contacted by another user via telephone. It should also be pointed out that the user who contacted him, <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlunders_of_the_third_kind_970a.html" title="User:Blunders of the third kind">Blunders of the third kind</a> (<a href="../../../b/l/u/User_talk%7EBlunders_of_the_third_kind_2c12.html" title="User talk:Blunders of the third kind">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Blunders_of_the_third_kind_15d6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Blunders of the third kind">contribs</a>), was previously party to the debates at <a href="../../../u/p/p/Talk%7EUpper_Canada_College_c758.html" title="Talk:Upper Canada College">Talk:Upper Canada College</a> involving the accused sock puppeteer, myself, and WormwoodJagger.</p>
<p>Now, for Wormwood's investigation:</p>
<p>1) My request for a CheckUser was not declined, it was deemed unnecessary as I'd already done sufficient work.</p>
<p>2) Having your socks disagree with each other once in a while is a <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppetry_eb4f.html#Straw_man_sock_puppet" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppetry">tactic for throwing people off the trail</a>.</p>
<p>3) &amp; 5) Magonaritus', Jonawikis' and 66.208.54.226's edit histories cross paths more often than they diverge. If I make a good case that 66.208.54.226 is Jonawiki, I also <a href="../../../g/2/b/User%7EG2bambino_temp_aef5.html" title="User:G2bambino/temp">make a good case</a> that 66.208.54.226 is Magonaritus; ergo, Magonaritus and Jonawiki could well be the same person.</p>
<p>Disruptive behaviour:</p>
<p>1) <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a></p>
<ul>
<li>I was accused of NPOV by a user who was attempting to edit based on his own POV and not factual evidence. I was supported by other users, and the accusing editor eventually resigned.</li>
<li>Accusation of NPOV by the same above-mentioned editor.</li>
</ul>
<p>2) <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">WP:CIV</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Confronted because I called a tag "silly"; no accusation of breach of WP:CIV</li>
<li>Supposedly offended user stated he never said my actions were uncivil; no breach of WP:CIV</li>
<li>Debate with same user under 1) above; no accusation of breach of WP:CIV</li>
<li>Debate with same user under 1) above; no accusation of breach of WP:CIV</li>
<li>Accused of violating <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> by same user who stated he never said my actions were uncivil; no accusation of breach of WP:CIV</li>
</ul>
<p>3) <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Automated bot reverted legitimate change; no accusation of WP:3RR</li>
<li>I removed linkspam; no accusation of WP:3RR</li>
<li>Legitimate warning of WP:3RR against myself in an edit war with Magonaritus.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wikistalking:</p>
<p>1) Same warning already mentioned above, does not constitute Wikistalking.</p>
<p>2) Agreed - did not perform the courtesy of notifying Jonawiki or Magonaritus. It does not excuse this omission, however 1) I didn't read the introduction carefully enough to take note of this, 2) I didn't want either user to stop their editing pattern and begin again under new user names. This does not constitute Wikistalking.</p>
<p>3) Jonawiki and Magonaritus were indeed causing disruption at <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_Galaxies_aef1.html" title="Star Wars Galaxies">Star Wars Galaxies</a>; I intervened to aid those who wanted to maintain balance, order and NPOV. I am free to edit whatever articles I please. This does not constitute Wikistalking.</p>
<p>4) Agreed.</p>
<p>5) Agreed.</p>
<p>All together, this is a pretty poor collection of "evidence" - a look beyond the mere surface shows that 95% of it is groundless. The other 5% I have, or will, accept responsibility for. My motives are to see nothing but the end of disruption and strife caused by a particular user; it is not up to me to decide how that is done, hence I have notified administrators of the issue and leave it to them to deal with.</p>

<dd>WormwoodJagger, you did not ask G2bambino to contact you on your talk page. You invented some non-existant protocol and procedure and then told him that was where he was to contact you and implying that he was not to post here any more. As to your remark about G2bambino wikistalking Jonawiki. Well to ID sockpuppets you have to look at the edits they are making.

<p>Look, I'm finding this very upsetting -- I'm not sure why CambridgeBayWeather and IrishGuy are even piling on me, here. If you go through my edits, you can see I thought I was an admin, when clearly I'm not, and I thought I was following correct procedure by having G2bambino's questions about my legitimacy moved to my talk page (you're wrong to assert that I did anything but ask him to follow protocol and not plug up the Jonawicki sock puppet discussion with anything else). I was asked to look at him in terms of wikistalking and, as you yourself note, without knowing his intentions, nor without having completed my invesitagtion, it certainly seemed as though he was wikistalking. He's had you explain his position very clearly now, and I am no longer suspicious, though I must say you two seem to work as a team, in my experience, as this reminds me very much of Upper Canada College last March. Furthermore, I don't care what you think my purpose was, anymore. Please stop wikistalking my posts here, and let the people who *can* resolve the matter of sockpuppetry do so. I will not be logging into this account nor checking anything for the next ten days, becuase, frankly, I feel like I'm being wikistalked and harassed when all I want to do is explain myself. I may even start a new account and close this one. Good day sir! I said good day!

To me, this seems all to co-incidental. An editor comes around, claiming to be an admin, and after a discussion is immature enough to place <i>My final act is to suggest that G2bambino and CambridgeBayWeather are meatpuppets</i> on his page before changing names? My personal thought on the matter is that wormwood is a person contributing nothing more than negative impacts on Wikipedia. First of all, someone claiming to be an admin would not simply change names because (1) or (2) people have a dispute with them ... they would contact other admin's (and I am referring to true admin here, not someone who wants to feel important with a cool title) to help settle the case. Secondly, there are many levels (and I am talking the difference between a simple house and the eiffel tower) between the maturity of admin and wormwood; I do not believe admin material includes behavior we have seen here. Assuming oneself to be admin would note you worthy of it ... Wormwood, here, resembles one of those autistic puppetteers, such as the famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:LTA/MG" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:LTA/MG" rel="nofollow">MascotGuy</a>; however, it is my belief that MascotGuy is even a load more mature than Wormwood. In conclusion, I suggest removing this "final claim" from Wormwood's page. It is my belief that this would quickly surface the IP/handle that wormwood has chosen to use. Secondly, has anyone looked into the fact that wormwood is a third puppet of the other (2) names? <a href="../../../d/-/h/User%7ED-Hell-pers_2b6e.html" title="User:D-Hell-pers">D-Hell-pers</a> 16:09, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

It was then used to add wormwood's "goodbye" mentioned above, followed by (2) other address that followed with edits.

<p>WTF??? I really can't believe this rules-wonking! Three weeks ago Brandt posted some fairly level-headed observations on his own bio page. At the time, I issued a warning that they should not be removed because I suspected that some small-minded person would be more concerned with the 'rules' or with dissing Brandt than actually looking to see how we could improve out content with fairness to the subject. Here, three weeks later, someone drags this up and wikilawyers exactly as I'd feared. We are not in the business of warring with Brandt or any other 'banned user'. If they may useful posts, all good and well. This is not a battleground and we don't do vendettas. Article quality is always our overarching priority.

<dd>Doc, Brandt is banned for very good reason, and any edit he makes should indeed be reverted. He has stalked me for many months, stalking that has included contacting what he thinks are old boyfriends of mine <b>from 20 years ago</b>. He has posted seriously libellous material then refused to publish a correction that was sent to him, which shows he is not the honest researcher he claims to be. He tried to hound another woman either out of her job or out of Wikipedia, and succeeded in doing the latter. He has posted photographs of people without their consent, some of which were very intrusive and clearly intended to be hurtful and possibly damaging to their lives. The only person I know of who has more seriously invaded Wikipedians' lives was Amorrow, whose edits are reverted on sight so that he gets the message that he isn't welcome here, no matter how useful his contributions might otherwise be. If we don't afford that minimum courtesy to editors — that we're not going to be asked to edit alongside people who are stalking us — then we'll lose everyone that Brandt and others like him decide to target.</dd>

<dd>I'm not suggesting we encourage Brandt's general participation. But as long as we have a publicly listed article on him - and an open discussion about it on a talk page - we should not prevent his public participation in that. Removing edits that are otherwise constructive is churlish, and serves no useful purpose. Denying him a right to comment publicly on his own bio will not prevent the behaviour you indicate, indeed it is only likely to escalate things further.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 00:41, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that constructive edits by banned users shouldn't be removed just for the hell of it or to spite them. But the key word here is "constructive". You can hardly call deriding Wikipedians and claiming we have "no sense of social responsibility" constructive in any way. If he wants to fix his article, he can either learn to keep a civil tongue in his head first, or do as SlimVirgin suggests and conduct his business by e-mail. The substantive content of that linked post could have been quite easily said in a civil, policy abiding manner as "Mentioning my draft card burning without also mentioning the amnesty is non-neutral/libelous/mean, please fix it." I find it quite humourous that a man who claims to fear for his reputation because of us mentioning his student activism, which was apparently mentioned in the New York Times and already quite publically available to anyone who cared, doesn't think that his habitually throwing about insults online is potentially just as damaging to him. If I were an employer I'd care a lot more about my applicant's present attitude when dealing with people they don't like than what their political views were during Vietnam. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> <small><a href="../../../t/j/s/User_talk%7ETjstrf_3ddb.html" title="User talk:Tjstrf">talk</a></small> 00:59, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Banned editors can stop the behaviour that got them banned, and can e-mail an appeal to Jimbo or the ArbCom. If Brandt is sorry for the harm he has brought into individual editors' lives, he can take down his website, stop posting people's personal details to other websites, send an e-mail to Jimbo expressing his contrition, and ask to be unbanned. If the only issue is BLP issues with his biography, he can e-mail his concerns to any administrator. Regardless of our opinion of him, his article is subject to as strict an interpretation of BLP as any other article. But SlimVirgin is right: it is an insult to stalking victims to expect them to have to edit alongside their stalkers. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">Musical L</a><a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist">inguist</a> 03:07, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Why are we debating Daniel Brandt's block? It would be completely against common sense to block people for reverting edits of an individual blocked by arbcom.

<li>No, there is a difference between a block and a ban. Brandt is banned. He is banned for trolling, disruption, conflict of interest, outing Wikipedians who prefer to remain anonymous, and pretty much stalking, per the above. If Brandt wants a corrction to his article, he should send mail to OTRS. We should not subject editors to the risk of being inadvertently sucked in to his mind games by engaging in dialogue, because we know what happens when you don't give him what he wants. As William Pietri so neatly put it in another context, we feel about Brandt <i>the way that a natural history museum feels about tigers. We admire them and want our visitors to see how fierce and clever they are, so we stuff them and mount them for close inspection. We put up all sorts of carefully worded signs to get people to appreciate them as much as we do. But however much we adore tigers, a live tiger loose in the museum is seen as an urgent problem.</i> If, after reverting, someone wants to check the comment and perhaps correct a verifiable inaccuracy then fine, but we absolutely should not get into any kind of dialog with this man. If you want proof, check his hive mind page. Just talking about him will get you on there, for all the Internet to see. We should not subject unwitting editors to that kind of treatment. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 16:14, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>In summary: Lordknowle's website of <a href="http://www.templars.org/uk" class="external free" title="http://www.templars.org/uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.templars.org/uk</a> appears to have just launched a new version on March 10th,<a href="http://templars.org.uk/public/news/p_news_1_recent.htm#" class="external autonumber" title="http://templars.org.uk/public/news/p_news_1_recent.htm#" rel="nofollow">[69]</a> so the recent activity on Wikipedia seems clearly designed to try and drive traffic to the site. My recommendation, after discussing it with others, is that Lordknowle be blocked from Wikipedia for a "cooling off period" of a few days or weeks, and then if he genuinely wants to return to Wikipedia after that and work in a cooperative and collegial fashion, he would be welcome.</p>

<li>There are limits to assuming good faith. Accepting unsubstantiated claims of academic credentials is one, for reasons Elonka has pointed out and that we are all very familiar with.

<li><b>Oppose</b> I fail to see how a 2-4 week block would resolve this content dispute. It may allow for enough time to get the article promoted to FA, but then what?

<p>The constant personal attacks and harassment are what concern me.

<dd>Characterizing the cited diffs as personal attacks is going a bit overboard, IMHO. Of course I am not aware of the actual content of any of the e-mails mentioned by Elonka, but they are off-wiki. Looking at the situation from a neutral stance, I see no reason to endorse either vendetta. ˉˉ<sup><a href="../../../a/n/e/User%7EAnetode_cbff.html" title="User:Anetode"><b>anetode</b></a></sup><a href="../../../a/n/e/User_talk%7EAnetode_6721.html" title="User talk:Anetode">╦╩</a> 22:22, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Why is it okay, during a content dispute about the Knights Templar, to go on laborious tangents about Elonka's character? <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Philwelch</a> 22:29, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I never said it was. I don't think that a temporary block will diminish Lordknowle's animosity because Wikipedia makes for a poor vehicle for any sort of effective behavioral modification. Lets focus on helping them resolve the content dispute. The personality clash and ensuing bad faith accusations are unfortunate, but that is a personal matter between these editors. ˉˉ<sup><a href="../../../a/n/e/User%7EAnetode_cbff.html" title="User:Anetode"><b>anetode</b></a></sup><a href="../../../a/n/e/User_talk%7EAnetode_6721.html" title="User talk:Anetode">╦╩</a> 22:52, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Two of the three diffs may count as incivil. But I believe that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Knights_Templar&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=116071025" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Knights_Templar&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=116071025" rel="nofollow">this diff</a> constitutes a personal attack, in the sentence "Maybe I should write a self-promoting entry page on my life, career and publications, but there again, I don't think that I could be so vain or conceited.:-)" The "self-promoting entry page on my life, career and publications" obviously refers to Elonka's user page. By saying "I don't think that I could be so vain or conceited", he's automatically saying that Elonka <i>is</i> vain and conceited. I call that a personal attack. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aecis_c56c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aecis"><font color="blue">A</font></a><a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis"><font color="green">ecis</font></a><sup><a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis">Brievenbus</a></sup> 10:19, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Oppose</b> Firstly, I object to being called a meatpuppet. Although new, I have been trying to pour oil on water on here in relation to your squabble with LK. The term meatpuppet (which I have now looked up) is not very welcoming to someone who has tried to resolve the issue. It also seems very hypocritical for you, Elonka, to be nicey-nicey in your welcome statement and then use this sort of language. It seems that Elonka really does have some real issues here. But to start bringing people like me in, when I'm trying to pacify the two of you seems more like desperation with no logical argument. I would disagree with your often used expression of 'concensus'. On the Talk page of the article in question, Elonka has been supported by three people (some names also appear here) who have personally contributed to her own Wikipedia article. That is not the basis for impartial concensus and should be considered in that prejudicial light. As to LK's academic qualifications, I know what he holds, as we have visited his library to research rolls and other archives. He is most definitely the holder of a doctrine and to accuse without knowing the fats is plainly rude and unnecessary. This now just seems to be academic jealously and I am frankly shocked at this attitude. As to breaches of policy, Elonka has equally labelled LK with the SPA tag when it is obvious that he is not. He has not been party to any vandalism at all. As to private emails, that is a matter for email providers to sort out, not Wikipedia, even if such emails exist. I am astounded at the manner in which this complaint has been raised considering the Talk messages that Elonka has sent on my introduction to Wikipedia. I am not happy at all. <a href="../../../h/e/x/User%7EHexTokis_8c57.html" title="User:HexTokis">HexTokis</a> 22:56, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yes.

<ul>
<li><a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanuck01_f5de.html" title="User:Canuck01">User:Canuck01</a> - This editor came to my attention when he repeatedly added a chart trajectory to the article <i><a href="../../../s/o/m/Some_Hearts_1233.html" title="Some Hearts">Some Hearts</a></i>. I removed this information (as did other editors) based upon the guidelines <a href="../../../c/h/a/WP%7ECHARTS_10e5.html" title="WP:CHARTS">WP:CHARTS</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a>. Canuck01 did not like this and reverted several times. I suspect (but am not positive) that this disagreement led to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ericorbit&amp;diff=113543251&amp;oldid=113382834" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ericorbit&amp;diff=113543251&amp;oldid=113382834" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> on my Talk Page.</li>
<li>Shortly thereafter, the same reverts were being made by <a href="../../../7/6/2E/User_talk%7E76.98.64.105.html" title="User talk:76.98.64.105">User talk:76.98.64.105</a> and <a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.45.87.86.html" title="User talk:68.45.87.86">User talk:68.45.87.86</a>. I have left warnings and attempts to communicate on the Talk Pages of all three editors.</li>
<li>Coincidentally, all three accounts edit the same exact articles.</li>
<li>Coincidentally, all three accounts edit each others' User Pages.</li>
<li>Canuck01 has questionable material on his User Page. Looks more like a regularly-updated collection of information that does not have anything to do with Wikipedia.</li>
<li>Additionally, 68.45.87.86 has now replaced all of the communication I left on his Talk Page with the very chart trajectory that I removed from <i>Some Hearts</i>. I'm pretty sure this isn't allowed either.</li>
</ul>
<p>If I'm overstepping here or if this behavior is acceptable then so be it, but as far as I can see, this could possibly be sockpuppetry and that stuff on the User Pages seems very questionable. My apologies if I've put this report in the wrong section of Wikipedia - if this is the case please let me know.

<dd>I have also encountered Canuck01 in the past, and found him an extremely unresponsive and confrontational editor then; as well, he edited through the IP 68.44.16.135 (<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.44.16.135.html" title="User talk:68.44.16.135">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.44.16.135_c4a8.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.44.16.135">contribs</a>) and his username when edit-warring, almost always refusing to join discussions with other editors on talk pages. Has a history of personal attacks, too: after I removed the trajectory from the <a href="../../../s/o/m/Some_Hearts_1233.html" title="Some Hearts">Some Hearts</a> page, he called me <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Extraordinary_Machine&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=104483322" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Extraordinary_Machine&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=104483322" rel="nofollow">"one of the worst editors in th (<i>sic</i>) encyclopedia"</a>, after which I warned him again not to use personal attacks.

<p>I must say this behaviour is indeed troubling. Darwinek was revert-warring on the <a href="../../../k/o/l/Koloman_G%C3%B6gh_080a.html" title="Koloman Gögh">Koloman Gögh</a> article, breaking 3RR himself two days ago, then (just minutes after his own 4th revert) blocking his opponent for 3RR. Admittedly a valid 3RR offense on a different article, on which Darwinek wasn't himself involved, but about a similar topic and as such part of the same overall dispute situation. Adding a rather taunting comment on the blocked opponent's talk page (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mt7&amp;diff=116385312&amp;oldid=116383719" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mt7&amp;diff=116385312&amp;oldid=116383719" rel="nofollow">[92]</a>). Then continuing the same revert-war until today, calling his opponent "schizophrenic" (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Koloman_G%C3%B6gh&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=116741879" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Koloman_G%C3%B6gh&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=116741879" rel="nofollow">[93]</a>). The dispute is one of those silly nationalistic POV-pushing matches where people have to be "claimed" for this or that nationality; both sides are equally at fault there. When S.novak added the report to Darwinek's old RfC (true, a stale RfC from last year about a totally different issue), Darwinek simply reverted it without any comment. This isn't looking good. That said, someone deserves a slap with the wikitrout for combining this report with an uncalled-for personal attack ("dishonorable"). <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 10:27, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not the first time I hear of Darwinek's bad mouth. Blocking someone you're in a revert with is even worse. I propose a proper long block for repeated incivility and abuse of sysop tools.

<p>Mt7, or whoever he is, is a nice example of user who doesn't know what is he doing. I started mentioned article, he later properly added mentioned person is Hungarian. But after recent dirty war on HU Wiki he started whitewashing articles about Hungarians from Slovakia on EN Wiki. I reverted his edits, and will do so until I will be user here. Point is I am not Hungarian but he is Slovak. Bashing Hungarians is a strong element in Slovak society, now transformed also to Wiki. He claims he used three sources, saying all prove Gögh is Slovak. Bullshit. I can speak Slovak and no of these three "sources" say anything about his nationality. No source also says he is Hungarian but it is most probable, he is. He played for Czechoslovakia national team because he was a citizen of that country but that doesn't mean he was Czech or Slovak. Mt7 edits are thus strong campaign against national and ethnic minorities and will be always reverted. He has even deleted cat "Hungarians in Slovakia" from Hungarian people who were born in Slovakia, lived there and later represented Hungary. This is vandalism. Only reason why we are here is he is whining and trying to camouflage his vandalism as content dispute.

<dd>Thatcher131, common knowledge to Darwinek may equate with he being correct that he is dealing with a vandalism issue.

<dd>I reduced Mt7's block for the reason I gave. I did not block Darwinek at the same time because I though I saw 4 reverts by Mt7 and 3 by Darwinek. I am certainly prepared to block Darwinek if he keeps this up, but I also have to go to work now and, being neither omniscient nor omnipresent, will have to leave that to the judgement of others for the time being.

<dd>This may well be true and your compromise may well be very reasonable, but it's still the case that the claim that this guy was an ethnic Hungarian remains unsourced (Darwinek added something he called a source but which wasn't).

<p>Darwinek seems to have, at the very least, a blind spot concerning this area of Wikipedia, which make him unable to distinguish between vandalism and edits that go against his view. His blocking of an editor with whom he as in dispute is also very worrying.

<dd>My understanding of Wikipedia policy is that it is customary to discuss the reasoning behind one's edits, especially the controversial ones, rather than just initiating an edit war and saying "I reject your arguments." --<a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENathanDW_d5ae.html" title="User:NathanDW">NathanDW</a> 16:42, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The issues on the talk page have been raised by supporters of Lyndon LaRouche, usually with no heed to the policies, and sometimes in violation of ArbCom rulings. These editors stuck the NPOV tag on it months ago, and feel it should stay until their demands are met, but the tags aren't there to enable editors to hold pages hostage. If there are genuine NPOV complaints, please describe them <i>succinctly</i> on the talk page (no rhetoric, no personal attacks, please) and make suggestions for improvement that are <i>actionable within our policies</i>. That means you have to be familiar with the policies first. If you do that, your concerns will be addressed, but if all we see are attacks, long-winded grandstanding, and suggestions that amount to policy violations, no one is going to respond. That's not a SlimVirgin/CBerlet conspiracy; it's just human nature. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 16:54, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>On the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_Right_7ce0.html" title="Christian Right">Christian Right</a> page I am in a discussion with an obviously sincere but very opinionated and unskilled editor who is responding with increasingly angry personal attacks to my attempts to explain about citation, secondary sources, original research, and the difference between anecdotal incidents and secondary authors describing paradigms. The editor is demanding that everything be cited, which is fine (if burdensome when directed at an entire page); but then does not seem to understand how cited research works. As a start, I would greatly appreciate an Admin. stepping in, reviewing the discussion, and then offering some comments about what consitutes "vandalism," and what consitutes personal attacks. Some guidance regarding how citation works on a contentious page would also be helpful. I have already tried an RFC and a third opinion request, and I want to avoid moving into mediation if it is not needed.

Also, at Anome's discretion I'd consider removing those diffs above from the history of those pages, since they contain his personal information (full name and email address) that he might not want broadcast like that (for spam, if no other reason). --<a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaelwys_a686.html" title="User:Maelwys">Maelwys</a> 19:19, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Could someone please intervene in the Betacommand situation. I don't care whether what he's using is technically a bot or not. The issue is that a lot of the edits he's doing are bad. Wikipedia is a human edited encyclopedia and Betacommand is using some (manual or automated) process that fails to apply human judgement to these edits. Numerous users are asking him to stop and he's not slowing down. I can't tell if he's just being rude or actually engaging in <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> but this needs to be stopped, if necessary via a block. Thanks. 64.160.39.153 20:03, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Um, he has been nothing but friendly here. He has reverted mistakes he made, he has undeleted a speedy article and afd'd it.

<dd>Sorry, I somehow saw a contribs page in which it looked as if the edits were still in progress. I'm not sure how that happened but it was undoubtedly my error. (I think I must have mistaken one of the older pages of Betacommand's contribs list for the most recent page). I'm glad the mess is being cleaned up.

<p>Ok, now I don't want to <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">bite the newbie</a>, but <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEvergreens78_bcd1.html" title="User:Evergreens78">Evergreens78</a> is obviously not acting in good faith, I don't think he'll ever be a decent contributor if he doesn't know that Wikipedia is serious about its policy, and his behaviour leads me to believe he's not a newcomer anyways, but I'll get to that later anyways. Anyways, my concerns are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The user <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Evergreens78/Boxes&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=115655496" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Evergreens78/Boxes&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=115655496" rel="nofollow">self-identifies as a troll</a>, and his userpage flagrantly violates <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> with its attacks on Americans, such as an upside down flag, references to using the flag as a cum-rag, and comments belittling 911.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Evergreens78&amp;oldid=116696082" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Evergreens78&amp;oldid=116696082" rel="nofollow">[103]</a> Now I know this may cause a knee-jerk reaction "Oh no we shouldn't stifle political speech", but I hope everyone will see the difference between political speech and deliberate antagonism, which harms the civil atmosphere Wikipedia needs for good editing. Everything seems to indicate he's mostly just here to cause trouble.</li>

<dd>Knee-jerk and inflexible application of guidelines is not necessarily in the best interest of the encyclopedia.

The Web site in question is that of a major-market <a href="../../../p/b/s/PBS_66e9.html" title="PBS">PBS</a> station in the United States, and thus can hardly be considered some sort of evil promotional plot. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 02:20, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't claim an evil plot and I don't see a disjunction between good faith and spam (Wikipedia is full of good-faith spamming). And there is no requirement that spam be commercial. These links all have to be evaluated according to the criteria of <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>. I have no trouble believing that there are some that qualify but hundreds is too much. We are not here as an outlet for PBS web content--PBS has its own web site for that purpose. Also, the content is not free in the sense that we are about ("the free encyclopedia" aka "encyclopedia libre"). See <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gratis_versus_Libre_3aa3.html" title="Gratis versus Libre">Gratis versus Libre</a> for the distinction. They are streaming videos (no obvious way for the user to download a permanent copy) that are PBS copyrighted and they don't appear licensed to permit re-use. If there is free (libre) video available about these topics we should upload it to Commons and not need extlinks. While this no-charge stuff is certainly preferable to typical commercial stuff, it's only partway toward what we're trying to develop. 64.160.39.153 03:18, 22 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Correct, but at this point we don't have the capability to develop such content and, as far as I know, nobody's even really trying. Until there's a quality "Wikivideo" project which can provide GFDLed, professionally-produced video clips of journalistic interviews with noted figures in world history, a PBS source is preferable to any other, and certainly better than nothing. Nowhere did I say that all the links should be kept - certainly we should review them and there's overkill in a couple places. But neither should we, as the topic heading suggests, simply blanket-revert them. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 05:42, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(unindent) I'm not persuaded that having PBS links all over the place is better than having nothing. We're writing a free encyclopedia that anyone can edit and re-use, not an online PBS catalog. Our <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> strategy is quite explicit: if we don't have something, then we should get by without it until we do have it, rather than linking to it externally from an article, unless it represents a unique resource beyond what we would supply in a hypothetical feature-quality expansion of the article. Maybe some of these PBS videos meet that standard. I'd favor a mass reversion followed by possible careful selection.
<p>I also don't have any respect for the concept that "professional" video is better than what we can make ourselves. A main point of wiki philosophy is that by working together and continually improving our materials, we can write an encyclopedia that's as good as--make that better than--the ones that professionals write, and also there should be no distinction between those reading the encyclopedia and those creating it (they are the same people). However, I'd agree that shooting video interviews with news figures is more in the mission of wikinews than the encylopedia part of the wiki project. I have a camcorder; maybe I'll look through some of the videos on that list and see if any of the interview subjects live near me and will let me interview them. Alternatively, perhaps we can approach PBS and ask if they'll license some of their videos compatibly with the GFDL so we can use them directly. If they won't do that, it shows that PBS's philosophy is different from ours and we shouldn't be linking to their stuff indiscriminately. 64.160.39.153 07:09, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not sure if this situation warrants a request for checkuser or not. I think it probably does, but figured I could just ask here. Over the last 2 weeks, multiple users, or usernames at least, have been attempting to insert information about a police officer who may or may not exist in Minnesota. 9 articles have been deleted. Several others have had information removed. It seems like every time an article or mention is deleted, a new username appears to recreate or reinsert with misleading edit summaries like 'miss spell', 'word order', or 'wording'. So far, the following is what I've been able to put together.</p>

<p>I guess I'm just confused about whether a checkuser would be declined because it's too obvious, but I'd like to root out any other socks that have already been created and think that might be considered a fishing trip. Either way, none of the above have been blocked yet, and I'm pretty sure that they've done enough collective damage to justify a block at least. Sorry for the excessive section length.

<p>Ok, so <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnnyAlbert10_f30c.html" title="User talk:JohnnyAlbert10">User_talk:JohnnyAlbert10</a> is a fine upstanding editor. However, his brother <a href="../../../5/1/2/User%7E512theking.html" title="User:512theking">User:512theking</a>, and sockpuppets thereof, is vandalizing all over, and threatening violence over it. Apparently, 512theking, who is older than JohnnyAlbert has threatened and engaged in violence against JohnnyAlbert10. 512theking is now vandalizing my talk page as well, etc, no signs of stopping.</p>
<p>Honestly, what is there to do about this? I'm sort of at a loss. They're both minors, and the IP is AOL, so its easy for 512 to evade. Any IP blocks inevitably end up catching JohnnyAlbert in them, which means time and inconvenience for him while we figure it out and unblock him. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">⇒</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../c/l/i/WP%7ECLIMBING_ffc5.html" title="WP:CLIMBING"><small><sup>On Belay!</sup></small></a> 01:39, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You could block an IP and have it not effect users. You could combine that with an account creation block as well.

<dl>
<dd>Well it also sounds like JohnnyA is getting caught be autoblocks. The autoblock is the only way to stop 512 from making more socks since he's on AOL; but then again, if he's on AOL then the autoblock will only work until he gets a new IP, so not really an effective sock blocker. I guess just block the socks with autoblock turned off and be resigned to the fact that you'll have to keep it up until he gets tired. If there's no static IP that's the only real answer anyway. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 03:12, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>See above. Betacommand's bot went on a rampage of removing perfectly proper external links, mostly to archived usenet posting on Google. The bot was shut down, and the bot's approval was yanked, and Betacommand did manually revert some of the damage, but there are HUNDREDS of such links that were removed from articles. And I simply do not find that the vast majority of these were anything other than important links that supported the article. And in removing the links in this fashion he leaves broken sentences and similar. Basically ALL of these edits were destructive. And they lacked the bot flag too. Look at everthing before around 1734 March 21st on here; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Betacommand" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Betacommand" rel="nofollow">[129]</a> -- It is a HUGE mess. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenBurch_6e87.html" title="User:BenBurch">BenBurch</a> 04:17, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The rollback function rolls back individual edits. It's going to take another bot to undo what Betacommand's bot did without a lot of manual reverting. Note that Betacommand's bot seems to have done some bulk edits on several occasions before today. Could Betacommand please give some indication that he understands not to do this any more? Always look for consensus before launching any large scale edits of this type, whether automated or manual. 64.160.39.153 04:25, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Disclaimer: I knew Hans in college, though I haven't been in contact since. This, combined with the random apparently antisemetic bent of the anon editor, is making my neutrality rather bent on this matter.

<p>I just discovered the new round concern over <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetacommand_e660.html" title="User:Betacommand">Betacommand</a> engaging in problematic automated behaviors (at least the third time). I would like to express my opinion that Betacommand should not be a member of the <a href="../../../b/a/g/WP%7EBAG_f4b6.html" title="WP:BAG">Bot Approvals Group</a>. I have no faith in his ability to handle bot related actions responsibly. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 05:21, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>PS. As there is no real process (or any history) of removing someone from BAG, I figure this is as good a place to start the discussion as any. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 05:23, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I concur with Dragonsflight in questioning Betacommand's judgment. Betacommand does good work that we don't always see, but every time he's mentioned on AN/I it's because of yet another outrageous action. These issues were brought up at the RFA <i>before</i> they happened... <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small>2007-03-22 05:47Z</small></i></span></p>
<dl>
<dd>I opposed Betacommand's RfA because of communication issues. I see the same issues coming up again and again on this noticeboard. Make no mistake about it, I think Beta has the best intent of the encyclopedia in mind, but I too am starting to question his bot-related judgment, particularly in the operation of scripts from his admin account. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><span style="color:MidnightBlue"><b>alphachimp</b></span></a> 06:57, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Betacommand has made some pretty awful process errors and has some trouble with communication, but as far as I can tell he is good with technical stuff. BAG members can't actually set bot flags, and it's not so clear what kind of harm they can actually do, so BAG still seems like a place where Betacommand can contribute. BAG process actually looks a bit bizarre and maybe needs to be adjusted somewhat (i.e. to require a bit more consensus within BAG before approving bots) and that too can help correct any errors.</p>
<p>Mainly I think someone needs to get into a discussion with Betacommand about some of these issues and Betacommand needs to be responsive to it. Betacommand's intentions are good, but he needs to develop better understanding of how the editing process works. I see from his RFA that he had very few mainspace edits at that time. Perhaps he would benefit from concentrating on that area for a while (I mean on actual content writing and editing) before going back to doing maintenance stuff. That would present another side of the encyclopedia to him--exciting in its own right--and also the added editing experience would help prevent further misjudgements from the technical side. 64.160.39.153 06:43, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This looks like you don't really have any objections with Betacommand actions with respect to BAG, but have objections to his own use of bots/scripts. Is that correct? <font face="monospace"><a href="../../../d/g/i/User%7EDgies_d44c.html" title="User:Dgies"><font color="#00F"><b>—dgies</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../d/g/i/User_talk%7EDgies_d02f.html" title="User talk:Dgies">t</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dgies_24b2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dgies">c</a></sub></font> 06:51, 22 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, correct, I think these current problems basically reflect poor editorial judgement on his part (i.e. the problem wasn't bot operation per se, but rather that he programmed his bots to make a huge number of edits that shouldn't have been made on content grounds). I'd prefer that he stay away from that kind of mass editing for a while until he has a better understanding of article-editing culture, rather than just following policy mechanistically.
<p>I confess to not understanding BAG myself that well, but if Betacommand's technical knowledge means he can contribute there without creating a concrete threat of harm from misjudgement, then maybe it's ok. Basically I wouldn't kick someone off BAG as a punitive measure in this situation--I'd only do it if I thought leaving them on was likely to harm the project or unlikely to help it. (I have to call it a pretty bad faux pas even on pure technical grounds though, that the recent rampage totally ignored the 2 edit/minute limit for unapproved bots). 64.160.39.153 09:09, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you feel he has poor editorial judgment, then how can you feel he can be trusted to decide when a bot should be allowed to make mass edits? If he has trouble figuring out when editting by bot is a good idea for his own account, then I don't see why it makes sense for him to judge whether proposals for bot actions by others are also good. It is not punitive, it is preventative. BAG is about deciding when the use of a bot makes sense, and I feel Betacommand has demonstrated poor judgment in exactly that skill. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 12:18, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It's a lot easier to be objective in your judgement about other people's edits than it is to be objective about your own. If there were evidence that Betacommand had displayed poor judgement in assessing the editing proposals of others, removing him from BAG might be a good idea, but as things are they seem like two different things. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 13:35, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Betacommand has made the wise (and mature - though difficult) decision to withdraw from BAG. I think that's a smart choice, and one he is to be commended for.

<dd>The critique article you've used as reference is by someone who does not believe in Homeopathy, nevermind the general 'neutral' tone and titles. The author, Anthony Campbell, in his book concludes that Homeopathy is not proven and suggests the effects are due to placebo</dd>
<dd><a href="http://www.acampbell.ukfsn.org/homeopathy/homeopathy-html/chapter01.html" class="external text" title="http://www.acampbell.ukfsn.org/homeopathy/homeopathy-html/chapter01.html" rel="nofollow">Book summary</a>. This critique is against Classical Homeopathy, not Vithoulkas himself, who is simply expressing Hahnemann's Homeopathic point of view for health and disease, nowdays accepted by most Homeopaths (the critique is dated 1978). Besides there was a newer edition of Vithoulkas' Science of Homeopathy printed on 1980, with very possitive comments by the Homeopathic community&#160;::<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Science-Homeopathy-George-Vithoulkas/dp/0802151205" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/Science-Homeopathy-George-Vithoulkas/dp/0802151205" rel="nofollow">Amazon.com</a>. At the time of print of the very first edition of Science of Homeopathy, at the Royal Hospital, only Homeopathic Polypharmacy (combinations of homeopathic remedies) were being used, and that only for minor health issues. Campbell and the establishment felt threatened, and hence this negative critique. Science of Homeopathy is a standard book used in almost all homeopathic schools around the world - the fact that it has been translated in 20 languages is a proof of its acceptance. And please do something about <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Cuerden_bd4e.html" title="User:Adam Cuerden">Adam Cuerden</a>, he is clearly biased, dismissing all information about Vithoulkas as POV (please compare the edited versions)&#160;::Homeopathic 16:02, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, we could, but I'd suggest you be the one that does it: I think he hates me enough already. That said, he has made himself notable enough among homeopaths to get a few awards, now, whether they're really notable - a medal awarded to him by Hungary to kick off a homeopathic conference in Budapest, for instance - is another thing, but it is evidence he's notable for a modern homeopath. Whether "notable for a homeopath" is really notable in reality, I dunno. I wouldn't mind keeping the article if we can get him to allow an objective statement of Vithoulkas' views, as it might be a useful study in how far out there homeopathic thought can get. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Cuerden_bd4e.html" title="User:Adam Cuerden">Adam Cuerden</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdam_Cuerden_a555.html" title="User talk:Adam Cuerden">talk</a></sup> 16:17, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hm. If we barred everybody who is a civil servant or otherwise employee of a state agency from contributing on political issues regarding their country, where would that lead us? - That said, I now see he actually claims not only to be an employee but an authorised representative of the PNA.

<p>Unfortunately, when you're dealing with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, it will be hard to find anyone resident in either Israel or the Palestinian territories <i>without</i> a strong opinion. It's not like a standard political issue where most of the populace doesn't pay attention to the issue and can be considered unbiased. So we either exclude the entire population of a country or two, or we just have to live with a bit of editing by interested parties. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 17:03, 21 March 2007 (UTC)\</p>

<dd>"Assume good faith" does not mean "bend over", Avi. The diff mostly seems to be a long lecture on your part. It's a bit like the thief giving the court his version of the law on robbery so far as I'm concerned, I'm afraid. As I noted, so long as this user edits within the bounds of policy, there is no problem; if she does not, there are the usual remedies. You could though try negotiation instead of antagonism. Anyway, Avi, my money is on this being a clever piece of trolling.

<p>An issue has arisen with a new editor, <a href="../../../a/s/u/User%7EAsucena_47bf.html" title="User:Asucena">Asucena</a> (<a href="../../../a/s/u/User_talk%7EAsucena_8489.html" title="User talk:Asucena">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Asucena_a751.html" title="Special:Contributions/Asucena">contribs</a>). She says on her user page: "I am an official of the Palestinian authority and a member of Hamas' political public relations division; I am an official representative of the authority in the online field." And on her talk page: "I am an official of the Palestinian Authority. I am authorised to answer your questions about Palestine."</p>
<p>If true, there's a clear conflict of interest regarding any edits to do with Palestinian affairs or issues of relevance to the Palestinian authority or to Hamas. The question is how should we handle it? I seem to recall that the IPs of offices believed to belong to American congressmen were being blocked at one point to stop edits that might benefit them, but the Foundation wanted to be told because it was a government issue. This is also in a way a government issue. Do we block the user; ask her to stop making that claim until she proves it; revert her edits; simply keep an eye on them? Some of her editing has been controversial; for example, she nominated <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestinian_political_violence.html" title="Palestinian political violence">Palestinian political violence</a> for deletion, which is absurd in itself, and a clear COI violation coming from her, if what she says is correct.</p>
<p>I'm posting this here and not on the COI noticeboard because she's saying there's a government authority involved. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 17:34, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>As long as all edits are in keeping with our guidelines and policies, there shouldn't be a problem surely? I'm a member of the University of Oxford, and have associations with a number of Colleges, but no-one has ever suggested that I should steer clear of relevant articles. Given that this editor is perfectly open and honest about her affiliation, we shouldn't have any problem monitoring what she does.</p>
<p>Whether she's actually who she says she is — that's another issue. Unless she tries to use it as a justification for edits, instead of giving verifiable sources, then I don't see that it matters. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Talk</font></a>) 17:46, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is a really big difference between just working for a college (which although needs to be seen as elite and exclusive does not need to be concerned with the public perceptions of of the organization near as much as a small government striving for recognition does) and being a paid public relations representative of a government. This is a textbook conflict of interest, if we ignore this situation we might as well abolish the entire policy since we are not going to find a better example of a violation. If someone was simply a member of a government in an unspecified position you might be able to make an argument against it being a COI, however this person is self-admitedly a public relations representative, their entire job is to protect the image of their employer. They will attempt to spin every detail to their advantage just as assuredly as those idiots on <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crossfire_%28TV_series%29_836c.html" title="Crossfire (TV series)">crossfire</a>.

<dd>I definitely don't agree with the proposition that some seem to be advancing - that we should be banning or reverting an editor's contributions <i>based on who they are</i>. That way lies a very nasty slippery slope. It's also totally at odds with our mission statement ("the encyclopedia that anyone can edit"). As long as the editor's professional affiliations are properly disclosed - and in this case they seem to have been - I don't think there will be a problem. As for the fact that this editor will most likely be a partisan, I have to point out that the Arab-Israeli conflict articles are already a cesspit of aggressive partisan editing, disregard for NPOV, original research, reliance on fringe sources and unverified information, coordinated tag-team edit warring, overt POV-pushing, ownership of articles and pervasive systematic bias. The addition of one professional partisan isn't going to make much difference to an area of Wikipedia which is already infested with numerous amateur partisans (and it wouldn't surprise me if some of them were professionals, too, as Moshe suggests). -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 21:31, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Chris, banning ANYONE violates the idea of "the encyclopedia that anyone can edit". And I think working for a militant organization which has engaged in combat against Israel makes someone more partisan than someone who, for instance, works in a Tel-Aviv delicatessen. Sure, the guy in the delicatessen might not like the Palestinians much, but his job isn't to do PR for the people who blow them up. I'd have the same objections to someone who works for Likud or IDF editing Israel/Palestine related articles as well. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Philwelch</a> 22:08, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's true that it's a bit of a paradox that when people disclose, we tell them they can't edit in certain areas, but it's not clear how else to handle it. For example, we don't want professional PR people for certain companies editing those companies' articles, and if they do, they have to be extra cautious; that is the point of the <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> guideline. Given Asucena's edits, she's not being cautious at all; quite the reverse. So the question remains how best to deal with it. Of course, we don't yet know that she really is a PR person for the Palestinian Authority. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 23:27, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Actually, I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing for people directly involved in the conflict to edit related articles. Several of our editors do serve with the IDF (<a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> comes to mind), which can hardly be avoided given Israel's conscription policy. I'm sure we have Likud activists editing too - I'd be surprised if we didn't. There's nothing wrong <i>per se</i> in them editing, as long as they disclose any COI issues in advance. I'd call it a positive step that people are willing to engage with each other on Wikipedia rather than just blowing each other up... -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 22:54, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you edit with a consistently pro-foo bias, you should be banned for being a pro-foo partisan hack. Admitting to be employed by the Party for Foo and Blowing Up Bar is evidence of bias, which, <b>in combination with a biased editing record</b> and no indication of future improvement, is cause for ban. If you happen to be employed by the Party for Foo and Blowing Up Bar, but never say anything, edit anything having to do with foo or bar, or if you do edit those things, edit them neutrally, no one will care. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Philwelch</a> 00:01, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think it's a problem who someone represents, Slim. It's much more of a problem how they edit. As I noted on the user's talkpage, I think the paradox you note is important; some strongly biased editors who do not say why they hold that bias are not challenged, while this one is challenged primarily because of a presumptive bias. But I don't see that it's something we have to "handle". So what if User:X is the Queen of Sheba. If she edits articles on Sheba using sources and within the bounds of our policies, what's the problem? Edits, not people, count. Given that this editor did not stick to the bounds, she was punished (intemperately in my view, given how egregiously others have performed and not been punished, but still, if we are blocking her, that is the best reason for it). <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 06:01, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A very brief look through the user's contribution history and talk page shows that she has been making edits based upon her expertise or authority, and has been challenged for sources. I think she should be made aware of the rules and policies, and watched. If she can make encyclopedic contributions that are NPOV and reliably sourced, great. If she can't handle the rules, or won't, then hammer her through existing process and policy. Same goes for her fellow employees, if they really exist, and assuming she is what she says she is. If she's not, she shouldn't be allowed to claim it. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 23:20, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Interesting comparison, SV. There are one to two self identified activists for various liberation groups editing currently. Since the "Front" has no official organisation, we are told that anyone who self identifies as such, and works within their remit, is a representative. I don't believe any of them have been blocked despite editing the ALF and related articles from an obviously pro-AR perspective. Why not? Because they are judged on their contributions, not who they claim to represent. I keep a close eye on those I'm aware of, however none of the have grossly violated our policies. I would suggest doing the same for this editor. <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockpocket_2e94.html" title="User:Rockpocket"><font color="green">Rockpock</font></a><font color="black">e</font><a href="../../../r/o/c/User_talk%7ERockpocket_62af.html" title="User talk:Rockpocket"><font color="green">t</font></a> 02:36, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Feel free to add to my explanation. My main concern is to slow things down before this becomes another media feeding frenzy. We understand that new users often get off to a rocky start, but the press can be merciless and the recent Microsoft to-do may incline them to very little leniency toward this editor. I'm confident they'd check the bona fides before running any story. Yet from our perspective we're dealing with a bull-in-a-china-shop situation and the bull doesn't appear to notice the cameras strolling past the sidewalk outside the plate glass window. Let's lead the bull carefully so the good vases don't get broken. I suppose I'll take some criticism for this decision.
