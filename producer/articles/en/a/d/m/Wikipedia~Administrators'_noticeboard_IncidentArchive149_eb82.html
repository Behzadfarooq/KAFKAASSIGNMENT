A long list of shops in a particular mall is simply not encyclopedic, and when you get that out, it's merely a substub with more links than actual content.

<dd>(I am not an admin, but...) It's not just procedural that first, you should contact people on their talk pages and ask them to calm down and take a bit of time off (which I just did to one of the parties). Protecting a page should only happen after other approaches including warnings to users and short blocks if necessary have failed. I can't blame you for wanting to try to calm it down a bit, but start at the right starting point: ask people nicely, on their talk pages, to calm down... In overall seriousness, this is nowhere near as bad as many other flame wars which we've let run without locking a page. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 07:27, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Very odd response. Frank is infamous for having been falsely convicted and, in fact, being an innocent man: <i>The Leo Frank case is considered one of the most egregious miscarriages of justice in the legal annals of Georgia... The degree of anti-Semitism involved in Frank's conviction and subsequent lynching is difficult to assess, but it was enough of a factor to have inspired Jews, and others, throughout the country to protest the conviction of an innocent man...Slaton reviewed more than 10,000 pages of documents, visited the pencil factory where the murder had taken place, and finally decided that Frank was innocent. He commuted the sentence, however, to life imprisonment, assuming that Frank's innocence would eventually be fully established and he would be set free... etc.</i><a href="http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-906" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-906" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> As for Shipman, did you bother clicking on the links provided? <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 02:58, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The case is a famous miscarriage of justice according to everyone who's written about it extensively, to the best of my knowledge, and so there's no reason to keep removing the category. Threeafterthree has e-mailed me to say that the two other editors are people he lives with. I assume he means <a href="../../../6/8/2E/User%7E68.9.116.87.html" title="User:68.9.116.87">User:68.9.116.87</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBackroomlaptop_97c5.html" title="User:Backroomlaptop">User:Backroomlaptop</a>.</dd>
<dd>There are similarities in editing style, articles edited, and general interests. Lots of Jewish-related interests, and specifically removing that people are Jews, even from well-known Jews such as <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steven_Spielberg_f3a5.html" title="Steven Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a> (Threeafterthree removed that) and <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elie_Weisel_8318.html" title="Elie Weisel">Elie Weisel</a> (Backroomlaptop's first edit was to remove from the first sentence that Wiesel is Jewish, then add to the end of the lead that he's of "Jewish decent [sic]". <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elie_Wiesel&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=50211590" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elie_Wiesel&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=50211590" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>) Threeafterthree even removed "of Jews" from a quote which said that <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Luther_b8dd.html" title="Martin Luther">Martin Luther</a>'s work had tragic effects "on later generations of Jews." He twice removed "of Jews," <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Martin_Luther&amp;diff=66535725&amp;oldid=66529737" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Martin_Luther&amp;diff=66535725&amp;oldid=66529737" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Martin_Luther&amp;diff=66570248&amp;oldid=66569699" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Martin_Luther&amp;diff=66570248&amp;oldid=66569699" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> saying he was correcting the quote, but the quote does say "of Jews." <a href="http://www.elcic-lopp.ca/policies_jewish.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.elcic-lopp.ca/policies_jewish.shtml" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></dd>
<dd>Also, Threeafterthree enabled 68.9.116.87 to evade 3RR at <a href="../../../k/a/h/Kahanism.html" title="Kahanism">Kahanism</a>. The anon added <a href="../../../r/a/c/Category%7ERacism_ca08.html" title="Category:Racism">Category:Racism</a> at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kahanism&amp;diff=88289001&amp;oldid=88239154" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kahanism&amp;diff=88289001&amp;oldid=88239154" rel="nofollow">21:51 Nov 16</a>, and reverted three times; then Threeafterthree arrived to revert at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kahanism&amp;diff=88345583&amp;oldid=88343309" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kahanism&amp;diff=88345583&amp;oldid=88343309" rel="nofollow">02:57 Nov 17</a>, despite having not edited since September 1.

<p>A one month block is a very long block. I do not support this block and think it should be withdrawn. If an editor poses an immediate threat of disruption, then you should block for a few hours or a day at most, during which time you should come to ANI to gauge consensus. Otherwise, you should do a discussion or warning on the user's talk page. In this case, I see no immediate threat, nor any attempts on Jayjg's part to warn or discuss and consequently feel that the block should be recalled. I make no judgment on whether the blocked user exhibited any anti-Semitic edits, only on Jayjg's implementation of policy, which I find flawed and unfair to the accused. -<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_sig_226e.html" title="User:Lethe/sig">lethe</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_sig_fced.html" title="User talk:Lethe/sig">talk</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" rel="nofollow">+</a></sup> 21:21, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

HighInBC correctly responded that a block would be inappropriate given the nature of the test edit, and instructed Ring modulator that use of the blatant vandal warning was inappropriate in this circumstance. Hoping to not scare off the new user, HighInBC removed Ring modulator's warning, replaced it with a welcome message on the new user's talk page, and told the new user the message was placed in error. Today, Ring modulator placed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chaosmeika&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=89428243" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chaosmeika&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=89428243" rel="nofollow">this</a> message on the new user's page, even though the new user had made no further edits.

<p>Sirex98 is right about there being something fishy; MingNei is running quite the sockfarm trying to influence the AFD.

<p>I should have been more clear: I wasn't suggesting it for the repost: it was for the new account creation, afd avoidal and reposting, and the linkspam combined. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">⇒</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Swatjester_088b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Swatjester"><small><sup>Ready</sup></small></a> <a href="../../../r/s/t/RSTA_5dcc.html" title="RSTA"><small>Aim</small></a> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_United_States_Armed_Forces_74b7.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject United States Armed Forces"><small><sub>Fire!</sub></small></a> 11:09, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>How are you so sure it's a sockpuppet? Was the other account blocked?

Administrators Guinnog, pschemp and myself have been involved in a discussion about creating a disambiguation page for <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cork.html" title="Cork">Cork</a>, as strong arguments can be made for the city not being the most popular lemma with that name. One editor, <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFrelke_e8a2.html" title="User:Frelke">User:Frelke</a>, has proven extremely difficult to work with, and his unwillingness to engage with factual arguments, take up complaints about guidelines in the appropriate places, and file bug reports about technical aspects that he feels need to be changed, has stalled progress on the talk page. I would appreciate review and recommendation by an independent admin. As a quick intro to my view of the situation, you may wish to read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ACork&amp;diff=89840005&amp;oldid=89838039" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ACork&amp;diff=89840005&amp;oldid=89838039" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>.

<li>Well people are certainly allowed to ask for advice here from other admins and fresh eyes on a situation, and this is done all the time. What we've got here is a situation where after much and prolonged discussion the majority of editors agree with what is standard practice on Wikipedia for disambig pages yet the minority is claiming that because not everyone is in 100% agreement, there isn't consensus. So what do you do in a situation like that? If you go with the majority and the standard practice, then the minority will claim "process wasn't followed" and "its a dictatorship" and "there wasn't consensus." (As they already have done) Can we do the right thing even if the minority doesn't agree or is Wikipedia so bogged down in process that it isn't allowed if it will hurt someone's feelings? Certainly asking the community this before taking action is a noble thing. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 16:33, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>A <a href="../../../c/o/r/Talk%7ECork_85ec.html#Straw_poll:_choose_alternate_title" title="Talk:Cork">vote</a> was taken on the issue, five people requested that the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Status_quo.html" title="Status quo">status quo</a> of <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cork.html" title="Cork">Cork</a> as the city be maintained whilst six requested that an alternative name be used (indeed in said vote the status quo was removed part way thru the vote as it was seen that a consenus had to be fixed). Its very close cut and by no means just one "extremely difficult" editor who is holding up the process. <a href="../../../d/j/e/User%7EDjegan_c54c.html" title="User:Djegan">Djegan</a> 16:51, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The consensus on the page was that voting was evil and a discussion was a better way. Only Djegan and Felke continue to cling to the "we must vote" even though the vote was closed as malformed and the resulting discussion can out in favor of following Wikipedia disambig guidelines and having cork as a disambig page. His interpretation of the vote is off too, only two people indicated that <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cork.html" title="Cork">cork</a> shouldn't be a disambig. This is an example of why more eyes are needed. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 16:52, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Plus, the poll was closed becuase it wasn't formed correctly, there was no consesnsus to have yet another poll, and a perfectly good disscussion took place that came to a decision.

<p>Djegan, the consensus of the discussion was clear.

<p>I have to say that the move seemed a bit premature. i thought the plan was to take the argument to <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">request move</a> to get the outside opinions. It seems strange to move the page without going to <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a> and then come to ANI for outside opinion. Especially given the sensitive nature of this subject. This early move, which appears to side step normal proceedure, is just asking for those who object to dig in their heels. It was definitely counter productive to resolving the issue. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_D._77aa.html" title="User:David D.">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_D._d1e6.html" title="User talk:David D.">(Talk)</a> 18:41, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If you review the talk page, you'll see that there wasn't a chance in hell of any constructive discussion coming out of it. Taking the issue anywhere else would have only prolonged the conflict and got more people hot and bothered, rather than achieving anything positive. Taking it to requested moves had been the option favoured by the opposers from the beginning, possibly with exactly the intention outlined above. As for digging the heels in, they had pretty much announced they would do that regardless fairly early on. Please note that the opposing side provided no data supporting their case, other than a somewhat biased analysis of Google results. - <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamsara_87dc.html" title="User:Samsara">Samsara</a>&#160;(<a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamsara_83cc.html" title="User talk:Samsara">talk</a>&#160;<small>•</small>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Samsara_6f94.html" title="Special:Contributions/Samsara">contribs</a>) 18:50, 24 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That is not entirely correct. Several contributors (myself included) attempted to offer supporting data. All of which was refuted out of hand. (Despite being acknowledged as an accepted WP means of identifying DAB priority). Regardless, the "request for admin review" here is not to "review the validity of this move", rather "review the manner in the move was instrumented". It was unheralded (a simple "I'm going to do this" would have done), and so gave no time for the contributing editors to help "prepare the ground" by preemptively working through the <b>several thousand</b> links which now incorrectly point to a DAB page! <a href="../../../g/u/l/User%7EGuliolopez_903d.html" title="User:Guliolopez">Guliolopez</a> 19:03, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>First off, if you were pointed to a "rant" it was not mine. (I have never "ranted" in any of these discussions). Secondly, I find myself questioning your use of the term "rant", given the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ASamsara&amp;diff=89726839&amp;oldid=89642419" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ASamsara&amp;diff=89726839&amp;oldid=89642419" rel="nofollow">profanity</a> used on your own userpage. Thirdly, I remain saddened by this expectation that this discussion be conducted over an undefined set of conditions. (EG: "enter into this discussion under *my* terms or you will be ignored")</dd>
<dd>All that said, while I'm not about to go through every one of my posts on this discussion over the last month to provide the diffs you request, I will bow to your terms and offer the following: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cork_%28city%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88478778" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cork_%28city%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88478778" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cork_%28city%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88613424" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cork_%28city%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88613424" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cork_%28material%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=83481762" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cork_%28material%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=83481762" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cork_%28material%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=83470310" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cork_%28material%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=83470310" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cork_%28material%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=83399198" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cork_%28material%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=83399198" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>. My points against the move therefore remain:
<ol>
<li>There was no precedence for this move (save for the enthusiasm of a handful of editors) (See: <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath.html" title="Bath">Bath</a>, <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limerick.html" title="Limerick">Limerick</a>, and - beyond geographical terms - any page that has two potential meanings).</li>
<li>A quick Google test (even balancing for links with a higher ranking owing to commerical considerations) demonstrated Cork (city) as a primary use candidate.</li>
<li>The arguments citing "dictionary evidence" were inconclusive, and offered no argument to address the imbalance of "proper nouns" in a dictionary context. (Beyond which, using "dictionary rules" seemed inappropriate given that wikipedia is clearly not a dictionary and not bound by the same considerations).</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Regardless, the validity of my points above are no longer of concern. As stated, I am no longer concerned '<b>that this page was moved</b>, but that (even though those involved in the discussion were attempting to work "within the rules of engagement defined by the proposers") it was moved without due consideration to the ongoing discussion, without notice (given the contention), and by an Admin (or Admins) who should have considered closing the debate, heralding the change and addressing any "impartiality" issues before making the change!</dd>
<dd>I am further dismayed by the language, attitude and undiplomatic perspective which permeated the discussion, which resulted in measured contributors - who were attempting to remain balanced and considered - being effectively blocked from participating. An aggressive (flaming) atmosphere was perpetuated in the discussion, and was not addressed by the admins (and in some cases the "flames were fanned"), and - because a vote was rejected and so no other avenue offered - measured discussion was impossible, and relevant arguments were ignored or (I expect) never proffered in the first place.</dd>
<dd>It's hardly the most inappropriate use of power I've ever witnessed, but it was so badly managed that I find myself disillusioned with the role of admins in resolving contentious issues. <a href="../../../g/u/l/User%7EGuliolopez_903d.html" title="User:Guliolopez">Guliolopez</a> 20:44, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>All those things were addressed and discussed over and over on the talk page, so I'm not going into why a google seach is not representative of the entire world's usage of English again. An inconclusive result says that to be NPOV we can't give the city precedence over the material anyway. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 21:36, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree on your points. A neutral admin should of come in and reviewed the process and made the final call. Instead the admins who where involved in the discussion for moving made it a rather private affair between themselves, and even when editors requested that a neutral admin interveen they went ahead (indeed the attempt was a rather botched one as the talk pages where not moved and less than five minutes notice was given before intention to move and moving - bearing in mind the vote was 5/6 and requests to allow an neutral admin ignored).</dd>

<dd>Oh please. You are simply whining because you didn't get your way. However, you never once came up with facts supporting your position. We make decisions around here based on facts and the dismabig guidelines, both of which say that <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cork.html" title="Cork">Cork</a> should be a disambig page. Like afd's, decisions are not made by votes (which you are skewing the interpretation of anyway, plus the vote was closed because it was malformed) around here, they are made by looking at the facts of the case. There were lots of non-admins who thought cork should be a disambig page so get off the conspiracy theory. Whine away but like it or not, if you don't have facts to back up your opinions, they matter little. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 21:33, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>(reproduced from the talk page) Hi... I've looked through this entire discussion... wow. I'm not sure I see why people are so passionate about this. My conclusion: (I am a neutral admin, previously uninvolved) and I think <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cork.html" title="Cork">cork</a> should be a disambiguation page. No term is most prominent, not the material, not the city, none of them. So the main reference should indeed be to a disambig. Support the action of Guinnog, and suggest that it be left as is. See, for example, <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phoenix.html" title="Phoenix">Phoenix</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/f/Lift.html" title="Lift">Lift</a>. I'm not sure that characterising the inputs of some admins as arrogant is necessarily the way to make a case for things, though.

<p>A user by the name of Bowser Koopa has been blocked from wikipedia without proper warning. <a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAuburnPilot_7d36.html" title="User:AuburnPilot">User:AuburnPilot</a> was the one who reported Bowser Koopa to <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">User:Metros232</a>, who immediately blocked Bowser Koopa and labeled him a "vandalism only" account. I am addressing this because Bowser Koopa only vandalised ONE page and was warned for it. He only received one warning of his actions. He goofed around with his talk page but received no warning or anything(he only received a hint). AuburnPilot then told Bowser Koopa that the talk page was not "his" and that anybody could say whatever they want and that Bowser Koopa could not delete it without their permission. He then went to AuburnPilot's talk page and posted a fake vandalism warning as a joke, yet it was deleted without Bowser Koopa's permission and AuburnPilot reported him to Metros232, who ignored the fact Bowser Koopa never received a final warning and blocked him indefinately. Not only was one rule ignored, but another(deleting a message on a talk page without permission) was also committed. There is major hypocrisy here that I want to stop. I am requesting Bowser Koopa be unblocked and given another chance, and for Metros232 to be accountable for his mistakes.

<p>And you first complained about this user on ANI, then complained about me on ANI, without so much as telling the user (in the first place) or me (in the second place) about it. If you're going to report an incident here, how about you tell the people involved that they've caused an incident?! Maybe you wouldn't have even had to block Myrtone if you had simply told her about this page!</p>

<dd><i>I clearly stated the block was to <b>prevent</b> further disruptive edits yet he is claiming it was "punative". The user was clearly editing disruptively and has been warned in the past.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I rearranged your justification, hope you don't mind. The user did this once before, like six months ago or something. I got the idea the user doesn't quite understand what the templates are for, but she's not abusing them and she was not at all likely to cause further damage.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>This is not the first time he has done this and seems to be protecting the user.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The user e-mails me every time she gets blocked. I guess she found me because I'm close to the top of the list of admins. I check over her block, decide she is being a nice person making a lot of good contributions and just a few mistakes, and let her edit again. She has not once gone back to causing trouble, and frankly you are the first person to complain, not because the user was a danger to the encyclopedia, nor because I negatively impacted the project in any way by reversing your block, but apparently because I didn't respect your admin authority.</p>
<p>I think this user poses no danger to the project, you disagree. That's <i>okay</i>. You posted on my talk page telling me that I was totally and obviously wrong and you were going to reblock, and I didn't argue with you. You obviously know better than me. I yield. But you seem to have your panties all in a knot over a relatively minor disagreement. What's up with this "Don't be so flipping disrespectful to your fellow admins"? I didn't say you were doing a bad job adminning. My chain of thought was, "good user, well-intended block over a legitimate mistake, user wants to get out of jail and edit again, I'll just fix things up for everyone". I even checked and noticed I had unblocked the user a few times before, so I left a warning.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>I really have a problem with Ashibaka's actions here and total lack of even trying to discuss it.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>If you are so up on discussing things today how about you try discussing this with the user responsible rather than huddling around in the admins' Masonic lodge to decide what to do, then simply telling the user "bam, you're blocked, problem solved". Also, maybe you could tell <i>me</i> when you start a discussion about me. Maybe this would solve some problems as well. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashi</a><b><a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_b_4e96.html" title="User:Ashibaka/b"><font color="orange">b</font></a></b><a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">aka</a> <small><a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">tock</a></small> 07:49, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I think conflicts such as this can be avoided if an admin, whenever undoing a block made by another, notifies the blocking admin of having done this. The blocking policy also recommends that.

<li>Oh God, <i>not again again</i>. Now we apparently have <i>two</i> incorrigible editors. Endorse reblock - I would have if Pschemp hadn't - and I strongly suggest Ashibaka refrain from unblocking this particular user anymore. <i>"The user e-mails me every time she gets blocked. I guess she found me because I'm close to the top of the list of admins"</i> - no, it's probably because you've twice and now three times shown yourself to be a soft touch who won't bother doing the courtesy of checking with your fellow admins before you overturn their efforts to protect the encyclopaedia just because Myrtone can be polite when he/she wants. You're 43rd in the list of administrators, I doubt Myrtone has chosen you at random each time. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 13:11, 23 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'd say this isn't really about Ashibaka per se - Myrtone is hardly the only user who effectively cannot be blocked because a sympathetic admin will overturn any such blocks by default. This perennial issue seems to stem from wikiculture.

<dd>Myrtone used to mail me a fair bit as well but since I've never unblocked, has cut way back. I've never unblocked because I found the blocks to be justified, this user, good intentions or not, is disruptive and blocks seem to be the only way to get a change. Support reblock, suggest that Ashibaka should post here, email or otherwise contact the blocking admin in future before unblocking. Overturning another admin is something not to be done lightly and merits discussion. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 11:25, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I came across Lebanon/to do and don't really know what to do about it. It appears to be an article in progress? But it's obviously tucked away without a proper entry title and page.

<dd>Sarah, Yeah, that was what was confusing me. Because it didn't seem connected to <a href="../../../l/e/b/Lebanon.html" title="Lebanon">Lebanon</a> in a direct way, such as having a link back to the main page or talk page of Lebanon, which I'm used to seeing on sub-pages. It certainly wasn't a complete article. And the general lack of wikifying, which I wouldn't expect from an article on Lebanon. It just struck me strange and worth noting. Sorry if it was a bother.

<p>I debated whether or not to leave this comment here, for <a href="../../../b/e/a/WP%7EBEANS_2a59.html" title="WP:BEANS">WP:BEANS</a> reasons, but decided it was better to have people knowing about it and being on the watch than just letting it go on.</p>
<p>A lot of vanity pages are being put into the mainspace by people creating them first as user pages, where we almost always ignore them, and then moving them into the mainspace after a few days have gone by (or until their accounts have aged sufficiently for them to do this). Here's a couple examples: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Cupton" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Cupton" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=move&amp;user=Doberman316&amp;page=" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=move&amp;user=Doberman316&amp;page=" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>. In the last couple days I've gone through the move log for about the last week, and killed a bunch of these. (Some like Cupton I left because he's not obviously CSD A7.)</p>
<p>It would be great if the new page patrollers and recent change patrollers also patrolled the move log regularly. I'm trying to remember to do it.</p>
<p>A couple things from the developers might be nice:</p>
<ol>
<li>Include pages on <a href="../../../n/e/w/Special%7ENewpages_26cd.html" title="Special:Newpages">Special:Newpages</a> (mainspace) which are moved there from other spaces;</li>
<li>A filter on the move log so we could see things moved between spaces, especially into the mainspace.</li>

<p>Question: Is there any guideline or policy regarding the appropriateness of a wikipedia editor getting another editor's email address through contact from the email function (we had collaborated back and forth regarding some edits several months ago), and then using that editor's email to invite them to various dating services etc? I've gotten a couple of requests from another editor, to join dating networks, social networks, and other such things. It's getting a little irritating, and I'm wondering if there is any official guidelines or policy regarding it. Don't get me wrong, I'm not asking that any action be taken against the other editor (hence why I'm not naming him), I am just curious as to the policy behind it. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">⇒</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Swatjester_088b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Swatjester"><small><sup>Ready</sup></small></a> <a href="../../../r/s/t/RSTA_5dcc.html" title="RSTA"><small>Aim</small></a> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_United_States_Armed_Forces_74b7.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject United States Armed Forces"><small><sub>Fire!</sub></small></a> 02:02, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Is it really an abuse of Wikipedia function? From how I read it, the OP volunteered her/his email address in a previous exchange, and that information is now being mis-used. <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnchoress_3b7f.html" title="User:Anchoress">Anchoress</a> 02:53, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I see what you're saying, but they used the <a href="../../../e/m/a/Wikipedia%7EEmailing_users_69d1.html" title="Wikipedia:Emailing users">email this user</a> feature to get Swatjester's e-mail address, and then used that address to spam him.

<dd>Hmmm, I see what <i>you're</i> saying, but it seems like a dangerous precedent. I am totally on board with sanctions against certain editors who engage in off-wiki stalking, but I think (speaking as a non-admin) that we (as editors) have to take responsibility for giving out our email addresses. The OP said s/he had 'collaborated' with the other editor in a 'back and forth' exchange, which IMO says that they had productive contact, which means this is in effect a friendly off-wiki contact that went a bit sour when the OP started getting emails s/he didn't like. I am on the bulk email lists of several editors thru wiki contact who now send me christmas greetings, e-cards, and jokes. Can I get them blocked? Cuz it seems like the same thing to me. Not dissing the OP btw. <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnchoress_3b7f.html" title="User:Anchoress">Anchoress</a> 03:18, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Our "collaboration" was his original email saying "Why did you nominate my article for deletion" and I explained it "It was a duplicate article, highly POV, and almost unrecognizable as being written in the english language it was that poorly written." That was the extent of it. He persisted, and I sent him one more email explaining myself again. That was the last contact I had until his (I count 4 that are still archived on gmail, and I think more are on my other laptop) spams. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">⇒</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Swatjester_088b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Swatjester"><small><sup>Ready</sup></small></a> <a href="../../../r/s/t/RSTA_5dcc.html" title="RSTA"><small>Aim</small></a> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_United_States_Armed_Forces_74b7.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject United States Armed Forces"><small><sub>Fire!</sub></small></a> 03:23, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>If it's <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">casual</a> invites, I would say it's unintentional spamming, which it is best to just kindly tell the person to stop.

<p>I can't believe it would be malicious, but it IS continuing after I've asked it stop. I've received three in the past month. I'm assuming good faith here, I'm not asking for blocks for the user, I'm not claiming malicious intent or anything. I'm simply noting that this does seem like a fairly large loophole with harassment potential (in my case it's merely annoying, its not at the level of harassment yet.) that should be fixed somehow, and seperately that the dearth of usernames and article clones that the Mohammad Salim Khan's have made are rather strange and worthy of attention. Like I said, the user identifies himself as a pakistani national, and his english is very poor, so I'm chalking most of this up to bad grasp of the language and customs. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">⇒</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Swatjester_088b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Swatjester"><small><sup>Ready</sup></small></a> <a href="../../../r/s/t/RSTA_5dcc.html" title="RSTA"><small>Aim</small></a> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_United_States_Armed_Forces_74b7.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject United States Armed Forces"><small><sub>Fire!</sub></small></a> 03:48, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The IPs are mostly Korean so far, and not from Analyzethis' home area. They may be proxies, but if so, there will never be technical evidence to confirm the alleged sockpuppetry. Do you have other strong evidence that the user is behind the attacks? If so, post an explanation and see if an uninvolved admin will agree to block the named account. Otherwise you'll just have to keep blocking the IPs. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 03:32, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is a user who some time ago (top of the last archive of my talk I think) posted a message tha went something along the lines of "<i>I see you're a smoker, I think you should stop</i>" I added a lenghty and quite tongue in cheek reply that basicaly said <i>thanks for the concern, but please stay out of my personal life.</i></p>
<p>Yesterday, that same user came back and osted again. I'm actually onn a bit of a wikibreak right now because my illness has the better of me at the moment, and so I'm prone to snapping (perhaps I should leave a messagebox? lol). However, reading his message, I saw red and couldn't resist replying. I tried to keep civil, but also wanted to be perfectly blunt about it as it seems that the message didn't quite get across the first time. I'm a little worried that I may have crossed the personal attack line unintentionally at the moment (possibly because I'm worrying needlessly, or possibly because it comes close - I'm not the best person to judge that at the moment, which is the <i>exact</i> reason I'm taking a break right now. Could somebody please review my comment <a href="../../../c/r/i/User_talk%7ECrimsone_6974.html#Have_you_stopped_smoking_yet.3F" title="User talk:Crimsone">here</a> and let me know? I'd ask at editor review, but it's only a review of one message I'm hoping for rather than my whole contib history.

<p>I have been editing pages on shopping centers in the Phoenix, AZ area, where I live, and the San Francisco Bay Area, where I grew up.</p>
<p>Today I found that the page "Metrocenter Mall" was deleted by admin JzG citing (WP:CSD G11, spam,) as a reason. I would beg to disagree with the conclusion as 1) Metrocenter is a major shopping center in Phoenix, one of America's major cities and 2) using such criteria would disqualify several dozen articles on shopping malls. Shopping centers are a topic of great social, cultural and economic significance in the USA and worldwide and deserve coverage on Wikipedia. Articles on them should not be deleted. Please strongly consider reposting the article, and/or I will begin a replacement article within 48 hours.--<a href="../../../m/s/r/User%7EMsr69er_1000.html" title="User:Msr69er">Msr69er</a> 18:17, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think you misunderstand me.

<dd>Hopefully the defendant is allowed to speak at his own trial&#160;:). I sincerely apologize if my calling you a racist hurt you, Nixer. However, your behavior on Talk:Armenia is very unappropriate and counterproductive. You continue to regurgitate the same statements, even though they have been disproved more than once, and remain ignorant on the facts and history that are presented regarding the Armenian language, Armenian alphabet, and history of the Armenian people. I (and others on Talk:Armenia) have repeatedly provided you with quotes, references to Wikipedia encyclopedia articles (the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_alphabet.html" title="History of the alphabet">History of the alphabet</a>, the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_language.html" title="Armenian language">Armenian language</a>, and the Unicode standard, and yet you <i>still</i> continue to regurgitate your baseless and simply <i>untrue</i> comments:

<p>This user account is less than a month old, and shows evidence in their edits of previous experience with Wikipedia's guidelines and procedures. However, the sum total of their few edits are all on talk or Wikipedia: pages, and the vast majority of those are to do with ongoing discussions in several places about the status of the <a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost_%28TV_series%29_c407.html" title="Lost (TV series)">Lost (TV series)</a> article and its place above the main <a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost.html" title="Lost">Lost</a> disambiguation page.

<p>Hi, guys.</p>
<p><a href="../../../e/1/0/User%7EE104421_300d.html" title="User:E104421">User:E104421</a> and User:Karcha were recently blocked as sockpuppets of each other since the checkuser investigation have shown they both use IPs from the same University. Later <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">User:Future Perfect at Sunrise</a> found some evidence suggesting that they might be different people <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard%2FIncidents&amp;diff=88595827&amp;oldid=88593876" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard%2FIncidents&amp;diff=88595827&amp;oldid=88593876" rel="nofollow">[54]</a> and unblocked them, then DMC found the evidences to be unconvincing and reblock them again. Now I had an E-mail exchange with both users. I know their real names and University IDs as well as the official University E-mail addresses. They appear to be separate people and the victims of a terrible coincidence and claim they even did not know each other before the incident. They work on different departments and have different status within their University. There is a small probability that one is a meatpuppet of the other, but it seems to be unlikely.</p>
<p>As I understand from <a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlex_Bakharev_c750.html#User:E104421" title="User talk:Alex Bakharev">DMC's messages</a> on my talk page the checkuser only confirms that they both are using the same University IPs, there is no other hidden indication they are the same people not available to all Wikipedians, so it is essentially a judgement call.</p>
<p>I think in this case we could assume <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and believe the editors, rather than lose two notable editors. I there will be no objections I will unblock E and K in a couple of hours. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">Alex Bakharev</a> 00:26, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No strong opinion on Karcha on my side, but I'll second Alex' opinion that E should be rehabilitated. Like Alex, I've been in contact with both users and found what I consider pretty strong evidence that they are different individuals (in addition to what I posted earlier). If there's consensus for a community ban on Karcha, let's get this clarified here - although my impression is his disruptiveness so far has not been quite up to the level where community bans have been handed out in other cases. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 09:06, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hello everybody. As I said before, I have nothing against the unblocking of E104421, as in case of doubts, as Alex noted, we should assume good faith. As for Karcha, I can only reiterate my belief that he should be blocked; and please, spare us sophisms like "oh, I didn't say kill iranism; I said kill paniranism: it's different". Was also calling Khorshid "Khorshit" a "political" position?. What I see, is a constant pattern of disruption.--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 15:12, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Firstly, I am not sure that I can post my oppinion here or not. If not. Please cancel it totally.</li>
<li>Why am I here; I was a kind of mediator.I contacted with these two users by mail and by phone later.I tranferred mails to some admins which they are take place in this discussion. I know the details, and something disturbed me in this matter.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>The major reason to block these users was <i>allegation of puppetry</i>. E104421 blocked temporarly for puppetry, Karcha blocked indefinitely for puppetry plus some distruptive behaviours.</li>
<li>Now, allegation of puppetry is failed.
<ol>
<li>E104421; no crime-no penalty, Unblocked. Ok.</li>
<li>Karcha; no pupetry crime, there is distruptive edits.
<ol>
<li>Karcha, now indefinitely blocked;Reason: distruptive edits.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Lets take a balance; lets put this crime one side and punishment to other side. If there is a balance, everything is ok.If not then no punishment/or another punishment is suitable.You can see also other users'(like as Korshid) distruptive edits/bad words.</li>

<li>I posted a message to Karcha some hours ago, to keepaway from edit-rv war.</li>

<p>I am second to Mustafa that it is kind of illogical to clear an account from the sockpuppeting allegations and permablock another one for been a sockpuppet. I am not a great fun of Karcha as an editor but since he is blocked for been a sock and the base of the allegations appear to be doubtful we should not probably reblock him. Maybe we could put him on Community Probation per <a href="../../../c/o/m/Wikipedia%7ECommunity_sanction_99c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Community sanction">Wikipedia:Community sanction</a>? So any admin who would find him disruptive could permablock him? The situation starts to look like as a Wheel War so I would not repeat my administrative actions, but I would be great if an uninvolved admin could review the situation. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">Alex Bakharev</a> 11:50, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

There is no question that Karcha has been disuptive in the past and made inappropriate comments and edit summaries. Also, Karcha has a definite tendency to edit with a nationalistic POV. However, there is a certain inconsistency to how these cases are being handled, and an indef block seems excessive. I agree that Community Probation would be a useful tactic. This would allow Karcha an opportunity to demonstrate some good-faith editing, while ensuring that he is closely watched. Further, I think some kind of Mentoring would be useful, preferably from an editor or admin who is familiar with the topics in question, and has some familiarity with the culture; I have a strong impression that much of this comes down to "cultural differences" and an incomplete understanding of how to "play well with others". I would request that the admins involved consider and discuss the possibilty that a combination of Probation and Mentoring would help Karcha become a more productive editor, thereby benefitting both the individual, and the project. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_Tropics_7009.html" title="User:Doc Tropics">Doc Tropics</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_Tropics_88a3.html" title="User talk:Doc Tropics">Message in a bottle</a></sup> 18:41, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>Just to add my two cents in as an editor who has been following this from the get-go. All I want to say is that we should try to be more lenient with relatively new users. Look, we have all joined Wiki at one point and were newbies at some stage. There was a point when we didn't know how Wiki and its rules worked. And let's not forget that Internet is international, when a university student from one corner of the world joins wiki, it might take some for him to adjust and learn to work efficiently in a completely international and free environment. A indef block right off the bat seems too excessive is all I am trying to say, I think he has gone through enough to understand that certain disruptive editing patterns will not be tolerated in the long run. I have run across other newbie editors who were engaging in certain disruptive editing (some of them that also seemed nationalistic) and I have always tried to tell them that they should concentrate on learning how Wiki works with an emphasis on a watch-and-learn attitude. In the end they always come around&#160;:)) I will also try to keep in contact with K about this and try to answer any questions he might have. A lame attempt at humor/insult by trying to make a pun out of a user's name from Khorshid to Khorshit shouldn't be the basis of an indef. I mean, nobody is Jesus, everyone looses their tempers at one point, let's ask him to apologize to that user. Just give the guy another chance, if he goes back to disruptive editing patterns, it can be dealt with accordingly. Even California has a <i>three</i> strikes rule, not <i>one</i>-strike rule.&#160;:))) Cheers! <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 11:07, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>New discussion:</b> The following discussion of a few days ago was archived too early. Emboldened by the failure to get any action over his blatant dishonesty, Shamir1 has now repeated the same stunt with help of his side-kick Amoruso. To summarise: Amoruso and Shamir1 are completely aware that there is a major unresolved dispute over the article but each of them individually asked for unprotection on the false claim that it was resolved. Edits <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_page_protection&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=89345073" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_page_protection&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=89345073" rel="nofollow">[55]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_page_protection&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=89345238" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_page_protection&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=89345238" rel="nofollow">[56]</a>. As soon as someone unprotected the article, Shamir1 did a massive revert to his preferred version <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Palestinian_exodus&amp;diff=89350027&amp;oldid=89345996" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Palestinian_exodus&amp;diff=89350027&amp;oldid=89345996" rel="nofollow">[57]</a>, vastly more than the minor point he had conceded on the talk page. Of course he hopes that next time it will be protected the way he likes. <b>Is this sort of abuse of the system allowed?</b></p>
<p>I ask again that action be taken to stop this behavior.

<p>Zero is being delusional. I asked for page un-protection because the debate over Habib Issa (you can see it was the only debated issue) was settled with me and Shamir accepting not to argue over it anymore.

You can see a summary of what occurred between the two of us in my post to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28assistance%29/Archive#Assistance_with_obstreperous_user" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28assistance%29/Archive#Assistance_with_obstreperous_user" rel="nofollow">Village pump</a>. So his allegations about stalking and wikilawyering were made against me first, and I have to be honest, Mactabbed is <i>definately</i> not on my friend list. I think Netscott is accurate in that Mactabbed is someone who has a good deal of experience with Wikipedia, given how quick he was to throw around the charge of Wikilawyering. <a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabercil_a2ff.html" title="User:Tabercil">Tabercil</a> 05:51, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>He's more than likely a sock of a banned editor.

<dd>So you found the source of that image and determined that he lied about taking it himself. I'm thinking that an indef. is in order here. <i>(<a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetscott_c779.html" title="User talk:Netscott">→</a><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott"><span style="background: white; color: grey">Netscott</span></a>)</i> 05:59, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I gave him a week, but what do others think? He's pretty obviously up to no good.

<dd>I suggest an indef. because this user is knowingly putting the project in jeapordy with the copyvio images (and who knows what else?).

<dd>Because it's up here for discussion, and other people are looking at it, so I don't feel a need to act precipitously.

<p>I wouldn't have hesitated to apply an 8 day block immediately (if I had a mop and bucket), but you're right <a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a>, a longer block could easily be justified, it just warrants some discussion. This appears to be a pattern of behaviour that is unlikely to change without some rather heavy-handed intervention. Perhaps a one month block, followed by community probation, and possibly a limited ban on contentious articles? This would represent the third "official" sanction (see his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Bosniak" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Bosniak" rel="nofollow">block log</a>), and we could reasonably apply a three-strikes-you're-out rule.

<dd>To throw in my two cents, Ryulong has been immensely helpful in procesing unblock requests. I usually first notice them when Ryulong alerts me to them on IRC. If something's an obvious decline, I see no reason why a non-admin shouldn't be permitted to decline it (much like non-admins are permitted to close deletion discussions if they are obvious keeps). --<a href="../../../s/l/o/User%7ESlowking_Man_5da9.html" title="User:Slowking Man">Slowking Man</a> 03:57, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I was going to suggest that someone just go and nominate him for adminship and we can be done with it, but I see that he's already been through two unsuccessful RfAs, the second only last month, so I guess that's not a good idea. While it's okay for non-admins to close obvious keeps in AfDs, I don't think non-admins should do unblock declines. The whole purpose of the unblock request is to get a second administrator opinion on the appropriateness of the block (and perhaps an examination of the blocker's motives), so non-admins should not be sticking their noses in. It opens up the possibility of collusion between editors (not that there can't be collusion between administrators) to keep an unfairly blocked editor blocked. I have no doubt that Ryulong here is doing good work here, but the issue is that justice must not simply be done, it must be seen to be done. And for that, a second administrator opinion is really necessary. <sub>└</sub>&#160;<sup><b><a href="../../../o/s/g/User%7EOsgoodelawyer_264a.html" title="User:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="blue">OzLawyer</font></a></b></sup>&#160;/&#160;<sub><i><a href="../../../o/s/g/User_talk%7EOsgoodelawyer_92f4.html" title="User talk:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="black">talk</font></a></i></sub>&#160;<sup>┐</sup> 04:36, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with this assessment. Closing unanimous keeps is very different from denying unblock requests.

<dd>Several of the unblock requests I have been dealing with are simple usernameblocks where the user does not know how to register a new account, malformed unblock-auto requests where the user is either directly blocked or there is an autoblock and the user needs to provide more information, unblocks that can't be done (such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Wandering_Star&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=89785888" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Wandering_Star&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=89785888" rel="nofollow">those who use Google Accelerator to edit</a>), or blatant denials that go along the lines of "no, you are not getting unblocked by calling [insert administrator's name] a faggot" (you can ask Khoikhoi of how I assisted him in the past week or so). I am not the only non-admin who goes through <a href="../../../r/f/u/CAT%7ERFU_768d.html" title="CAT:RFU">CAT:RFU</a>, and as Slowking Man himself said, I help more people out than I deny sockpuppets or other things.

<p>Ah, no not really. If you view Ryulong's first "RfA" in early August 2006, you can see that his closing of "unblock request templates" was an issue back then. So when he says he's only been doing it for the last few weeks, he's being disingenuous at best. Furthermore, it is rather troubling from a review of the "history" of this AN that Ryulong himself attempted to blank this thread about 3 times before finally being forced to respond by the community. So the bottom line is, is he going to stop like many admins have recommended, or not? Cocunuthead 17:39, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Anyway, I was not forced into replying. I did so on my own, and led to this. I see nothing wrong with denying unblock autos that are direct blocks or unblock requests from people who directly attack the blocking admin, or several blocking admins. I may not be able to actually unblock, just like I cannot delete an article. I avoid several unblock requests that are too complex or I do not know how to fix. Several of them are the AOL unblocks, that I help by telling them to register, as they are all anon-only, as is stated by someone up there. I did do it in the past, but I stopped and restarted only recently, and now I pay more attention. I saw that the OP for this did an unblock request, and I ignored it and let someone else deal with it. I can bet you that Coconuthead will also post an unblock request soon, and I too will let another user deal with it.—<a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryūlóng</a> (<a href="../../../r/y/u/User_talk%7ERyulong_923f.html" title="User talk:Ryulong">竜龍</a>) 01:48, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a> is relevant here, there's generally a limited amount of involvement in unblock requests...not enough to snow on (so to speak). I agree with a couple editors above when they say unblock requests should be performed by admins. Many times these are judgement calls, I think someone doing this should have had at least some vetting. <a href="../../../r/x/_/User%7ERx_StrangeLove_2537.html" title="User:Rx StrangeLove">Rx StrangeLove</a> 03:15, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The point of SNOW is that if there's a snowball's chance in hell that something will succeed, then you can prematurely shoot it down. Just like nominating the day's featured article for deletion (which is now a formal speedy keep clause, but didn't used to be), there is zero chance of that unblock request succeeding. You shouldn't have to wait for 5 or 6 other people to all come comment that you can't nominate the main page for deletion, you should just close it as soon as you see that nomination. I would hold the same to be true for obscene unblock requests. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> <small><a href="../../../t/j/s/User_talk%7ETjstrf_3ddb.html" title="User talk:Tjstrf">talk</a></small> 09:52, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It appears to me that there are three issues: 1) That the decline template says "an admininstrator" has reviewed, and Ryulong knows he's not an admin, 2) that the above poster was correct in saying that unblock requests are judgement calls, and the Wikipedia community has spoken clearly in two RFAs that they simply do NOT trust Ryulong's judgment in such matters, and 3) the issue arises as to what to do about Ryulong's usurpation of admin vestments . . .

<dd>Well I agree with Ryulong, while I see that there can be an issue here I do not feel Ryulong's actions were wrong. Admins handle a lot of bullshit, every thing from personal attacks, vandalsim control, and maintaining wikipedia. there are only 1,068 of us that have the admin privs and of those 69.69% are active. I think that adminship is <b>NO BIG DEAL</b> and thus if an nonadmin in good standing can render assistance to the admins I thank them. especially helping with unblocks. Ryulong is always on IRC if a user needs unblocked he can contact an admin on IRC I have never not been able to reach another admin there. just because someone fails an RfA that doesnt mean that they are untrustworthy. it just means that an overwhelming number if users dont support him. <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetacommand_e660.html" title="User:Betacommand">Betacommand</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/e/t/User_talk%7EBetacommand_bfb0.html" title="User talk:Betacommand">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Betacommand_4a01.html" title="Special:Contributions/Betacommand">contribs</a> • <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetacommandBot_3654.html" title="User:BetacommandBot">Bot</a>)</sup> 05:58, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>When adding this link, this spammer immediately follows up with another edit elsewhere in this article. I don't know why, but it seems like an attempt cover up his tracks, so to speak, since a simple check on the difference between current and last edit won't show the link added. By now, I think it's about time that an administrator had a look at this matter, since this spammer really doesn't seem to get it when warned by other editors. /<b>M.O</b> (<a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMagore_c109.html" title="User:Magore">u</a>) (<a href="../../../m/a/g/User_talk%7EMagore_308e.html" title="User talk:Magore">t</a>) 14:43, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - Perhaps a range block would be a suitable solution here? I have feeling that we haven't seen this spammer/vandal for the last time, although the site (ghosttracker.50webs.com) is now blacklisted and can't be linked to from Wikipedia articles. He seems intent on damaging the articles in question, when he can no longer link to his site. Abusive spammers like this one has no business on Wikipedia, thus a range block might be the most pertinent action in order to prevent further damage? /<b>M.O</b> (<a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMagore_c109.html" title="User:Magore">u</a>) (<a href="../../../m/a/g/User_talk%7EMagore_308e.html" title="User talk:Magore">t</a>) 00:25, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks HKelkar, I was and am short of words to express the nefarious activities of some anonymous editor and Abecedare's striving to support the nefarious activities. I have not grieved against the link you provided. I have objections against inclusion of some external links suggesting that Hinduism has it's roots in christainity or like things. While, I said non-Hindu editors, I meant the mischievous elements of other religion who try to downplay Hinduism and promote one's religion. No sane policy can support such nefarious activities. I fail to understand when everyone involved with Hinduism find it appropriate to remove the un-realiable links, why someone should be interested to have the same on talk pages? My earnest appeal to all here is help in preventing nefarious activities in the name of Wikipedia policy. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwadhyayee_16ab.html" title="User:Swadhyayee">swadhyayee</a> 04:22, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Note: I'm not actually an admin, I'm just trying to suggest (with a bit of gentle humor) that the best way to handle this situation would be to step back and take a breather. So far, no one has committed a violation worth issuing a block; the best way to avoid escalating the situation would be to edit elsewhere for a while before returning to contentious areas; consider it a kind or "working wikibreak". <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_Tropics_7009.html" title="User:Doc Tropics">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_Tropics_88a3.html" title="User talk:Doc Tropics"><font color="green">Tropics</font></a> 19:00, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't even want anyone to be blocked! What I <i>actually</i> requested (see above) was for someone independent in a position of authority to have a quiet word with Vintagekits and tell him to quit it with the <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> violations. I've tried resolving this with him on my own by leaving messages on his talk page (first step recommended by <a href="../../../r/e/s/Wikipedia%7EResolving_disputes_9a93.html" title="Wikipedia:Resolving disputes">Wikipedia:Resolving disputes</a>); you can see above how well that turned out. <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemiurge_afbf.html" title="User:Demiurge">Demiurge</a> 19:14, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>There is no such thing as 'someone in authority' on the site (other than ArbCom and the Foundation staff I suppose, but they are not used for this kinda thing). Everyone is equal - some just have extra mopping up abilities. As Doc Tropics says, the pair of you should just take a step back and calm down (try and think about this as if it were real-life. Would you continue to argue until it ended up as a punchout and then being arrested? Or would you break it up and walk away?). Looking at both talk pages I see both users being uncivil to one another - the only thing that will come from persuing this is blocks on both parties, as far as I can see.-<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a><sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 23:27, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree, the guy needs to chill out, he seems to think that all his edits are to be taken as law.

<ul>
<li>So what would you suggest as the appropriate response to someone who is blatantly uncivil to you, then edit wars to remove your civility warning tag from their talk page while simultaneously edit warring to put the exact same tag on your own talk page? I can't go to <a href="../../../p/a/i/WP%7EPAIN_2701.html" title="WP:PAIN">WP:PAIN</a>, because they require a npa3 tag which if I put it on his talk page will trigger another edit war. I don't believe I have been uncivil myself (certainly nothing on the scale of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Demiurge&amp;diff=90041525&amp;oldid=90038699" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Demiurge&amp;diff=90041525&amp;oldid=90038699" rel="nofollow">[107]</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Vintagekits&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=90000698" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Vintagekits&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=90000698" rel="nofollow">[108]</a>), can you be more specific? (In response to your analogy, I'd call over the bouncer and tell him "hey, that guy over there is being rude to me, could you tell him to give it a rest please?" which is <i>exactly</i> what I'm doing here.) <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemiurge_afbf.html" title="User:Demiurge">Demiurge</a> 23:54, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Well I would say that <i>Incorrect, someone needs to pull your reins in - you need to check your attitude and how you deal with and handle other editors - it in no wonder you attract so more trouble and vandals!</i> is uncivil to the same level as you state there. I would also point out that removal of warnings on a users talk page is not against policy but can be seen as indication of problems. Also, an edit war requires 2 parties or more to be a war - which indicates that you also edit warred.</dd>
<dd>As you say above, you should have put an npa3 warning on the page and seen where it went from there - if he removed it, so be it - that in itself is not a 'crime'. If he continued with incivility you could then have taken in to WP:PAIN.</dd>
<dd>So, as far as I can see - the situation spiralled out of control due to both parties taking things personally - take some time apart, don't interact and the problem will fade as far as I can see.</dd>
<dd>Also, my analogy above doesn't mention anywhere with bouncers... The arrests would be the equivelant of being blocked. We don't have bouncers here as I said.-<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a><sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 00:36, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>There are a number of single purpose user accounts that seem to have been created just for the purpose of promoting the religious group "Opus Dei". For example, User:Pradeshkava who seem quite well-versed in Wikipedia for someone who's got less than 100 edits. In the case of that user, for example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Pradeshkava" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Pradeshkava" rel="nofollow">his contributions</a> reveal that every single edit has been related to Opus Dei. I wouldn't be shocked to learn he's a sockpuppet, but given how many single purpose accounts, tendentious accounts there are promoting Opus Dei, I wouldn't really want to single out any one user to point the finger at being a puppetmaster for the purposes of checkuser.</p>
<p>Anyway, as of right now, Pradeshkava has been reported for 3RR violation, but that seems like it doesn't get at the heart of the matter-- which is to say, this user seems to be using Wikipedia to promote an agenda.</p>
<p>As an aside, there's a content dispute at <a href="../../../o/p/u/Opus_Dei_ef15.html" title="Opus Dei">Opus Dei</a> and its related pages. There are a few experienced wikipedia editors on one side of the dispute, while a very dedicated group of OD members who edit only OD-related articles are on the other side. I'm doing an RFC now, if anyone wants to comment (or help) on dealing with this situation, it would be <b>greatly</b> appreciated. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlecmconroy_3761.html" title="User:Alecmconroy">Alecmconroy</a> 10:00, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Single purpose account nothing, this looks like the makings of a community ban. He's obviously exhausted several editors patience (I remember going onto the commons to find a way to delete his idiotic Sweetest Day rant that he puts into the article, itself). He has done no constructive editting, and he is defaming the companies, claiming that they are one in the same and that they have a stake in Wikipedia's articles on them.—<a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryūlóng</a> (<a href="../../../r/y/u/User_talk%7ERyulong_923f.html" title="User talk:Ryulong">竜龍</a>) 22:55, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I didn't know (I know nothing about the greeting card industry), but I just checked. According to the article, the <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Trade_Commission_eba7.html" title="Federal Trade Commission">Federal Trade Commission</a> apparently complained that American Greetings and two other companies (not Hallmark) were engaged in price-fixing activities (nature not specified). Um, in 1952. Quick follow-up research indicates that this complaint resulted in on-again, off-again litigation between the FTC and American Greetings for several years (citations available). It's even conceivable that this dispute deserves a sentence or two in the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Greetings_c583.html" title="American Greetings">American Greetings</a> article, if someone looked up exactly what was alleged and the result of the litigation, although this would be appropriate only if the entire history of the company section were expanded so that this anicnet issue is not given <a href="../../../u/n/d/Wikipedia%7EUndue_weight_f869.html" title="Wikipedia:Undue weight">undue weight</a>. However, what this episode in the 1950's has to do with alleged conspiracy between American Greetings and Hallmark in 2006 remains beyond me. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 06:04, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not advocating a full-fledged community ban at this point. If the community sanctions proposal is in effect, this could be a perfect case for a narrowly tailored article or topic ban. As for RfC, I can imagine several purposes for holding these: (i) to gather facts as to a given user's conduct; (ii) to ascertain community sentiment as to the merits of the user's contributions; and/or (iii) to educate the user as to the fact that consensus is against him or her.

<dd>That is exactly why I suggested that a RFC would be useless, because months of talk page discussions between him and other editors, as well as the contributions themselves, seem to shine a bright enough light on the problem.

<p>In the course of looking through <a href="../../../r/e/q/Category%7ERequests_for_unblock_4c8c.html" title="Category:Requests for unblock">Category:Requests for unblock</a>, I've seen two instances within two weeks of what I think were rather blatantly inappropriate blocks by admin <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPMA_64d9.html" title="User:PMA">PMA</a> (<a href="../../../p/m/a/User_talk%7EPMA_6cc5.html" title="User talk:PMA">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PMA_1ffd.html" title="Special:Contributions/PMA">contribs</a>). Today, he blocked Elsmlie (<a href="../../../e/l/s/User_talk%7EElsmlie_1fac.html" title="User talk:Elsmlie">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Elsmlie_3ff4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Elsmlie">contribs</a>) for 36 hours for "POV edits, article degradation", based on a total of five edits by Elsmie made since 20 November, all evidently made in good faith, with which PMA happened to disagree. Not only is this an abuse of blocking policy by penalising editing in a good-faith and entirely undisruptive minor content dispute, but in addition it's also a blatant case of using admin weapons against an opponent in a dispute the admin is involved in. For all I can see, no other editors were involved in the dispute at all; there was no prior warning or even discussion, nothing.</p>
<p>Given these rather extraordinary circumstances, I've unblocked without further consultation with PMA (but notified him, of course). I invite further review of the case by other admins. I must say that, looking into PMA's prior admin log, I can see a couple more cases of what seem at first sight to be rather questionable blocks, so I'm considering whether an admin RfC would be in order. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 12:44, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>PMA, this isn't about penalising or persecuting you for trying to do the right thing. It's about your use of the block tool in a way that seems manifestly inappropriate.

<p><b>Good</b> that shadowbot is blocked. It used to revert (major) rv of contributory editors and used to give spam notice. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwadhyayee_16ab.html" title="User:Swadhyayee">swadhyayee</a> 07:53, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've temporarily shut down Shadowbot and removed any and all web sites that can cause problems from its spam blacklist, such as Livejournal and Geocities. Judging from Shadowbot's contributions, it appears that the problems encountered on Steve Irwin and other pages were caused by these rules. I plan to do an overhaul of the blacklist tonight to ensure that these problems <b>will not</b> happen again. I also think that Swadhyayee should note that Shadowbot has also been making good anti-spam efforts, along with the occasional bad revert.</p>
<p>Most of the problems that resulted in the block were caused, in part, by the bot supplying Shadowbot's edits. This bot is the one that maintains the initial blacklist, however, it is hosted by several users, and we often are forced to change hosts due to ISP problems, among other things. Due to the host switching, most of the bot clones are not kept in sync with each other, which means that I might remove livejournal from one bot, but the next one isn't aware of the deletion. I'm definitely going to fix this syncing problem before I even consider bringing Shadowbot up again. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadow1_a579.html" title="User:Shadow1"><font color="olive">Shadow1</font></a> <a href="../../../s/h/a/User_talk%7EShadow1_f31d.html" title="User talk:Shadow1">(talk)</a> 18:53, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>User:Otis Fodder is showing disruptive and incivil behavior far above and beyond the norm, especially in relation to Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Artist Formerly Known As Kurt Benbenek. Among the things that have been done:</p>
<ul>
<li>Refuses to sign comments</li>
<li>Arguementative for arguements sake. Consider these quotes:
<ul>
<li>"When you say "we" ("We don't want blogs, we don't want chat forums.."), do you mean that you're paid by Wikipedia and you speak for them and all involved with Wikipedia? If you're NOT being paid to debate and investigate articles (such as this BENBENEK article), why do you do it and why do you use the word "we"? Are you speaking for Wikipedia as a thing or as an internet corporate entity? Or is the "we" referring to only you? This will help me respond to your immediately-previous comment...because I worry when single individuals start throwing the "we" word around. Plus I'm a little new to Wikipedia as an open-source text phenomenon. Plus I'm too lazy to hunt down your "Wikipedia User Profile" and see if you're part of official Wikapedia management. I figure you're probably just eager to respond to just about anything any body throws on these ever-changing and well-formatted pages. My other guess is that you're a BOT, but Wikipedia BOTs are probably out on Thanksgiving weekend vacation. So, what is this "we" that you type of...?": <i>Stated in response to what I offered as what "we" at wikipedia look for in a "notable" and "verifiable" article.</i></li>
<li>"My dear mom (who was somehow born in the 20s in Missouri without the use of Wikipedic means of childbirth) always taught me to watch out for ***GROUP THINK*** and when some anonymous guy on the internet tells me to "follow the blue links" I think I better start worrying. Guy...guys...if you all really have raging hard-ons for deleting my nice, little BENBENEK article, then by all means cite Wikipedia authority and direct people to your blue links until you're blue in the face and get on with it. I figure the BOTs have the final say anyway in these important article matters...so...whatever" <i>In response to being directed to wikipedia's policies</i>.</li>
<li>"So, suddenly Wikipedia is all about "notability"...or maybe it's just a kind of high-tech, open-source popularity contest? Not that many people in the obscure-est reaches of Arkansas or Mt Everest know who Einstein was (or what he did) yet Einstein is in Wikipedia. There are thousands of entries in Wikipedia that ARE NOT of a "notable" nature. How unfair is it to discredit a simple entry on the basis of "notability" - this type of "notability-based" stamp-of-approvalocity is unfair and narrow-minded and should not be tolerated. It's interesting to see that four or five guys (always guys...) with little sense of the "real" world can make or break a Wikipedia entry. All the negative criticism of this entry is based on spurious INTERNET data. Has anyone called The Swedenborg Society or East Village Arts District for verification of these Benbenek entry claims? Nah, I doubt it." <i>In response to requests to provide sources for notability.</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>He also blanked the AfD discussion, and when it was restored, pagemoved the AfD discussion from <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Kurt_Benbenek_c5d7.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Kurt Benbenek">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Kurt Benbenek</a> to Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Artist Formerly Known As Kurt Benbenek (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/The_Artist_Formerly_Known_As_Kurt_Benbenek&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/The_Artist_Formerly_Known_As_Kurt_Benbenek&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">page history</a>).</li>
<li>He has a history of these kinds of disruptions to other AfD discussions.

<dd>Additional incivil behavior continues: See this quote from the above cited AfD:
<ul>
<li>"Hey, guys (and I use that term in kind reference to each and every one of you) you all sure certainly seem to be dragging your collective Wikipedia-enraged feet. Why hasn't anyone sent the real BOTS in? You know...the BOTs that Wikipedia management keeps in reserve for situations such as these. Every cry of "DELETE" only makes me more determined to fight tooth and nail to preserve the integrity and textual (and paragraphical) essence of what this proud and defiant "Artist Formerly Known As Kurt Benbenek" article means. Thanks! Have a great day! PS - ask yourself if your mom would want you to vote for deletion and then please vote your conscience...and also watch out for the BOTS. They seem to be everywhere in this Wikipedic Hell! "</li>

<p>The diffs support <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron</a>'s accusations, and this is some fairly egregious behaviour: blanking an AfD, and disrupting multiple AFds and articles. Furthermore, I checked some of his other contribs, and the few that haven't been reverted yet probably should be; he seriously lacks the language skills we would hope for in a serious contributor. All-in-all, it smells like troll, and I tend to think a block would be in order.

<p>Sorry to bother but I just wanted to inform the proper admins of the war going on in the CfD for the above category. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott">Netscott</a> and <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> have been arguing back and forth for the past couple of hours or so about whether the cat. has been up for deletion 2, 3 or 4 times or whatever. Besides that, they have been attacking each other verbally and this kind of bickering does not help the voting. It is true that discussion is important for CfDs, but this type of behavior is uncalled for. I am trying to remain as unbiased as possible. I did, however, cast a vote for the cat. so I do have an opinion on which way the vote goes, yet, my concern is that their behavior will affect any type of voting. At this point,honestly, it does not matter to me which way the vote goes. I do not know much of <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott">Netscott</a> but <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> has a history of being very argumentative and has been banned in the past. I ask of you to please stop their bickering and to end the voting for the category as soon as possible.

<dd>Our discussion is over at this point. We've both made our points... and managed to remain rather civil if a bit heated. <i>(<a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetscott_c779.html" title="User talk:Netscott">→</a><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott"><span style="background: white; color: grey">Netscott</span></a>)</i> 05:16, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am glad to see it is over, but the admins do need to see what happened. As I mentioned, it was extremely disruptive for the two of you to be bickering over it. I don't know if you are a new editor or not but <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> is a veteran and should have known better. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetsFan76_ea64.html" title="User:MetsFan76">MetsFan76</a> 05:20, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think he's a new editor (I'm certainly not). I think it's pretty safe to say that so long as a discussion remains civil there's not much harm done. I'd venture to also say that it is normal that back and forth exchanges like this are typical in controversial areas (of which this one certainly is). <i>(<a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetscott_c779.html" title="User talk:Netscott">→</a><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott"><span style="background: white; color: grey">Netscott</span></a>)</i> 05:23, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree with you except for the fact that admins and people who want to vote have to read through the entire soap opera to get an idea what's going on. Who has time like that?

<dd>Well the point of XfD is not voting... it's actually discussion... that attempts to reach a consensus... so while a discussion may get long that's generally seen as a good sign. <i>(<a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetscott_c779.html" title="User talk:Netscott">→</a><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott"><span style="background: white; color: grey">Netscott</span></a>)</i> 05:29, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would like to remind everyone involved in this debate that CFD is not a vote, but a discussion. A closing administrator should not mearly count "deletes" and "keeps". The arguments expressed are important, resonance with policy is important, precedent is important, the behavior of those that participate is important. The more that admins rely on "vote counting" the more people will game the system. I think one good argument is more important than a score of impassioned "votes". -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuelWantman_9090.html" title="User:SamuelWantman">Samuel Wantman</a> 05:27, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Take a look at this user's contributions. He is almost certainly a troll. New users do not come to Wikipedia knowing how to upload images and where to find the RfA page. Also, most of his article edits are probably vandalism; he simply changes words and then inserts his signature into the article.

<dd>I'm not an admin, but I would like to add my comment: NorbertArthur has for sure been asking for it, and he has been repeatedly engaging in inexcusable behaviour - the worst part of it was in Romanian. I was the target of such an outburst after I had asked him (for a second time) to write family name first in category brackets for articles on people (where he kept intervening). Judging by other users' talk pages, I see that he has done most of his trolling in Romanian.</dd>
<dd>Let me add that there is not a single piece of writing which could be cited as valuable from this user. In fact, all he has done was to create forks, use personal guesses to replace data, and create a problem in many articles by confusing and confounding Romanian people who live abroad with Romanian-born citizens of other countries and with Romanian ethnics who have lived their entire lives in foreign countries. Refusing to pay attention to guidelines, he has also uploaded copyrighted material - knowing full well that it was not public domain (this IMO, equates vandalism). As far as wikipedia is concerned, he is merely a habitual troll. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 20:32, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I came here and I say the following things: you are all a gang of hipocritic racists against the Romanian nation. I tried now for almost an year to do something, but with people like you there's no way back to recuperate. I'm not sorry at all for what i wrote and I'll be <b>never</b>! This wikipedia is for me just a shithole on Internet and I will tell you why, because its based on lyings and on point of view from other people (ex. Mikkalai, Khoikhoi). I not a accusing you <b>user DC76</b> at all and I respect you of what you did. I know me too to use a polite language <b>for people that I respect</b> and for people that I don't respect like 95% of the wikipedia i usa that language. The respect is <b>deserved</b>. And for my future I will continue to edit wikipedia for one purpose: to destroy it. Nobody here knows that beyond my username NorbertArthur I'm the "owner" of an another 15 usernames that I edit on and no one of you will can fin out that 'cause its very good hidden. I'm not sorry for what I'm doing and you don't have the right to judge me ok? I proposed not one, not ten but hundred ideas, I think even more then 70 sources that where prooving what I was sustaining, you ignored all. to arrive a common point but I realized that you people are too low-minded to understand and that there's no purpose anymore to help just to destroy. The stupid admins like Khoikhoi they juste see the things against me, they don't see what <b>me</b> I endured from all you others by insulting my country and my people. But, there's always a way of neutral point. If everybody here will try at least to be one time in their life to be sincere and to listen to the other and not being racists, I promise and personally engage to stop all this and colaborate in good aim. But that will not happen I'm sure. I think I said all I had to say and explain.<br />

<dd>Hi everybody, I would like to point out that <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorbertArthur_ab3b.html" title="User:NorbertArthur">User:NorbertArthur</a>'s remarks coppied above were in response to my post <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Romanians#Keep_the_discussion_academic" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Romanians#Keep_the_discussion_academic" rel="nofollow">here</a>. <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">User:Khoikhoi</a> has pointed to me this response of his above, and here is our <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Dc76#Romanians_article" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Dc76#Romanians_article" rel="nofollow">discussion</a>.</dd>
<dd>I do not know NorbertArthur, because I am relatively new on Wikipedia. But I noticed his first rude remark he made a couple days ago in the subject line of the article <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanians.html" title="Romanians">Romanians</a>, resulting in that article being blocked. Prior to the incident I also edited a little that article; there was a dispute, some people agreed to come to some middle solution, but several others continued their prefered warring, and everything we suggested was immediately reverted. For example, me and Khoikhoi supported diferent POV, but somehow we were able to talk and find common ground. If it were just we two, this article would have been long settled. I guess the simple fact that some users supporting differnt POV try to talk to each other is perceived by some as "treason", and even in majority by number, we are being dismissed. Despite the fact that there are 10+ editors in that article, the edit war was basically between three users: NorbertArthur against tow others. The propositions from both sides were going to the extreme from edit to edit until NorbertArthur perhaps did not resist, and started his famous now remarks. You know the rest of the story. Just as the extreme edits by the three users before, NorbertArthur's remarks after the block increased exponencially in rudeness from response to response. In an interval of less than 3 day to go to such lengths, wow! I agree with Doc Tropics's comment above, he had a very-very passionate crash.&#160;:-)</dd>

<dd>Isarig's <i>opinion</i> is unlikely to be enforceable as <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libel.html" title="Libel">libel</a> in the US -especially as he would be able to point to published charges of antisemitism/antisemitic comments made by others against Cole. This does not mean that Will, as a lawyer, could not make life difficult for him via a <a href="../../../f/r/i/Frivolous_lawsuit.html" title="Frivolous lawsuit">frivolous lawsuit</a>. Isarig <i>has</i> been blocked for violating NPA, however, that was apparently not enough for Will, and his legal threats amount to harassment of his "opponent". Will should be blocked, ideally permanently, as he's shown no acceptance of WP's mission, culture, or processes -or any progress towards it.

<dd>Wikipedia should avoid libel whether or not it is technically actionable - armon's claim that a libel claim may not be enforceable in one particular country is hardly a reason for Wikipedia to endorse libelous statements. In addition, the U.S. Supreme Court has clearly held that opinions can be actionable as libel -- the case <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milkovich_v._Lorain_Journal_Co._4dc7.html" title="Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co.">Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co.</a> held that opinions can be libelous insofar as such opinions "may often imply an assertion of objective fact." (In this particular case, the "opinion" certainly does imply such an assertion and would be actionable if someone chose to pursue it). I find armon's insistence that Will be blocked permanently to be distasteful, as he appears to be trying to use Wikipedia policy to remove an ideological opponent. Will's statements that Isarig should avoid libel do not appear to me to be threats or personal attacks. <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 03:54, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I have had no respone from him or others on this matter other than this preemptive action from Isarig's sockpuppet. there are some other complaints I need to make against other persons for gross incivility. if this is the proper place to make it then here goes. It is the grosses violation, and entirely uncalled for. Because it is in the edit line, it's permanent and can't be erased. It's for keeps.

I deny I made a legal threat to Isarig. I advised him that he had subjected the Wikipedia foundation to libel with his namecalling and he needed to stop it. And I also said that if others didn't report him that I would. I put it on my talk page because he has a habit of deleting warnings on his talk page. I put it on the Cole talk page to get feedback to see if somebody had already noticed it because I had no feedback from Isarig about it and I didn't know how to notice it. And I will tell Professor Cole about this because he is a friend of mine and it's funnier than hell that Isarig would get so vulgar. Here is somebody that is wikilawering and turning people in all the time for the slighted imagined rule violations and going aroung libeling people in the grossest way. He can't be allowed to get away with this. Maybe he's already been punished for it, I don't know. Please advise. I have had no feedback.

<dd>Will may be a lawyer, but it is a stretch to claim that "advise" is being used in such a legal sense in that sentence. It is doubtful that Will is Cole's lawyer and it is unlikely that Cole would accept Will's counsel under the circumstances. But I believe the problem here is not Will -- if Wikipedia is sued because of a statement that Isarig published, it is Isarig and not Will who is at fault, whether or not Will is the lawyer who initiates such a lawsuit. <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 03:58, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If was pretty obvious what was being implied.

<dl>
<dd>The word "advised" is very common and is often used in non-legal settings. As a university professor, for example, I often "advise" students. In another example, I often "advise" friends (or seek "advice" from same) on personal matters. I believe <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/advise" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/advise" rel="nofollow">this</a> may help clear it up. I have no way of knowing whether it was Will's intent to use the term in a particular way, but I assure you that it is even possible for lawyers to use the term "advise" in a non-technical sense. Will may have simply meant that he intended to send Dr. Cole an email. That doesn't necessarily excuse the action, but it does make it a lot less sinister than is being implied here. I would add, again, that the legal problem, if there is one, lies with the party posting illegal content, and not the party who takes action (or who informs someone) of said content. After all, we don't need a legal adviser to expose something that has already been posted to a public website.<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 07:52, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, then Will's threats were utterly unnecessary other than for trolling and/or harassment. As for the "ultimate meaning" of "advise" or "inform", we might as well argue about what the meaning of <i>"is"</i> is, rather than putting it in the context of Will's posting of <a href="http://www.juancole.com/2006/10/wikipedia-karsh-and-cole-encyclopedia.html" class="external text" title="http://www.juancole.com/2006/10/wikipedia-karsh-and-cole-encyclopedia.html" rel="nofollow">WP talk page debates on Cole's blog</a> to solicit POV warriors, his "ends justify the means" approach to editing here, and his complete lack of regard for any policy other than <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>.

<dd>I'm a newby and there's a lot I don't understand. But I don't think legal threats have been made. In my neck of the woods one might "advise" someone of something, and you'd only be telling them it happened. You'd not be suggesting they sue, nor would you be "advising" them of how to go about sueing someone.</dd>
<dd>What is much, much more worrying is that Isarig is apparently free to post <i>"(Cole is a jewbaiter, so his jewbaiting quotes are in. thsi was moved to v&amp;C, but you've deleted V&amp;C, so it's back here)"</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Juan_Cole&amp;diff=87446122&amp;oldid=87402322" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Juan_Cole&amp;diff=87446122&amp;oldid=87402322" rel="nofollow">[133]</a>. This would be a deeply unpleasant slur even if it was genuine - and to accuse supporters of Israel of potential <i>"dual loyalty"</i> is not (on the face of it) jew-baiting.</dd>
<dd>I trust Isarig doesn't mind others referencing the fact that particular people are Jewish - oh, look, he takes considerable objection <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Isarig" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Isarig" rel="nofollow">[134]</a> <i>"what relevance does the alleged Jewishness of the lead prosecutor have to do with the article?

<p>I do not know about any prior history with this user, but in this particular case it looks like an overly aggressive response to the patently inappropriate comment by <a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsarig_bbf7.html" title="User:Isarig">User:Isarig</a>.

<dl>
<dd>I agree with Centrx; this is over the top. Particularly when you consider that proportionally, Isarig was apparently blocked for only 1 day for the inappropriate content itself. So the message is that it may be bad to post libelous comments in edit summaries, but it is 45 times worse to "threaten" to advise someone about inappropriate things being said about them on a public web page. Had the editor simply informed Cole rather than "threatening" to inform Cole, we would consider his actions common courtesy rather than legally threatening. <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 23:49, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have tried to Assume good faith in Srkris, however, his constant disrespect seems to signal that he is not at all innocent. I hope he is warned to not only participate in a constructive, NEUTRAL manner, but about his overt disrespect towards other Wikipedians (evidenced above from the humour he finds in something obviously quite serious, as well as when he rolls on the floor laughing ("ROFTL") and "Haha" in [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Carnatic_music&amp;oldid=90192246|Carnatic" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Carnatic_music&amp;oldid=90192246|Carnatic" rel="nofollow">music discussion page</a>].) His attitude needs to change.</p>
<p>Srkris' version of the facts are somewhat distorted compared to what actually happened - it seems he is not innocent. There is no absurdity or falseness. There was indeed agreement in deleting images of Modern artists in the article <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carnatic_music.html" title="Carnatic music">Carnatic music</a>, as is evidenced in [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Carnatic_music&amp;oldid=90210294|Carnatic" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Carnatic_music&amp;oldid=90210294|Carnatic" rel="nofollow">music talk</a>] - it was agreed that the images would be deleted until the issue was resolved - the issue of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> with why some modern artists pictures were on the article rather than others, and whether such images are appropriate in an article that does NOT focus on modern artists). Instead of signalling his disagreement, or respecting the wishes of another WP:Wikipedian to let this issue be resolved by discussion before reverting, he chose to revert AGAIN [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carnatic_music&amp;oldid=90009478|here" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carnatic_music&amp;oldid=90009478|here" rel="nofollow">[141]</a>] to the version with images in question, and ONLY after this, does he bother placing warnings on my page and the Carnatic music page concerning <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>. He then puts a warning regarding vandalism too. He then has the audacity to claim I am dictating views on others, when he seems to be guilty of the same.</p>
<p>His latest reply in <a href="../../../c/a/r/Talk%7ECarnatic_music_1cb6.html" title="Talk:Carnatic music">Talk:Carnatic music</a> is further evidence. He misleadingly states that all I do is "undo other's painstaking work" - this is both disrespectful, unreasonable and defamatory. He suggests I haven't tried writing an article on Wikipedia from scratch before, and also explicitly states that the only reason the reverts have continued was because I think "The article doesnt need images other than what I upload" - which is untrue, regarding the latest edits and reverts, as can be seen in [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carnatic_music&amp;action=history|history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carnatic_music&amp;action=history|history" rel="nofollow">of reverts</a>]. His defamation didn't stop after the first warning, nor did his assumption of bad faith, after my first warnings. His failure to <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assume_good_faith.html" title="Assume good faith">assume good faith</a> in dealing with other editors is a serious issue.</p>
<p>He seems to have violated <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> on several occasions, notably and openly when requesting intervention <a href="../../../p/a/i/WP%7EPAIN_2701.html" title="WP:PAIN">WP:PAIN</a> against another member. He has blatantly insulted their behaviour, when he needs to have a look at his own from a neutral point of view.</p>
<p>I hope the administration will warn him about his behaviour so that it will improve in due course, without interfering with his and others contributions to Wikipedia.</p>

<dd>No, actually this is a long term problem. A <i>very</i> long term problem. f and also, more controversially, here: (links deleted by the anon, and by me, 23:32, 29 November 2006 (UTC)) Both of these pages were deleted by Jimbo himself as part of a negotiation with this person. What his part of the deal was I do not know, but if it involved <i>leaving us alone</i>, he's broken his part. We may wish to get Jimbo himself to weigh in on this. I believe that several people were on the verge of opening an ArbCom case against this person because of his persistent abusive behavior and POV-warring, in addition to his general inability to get along with any other editor in any manner at all.</dd>

<p>Minor offtopic comment, can the page on GRP be deleted? I highly doubt it'll be recreated by the subject if it was deleted by Jimbo during talks with him and SW hasn't be recreated yet. A suggestion... 68.39.174.238 02:16, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>When I saw the dispute over the Hollywoodland article, I tried reasononing with the anonymous user (who did jump around on various IPs), I tried explaining the policies, and I tried explaining that reverts are not meant as personal attacks. They seem a bit paranoid, and they don't seem to place much value on civility. They are very defensive of their edits, and I think their conduct is unbecoming of a good faith editor. <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVerkhovensky_cd5c.html" title="User:Verkhovensky">Verkhovensky</a> 02:18, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Reply, verkovesky was told what to do, then when one of the people left a note on his page i am a troll i lost my cool, i did not mean to, and yea, i understand these things sounds mean, but again, when will one nice administrator look into suggestions,i am sick of being accused for all these months of being vandal, i may be uncivil at times (but mostly i am not), BUT I CAN NOT TAKE THIS ATTACK AND ATTACK AND SO ON. I simply try to improve few links on wiki and you call me troll, shame on you. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 64.107.0.166 (<a href="../../../6/4/2E/User_talk%7E64.107.0.166.html" title="User talk:64.107.0.166">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.107.0.166_f066.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.107.0.166">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>Many of us have tried to reason with this editor. God knows we've tried. I for one am weary of it. We've tried to explain civility, NPOV, calmness, no personal attacks ... he has responded with extended campaigns of vandalism, revert wars, "I WIN I GET MY WAY,YOU ADMINS ALL VANDALS," other similar comma-spliced invective, torrents of e-mail to Jimbo (which is why the pages are deleted), --and yet he keeps coming back. Again, again, and again. This time I noticed that many people were colliding with him but none seemed to notice that they were not alone, and that there was a long story here. He seems to have valuable knowledge on a lot of topics, but a complete inability to work with other people in any kind of collaborative enterprise. It seems to me utterly hopeless.</dd>

<p>Antandrus was never fair, nothing else, he reasoned with me? he never helped me, did he ever ever try to fix the proble, no, never, ever, hopeless, where were you when i needed assistance all the way back in january, where were you, shame on you, you are one of the 5 administrators i had problems, with the rest, i was able to communicate (even though they were no help at all) what grammar error, i dare you find those errors, none and good to know u unblocked that page, for long time i wanted to know what's that, 90% is pure garbage and nothing to do with me. I do know who you are and you keep on playing games, that will not be forgiven... If i do something wrong, where is your assistance, none, if i do things right, which they are mostly right, where is thank you, ok, good job, never, why, you do not want to be seen wrong. Also why do you use name of GOd, God knows, God knows you did everything wrong, from very beginning with instruuctions to revert everything on site, also wales clearly said not to recreate the site and what are you doing, so many of you administrators do not belong here. So far only Ray wants to talk to me about why certain link should be included. And who knows if you can even reply to this and prove anything you say.</p>

This was arguably incivil, and Tbeatty called him on it (and made a counter-point, invoking Occam's Razor). SalvNaut then struck out the "lie" part and replaced it with a more neutral phrase.

<p>I'm sorry MONGO, I'm just not seeing it. Occam's Razor comes up an awful lot in philosophical discussions and the most common admonitions to someone using it are "watch out, it cuts both ways" and "don't cut something important". It's certainly not a threat of physical harm at all; it's merely an intellectual play on words, with Occam's razor being imagined as a literal razor that is snipping through overly-complex ideas. It's not a "matter of perspective"; you're simply trying to twist the meaning of an innocuous statement to turn it into an actionable threat. I would suggest that, in the future, you don't threaten to use admin actions against people you're involved in content disputes with; if you're so involved you cannot accurately interpret what they're saying, you certainly shouldn't be blocking them for it. Please call in a third-party observer next time. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 23:37, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

In that case there was not even a thin justification like this 'threat of violence with Occam's razor'... rather a direct statement that he would use his admin position to 'win' the content dispute. While the community largely gave him a pass (incorrectly IMO as that block threat was beyond the pale) there was a general agreement that he should refrain from admin actions/threats for disputes he is involved in.

<p>Hi, I would like someone to look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Juan_Cole&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Juan_Cole&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">recent history</a> of the page and note csloat's <i>continual</i> page disruptions. At the moment, it hasn't got to 3RR, but it's frustrating to deal with an editor who incorrectly thinks his veto trumps the consensus on what is, or isn't to be included, and engages in ad nauseum arguments on talk which will only result in incivility and further frustration. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmon_3172.html" title="User:Armon">&lt;&lt; armon &gt;&gt;</a> 05:21, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ad nauseum comments on talk are how disagreements are supposed to get resolved. Csloat seems to be making a good faith effort to document the source and reasoning behind their input. At the moment, I see a lot of talking past each other on the talk page; it's a little disruptive on both sides, but there's nothing on first inspection that's a policy violation. This doesn't seem like it needs any ANI involvement. Try harder on the talk page in good faith, please. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 05:32, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>OK well do think this is a good case for mediation? Seriously, the discussion has gone nowhere for months. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmon_3172.html" title="User:Armon">&lt;&lt; armon &gt;&gt;</a> 06:23, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Mediation is never a bad idea, or maybe an article RfC. I don't disagree that it seems to be a long running nonproductive argument, but there being a long-running nonproductive argument doesn't equal a policy or abuse issue. These are what mediators and article RfCs and such are for. Neither side on first inspection has really abused anything, but figuring out how to perhaps come to an actual understanding with someone else's help might be worthwhile. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 06:33, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Mediation and/or RfC sounds great to me -- really, I would be happy about any way of bringing other voices into the discussion, which has become dominated by people with an agenda. I don't think it is productive for editors to continue making misleading statements about "disruption" to WP:ANI or throwing around false charges of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Commodore_Sloat&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=90379593" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Commodore_Sloat&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=90379593" rel="nofollow">vandalism</a>. This is a content dispute, not a dispute about violations of Wikipedia rules, and it is not a good idea to pursue content disputes as if they were rules violations. It's also courteous to let someone know you are reporting them (or to warn them beforehand) -- I think the goal should be to encourage disruptive editors to edit more productively rather than to "discipline" them. In any case, it's clear that I have not been disruptive on the page, but I look forward to bringing more voices into the discussion; I certainly agree with Armon that it has become unproductive. <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 22:54, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have an opinion on what is and isn't notable, I do not have a nefarious "agenda". csloat (and Will, below) appear to have trouble making that distinction, or understanding that whatever <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AJuan_Cole&amp;diff=90115198&amp;oldid=90113424" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AJuan_Cole&amp;diff=90115198&amp;oldid=90113424" rel="nofollow">your agenda happens to be</a>, it's not appropriate to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Juan_Cole&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=90364243" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Juan_Cole&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=90364243" rel="nofollow">edit according to it</a>.

<dd>I don't think I ever used the word "nefarious" or that I singled you out as the only editor with an agenda. There is no evidence of "disruption" in any of the comments you have cherry-picked out of those discussions. There is evidence only that I have tried to vigorously defend WP:BLP, WP:NPOV, and WP:RS. You may see those rules different from me and that is where the content dispute arises. I am welcoming additional editors to the content dispute who don't have a "horse in the race" since I think both of us (and Will and Isarig and Elizmr) have pretty clear opinions on the issue. You are raising charges of "disruption" - which have now been rejected by an admin who looked at the page - in order to prevent one side from participating in the discussion. As I said, the Wikipedia rules are not there to be used as a hammer when you feel you can't support your arguments in a content dispute. Personally, I think it is disruptive to claim "vandalism" when there is none or to post charges to WP:ANI that are invalid on their face. Let's discontinue this nonsense and get back to discussing the article, shall we? <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 20:46, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I guess i've gotten unblocked. Armon thinks the Cole page biography needs to be about Karsh smearng Cole with the protocols of Elders of Zion qote. this has been going on for about a year and a half. the page was protected at one time because of this. Even jimbo wales made an appearance. The matter was resolved by starting a separate page for V&amp;C where the invidious Karsh Elders of Zion quote could reside. Now the V&amp;C page has been done away with. And the Cole detractors want to make the "Protocols" live in spite of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. Cole is not an ant-semite or new-anti-semite. However, he is a critic of a greater Israel or denial of the rights of the Palestinians. This puts him squarely in the gunsights of certain people. Juan Cole deserves a fair shake on Wikipedia and fighting for a fair page is not "disruptive." CSloat just happens to be of the Jewish faith. Moreover, he is a university professor. I don't know why he wastes his time reasoning with the seemingly unreasoning. More wikilawering to silence perceived ideological opponents. Sorry, I just have to tell it like I see it. It's called integrity. Will<a href="../../../6/5/2E/User%7E65.184.213.36.html" title="User:65.184.213.36">65.184.213.36</a> 22:44, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This message was in my e-mail when I logged on:</p>
<p>JonMoseley &lt;xxxxxxxx@xxxxxxx.net&gt; to me</p>
<p>I demand that you TERMINATE Raul654 from any rights or authority at Wikipedia. Raul654 is pushing a left-wing BIASED perspective on the page for Global Warming. There are numerous false statements which I corrected -- backed up by clear citations for each point. I allowed those statements to remain but BALANCED the discussion with CITATIONS to hard facts. And rather than confront the hard citations that I provided, Raul654 HID FROM HIS ATTEMPTS TO LIE in the Wikipedia article by blocking me. He did not identify anything incorrect about the corrections I provided. He did not counter with any other citations to the contrary. He only LIED and said that the matters had been previously discussed on the Talk page. THEY HAD NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED ON THE TALK PAGE. The first mention was today. If Wikipedia is exposed as being a nest of left-wing activists, it will harm the entire enterprise. Trust me when I say I have the news media connections to make the truth clear.</p>
<p><br />
Does anyone know the background to this and is prepared to comment/resolve the issue? I will post a message linking to here to Raul654 as well. <a href="../../../%28/a/e/User_talk%7E%28aeropagitica%29.html" title="User talk:(aeropagitica)">(aeropagitica)</a> 14:19, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think you would need an option to block users e-mail ability, isn't easier to just set up a filter to automatically delete mail from the users e-mail address? Anyone willing to use multiple e-mail accounts would be willing to make multiple wikipedia accounts as well, so that advantage is removed. You could, however, block account creation, but would that work on a registered account? If the e-mail block was set to work with the autoblock to circumvent multiple account creation it limits the number of e-mails people blocked as collateral damage can send.

I don't intend to defend the edits of a possible sockpuppet, but something really needs to be done about the entrenched POV-pushing throughout the Chávez articles. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESandyGeorgia_ca9b.html" title="User talk:SandyGeorgia">Talk</a>) 17:39, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Since you did a check on me already, adding my name to your GuardianZ list, and found me to <i>NOT</i> be a sock <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser#GuardianZ" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser#GuardianZ" rel="nofollow">[159]</a>, please stop STALKING me. I only posted one investigation into Skinny McGee (1 for socks and 1 for ckuser), which already turned out to be trued. I then realized it had been going on far longer and wanted to recheck, just to be sure to check everyone. I am only trying to be fair. You continually hounded the editors on the opposing side and now you are hounding EVERY post I make, whether it be a report or a simple suggestion about archiving, or to check out all the users. This is my process before I can make a fair assessment of all the sides in a dispute—I need to know who and how many I am dealing with. If you choose to hinder the process, it won't help matters. <b>Firm request for block</b>. Because Skinny McGee has been socking, he should be punished with a ban of his sockpuppets and at least a 3 day block for himself. Same punishment was afforded to GuardianZ per Dionyseus' requests/checks. Let it be the same for Skinny McGee. Fair is fair. <a href="../../../p/e/a/User%7EPeacekpr_8f03.html" title="User:Peacekpr">Peacekpr</a> 11:06, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have never hidden behind sockpuppets. When I first started editing, I just used my IP address. When I realized that was frowned upon, I created my user name and have been editing under that ever since (except when I occassionally think I'm signed in, but am not - but I've gotten much better at that lately). As <a href="../../../d/i/o/User%7EDionyseus_52e5.html" title="User:Dionyseus">Dionyseus</a> mentioned, I have already explained that <a href="../../../d/e/f/User%7EDefender99_cc59.html" title="User:Defender99">Defender99</a> is my husband, and he only made one very non-controversial edit to the article (which <a href="../../../p/e/a/User%7EPeacekpr_8f03.html" title="User:Peacekpr">Peacekpr</a> chooses to reference here). <a href="../../../o/r/o/User%7EOroboros_1_800e.html" title="User:Oroboros 1">Oroboros 1</a>/<a href="../../../g/u/a/User%7EGuardianZ_b24c.html" title="User:GuardianZ">GuardianZ</a> were continually inserting promotional material for Joseph Vargo and were linking to sites created by Joseph Vargo that are defamatory to the band, and to articles in which Joseph Vargo defames the band (<a href="../../../o/r/o/User%7EOroboros_1_800e.html" title="User:Oroboros 1">Oroboros 1</a> is a confirmed sockpuppet of <a href="../../../g/u/a/User%7EGuardianZ_b24c.html" title="User:GuardianZ">GuardianZ</a> and has been banned infinitely - the two of them would actually "talk" to each other and even appear to disagree). I did not want to let that stand, so I felt I had no choice but to revert. I have never tried to hide what I was doing. I was just trying to protect the integrity of the article the only way I knew how to protect it. Also, I find it very suspicious that <a href="../../../g/u/a/User%7EGuardianZ_b24c.html" title="User:GuardianZ">GuardianZ</a>, who was so vehemently fighting over the article, would just disappear after her block for sockpuppetry and be replaced by <a href="../../../p/e/a/User%7EPeacekpr_8f03.html" title="User:Peacekpr">Peacekpr</a> who has done nothing but attack me. - <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkinny_McGee_2caa.html" title="User:Skinny McGee">Skinny McGee</a> 16:10, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>I'm not an admin, but from the outside looking in, this appears to be a content dispute that has boiled over a bit. I don't see any real evidence of sockpuppetry on the part of <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkinny_McGee_2caa.html" title="User:Skinny McGee">Skinny McGee</a> in regards to <a href="../../../d/e/f/User%7EDefender99_cc59.html" title="User:Defender99">Defender99</a> as there is exactly 1 edit by <a href="../../../d/e/f/User%7EDefender99_cc59.html" title="User:Defender99">Defender99</a> who <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkinny_McGee_2caa.html" title="User:Skinny McGee">Skinny McGee</a> contends is her husband. There is an active sockpuppet investigation request <a href="../../../s/u/s/Wikipedia%7ESuspected_sock_puppets_Lizstjames_d9e9.html" title="Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Lizstjames">here</a> and any action should pend on this. I do find it a bit curious though that the editor bringing this up had his/her first edit as an extensive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Peacekpr&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=89395726" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Peacekpr&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=89395726" rel="nofollow">"fact finding"</a>. As much as <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkinny_McGee_2caa.html" title="User:Skinny McGee">Skinny McGee</a> is a single purpose account for editing <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midnight_Syndicate_7b23.html" title="Midnight Syndicate">Midnight Syndicate</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/a/User%7EPeacekpr_8f03.html" title="User:Peacekpr">User:Peacekpr</a> seems to be a SPA for investigating editors who contributed to that article. The article is locked right now anyway, so I recommend all parties be <a href="../../../c/o/o/WP%7ECOOL_e649.html" title="WP:COOL">WP:COOL</a> wait for the outcome of the sock investigation, and remember... you are fighting over an article on a band that doesn't even meet the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> guidelines.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 17:00, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I posted a complaint there and it was removed, on the grounds that I hadn't gone through all the prescribed warning steps and that there was no evidence that these were not legit edits. IF you consider the various anonIPs used as separate users, then perhaps this stance by the AIV folks makes sense. When it's clearly one person cycling through many IPs, it doesn't.

<p>If I'm in the wrong place, please redirect me. There is a user who has spent a night replacing [[GNU/Linux]] with [[Linux|GNU/Linux]] in around 75 articles. There was no reason for this, and IIRC it violates WP policy. Maybe they misunderstood what disambiguation is, or maybe they think this is a useful thing to do, or maybe it is part of building support for/against a rename the article with the <a href="../../../g/n/u/GNU_Linux_naming_controversy_e0ad.html" title="GNU/Linux naming controversy">controversial</a> name "<a href="../../../l/i/n/Linux.html" title="Linux">Linux</a>", or maybe it is part of a two-step plan to replace the name "GNU/Linux" with "Linux" (first "dab" the link, later "dab" the text).

<dd>It's common practice to disambiguate links when they point to a disambiguation. This is nothing to be concerned over, as it was obviously a good faith effort to help out 0 see <a href="../../../d/i/s/WP%7EDISAMBIG_0cde.html" title="WP:DISAMBIG">WP:DISAMBIG</a> (and I currently see no problems with it). If you have a real problem with the changes, feel free to revert them yourself, but it would be helpful to explain <i>why</i> you're reverting back (sorry, but I'm still unclear), and to leave a reason on the user's talk page. I also might like to remind you of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, an official Wikipedia policy. -<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatstuart_7fbf.html" title="User:Patstuart">Patstuart</a><sup><a href="../../../p/a/t/User_talk%7EPatstuart_e8fd.html" title="User talk:Patstuart">(talk)</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Patstuart_a3f0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Patstuart">(contribs)</a></sup> 12:30, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Gronky, can you please explain what the problem is here? It looks to me like he is changing the link from <a href="../../../g/n/u/GNU_Linux_4a58.html" title="GNU/Linux">GNU/Linux</a> which is a disambig page, to the actual article on "Linux (also known as GNU/Linux)" located at <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linux.html" title="Linux">Linux</a>. Usually when a link leads to a diambiguation page, we try to diambig the link and direct it straight to the precise article. I don't understand what the problem is. Sarah Ewart (Talk) 12:39, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The only problem I can see now is that the dab page at <a href="../../../g/n/u/GNU_Linux_4a58.html" title="GNU/Linux">GNU/Linux</a> has apparently been rather controversial, forever switching between being a redirect to <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linux.html" title="Linux">Linux</a> and being a dab page. As long as it was a redirect, the rules at <a href="../../../r/e/d/WP%7ERedirects_f116.html#Don.27t_fix_links_to_redirects_that_aren.27t_broken" title="WP:Redirects">WP:Redirects#Don't fix links to redirects that aren't broken</a> would apply, but given the instability of the target, I agree it's highly preferable to have all links go directly to the stable real article. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 12:41, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, Fut.Perf., that is that policy I was thinking of. And thanks to all three for the quick responses. However, the controversy you've seen is not the one I was talking about (and is quite small and irrelevant). There is a large debate ongoing over whether GNU/Linux should be a redirect to Linux, or should it be that Linux is a redirect to GNU/Linux, or should they be two seperate articles. For this reason, that users' actions fit the above policy due to the effects on <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirects_with_possibilities_c528.html" title="Wikipedia:Redirects with possibilities">possible future articles</a>. Should I now go to those 75 articles and express my preference by doing the same replace? Surely the policy exists exactly to prevent silly situations like that. The current note of encouragement on his/her userpage doesn't seem to lead to a productive or even neutral outcome. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGronky_aa0a.html" title="User:Gronky">Gronky</a> 13:13, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There's no need to do anything. As long as the articles which were edited are actually meant to link to an article that describe the operating system, the links are fine now. Even if it should later be decided that the Linux page should be moved, to <a href="../../../g/n/u/GNU_Linux_4a58.html" title="GNU/Linux">GNU/Linux</a> or wherever else, all will still be fine. As long as <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linux.html" title="Linux">Linux</a> itself doesn't become a dab page... <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 13:24, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>&lt;after ec&gt;I still can't see any reason to do a mass revert of those changes. With regard to <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirect_36c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Redirect">Wikipedia:Redirect</a>, it's a guideline, not a policy. And it doesn't say that once those changes have been made, they should be mass reverted. I think it would be better to talk to the editor who made the changes and try to resolve the issues that Fut mentioned above. Edit warring over it is not the way to go.

Apart from blatantly violating the ban, this new account was once again involved in copyright violations and in personal threats. I have rolled back all identifiable contributions that I could find as per <a href="../../../d/e/n/WP%7EDENY_da3a.html" title="WP:DENY">WP:DENY</a>. However, given that this is approximately the 11th sockpuppet created for this long-term abuser, it is clear that Cute 1 4 u will create a new account before the end of the week and resume the abusive behaviour. What additional steps can we take to enforce the ban on this user? The user edits from a series of dynamic IPs in the Chicago area which makes an IP block unreasonable. However, I am sick to death of dealing with this long-term vandal and it is taking us weeks, not days, to track down each new account. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 15:53, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
