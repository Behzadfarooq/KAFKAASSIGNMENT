<dd>These two may need some forced dispute resolution - they seem only interested in getting the other editor blocked.

<dd>I've tried to work with these users, but their actual responses to my questions are usually rather incoherent or begging the question. On the other hand, they are repetitively battling across a variety of articles and there has been no success in stopping this dispute. I give Venki some credit for trying mediation, even though he listed an absurd number of people as parties, making his attempt futile. Anyway, overall, I don't think giving both of them what they want would be a bad idea. Of course a number of socks would follow, but from what I can tell, they should be fairly easy to catch; these two users have very specific things in mind for these articles. Do what you think is best here. Thanks. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 23:14, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Block 'em both for a couple of weeks so they can calm the hell down, and make it clear that if they continue to lose sight of the "build an encyclopedia" concept, those blocks will be lengthened. We've got like 1.7 bajillion pages around here; seriously, can they <i>not</i> find different articles to edit? <a href="../../../e/v/u/User%7EEVula_5373.html" title="User:EVula">EVula</a> <span style="color: #999;">// <a href="../../../e/v/u/User_talk%7EEVula_6eaa.html" title="User talk:EVula">talk</a> // <a href="../../../e/v/u/User%7EEVula_admin_63be.html" title="User:EVula/admin"><span style="color: #366;">☯</span></a> //</span> 23:58, 31 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>A mid-length block for both might work.

<dd>Perhaps it is that I am a mere neophyte in comparison to individuals such as yourselves. My humble apologies for not reading all of the <i><b>Talk</b></i> pages as I am still learning this marvelous entity called Wikipedia. My adding information and editing information to the <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turtle_Creek_Chorale_7f8e.html" title="Turtle Creek Chorale">Turtle Creek Chorale</a> article was to improve the overall completeness of the Wikipedia. I have requested that the TCC add a notice granting permission to release their rights to Wikipedia for educational and informational purposes. This is of course to add more accurate and completeness, which is what I hope every contributor wishes. As they are a US 501(c)(3) Not-for-profit organization which seeks to educate, unite and uplift their audiences and members, it would be harsh to state that they are advertising on Wikipedia. In fact, you could view almost any article about a person, organization or corporation as a living advertisement. KZ, I love the superscripts on your Talk &amp; Contrib, perhaps you can teach me how to use them sometime. Happy writing...see you in a couple days after we work this out with TCC website.

<dd><b>Whoa</b> Fairuse violation, yes, but as this is now code on the page, not a template, it does NOT violate T1. Nail it on fair use, and dig thour the Userpage rules, but these ceased being templates after they were sub'd. You can embed a template, and you can substitute the code of the template onto the page, two different things. Watch out for the over reaching instructions, it sets bad precedent as subing T1 UBX's before deletion has been somewhat commonplace, and it can allready be easily handled under other rules violations allready -<b><a href="../../../a/k/m/User%7EAKMask_da48.html" title="User:AKMask"><font color="#990011">M</font></a></b><sup><a href="../../../a/k/m/User_talk%7EAKMask_4b56.html" title="User talk:AKMask"><font color="#990011">ask</font></a></sup> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Alaska.svg_3df9.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/e/e6/Flag_of_Alaska.svg/20px-Flag_of_Alaska.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="14" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Alaska.svg_3df9.html" /></a> 19:37, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Anyway, I brought it here specifically to get that question answered since I haven't dealt with it before. I see at as roughly equivalent to having a userbox saying, "This user is opposed to international terrorism" and including a picture of George W. Bush on it. It is definitely divisive and inflammatory, like the deletion log said. I believe they should go and I am not sure why Khoikhoi subst'ed them right before deleting them.

It may be that they are distinct individuals whom Bless sins had recruited onto Wikipedia, or at least to the depictions discussion.

<dd>It turns out that many of the edits from this anon are happening at the same time Bless sins is editing but on different articles. See for example the edits by this anon IP <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/206.126.81.88" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/206.126.81.88" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>, at the exact same time Bless sins is editing another article while logged in, if you check Bless sin's contribution log.

<dd>The blocking was forewarned by <a href="../../../g/a/i/User%7EGaillimh_1708.html" title="User:Gaillimh">User:Gaillimh</a> but not 'discussed' in any meaningful sense. It was strictly a 'do it or you are blocked' ultimatum. <b>Play Brian Moore</b> is what the user signs signs all his edits; which was (I think) the compromise reached in 2005. In order to see the "Fenian Swine" you must go to his Userpage. Furthermore, as an avowed Fenian himself (a claim supported by his contributions) he states his use of "swine" is ironic. In this case, given all the facts and previous compromise two years ago, it seems to me that this blocking is totally OTT and not in the <i>spirit</i> of Wikipedia.

<dd>As the blocking admin, I'll note that the name "Fenian Swine" is indeed blatantly offensive (and he was, in fact, originally blocked for just that reason). With regards to the username policy, and the aforementioned section in particular, <i>Usernames that are recognised as slurs or insults</i> are disallowed. Such usernames fall under the scope of what is labelled <i>Inflammatory usernames</i> on the policy page. This applies to this user, as a "Fenian" is sometimes used as an insult directed at Catholics and nationalists. However, if someone is a member of <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sinn_F%C3%A9in_5dd5.html" title="Sinn Féin">Sinn Féin</a>, he might identify himself and his mates as Fenians, where no insult is intended. It's a bit confusing if you're not from Ireland, and the only similar comparison I can make is that it's a bit similar to when African-Americans use the word "nigga" as a substitute for "mate" or "friend." Conversely, when those outside of the African-American community use the word, it's usually in a disparaging tone. One can see that this user is attempting to use the word "Fenian" as an insult as his full username is "Fenian Swine." As you may already know, swine is a term for pig, which is almost never used in a flattering term. Ironic or not, the username is ridiculous and disparaging towards Catholic nationalists. In addition, if one looks at my discourses with the user, one will see that I had asked him to change his username beginning eight days prior to the block being issused. During this time, I attempted to work with this user and was rebuffed several times. I also ignored his incivility in the hopes that he would change his username. That is, the block was used as a last resort <a href="../../../g/a/i/User_talk%7EGaillimh_5024.html" title="User talk:Gaillimh"><font color="#008000"><span style="cursor: w-resize"><b>gaillimh</b></span></font></a><a href="../../../g/a/i/User_talk%7EGaillimh_5024.html" title="User talk:Gaillimh"><sup>Conas tá tú?</sup></a> 19:12, 1 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>For a 2 year old user account, blocking is not the correct answer, and its certainly not the last resort. WP:RFCN is the right place to go. Disagreeing with you on changing his username is not appropriate grounds for blocking unless there is community consensus per WP:RFCN. For an account just created, I can understand blocking and posting to RFCN upon the user's request <i>if this were a new account</i>, but this particular block was very much the wrong action to take. --<a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAutocracy_4fe0.html" title="User:Autocracy"><span style="background:darkblue; color:white"><b>Auto</b></span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../a/u/t/User_talk%7EAutocracy_ca14.html" title="User talk:Autocracy"><span style="background:#B0C4DE; color:black"><i>talk</i></span></a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Autocracy_0ad6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Autocracy"><span style="background:#B0C4DE; color:black"><i>contribs</i></span></a>)</sup> 04:21, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Reposting old thread, as I've done some research into it.</i></p>
<p>This user has been tagging many newly created articles for either <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProposed_deletion_cb76.html" title="Wikipedia:Proposed deletion">proposed</a> or <a href="../../../s/p/e/Wikipedia%7ESpeedy_deletion_1a12.html" title="Wikipedia:Speedy deletion">speedy</a> deletion, and many of those same tagged articles have been expanded into viable aricles by other myself or others(usually the creators). I though he/she was just overzealous; but eventually, his/her prod/speedy tagging of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_KLF_651e.html" title="The KLF">The KLF</a>(well beyond stub-level)drew a vandalism warning from <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">User:Kingboyk</a> who reverted it back to the last pre-tagging edit. I then realized that he was clearly causing trouble; so I started monitoring his recent edits regularly, and have to revert or de-tag about dozen of prod/speedy tagged articles(none of which I created) a number of which again were expanded to decent articles. To top things off, earlier today he/she vandalized <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devil%27s_advocate.html" title="Devil's advocate">devil's advocate</a> by inserting c's into the middle of several interwiki links. Because a registered user made a good faith edit and failed to notice it, I had to remove the c's myself. Based on the fact that he/she has clear knowledge of prod/speedy deletion policies and abusing them, I'm not ruling out the possibility that this IP may be a sock/meatpuppet of a more prolific deletionist vandal... <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERanma9617_c5d0.html" title="User:Ranma9617">Ranma9617</a> 01:58, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

And while attempting to "explain" to me why my additions were wrong, he referred to me as an "Armenian joke" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:MarshallBagramyan#Rmvl_of_AG_reference" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:MarshallBagramyan#Rmvl_of_AG_reference" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>. He furthermore continues with accusations that I am a part of fringe Armenian political party (the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_Revolutionary_Federation_c3c3.html" title="Armenian Revolutionary Federation">Armenian Revolutionary Federation</a>, (ARF) ) whose sole purpose is to essentially terrorize Turkish related articles, that the party supposedly terrorized Turks 100 years ago, and continues to do so now on Wikipedia: "<b>ARF members are attacking everything they found honorable around</b>, this time Ataturk, They are constantly deleting significant information that proves they made mistakes." One successive attack after another, all because he believed my additions were too insulting to the person in question the article is about.</p>
<p>Later, my propositions on the <a href="../../../v/a/n/Van_Resistance_871b.html" title="Van Resistance">Van Resistance</a> talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Van_Resistance#Opposition_of_deletion_of_content." class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Van_Resistance#Opposition_of_deletion_of_content." rel="nofollow">[38]</a> turned hostile when the same user became indignant about them, and again attacked my people as a whole: "<b>When history is written by Armenians with Armenian lexicography it is nice</b>, but rest is bad and ugly. Truth has no value in these arguments" , "MarshallBagramyan says: ""LETS get rid of it" <b>Of course. There is a group of Armenian soldiers which votes to get rid of even the name of these activities</b>" , "It is so dogmatic <b>that the people like MarshallBagramyan 's view of history</b> [my note: that is, in reference to us Armenians]; if the answers of these questions are not in his/her history book (lets say the bible of the truth) the questions are not (or should not be) valuable questions."</p>
<p>All these comments and yet he still feels that it is necessary to add the comment "thanks" at the end of his messages. This user is well-versed on Wikipedia's policies and hence reminding him of so elementary rule seems redundant. I hope the proper action is taken.

<p>Yesterday evening Daniel Brandt e-mailed me with a proposal to allow him to begin editing again. Brandt has been banned for a while now due to spats with some of our administrators; he has been editing Wikipedia since then using a number of sockpuppet accounts.</p>
<p>The premise of Brandt's proposal was that he has a lot to contribute to Wikipedia. He runs NameBase, a comprehensive database of biographical articles citing thousands of reliable sources. Brandt is an "old-school" researcher who would be invaluable to our biographies of living people. Although some people may have old fights to pick with him, he suggested a mentorship to prevent personal disputes from disrupting his editing.</p>
<p>I have decided to take a <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> action in the interest of improving the encyclopedia and allow Brandt to start editing again.

<p>Well, to anyone who unblocked me, thank you! I know I'm not the most liked person here, but I promise to at least try to not cause any trouble. I will of course continue my work off-wikipedia, but I welcome any constructive criticism, and I will certainly take the mentorship under concideration.

<p>This user edited the article Orane Community, which I placed a speedy tag on (I later noticed that he did not actually create the article, but it still seemed non-notable). Then he removed the speedy tag four times, getting a full set of warnings from me, and then placed the hangon template on the article. I did not revert that, but then he removed both the speedy and hangon tags. Should he be blocked and the article deleted, or have I done something wrong? <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacintosh_User_611f.html" title="User:Macintosh User">Macintosh User</a> 18:38, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Before I could get on to reporting these two users, you probably should know who Danny Daniel is. Danny Daniel is a user who vandalized pages related My Gym Partner's a Monkey and Zatch Bell!. His confirmed sockpuppets like to create hoaxes and vandalise articles related to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Fairly_OddParents_90b9.html" title="The Fairly OddParents">The Fairly OddParents</a>, <a href="../../../m/y/_/My_Gym_Partner%27s_a_Monkey_1e4d.html" title="My Gym Partner's a Monkey">My Gym Partner's a Monkey</a>, <a href="../../../f/o/s/Foster%27s_Home_for_Imaginary_Friends_4c3c.html" title="Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends">Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/-/Re-Animated_5392.html" title="Re-Animated">Re-Animated</a> and anything related to anime. He created a hoax article called Monk (Cartoon Network). All of this would eventually get him blocked indefinitely for vandalism on December 21, 2006. See this <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_checkuser_Case_Danny_Daniel_17aa.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Danny Daniel">Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Danny Daniel</a> for more information about this vandal.</p>
<p>I already notified <a href="../../../p/e/r/User_talk%7EPersian_Poet_Gal_f352.html" title="User talk:Persian Poet Gal">User talk:Persian Poet Gal</a> about this, but she says that she can't log on right now, so I decided to report this here. Anyways, I found two possible sockpuppets of Danny Daniel. They are <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChoolabuuulba_96f1.html" title="User:Choolabuuulba">Choolabuuulba</a> (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Choolabuuulba_7cd8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Choolabuuulba">contribs</a>) and <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBooooomerang_0580.html" title="User:Booooomerang">Booooomerang</a> (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Booooomerang_3dc2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Booooomerang">contribs</a>). Both of these accounts have similar editing patterns to that indefinitely blocked user. In fact, Choolabuulba even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Astro_Jam&amp;diff=119131468&amp;oldid=118384000" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Astro_Jam&amp;diff=119131468&amp;oldid=118384000" rel="nofollow">edited</a> a page created by Booooomerang adding on to the hoax with more misinformation and lies.

Both seem to be vandal-only accounts. To top it all off, Boooomerang has created a hoax page called Jeanie Meanie Minnie Mo. Note how it seems to relate to the television shows <i>The Fairly OddParents</i>, <i>Ed, Edd n Eddy</i> (see the parts about Jib), and <i>Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends</i>. Danny Daniel's sockpuppets seem to "like" creating hoaxes like that.</p>

<ul>
<li>Really? Name three examples of user space essays being linked in the body of Wikipedia space content. Some broadly used resources are kept in User space, and linked from other places, but I can't think of any that are essays. If any time content is "userfied" the creator can just replace all the links to the original with links to the User subpage, then much of the point of the process is lost. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 00:43, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Several of my essays are linked to from project space, and linking from AFD discussions (that are in the project namespace) to user-space essays has been a common practice for several years. See <a href="../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_User%7ERaul654_Raul%27s_laws_c6ab.html" title="Special:Whatlinkshere/User:Raul654/Raul's laws">Special:Whatlinkshere/User:Raul654/Raul's laws</a> and <a href="../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_User%7ESilensor_Schools_bbdc.html" title="Special:Whatlinkshere/User:Silensor/Schools">Special:Whatlinkshere/User:Silensor/Schools</a>, for examples. "Cross-namespace linking is bad." is superficial and wrong, which is probably why you are having a difficult time explaining it. A better statement would be a specific one: We don't link from the article namespace to other namespaces (except the category namespace), because it causes problems for mirrors, and causes articles to make no sense anywhere other than on Wikipedia itself. (See also <a href="../../../s/e/l/Template%7ESelfref_ae94.html" title="Template:Selfref">Template:Selfref</a>.) But links between the project namespace and user namespace are <i>not</i> prohibited for those reasons.
<p>Now whether a link to <i>this particular essay</i> is appropriate is a different matter. My essays and <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilensor_Schools_46ba.html" title="User:Silensor/Schools">User:Silensor/Schools</a> are not humour, and linking to them is not a matter of "I wrote a humourous essay, too!". So the consideration is not the namespaces but is, in part, whether the link is an aid in the effort of working on the project, and how far it is across the threshold beyond which user space starts to turn into Uncyclopedia. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:53, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>For the past several months <a href="../../../p/e/j/User%7EPejman47_4bc1.html" title="User:Pejman47">User:Pejman47</a> has been trying to remove any mention from the article lead that <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad_6e5e.html" title="Mahmoud Ahmadinejad">Mahmoud Ahmadinejad</a> is infamous for his alleged antisemitism and Holocaust denial. The lead itself uses multiple impeccable sources to merely state that he has been accused of it, and also includes his own defense that he is not; it was difficult consensus hammered out amongst multiple editors. After finally giving up on deleting the material, more recently Pejman47 has decided to insert an argument that Ahmadinejad cannot be antisemitic because Persian Jews aren't officially persecuted, and because his office once donated some money to a Jewish hospital. It has been pointed out on the Talk: page that this argument is <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, and that he has misrepresented his sources. However, rather than dealing with the issue, he insists that he can insert whatever argument he wants to invent for the sake of "NPOV", and that he will revert 3 times a day for that purpose. His most recent Talk: comment states <b>"I have done my 3rr today, take care till tomorrow!"</b>. I am requesting a block under the following <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> clause:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The rule does not convey an entitlement to revert three times each day, nor does it endorse reverting as an editing technique; rather, the rule is an "<a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_fence.html" title="Electric fence">electric fence</a>".<sup id="_ref-electric_fence_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-electric_fence" title="">[1]</a></sup> Editors may still be <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">blocked</a> <i>even if they have not made more than three edits in any given 24 hour period</i>, if their behavior is clearly disruptive. This particularly applies to editors who persistently make three reverts each day, or three reverts on each of a group of pages, in an apparent effort to game the system."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am hoping that such a block will convince Pejman47 to respect policy, and use the Talk: page, rather than assume that 3RR is a game where you revert 3 times, then wait for the next day. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 20:14, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This isn't a discussion of content, but of your stated aim to game 3RR. That kind of attitude is antithetical to productive editing on Wikipedia, which should be the product of consensus-building etc., and not one of wearing down your opponent. <font style="color:#22AA00;"><b><a href="../../../t/e/w/User%7ETewfik_396b.html" title="User:Tewfik">Tewfik</a></b></font><font style="color:#888888;"><sup><a href="../../../t/e/w/User_talk%7ETewfik_b384.html" title="User talk:Tewfik">Talk</a></sup></font> 20:57, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

This is not a content dispute. <a href="../../../o/r/a/User%7EOrangemarlin_8532.html" title="User:Orangemarlin">User:Orangemarlin</a> continues to label me as a "creationist" on talk pages related to <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">Evolution</a> and the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation-evolution_controversy.html" title="Creation-evolution controversy">Creation-evolution controversy</a> in an effort to discredit me among other editors who frequent those pages, many of whom naturally have strong feelings against creationists. I've explained (very reluctantly) that the label is inaccurate and that I find his comments and attacks (e.g., "whiny little creationist") offensive. I've attempted for some time now to resolve this issue amicably, or at least courteously. My attempts to simply remove his personal attacks and labeling from article talk pages, even being careful to leave appropriate content, have been reverted by him. I object very strongly to allowing him to leave those attacks and labels on the talk pages for any period of time, therefore I request a block.

I put a subst-prod on it, and he removed it twice (although hiding behind an anonymous IP address.) He also created articles about the two characters he allegedly plays on As the World Turns, and vandalized another page (<a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Divins_482b.html" title="Charles Divins">Charles Divins</a>) by editing it to state that this person (who actually does appear on As the World Turns) is his son. He also vandalized several other pages (see my user contributions from 3/31 and 4/1 where I attempted to clean up some of them.) Additionally, he recreated an article called WHAA-TV after it was speedily deleted. This article was a copy of all of the text in the <a href="../../../w/a/b/WABC-TV_f943.html" title="WABC-TV">WABC-TV</a> article where he just changed the call letters to some fictitious station.

<dd>From the blocking policy <i>"A user may be blocked when his/her conduct <b>severely disrupts the project</b> — his/her conduct is inconsistent with a civil, collegial atmosphere and interferes with the process of editors working together harmoniously to create an encyclopedia."</i> . (emphasis mine) I feel it's borderline. No one else even bothered to remove the attack until I came along and other editors replied to it. It doesn't appear to have disrupted the debate on the page.Other admins mat very well disagree and decide to block him.

<dd>Well, it's nothing to do with me! I would say as a caution however that frustration often brews when good-faith editors see such abysmal behaviour passing by with little of no action- and problems may subsequently arise that could easily have been prevented. I don't see an editor abusing another editor like this ("Fuck You" and so on) as acceptable. It's a curious system- sometimes blocked are handed out for nothing, or next to nothing, whilst in a case like this- that seems to be fairly clear-cut- nothing is done. Anyway, I shall shut about it since it's beyond me to interfere, even if I wanted to. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 10:57, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This user appears to be making disruptive edits to dozens of userboxes, including changing the language used in stable <a href="../../../b/a/b/Wikipedia%7EBabel_d383.html" title="Wikipedia:Babel">Wikipedia:Babel</a> templates like <a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUser_fr-0_c397.html" title="Template:User fr-0">Template:User fr-0</a>. He/she is also adding an aggressive/hostile section titled "DO NOT . . . " to the page of many of these templates. See <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PatPeter_50ef.html" title="Special:Contributions/PatPeter">Special:Contributions/PatPeter</a> for numerous examples of such edits.</p>
<p>I first noticed this behavior when I reverted an edit made by PatPeter (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:User_fr-0&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:User_fr-0&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[60]</a>), and then his/her response was this very incivil post on the talk page (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template_talk%3AUser_fr-0&amp;diff=119569559&amp;oldid=26000793" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template_talk%3AUser_fr-0&amp;diff=119569559&amp;oldid=26000793" rel="nofollow">[61]</a>). All of this certainly appears to be inappropriate and disruptive behavior, and I don't know what to do about it, other than posting here hoping that an admin can help.

<dd>They're not NPOV, but they (mostly) seem to be good faith. Obviously, this is an author who regards this scientist as a villain and charalatain, but he added significant <i>laudatory</i> information as well as significant damning information. There was an escalation, of course, with charges that the guy lives on the Internet and posts nonsense, but I suspect that was a complaint about the article. Nevertheless, the matter should be discussed on the talk page. The factual bits, if they can be referenced, would be useful for the article. If <i>Nature</i> did dismiss him, that should be verifiable. If the board did oust him, that would be verifiable. The BLP issues come from the lack of references. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:17, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Well, I won't <i>block</i> Anynobody for trolling, and I doubt anybody else will either. But otherwise I agree with Justanother: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Editor_review/Anynobody" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Editor_review/Anynobody" rel="nofollow">this Editor review</a> is a mere troll. I was just thinking of taking it to ANI myself. It's an attack page, lightly disguised as a request for review of Anynobody's dispute resolution skills—and guess what, the example dispute turns out to be that between Anynobody and Justanother— very inventive! And as JA points out, it comes on top of some very strange use by AN of other processes, notably a <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_adminship_Anynobody_0aa8.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for adminship/Anynobody">rather frivolous RFA</a> devoted to attacks rather than any realistic attempt to attain adminship. I should declare an interest here: I'm one of the people attacked, see especially the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_adminship_Anynobody_0aa8.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for adminship/Anynobody">RFA talkpage</a>. Anyway, I recommend people to take a look at this request for editor review, it's quite a document. In my opinion it should be deleted as misuse of process. Being one of Anynobody's targets, I won't delete it myself, but somebody might like to. Anynobody, please stop all this, leave Justanother and the other people you resent alone. Abandon the idea that you must triumph over your "enemies" at all costs, walk away. I honestly think you'll feel better. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 15:42, 1 April 2007 (UTC).</li>

<dl>
<dd>I concur with the above opinion. It was my feeling that, even if the user is gaming the system, the system needs to be honored somewhat. If there were 48 hours without actual progress from someone other than Anynobody at the editorial review, I was going to delete it. If there were 24 hours without any comment from another party, then I would delete it. The point is that this is trolling, but trolls are best starved, not whacked. At the peril of <i>again</i> being misread, I suggest that these are virtual tarbabies: the more you strike them, the more you stuck you are, and so few people are listening or interested in what Anynobody is saying that I suspect it can fail with a whimper. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 15:56, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Tom. Thanks for your help with the phony Editor Review. Yes, you are right, that is the beginnings of an RfC or ArbCom on <a href="../../../s/m/e/User%7ESmee_be9e.html" title="User:Smee">User:Smee</a> (formerly Smeelgova). Certainly my user space is the appropriate place for me to work on it. It goes without saying that those are charges against Smee that I intend to pursue. Another editor has already added his experience. After Smee's promise to reform and as a sign of good faith (please see my User Talk) I have put it on hold. If I see a turnaround then I will save it off-wiki and delete the page. I must say, however that, so far, reviews are mixed on Smee. A couple positives but a few negatives too including misrepresentation on my talk page and her unwillingness to accept that I will not delete the page until I see some change. She very much wants the cart before the horse. But I remain hopeful. Thanks for your time. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 01:17, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

People abusing the rules in order to simply say the same things over and over is no good. In fact, abusing AN/I for "tell me again and again and again" is abuse. Tom, don't answer.

<dd>Paul McCann, Chief, Public Information Office, UNRWA Headquarters Gaza, writes, in part that: <code>The Weekly Standard's characterization of Peter Hansen, UNRWA's Commissioner General as an anti-Semitic "peasant-in-chief" is <b>pure slander</b> and an insult to the intelligence of the magazine's readership.</code> David Tell responds in part that: <code>One of the books in question, for instance, turned out to include such evocative lessons as this: "Treachery and disloyalty are character traits of the Jews and one should beware of them"; UNRWA's researchers advised the State Department <sup><b>{{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}}</b></sup> that the phrase could not fairly be considered offensive because it described actual "historical events."</code> <sup>(from <a href="http://www.tomgrossmedia.com/mideastdispatches/archives/000578.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tomgrossmedia.com/mideastdispatches/archives/000578.html" rel="nofollow">[78]</a>, bold is my emphasis)</sup> Perhaps this unsourced statement in good enough for the standards of the <i><a href="../../../w/e/e/Weekly_Standard_59f2.html" title="Weekly Standard">Weekly Standard</a></i>, but I hardly see why they should be good enough for Wikipedia.

<p>I'm not sure what policy this would fall under, but it seems like a really questionable thing to do. One editor here has been unable to insert his point of view into a particular article (COI as well) and has written an article on his website detailing what he thinks is wrong with wikipedia in general, and this specific article, as well as instructing readers to come to wikipedia and "fix" these things. That's his business, he has every right to do that.</p>
<p>But recently an editor sent a newcomer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Crystal_Healer&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=119143323" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Crystal_Healer&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=119143323" rel="nofollow">a welcome message that included a link to this advocacy page</a> ("For a perspective from another author on paranormal coverage in Wikipedia, go here."). This seems like a big conflict of interest and encouragement to do POV pushing (both the new editor and the one have already engaged in some blatant POV edits, and this seems like an attempt to recruit potential bodies to help in revert wars and such). I'd appreciate if an admin would take a look at this and either make a recommendation or take whatever action is appropriate. At the very least, is it appropriate to remove the link to the advocacy site? --<a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMinderbinder_2383.html" title="User:Minderbinder">Minderbinder</a> 14:45, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Earlier today, I received a private complaint about libelous information being added to this page by <a href="../../../i/m/s/User%7EImstillhere_db58.html" title="User:Imstillhere">User:Imstillhere</a>. I reviewed the matter, and found the edits in question to be inflamatory, potentially damaging, and cited to a non-specific source: a clear violation of BLP. A few minutes ago, I took the emergency step of deleting the page, restoring it without its edit history, and imposing page protection.</p>
<p>I am not an entirely uninvolved party in this matter. I have been active on the Warman page for some time, and have reverted edits by Imstillhere on more than one occasion. Under normal circumstances, I would not have carried out these administrative actions myself; given the existence of BLP concerns, however, I decided that I would be justified in taking extraordinary steps.</p>
<p>Could I please request that:</p>
<ul>
<li>an uninvolved administrator review my actions, and determine if they were appropriate?</li>
<li>an uninvolved administrator review Imstillhere's recent posts in the deleted page history, and determine if (i) they constitute BLP violations, and (ii) deserve some form of censure?</li>

<p><small><i>Moved back from archive</i></small></p>
<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>User:195.169.212.143 is continuously adding the full and not confirmed name of a recently arrested murdersuspect to the article <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_S%C3%A9v%C3%A8ke_a9ea.html" title="Louis Sévèke">Louis Sévèke</a>. The case is that the name he adds has been mentioned by anonymous users in a forum (www.geenstijl.nl) and therefore he (or she) concideres this as a valid source. The fact of the matter is that the name of the suspect only is referred to by the initial of his last name in the Dutch newsmedia. I've asked the anonymous to give a reliable source (see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Louis_S%C3%A9v%C3%A8ke&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Louis_S%C3%A9v%C3%A8ke&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">edithistory of the article</a>, the <a href="../../../l/o/u/Talk%7ELouis_S%C3%A9v%C3%A8ke_cff3.html" title="Talk:Louis Sévèke">talkpage of the article</a> and the <a href="../../../1/9/5/User_talk%7E195.169.212.143.html" title="User talk:195.169.212.143">talkpage of the user</a>), but he or she refuses to do so and keeps on adding the name. Can an administrator have a look at this and take appropriate actions?</p>
<p>Another fact is that I am administrator on the Dutch Wikipedia, and I also have a problem overthere with someone who keeps on adding the full name of the murdersuspect, claiming that it is on the English language wikipedia. I have no proof, but I suspect the anonymous overhere is the same user as the one that keeps adding the name on the Dutch article <a href="../../../../nl/l/o/u/Louis_S%C3%A9v%C3%A8ke_a9ea.html" class="extiw" title="nl:Louis_Sévèke">nl:Louis Sévèke</a>.</p>

<dd>The short name should be OK. Dutch law mandates that the Dutch press may never publish a suspects' full last name; only the first letter may be used. While en.wiki is not strictly bound by that law, it is arguable that it violates <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. Some weblogs (such as geenslijl.nl) feel they should expose the suspect, but I can say that geenstijl.nl cannot be used as a reliable newssource; their goal is to publish controversial 'news' and hold no journalistic ethics. Having said that, I feel that any mention of the suspects' full name, including edit summaries, should be deleted. --<a href="../../../e/d/o/User%7EEdokter_4a5a.html" title="User:Edokter">Edokter</a> <small>(<a href="../../../e/d/o/User_talk%7EEdokter_9869.html" title="User talk:Edokter">Talk</a>)</small> 17:25, 31 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Agreed. Just a probably superfluous note note that, as with all negative information about a living person WP:BLP kicks in when we don't have a reliable source and forbids any mention of it anywhere in the encyclopedia. <a href="../../../a/v/b/User%7EAvb_3038.html" title="User:Avb">AvB</a>&#160;÷&#160;<a href="../../../a/v/b/User_talk%7EAvb_5b28.html" title="User talk:Avb"><small>talk</small></a> 17:38, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This was talked about much earlier, his English skills are not very good and I don't think that he is harmful. In fact, "Revolution;coordinator is died, long live new coordinator." was kinda funny - even though it is a bit POINT. As for canvassing thing, it still shows that he is naive, because had he really wanted to he could have e-mailed many more people and is useless in any case since that AfD was already listed under Turkey-deletion sorting.. He generally does good work around Wikipedia (especially with templates and certain articles) so if you ever see him do such edits, just leave a note to his talk page.. That would be my two cents... <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 20:27, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

<p><a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkey</a> has been the target of a very persistent vandal who is using elaborate techniques to attack the article. He created 50+ user names, and is so persistent that the page had to be fully protected on March 27 - even the semi-protection doesn't work. It is extremely disruptive since he seems to be passing all the time he is awake in front of his article waiting for an opportunity to vandalize the article. It is an FA, and is really disrupting the work of many editors. No block seems to work, and I feel that something needs to be done since the block auto-expired just this morning and he already came back. I made another request for semi-protection, but what can be done if it continues? We cannot fully-protect the page forever.. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 20:20, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Howdy! Operating as an editor, I'm having a bit of a problem that I'd like to ask for external input on. I'm posting here because I'd like to make sure that I've got good admin scrutiny of my actions, things are a bit catywonkous. Traditionally, this would just be a run of the mill content dispute, but I'm an admin, the standard dispute resolution techniques seem to be failing, and I'm wondering if anyone has some suggestions on how to fix this.</p>
<p>The article <a href="../../../a/c/e/Aces_High_%28computer_game%29_3301.html" title="Aces High (computer game)">Aces High (computer game)</a> has been recently edited by a gent named <a href="../../../s/c/r/User%7EScribner_94ed.html" title="User:Scribner">Scribner</a> (<a href="../../../s/c/r/User_talk%7EScribner_9808.html" title="User talk:Scribner">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Scribner_6a23.html" title="Special:Contributions/Scribner">contribs</a>) who has added some distinctly POV stuff (in my opinion), specifically <a href="../../../a/c/e/Aces_High_%28computer_game%29_3301.html#Derogatory_Online_Experiences" title="Aces High (computer game)">Aces_High_(computer_game)#Derogatory_Online_Experiences</a>.

I don't want to edit war, of course, and I've asked him to come to the table, but he's instead left 3RR notices on my page, deleted the conversation threads on his talk page, and more. I'm feeling a bit frustrated here, and if I were an admin coming into this conversation from the outside, I'd be warning the user to knock off the disruption, but as I'm an involved party, I've brought it here instead.</p>

<p>I don't think he's a vandal, I suspect instead (just my opinion, mind you) that he may have a grudge against the game or the company. He seems to be using the unreferenced tag as a bludgeon and using the article as an attack page against the online game referenced. I'd like an external set of eyes to help out. If I'm crazy and he's the soul of civility, then I'll take my lumps and learn. If he's being disruptive and incivil, he might benefit from an uninvolved person discussing the issue with him. It's obvious that he's passionate about the subject, I'd hope that he'd turn that energy into either beefing up the disputed section with good references or improving this/other article(s) instead of just leaving threatening messages. Finally, if there are any ways I can improve in how I balance the admin/editor role in situations like this, I'd appreciate the feedback.

<dd>The main article is referenced quite well, and therefore I have removed the tag from the top of the article. The subsection has no references at all so I added some tags there. If references aren't provided within a couple of days, that section should be removed entirely. Unreferenced POV doesn't belong in an encyclopedia. Verifiability is required. I put this on the talk page as well so hopefully Scribner will discuss his changes. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy"><font color="green"><b>IrishGuy</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishguy_9a49.html" title="User talk:Irishguy"><font color="blue"><i>talk</i></font></a></sup> 21:01, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

<p>Apparently they've done this before in December and less ambitiously in March, hitting several articles with an external link to what resembles a myspace/blog-type site, not an information source. They've been warned before.</p>
<p>What drew my attention was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roman_Catholic_Church&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=119804216" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roman_Catholic_Church&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=119804216" rel="nofollow">placement</a> at <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_Church_7422.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a>, which is overreaching at best. Does it seem reasonable to revert the rest of the placements?

<p>Sorry if this is the wrong place for this, if it is please point me in the correct direction.</p>
<p>On my talk page user Widefox has posted a slanderious lie stating that I have been banned from Wikipedia and other unnamed forums for a dispute with someone else. There is no factual basis for this. The reason I believe that he has posted this lie is an ongoing dispute on the Swiftfox article. He is doing this out of spite, in an effort I believe to use one lie in one place as a basis to start problems in another place. He did that in the past, by saying an unsigned edit was a sockpuppet, even though I have a static ip. He then took that lie and used it in other areas. Is it poossible to have user Widefox blocked from my talk page as he insists on posting lies, slander, and starting arguments with me there?

<dd>Iamunknown - yes agreed he was "blocked" 48hrs. Actually, I used "banned" because that's how I remembered it and I'm also quoting *his words*. How can Kilz object to his own words? I followed all advice for cooperating with Kilz before - Kilz rejected 3rd opinion as opinion, up until mediation. I left him months. I'm always doing the work.

I have defended myself by giving links about him being blocked 48hrs, banned from Swiftfox forum and warded off elsewhere.

Your continued defense of your actions show that you see no problems in your attack on me. That you think its ok to post personal attacks. That so long as its what you remember happening months and months ago you can dreg up anything and post it. What makes it even more unbelievable, is you know the sockpuppet case you filed was for a logged out edit. So now you seek to build upon a false accusation by posting it again, and again. What is the purpose of posting it again? What good can come of it? <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKilz_c9ee.html" title="User:Kilz">Kilz</a> 01:59, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>After a night to cool down as suggested. I ask the admins to please look at what Widefox is asking for. He is asking for me to be banned from the Swiftfox page. For what? This is what he was seeking by posting the attack on my talk page in violation of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>. He thinks personal attacks are a way for him to win disagreements over editing an article in violation of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>. His solution is rewarding him for bad behavior. I have not attacked him in any way. But simply ask to be protected from more of the same. He sees nothing wrong with what he has done. He will do so again. His request shows he does not <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>. His actions on my page show he does not <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>.His actions on the Swiftfox page show he does not <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>. Maybe he should be blocked from my page and from Swiftfox since he attacked me in both places. At the very least, I believe he (Widefox)should be told that his actions were wrong. To stop attacking me and focus in on the issues and not me. That he should not repeat them, that he should assume good faith, and that a repeat of his actions will have consequences. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKilz_c9ee.html" title="User:Kilz">Kilz</a> 12:09, 1 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>But you did vandalize the page, you removed tags without fixing the problem the tag was placed there for. While there was a discussion on the section. You also removed requests for citations on areas that were inmho original research by you. Reverting vandalism is an approved practice. I did it once a day. You also tried to put words in another editors mouth, and told me to be quiet on the subject as you sought to influence the discussion. Then when you saw that you were not winning, you posted a smear on my talk page and the Swiftfox page , in violation of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>. You did not seek help from an admin, you took it opon yourself to make a personal attack. Dreging up the most dirt you could think of, to smear me.

<dd>My take on this is that Wildefox should not be posting on Kilz's talk page unless it is absolutely necessary because it clearly irritates Kilz. And there is nothing to stop Kilz removing stuff he does not like from his talk page. - <a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKittybrewster_2ff5.html" title="User:Kittybrewster">Kittybrewster</a> <small><a href="../../../k/i/t/User_talk%7EKittybrewster_3d4b.html" title="User talk:Kittybrewster">(talk)</a></small> 20:16, 1 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you for your answer Kittybrewster. I have been told that I am not allowed to delete things from my talk page. That I must archive everything. Are you suggesting that the attack be deleted. Secondly, if I do that doesnt it remove the record of what Widefox has done, and if he does it again I wont have proof to point to? <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKilz_c9ee.html" title="User:Kilz">Kilz</a> 21:16, 1 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>This is a new tatic of Widefox. It appears that 2 other editors have in some way agreed with me. So widefox has labeled them as puppets of some kind so he can write them off. He is now ignoring consensus. Secondly, what may have happened in the past on the Swiftfox forum in no way changes my ability to edit the swiftfox article on Wikipedia and make sure that it is as honest and up to date as possible. As you see Widefox is using one tatic after another to win a content argument. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKilz_c9ee.html" title="User:Kilz">Kilz</a> 11:34, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

That others are editing and changing things should be no suprize on Wikipedia. That they may disagree with Widefox has nothing to do with me. Even with the knowledge that one is from the University of Maine he still claims one to be a sockpuppet. Has Widefox filed any reports of suspected sockpupptry? Not that I can find, Why?

<dd>Lets look at your picture Widefox. In order to win a content disagreement Widefox reasorts to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem" rel="nofollow">ad hominem argument</a>. Widefox has smeared and attacked me multiple times on multiple pages. Lied that I have been banned , said I have had problems on the Ubuntu forums where I have not(you only show baseless one sided complaints about me there, not any reprimands), said I am a puppeteer over and over(without filing any cases or reports). Written off consensus of 4 other editors(me and 3 others). Why? So that old, non reliable sourced, apples to oranges comparisons, and conflicting data can stay rather than be labeled so it can be replaced and updated. The so called slur (read in context)is reporting a license violation of foss code. The only thing I have removed from my talk is a personal attack, and per above instructions have left a diff link in its place. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKilz_c9ee.html" title="User:Kilz">Kilz</a> 12:26, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Great, not only did a conspiracy theorist finally get admin status, but it was by the thinnest of margins. This is making me rethink my current abstention from RFA. I don't quite know what to say, except that if Guinnog does this again (among other things, justifying libel - I notice that Guinnog, while adding a welcome template to his new buddy, chose not to actually warn the chap for violating BLP, which was the main reason that warning was there in the first place), you should take this straight to RfC and/or Arbcom. I like how Guinnog is inviting this person to 'add their thoughts' to improving the article, as if anything they put remotely belongs.

<p>I must agree with MONGO, and I'll state that I have handed out similar warnings in similar cases myself (on articles in the domains I edit). Even though these cases may not technically match our standard definitions of vandalism perfectly, there is a point where reckless POV-pushing becomes so blatant and so disruptive that an anti-vandal response is legitimate. Nobody in their right mind can possibly believe that the statement <i>"7 World Trade Center collapsed in an obvious, controlled demolition, ordered by owner Larry Silverstein"</i> fairly and accurately reflects the current state of commonly accepted human knowledge. Even if you happen to believe that the statement is true, you simply <i>must</i> know it's not commonly accepted and not "obvious". A user who makes edits like this is either not acting in good faith, or so clueless about the purpose of Wikipedia they really shouldn't be here. Come to that, there's the very real BLP issue. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 11:02, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Guinnog told me it would have been better had I done a BLP warning instead of a vandalism warning, but seeing that the editor has such a very limited contribution history, his edit appeared to be clear vandalism. <a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">User:Tbeatty</a> later placed a BLP warning template on his talkpage. My biggest concern about this entire affair is to wonder why I would be badgered for the entire editing session about a whole lot of nothing when I had hoped to be working on other things of interest to me. It appears Guinnog was trying to goad me into saying something nasty.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 11:13, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think Guinogg exercised poor judgment in reverting MONGO and leaving a message on MONGO's page. Guinogg was involved in the article. It is inappropriate to act as both a contributor and an administrator as it has a chilling effect on contributions. At most he should have simply expressed his viw as an editor on MONGO's talk page without reversion and without an administrator warning. That would have given MONGO the choice of amending the warning to be more specific or taken no action. Guinogg's next choice should have been to bring it here for comment. But ating unilaterally was inappropriate considering his involvement. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 15:45, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, AumakuaSatori made edits which were POV and BLP violations. No, MONGO did not correctly deal with those as POV and BLP problems, but rather incorrectly as 'vandalism'. No, Guinnog did not defend AumakuaSatori and was not wrong to tell MONGO to stop misusing the vandalism template.</dd>
<dd>Guinnog was acting, correctly, under the guidance of things like <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a>... new users doing things they shouldn't may simply not know / understand. The proper response is to calmly inform them of things like NPOV and verifiability. It is certainly possible that this was a sockpuppet, troll, or new but equally intractable user who would never comply with policy... but usually we <i>tell</i> them about those policies and block them <b>after</b> they continue to violate them, not before.

<dd>It was a standard vandalism warning....indeed, the editing hisory of this probable sock account has at least one other BLP violation and vandalism as well.

<p>I've just belatedly come across this thread (I'm travelling with limited internet access this week). The violation of WP:LIVING, WP:VERIFIABILITY/ATTRIBUTION, and common decency involved in posting that Larry Silverstein obviously blew up his own building on 9/11 is extremely serious. I don't care precisely what warning template is used, but assertions of that nature must never be allowed to remain posted on Wikipedia, much less being restored by an experienced editor or administrator. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 22:52, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Seeing <a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinnog_5d26.html" title="User:Guinnog">Guinnog</a>'s note on <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a>'s talk page and then the words 'demolition' and 'collapse' I knew immediately what article was being talked about. I'd thought to try to educate him how readily recognizable AumakuaSatori's 'edit' was, but in finishing up my comment I found Guinnog had been at the page for quite a long time, and <i>must</i> know it was a bad edit. I backed off, not knowing what to think. And then re-reading his comment to MONGO, there was <i>"I'd like to see you use discussion and references to reliable sources rather than labelling them a vandal. I don't see any vandalism in the user's edits but an attempt to improve the article."</i> That shook me, because if Guinnog had been anywhere near the article for any length of time, and knew MONGO had been too, his comment was pure nitroglycerin. Given my perceptions <i>at the time</i>, and after checking around, I guess I have to take exception to any summarizing that Guinnog was acting correctly with respect with another editor, MONGO. Read the talk page, check the page histories, re-read his initial comment, Guinnog was being provocative. <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShenme_67cd.html" title="User:Shenme">Shenme</a> 23:54, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I consider the situation to be water under ther bridge now, so long as people will not spend hours badgering me about warning another editor about vandalism.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 05:05, 3 April 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Sorry, I've been away. To paraphrase <i><a href="../../../a/i/r/Airplane%21.html" title="Airplane!">Airplane!</a></i>, "Looks like I picked the wrong weekend to move house...". I considered the situation to be already water under the bridge when I last spoke to MONGO about it on Saturday evening when I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MONGO&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=119319375" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MONGO&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=119319375" rel="nofollow">apologised</a> to him. I admit (as I already admitted to MONGO) that I was wrong to replace his bad warning template with a welcome one; I should have also added a more accurate warning in the 15 minutes before Tbeatty did, instead of getting into an unproductive discussion with MONGO about it, and I thank Tbeatty for that. I never used or threatened to use admin powers over the matter.</dd>
<dd>The edit which I promised to take further if MONGO failed to correct it was his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=7_World_Trade_Center&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=119274883" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=7_World_Trade_Center&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=119274883" rel="nofollow">mistaken reversion with unhelpful edit summary</a> of my (fairly non-controversial) attempt to edit the article, something I have incidentally very seldom done. MONGO <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MONGO&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=119277634" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MONGO&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=119277634" rel="nofollow">explained</a> that he "thought [he] was reverting the vandalism by the anon (sic)". A look at <a href="../../../r/e/v/Help%7EReverting_1fd5.html" title="Help:Reverting">Help:Reverting</a> might be in order; "Do not revert changes simply because someone makes an edit you consider problematic, biased, or inaccurate. Improve the edit, rather than reverting it." and "<b>Reverting is not a decision which should be taken lightly</b>". One ought to at least read the edit one is reverting, I think.</dd>
<dd>I take heed of the opinions of others here, and I note with sadness that some have commented on the matter who clearly have not researched what actually happened. I have always understood that <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> applies to users here as much as to anyone else, and vandalism warnings should not be misapplied by anyone. <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a> dictates that we assume good faith in newbie users; I found it instructive how little good faith was assumed on my part. As CBD says, if this is now to be the way that AGF is implemented, perhaps we need to edit the policy to make it clear that it only applies to established users.</dd>
<dd>Nonetheless I accept that I did not handle the situation in the best way. As JzG says, I should have sent MONGO a note querying his use of the template first of all, rather than changing the template. I thank I'm so special, Chacor and Newyorkbrad for alerting me to this centralised discussion, something MONGO failed to do.</dd>
<dd>Next time I see MONGO misapply vandalism warnings I think I will bring it straight here and let others who MONGO may feel are more neutral deal with it. As I already said, I sincerely hope there will not be a next time. --<a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinnog_5d26.html" title="User:Guinnog">Guinnog</a> 07:05, 3 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>But seriously, we don't need to issue total good faith to these folks. I very much doubt that, when pointed out that his theory was not welcome, he would have said, "Oh, pardon me sirs, I won't do it again, I'll go over here and edit an article on grasses". However, I cannot read his mind.</dd>
<dd>Perhaps a vandal template was the wrong thing to do. But a nice note saying that their theories aren't welcome here? That might be nice.</dd>
<dd>Either way, I apologize for the brash tone of my comments above. Thank you for responding. --<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolbez_ce9f.html" title="User:Golbez">Golbez</a> 07:11, 3 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, that was going to be the substance of my comment at the time to <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">User:MONGO</a> (which I also deleted out of trepidation at the situation). Not finding an applicable template, and knowing that editor's time is precious, I was going to suggest that for situations like this which could be foreseen, perhaps a cut-n-paste text from a sub-page would be helpful. Something that says this same subject edit has been made N to the N times before, and could the contributor please read the talk page archives first, then bring up any <i>new</i> discussion areas on the current talk page, as mere repetition is not a good thing (which is why the revert was done). Of course, maybe the user warning templates people just haven't edited pages where the same edits have been seen literally 20, 30, 50 times before? Could we suggest creating a new template, or else they <i>have</i> to watchlist these pages?&#160;:-) <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShenme_67cd.html" title="User:Shenme">Shenme</a> 07:48, 3 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That is for you'all that are familiar with the subject to decide. I fixed the weird redirect in the disamb page.

<dd>We already have opinions from a number of different editors, and what seems to be consensus. The problem is that a couple editors refuse to accept that there is consensus and keep reverting to their preferred version in spite of all the editors who disagree with them (and I suspect they'll keep reverting regardless of how many additional editors came in from 3O or RFC and disagreed with them). Is there any solution to this? Without some sort of admin intervention, I fear the page will just turn into a revert war. I'd still like to get admin input on the situation, could someone please take a look?

Closing consists of announcing the decision at the locations of the discussion and briefly explaining the basis for closing it in the way it is being closed; further, to change any policy pages, guidelines or naming conventions to conform with the decision; and finally, to enforce the decision with respect to recalcitrant users who violate the decision, after reminding them and warning them.

<dd>Thanks for the info. As it turns out, the main dissenter here was also one of the main dissenters in that case. It looks like he's not going to admit consensus regardless of the arguments or how many other editors disagee with him. Could an editor please take a look at the discussion and determine if there's a consensus so this doesn't go on forever?

<dd>There’s an ‘every article must have at least one image’ (yes, unqualified just like that) faction out there, so somebody would probably argue that this is a good idea. However, with party logos being usually copyrighted (and non-free), there is absolutely no way that they could be used in articles on individual politicians (we don’t have an Apple logo in <a href="../../../i/p/o/IPod_1102.html" title="IPod">iPod</a>, either). The reason is that per policy, we are to display fair use material only where it is not just not replaceable, but also necessary and used in a critical context and for identification. Party logos in biographical articles obviously fail this benchmark. Even where a logo is usable in terms of copyright, putting it into the infobox instead of a photograph would probably give the implied affiliation undue weight (assuming that the person is notable). —<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzy_n_12cc.html" title="User:Xyzzy n">xyzzy</a><sub><a href="../../../x/y/z/User_talk%7EXyzzy_n_2d1b.html" title="User talk:Xyzzy n">n</a></sub> 23:32, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>User:Malamockq has on a few occasions attempted to remove warnings from his/her talk page, and the sock-puppetry template posted after <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_checkuser_Case_Lengis_de10.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Lengis">Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Lengis</a>. He/she is now edit-warring to maintain this removal. My understanding is that removing warnings and sock-puppet notices is not allowed. If one or more admins feels like explaining this to Malamockq, that would be appreciated. Alternatively, if I'm misreading the policy, I'm happy to be corrected about this. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 01:46, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Users can remove warnings from their talk pages. Sock notices go on their user pages, but I see zero reason to have one here, unless I missed something from my skimming. User:Lengis is not blocked or banned and has not edited since September 2006. <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a> explicitly allows alternate or secondary accounts as long as they are not being used to evade bans or blocks or used to edit disruptively.

<dd>Then I don't see the need for it now, as they have stopped using the Lengis account and are using Malamockq as their primary. If he/she begins using both accounts disruptively, then one of the socks should be blocked, and the user warned/temp blocked again. That's about it. One indiscretion (assuming it hasn't happened in the 8 months since) should not amount to a permanent scarlet letter, in my view. —<a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell"><span style="color:#555;font-weight:bold;">bbatsell</span></a> <a href="../../../b/b/a/User_talk%7EBbatsell_7978.html" title="User talk:Bbatsell"><span style="color:#C46100;font-size:0.75em;">¿?</span></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bbatsell_a457.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bbatsell"><span style="color:#2C9191;">✍</span></a> 02:04, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This user has been disrupting numerous articles for quite a long time now. I believe that <a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiorgioOrsini_2f95.html" title="User:GiorgioOrsini">GiorgioOrsini</a>, <a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni_Giove_12a0.html" title="User:Giovanni Giove">Giovanni Giove</a> and recently NovaNova are all the same person. They use the same style of writing (grammar mistakes, spacing, etc.) and they all have the same subject of interest which are Dalmatia-related articles and removing or vandalising every mention of Croatia in them. I have looked around their history pages and I have found striking similarities in their reverts. I found out that these two members have been involved in numerous edit-wars where they have "collaborated" to such a degree that it took my attention right away. Looking closer I found out that they in fact made exactly the same methods and when there wasn't one there was the other doing the same revert and replying in the same manner. Some of the articles included are: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Croatians_ba68.html" title="List of Croatians">List of Croatians</a>, <a href="../../../g/i/o/Giovanni_Luppis_b85d.html" title="Giovanni Luppis">Giovanni Luppis</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francesco_Patrizi_7ce0.html" title="Francesco Patrizi">Francesco Patrizi</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benedetto_Cotrugli_7c39.html" title="Benedetto Cotrugli">Benedetto Cotrugli</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrea_Meldolla_8e4c.html" title="Andrea Meldolla">Andrea Meldolla</a> and so on. If these are all accounts of the same person (which I am convinced they are) he is also guilty for vote stacking on as can be seen on <a href="../../../f/r/a/Talk%7EFrancesco_Patrizi_ba52.html" title="Talk:Francesco Patrizi">Talk:Francesco_Patrizi</a>, this page can also be observed for striking similarity in argumentation of these supposedly two people (it is in fact identical). Recently it seems he introduced another sockpuppet at <a href="../../../g/i/u/Giulio_Clovio_a798.html" title="Giulio Clovio">Giulio Clovio</a> named NovaNova, this article is also where GiorgioOrsini is involved in a edit-war for very long time and now he obviously introduced another sock to help himself. In short due to long-term disruption, vandalism, incivility and extremly striking similarity in edit style, argumentation and exactly the same interests I am forced to request an indefinite block or ban of this user and all of his accounts.</p>
<p>It is certain to assume that <a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni_Giove_12a0.html" title="User:Giovanni Giove">Giovanni Giove</a> is the master account, as it is the oldest account out of the three. This person then created his other two accounts in a short amount of time - during November 2006. <a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiorgioOrsini_2f95.html" title="User:GiorgioOrsini">GiorgioOrsini</a> and NovaNova are his two accounts which are used for rampant edit warring, and personal attacks, and they are also used to create the illusion that their is more than one person who holds these opinions. To get a taste of this report, please see that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:GiorgioOrsini&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88822454" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:GiorgioOrsini&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88822454" rel="nofollow">after a user gave him a legitimate warning</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:PaxEquilibrium&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88822152" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:PaxEquilibrium&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88822152" rel="nofollow">Orsini removed it and was uncivil.</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nishkid64&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=92110211" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nishkid64&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=92110211" rel="nofollow">Also take a look at this threat/attack.</a></p>
<p>Looking at each user's contributions, it is highly likely that GiorgioOrisni was created by Giovanni Giove to create the illusion of support for his views on the article "<a href="../../../j/u/r/Juraj_Dalmatinac_aaed.html" title="Juraj Dalmatinac">Juraj Dalmatinac</a>". Another point to notice is that GiorgioOrisni's <b>first ever edit</b> was to the talk page of <a href="../../../j/u/r/Juraj_Dalmatinac_aaed.html" title="Juraj Dalmatinac">Juraj Dalmatinac</a>, where he immediately started <b>repeating the same words spoken by Giovanni Giove</b>, and immediately engaged in edit warring over that article - quite an unusual thing for a genuine new user to do. Both accounts edit the same articles - often edit warring with other users, most notably on <span class="plainlinksneverexpand lx"><a href="../../../j/u/r/Juraj_Dalmatinac_aaed.html" title="Juraj Dalmatinac">Juraj Dalmatinac</a> <tt>(</tt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../j/u/r/Juraj_Dalmatinac_aaed.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../j/u/r/Juraj_Dalmatinac_aaed.html" rel="nofollow">edit</a><tt>|</tt><a href="../../../j/u/r/Talk%7EJuraj_Dalmatinac_92ce.html" title="Talk:Juraj Dalmatinac">talk</a><tt>|</tt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../j/u/r/Juraj_Dalmatinac_aaed.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../j/u/r/Juraj_Dalmatinac_aaed.html" rel="nofollow">history</a><tt>|</tt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_Juraj_Dalmatinac_4cf9.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_Juraj_Dalmatinac_4cf9.html" rel="nofollow">links</a><tt>|</tt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../j/u/r/Juraj_Dalmatinac_aaed.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../j/u/r/Juraj_Dalmatinac_aaed.html" rel="nofollow">watch</a><tt>|</tt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">logs</a><tt>)</tt></span>, <span class="plainlinksneverexpand lx"><a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrea_Meldolla_8e4c.html" title="Andrea Meldolla">Andrea Meldolla</a> <tt>(</tt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/n/d/Andrea_Meldolla_8e4c.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/n/d/Andrea_Meldolla_8e4c.html" rel="nofollow">edit</a><tt>|</tt><a href="../../../a/n/d/Talk%7EAndrea_Meldolla_7ada.html" title="Talk:Andrea Meldolla">talk</a><tt>|</tt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/n/d/Andrea_Meldolla_8e4c.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/n/d/Andrea_Meldolla_8e4c.html" rel="nofollow">history</a><tt>|</tt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_Andrea_Meldolla_720b.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_Andrea_Meldolla_720b.html" rel="nofollow">links</a><tt>|</tt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/n/d/Andrea_Meldolla_8e4c.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/n/d/Andrea_Meldolla_8e4c.html" rel="nofollow">watch</a><tt>|</tt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">logs</a><tt>)</tt></span> and other articles of famous Croatian/Italian figures. Both account seem to have the single purpose of removing all references to Croatia or Croats on articles of famous historical figures, and claiming them as exclusively "Italian", while calling all other views "pseudo-historical". Both account use the same style of language in talk pages and edit summaries. The account GiorgioOrsini is also guilty of vandalism, by removing people from article lists and then adding words such as "falsifier" to describe someone<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Croatians&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97854344" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Croatians&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97854344" rel="nofollow">[109]</a>.

<p>All three users constantly move pages from Croatian names to Italian ones. All three remove sections of articles regarding name controversies and such - and always use the same or similar "reasoning" (e.g, "removed name nonsense", or "pseudo-historical nonsense".</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../g/i/u/Giulio_Clovio_a798.html" title="Giulio Clovio">Giulio Clovio</a> article is a frequent target of this one user's heavy POV edit warring. He frequently removes references and text referring to the man as a Croat. On the talk page, and in edit summaries they are always uncivil, and usually use personal attacks.</p>
