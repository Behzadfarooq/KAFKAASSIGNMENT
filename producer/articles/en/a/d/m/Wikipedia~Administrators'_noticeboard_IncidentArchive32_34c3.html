<li>Well, a revert is a revert, even if it's a revert of totally unrelated material...it's three reverts <i>per page</i>, so I thought it was applicable. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 14:23, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Guettarda, uh just to point out for the future, you accidentally cited the diff with "diff=0" (which is a dynamic link that points to the most recent edit of the page), rather than a static diff. That would explain the "irrelevance". I get confused by it sometimes as well. -- <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Natalinasmpf</a> 16:39, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>The anonymous editor in the last edit has rather the same editing style - ie. sudden removal of anything that makes aetherometry look bad without discussion, possibly a sockpuppet of Helicoid. Of course, that's just my thoughts. From what it looks like, from some of the comments on the vfd page, some of the aetherometry proponents are "calling their friends/relatives over" to revert the page, or to vote "keep" on its vfd. -- <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Natalinasmpf</a> 18:56, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<p>The <a href="../../../t/h/r/Wikipedia%7EThree-revert_rule_1a38.html" title="Wikipedia:Three-revert rule">3RR</a> is indeed very broad — to my mind, much too broad. I can see good grounds for ruling out too many reverts of the same material, because there are very few occasions on which that might be justified; there are far more occasions on which a number of <i>different</i> reverts on the same page might be justified, though. As blocking is at the discretion of the admin involved, I generally use my discretion to black only when the reverts are of the same material.</p>

<ol>
<li>I can't see that these count as reverts; three of them differ only in details, but one is significantly different.</li>
<li>There is no need for anyone to open an editing account. There are advantages for them, and it can make their lives easier, but it's entirely up to them, and they're not doing so is irrelevant to this issue. I might add that people editing from accounts used primarily for disruption are in no position to attack anons for being difficult to take seriously.</li>
<li>In any case, I can't see that 172.134.132.223 was warned about the 3RR beforehand.</li>

<p>I must admit to knowing about the 3RR. If my edits are considered to be reverts, I must then ask if the deleting of sourced, relevent content due solely to my not having created an account is vandalism. If this is the case, I don't believe my edits would count towards the 3RR. Regards. -bro 172.147.73.11 23:22, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, it does not count as vandalism (and so your reverts <i>do</i> count against the 3RR). "Vandalism" is (annoyingly) just about the most over- and mis-used term on Wikipedia. Please see <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia:Vandalism</a> for our definition of what counts as vandalism. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 16:15, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>From the article you linked: <b>Apparent bad-faith edits that do not make their bad-faith nature explicit and inarguable are not considered vandalism at Wikipedia.</b> Since the bad faith nature -was- made explicit in admitted reverting based solely on the status as a nonlogged in user, it certainly does fit the definition. -bro 172.168.246.192 01:10, 27 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>It would be akin to someone stating that they do not like your username, and that they would revert your edits until you change it. If that doesn't fall under the vandalism definition, I suggest it would be a good idea to revisit it. -bro 172.168.246.192 01:30, 27 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Look at that line you just quoted: <i>edits that do not make their bad-faith nature explicit and</i> <i><b>inarguable</b></i>. Since I clearly do not agree that they are bad-faith, they are by definition <i>arguable</i>, and therefore by definition they don't qualify, right? <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 03:14, 27 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>If you hold the standard to be that no one argues it, it's useless just considering the person accused will dispute it. Putting that aside, I do find it odd that you don't consider blind reverts of anon users to be bad faith. Oh well, it is at least undeniably <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikicrime_a3b5.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikicrime">Wikipedia:Wikicrime</a>, though I don't believe thats official policy. Hope you don't run into someone who doesn't like your name.&#160;:D -bro 172.165.17.51 28 June 2005 04:13 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Again, there were no blind reverts and there certainly isn't vandalism on my part. Let me explain why...there is a standing Rfc on the exact passages you are editing. You were cordially invited to voice your opinion and comment there before you began editing the section...this would have made your efforts appear to be ones made in good faith. As Mel stated above, you certainly do not need a user name, but without one, regardless of your form of a username "bro", it is very difficult for others to keep track of your edits. The article is heavily vandalized and working outside of the norm as expected by the Rfc along with a lack of a username does not help you build a "name for yourself" good or bad, especially in a highly visited article such as this one. Furthermore, it is simple to track any IP right through the service provider to the exact computer and even the person or entity that pays for the service. Remember this when you utilize the web.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 30 June 2005 03:31 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Ah, it seems you are still accusing me of that vandalism of your page. I would like to invite you to provide your evidence for such. I know quite a bit about TCP/IP myself, and would -love- to see your evidence. Your claim that you have a 'more accurate' way of showing where the vandal ip, and my ip's originate, if true, would keep you from branding me as the vandal. Nonetheless, I eagerly await the results. -bro 172.138.4.162 2 July 2005 08:07 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Once you create a username and use only that to log in and edit....Interestingly, you now claim to know a lot about IP's, but I see below, you claim you have no knowledge of this. So which is it? Oh nevermind...you just go ahead and do whatever you want.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 2 July 2005 15:10 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Actually, what I said below was that I didn't know where the tools were to track the location of the IP's, which immediately after I did find, and did myself. If that is 'claming to have no knowledge', then your comment wouldn't be absurd. Alas, thats not the case. Do you need some ice for that ankle sprain? That was a killer backpeddle. Good to know. -bro 172.162.182.69 3 July 2005 01:25 (UTC)

<dd>Hah, you just outed yourself MONGO. More than a week ago I told you that I lived in Blacksburg, which, I'm afraid isn't totally true, and now you try to use that to show some kind of 'evidence'?

<p>In regards to the user page vandalism, it does seem that I share the same ISP as the vandal. Unfortunately, so do millions of other people. I believe it is possible to tell at least the area where the IP orginates, though I personally do not know how. If anyone does, I would appreciate your weighing in.

<dl>
<dd>Because you refuse to develop a simple user page and use only that for your log ins and contributions, no one can track you since every time you dial up, you are assigned another IP. People often do this to avoid the 3RR rule. The IP link you provide is significantly less accurate than the one I have at my disposal...reagrdless, if you create a username and no more vandalizing edits from your multiple accounts to my user page occurs, then you will have restored some faith on my part that your intentions are ones made in good faith.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 00:29, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>This isn't the place for the discussion, I've responded on your userpage. I'll only respond here in regards to the now repeated accusation of vandalism. There has been none by me. The only accusation you've bothered to even link to, I have addressed. Your deletion of my comments on your talk page with the heading of "Sockpuppet and Vandalism" when there was nothing of the such does not reflect well on you. Other editors can see your actions there. -bro 172.147.73.11 00:47, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Coolcat has made quite a few modifications since he restored the article. The images are all either USDA or assert fair use. Changes that have been made to the article shouldn't be copyvio - you can look through the history and see the sections changed. If you <i>can't</i> find the source, do we assume its copyvio? There are copyvios in the history, maybe even some in the article, but we don't usually delete copyvios from page histories, and if we had to take out every article with slightly dodgy bits we'd cut half our articles. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 28 June 2005 12:57 (UTC)

<p>Quick question on this: People are forming battle lines over a tiny bit of text on an article that has pretty weak justification? 1) If the author of the suspect passage is working on it, then that author could conceivably write the material in a new way that would end any possibility of copyvio (but isn't) 2) Without a clear VfU, people are reinstating an article (which is a policy violation) 3) In general and everywhere, we should be <i>conservative</i> on issues. The presumption is good faith, but the assumption is always also that things unproven are presumed untrue, because we're a <i>reference work</i>. We shouldn't be allowing doubtfulness in the name of being nice. If it is good faith, then cite, rewrite, recast. Why fight? I've used myself for information, but my brain came up with the original formulation, and it can damn sure come up with a new one. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 5 July 2005 18:09 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, there was a copyvio, see the talk page. It was the same text reviewed during the article's second copyvio listing. I think Coolcat made a good faith attempt to re-write the article but accidentally included some of the copied text.

<dd>Well turn off your alarm, because he's only telling half the story, at best: he was being rolled back as a knee-jerk thing, given a) the vast amounts of BS/original research he was peddling on various Australian government pages made anything he wrote about government functions immediately suspect; and b) he was specifically altering the edits of his chief antagonist in his tireless battle to unilaterally declare Australia a republic. The rollbacks were ill-advised but understandable under the circumstances. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 11:33, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Ek, if you spent less time playing WP's collective conscience, you might actually <i>notice</i> the piles of bullshit people have to wade through.

<dd>I'm sure you can see how, based on this, it looks like Skyring is being persecuted. He makes good edits (good by <i>any</i> standards), gets reverted; tries again, gets reverted again. Maybe Skyring has done some stuff to be punished for, but if so, that right there tells me that at least one person on the other side needs to be punished as well. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 02:00, 27 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd><i>...based on this...</i> Sure, if you're selective with your evidence, leave out context, and spin it dishonestly, you can justify pretty much anything, as certain international events of the past couple of years demonstrate. And it's not a question of punishment, but an application of the Stopped Clock principle: a broken clock may be right twice a day but that doesn't mean you ought to believe it.</dd>
<dd>Basically, he was behaving like a jerk; and since Adam made some mistakes because of that, Skyring's decided to continue being a jerk by gloating.

<p>What actually happened is simple. Skyring has been stalking and abusing users who dared to stop him doctoring articles to claim Australia is a republic, etc. He has driven one person from Wikipedia. Others are afraid to make comments openly on talk pages in case he stalks them too, and have resorted to AIM and emails. He devoted over 102 edits in a row (bar two)<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Skyring/Evidence&amp;diff=15203620&amp;oldid=15203598" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Skyring/Evidence&amp;diff=15203620&amp;oldid=15203598" rel="nofollow">[22]</a> to stalking articles I had in any way entered, even if I had only fixed a text box, leaving abusive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Djegan&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=15266115" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Djegan&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=15266115" rel="nofollow">[23]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Adam_Carr&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=15127302" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Adam_Carr&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=15127302" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> or snide messages on many of the pages.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Naming_conventions_%28names_and_titles%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=15651334" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Naming_conventions_%28names_and_titles%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=15651334" rel="nofollow">[25]</a> (He even proposed a VfD minutes against an article after I had edited a page!)</p>

<p>All of this was because I stopped him doctoring Australian articles to write in POV crap (eg, Australia is a republic. Its governor-general is its head of state. Its queen isn't. An Australian High Court judgment meant the exact opposite of what the judges said it meant. Academics shared his wacky understanding of constitutional law even when their quotes said they didn't. Constitutional monarchies are republics, yada yada yada.) Whereas he used as evidence a quote from a minor lawyer and some TV pundits and endless misquotes out of context, I quoted laws, letters patent, attorneys-general, state documents, governors-general etc. He did not like it that <i>everyone</i> (and I mean everyone. Not a single person agreed with him) on the talk page (and a lot of people edited it) said he was wrong.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Government_of_Australia" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Government_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">[26]</a> So he <i>personally</i> targeted me for abuse<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Skyring/Evidence&amp;diff=15201074&amp;oldid=15200959" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Skyring/Evidence&amp;diff=15201074&amp;oldid=15200959" rel="nofollow">[27]</a> and targeted others for abuse when they told him to stop. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=15491561" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=15491561" rel="nofollow">[28]</a></p>
<p>For example if I wrote about the Irish president's honour guard, he suddenly became interested in it too. If I touched <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donald_Regan_8479.html" title="Donald Regan">Donald Regan</a>, so did he. If I wrote about a crown, he'd change it. If I put in a template, he'd leave a message saying it was wrong, if I wrote about the European Constitution, he'd add in a snide comment about Ireland knowing that I am Irish, etc, with edit summaries like <b>14:33, 13 Jun 2005 (hist) (diff) User talk:Adam Carr (Low quality of Irish editor)</b> and <b>A common pattern for this editor to produce poor English</b>)</p>
<p>When I refused to keep wasting time discussing his endless attempts over 5 pages, a RfA, etc to justify his arguments (everyone also just gave up reading his 'I'm right. You are all wrong. So are the courts, academics, attorneys-general, etc etc' diatribes) he began his harrassment and stalking to try to force me to talk yet again to him.</p>
<p>I was advised by email by some admins to respond to his following he around to each page as I edited it to do as was done in the past when similar individuals stalked users by reverting <i>all</i> his changes in the list of articles where he had been following me around, something that had been done in the past to other wikistalkers. I did. I and others whom he was stalked reported him to be ArbComm, who were already in the process of banning him from some pages for a year. (Where, BTW, according to an admin who checked it, he seems to have produced a <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sockpuppet.html" title="Sockpuppet">sockpuppet</a> to defend himself.)</p>
<p>He did as the admins in the emails expected. He screamed, threatened, proposed the VfD<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Log/2005_June_19&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=15427123" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Log/2005_June_19&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=15427123" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>,</p>
<ol>
<li>(cur) (last) 04:53, 19 Jun 2005 Skyring (VfD. Trivial material covered elsewhere.)</li>
<li>(cur) (last) 04:11, 19 Jun 2005 Jtdirl</li>
</ol>
<p>And he left abusive messages on talk pages and users' talk pages. As the admins had predicted,and as they said had happened before in similar cases the blanket reversions stopped him stalking (at least for a while, though he did try to continue stalking as an anonymous IP, something he had already threatened to do). He then reverted to bullying type by writing lies on an off Wikipedia site, while conveniently not telling his readers of his abuse, his threats, the fiction he tried to enter onto pages and his stalking of others who dared stand in his way.</p>
<p>Others have said that if he tries stalking other users again they will again blanket revert everything he does until he stops. Hopefully the ArbComm will soon get around, <i>finally</i>, to banning the <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troll.html" title="Troll">troll</a>, something they should have done ages ago anyway. I'm afraid Everking's idea that Skyring "is being severely mistreated" is wide of the mark. It is the victims of his abuse and stalking that were being "severely mistreated", by him and to be blunt, by the slowness of the ArbComm in tackling him when they admitted there was a major problem.

<dd>Honestly, if someone was stalking me by making good edits in my wake, I think I'd be all for it. If anybody sees me editing an article and notices anything else—typo fixes, content additions, formatting changes, factual corrections—that they can positively do to it, by all means, feel free. Automatically reverting someone regardless of whether the edits are good or bad? What? I don't even know how to respond to that. It seems like our ideas about Wikipedia are from different universes. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 02:56, 27 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Presumably you agree that Skyring's rudeness and personal attacks are out of line, so the only disagreement appears to be the manner in which a difficult editor should be treated. Even if Jtdirl or other editors erred in rolling back Skyring's accurate edits, surely Skyring himself is partially at fault for his history of editing in such a grievously biased manner as to bring suspicion on the accuracy of his future edits. — <a href="../../../r/d/s/User%7ERdsmith4_389f.html" title="User:Rdsmith4">Dan</a> | <a href="../../../r/d/s/User_talk%7ERdsmith4_959f.html" title="User talk:Rdsmith4">Talk</a> 03:17, Jun 27, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Perhaps. I'm not defending whatever else he may have done, in the Australia dispute and so on. But it's not hard to see that the edit in question was a good one. Even a cursory glance makes that obvious. So it's not a question of suspicion, is it? We all know there's a president of the US but not one of the UK, we don't need to be suspicious about that. It seems to me more like it was decided that Skyring would not be allowed to edit no matter what, and so he was rolled back unconditionally. But he's not under a ban (at least he wasn't at the time this place), so we can't do that, and even if he <i>was</i>, I think we'd have a personal obligation to take a second or two to discern whether or not the edit was a bad one, or even <i>possibly</i> a bad one. It hurts articles to apply that kind of indiscriminate logic. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 03:42, 27 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Actually it is quite standard to ROS (revert on sight) edits of trolls, <i>irrespective</i> of the quality or otherwise of their edits. In cases like DW, articles started by him after his many bans were deleted on sight, irrespective of the quality or otherwise of content. I was simply acting as advised by admins and, as they expected, a policy of RoS stopped him in his tracks. He faced the choice of continuing to stalk people and have all his work wiped, or stopping stalking and having his edits judged on their merits. Everyking's reaction suggests that he has never had to deal with people like DW, Skyring and others aren't real contributors but just use their position on Wikipedia to bully, abuse, threaten and stalk other real Wikipedians. If he had, he would know that RoS has worked to stop extreme behaviour by trolls pending their eventual banning, and will in extreme cases be used by real wikipedians to deal with extreme trolls in the future. It is <i>only</i> ever used in <i>extreme</i> cases and is not used against the 99.9% of honest and genuine users. It is puzzling however that Everyking is so silent against Skyring's behaviour on Australian pages, where he tried to enter his POV opinions as fact and dismissed the concerns of every other contributor, his harrassment of me and Petaholmes, his behaviour against others, or the fact that one user that I know of, and probably more, quit Wikipedia rather than face his barrage of bullying. He seems more concerned with the hurt feelings of the bully than the experiences of his many victims. <font color="#006666"><b>Fear</b><font color="#FF6600"><i><b>ÉIREANN</b></i><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Ireland.svg_cb65.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/4/45/Flag_of_Ireland.svg/25px-Flag_of_Ireland.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Ireland.svg_cb65.html" /></a>\<font color="blue"><sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl">(talk)</a></sup> <font color="black">28 June 2005 17:54 (UTC)</font></font></font></font>

You and I don't stalk other users, going to every page they edit to leave abusive messages in edit summaries. You and I don't doctor articles to add in claims that are demonstrably untrue, and insist when 20 people + come to the page that we are right and everyone else pushing a POV. You and I haven't been threatened with a year long ban from some articles by the ArbComm. You and I have not driven genuine wikipedians people away from Wikipedia. You and I have not had our behaviour universally condemned everywhere by everyone. You and I have not threatened to get around a ban by coming onto on Wikipedia anonymously to continue harrassing individuals. You and I do not write a tissue of lies about users on off-Wikipedia pages. People can disagree. What they cannot do is behave as Skyring has done. He is not labelled a troll (by me and others) simply because of disagreements. He has been so labelled because of his conduct, conduct which has seen other users, like DW, Lir and others banned. Prior to the creation of the ArbComm he would have been banned outright far more quickly, but perhaps because of the workload they are slow at reaching decisions, which means that people can act in a bannable way for weeks if not months before they get around to issuing an injunction. In the time I have been here I have seen as few as four or five cases where RoS was used. In each case it was to deal with an <i>extreme</i> user and in every case they were banned (in all cases that I can think of, <i>permanently</i> banned) with an order to revert and delete everything they did when they reappeared. Only in <i>the</i> most extreme cases, with <i>the</i> most extreme user, acting in <i>the</i> most extreme manner, have people used RoS. Neither you nor I, nor 99.9% of people here, qualify.

<p>Hello all. The title says it all. Wikipedia seems to be infested with pathetic little Linux <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fan_%28aficionado%29.html#Fanboy" title="Fan (aficionado)">Fanboys</a>, many of them admins, who in their own miserable little minds are "protecting the honor of Linux" by monitoring all Linux related articles and editing out whatever they dislike. Please as an example review the history of the <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linux.html" title="Linux">Linux</a> article and see how they revert and ban people who have contributed information to the article that is CORRECT AND RELEVANT. This is truly pathetic.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding your edit summary: <i>they are even reverting my post here. this is really unbelievable.</i> This had a purely technical reason: you were posting in the footer section. This page contains a notice which reads "DO NOT EDIT THIS PAGE to add new subsections in this section. Please use the appropriate sub-page. New subsections added here may be completely deleted without warning. Thank you." I hope this makes it slightly more believable. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 22:55, 2005 Jun 25 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you for your explanation. Although I just double checked and I don't see your explanation to be the case for my post. In fact, I reverted back to my old post, to which you responded. I suppose if my old post was problematic, you also would have reverted or corrrected it, right? At any rate, I don't want to move the focus on that subject, I think it is rather important that this subject be discussed on the admins' board, because the PLLF's who are also admins, clearly abuse their admin power on Linux articles, including heavy-handed treatment of contributors and bans and other unfair practices.
<dl>
<dd>If I look at <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linux.html" title="Linux">Linux</a>, all I see is consistent reverts by different IPs who all use the phrase "pathetic little Linux Fanboys". Going further back, I see even less complimentary terms hurled around. This should stop—we have a policy against <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">personal attacks</a>. You can think about people any way you like, but calling them names is not productive.<br />
In response to the constant reverts, <a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesarB_5f7f.html" title="User:CesarB">CesarB</a> protects the page, which is the right thing to do (<a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProtection_policy_d869.html" title="Wikipedia:Protection policy">Wikipedia:Protection policy</a>). If I then look at the talk page to see where the discussion on this obviously disputed issue is being conducted, I see... nothing. A single comment where people are, again, called "pathetic little Linux Fanboys". There is no discussion, there are just reverts.<br />
I suggest using the talk page to discuss exactly why you think everybody else is wrong in removing the information you posted, and also <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assuming good faith</a> by not supposing everyone who disagrees with you must therefore be a "Linux Fanboy". I do not, in any case, see any abuse of administrative powers. The talk page is <i>there</i> to resolve disputes.

<dd>My "original reserach" was originally posted by others. I've taken it upon myself to mark the relevant section as unverified and start the work of verifying it, while 172 would prefer to destroy the information entirely for reasons I cannot ascertain. After deciding to leave the article entirely, he felt like putting up a dispute tag, which was a redundant "parting shot". I've taken it upon myself to remove his vandalism. — <b><a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Phil</a></b> <i><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">Welch</a></i> 04:56, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Now, I'd like to clarify this report. These are not four reverts in 24 hours. These are four reverts in a hair under 25 hours. I see no reason to fetishize the 24 hour aspect–Trey Stone is clearly revert-warring and that sort of behavior shouldn't be tolerated. (Note that the 3rd revert is still a revert even though there's a one-word difference. The rest is the same.) Before another administrator blocks, I'll note that 172 is already blocked for a violation of the 3RR (which I disagree with, but I appear to be in a minority of one on the matter). If Stone is blocked (and it would hardly be the first time for him), then it will be 24 hours before we can start resolving the dispute on <a href="../../../f/i/d/Fidel_Castro_ecc2.html" title="Fidel Castro">Fidel Castro</a>. The article is protected, and will remain so until the dispute is resolved, as the parties involved have demonstrated that they can't handle having the page unprotected.

<p><b>Comments:</b> I am kind of late with this, sorry as I am new and still havn't gotten used to the site much yet. I would like to report abuse in the Scanderbeg article. The person, no name, just an IP adress constantly changes the page at his will and does not even bother to try and debate his nor does he try to bring the proposed changes in the discussion page first, on top of this, nearly all of what he has written is assumed and not at all from a neutral point. He ignores the evidence I brought against him and constantly repeats himself. Also, I believe he is working under two different IP adresses 70.48.250.150&#160;(<a href="../../../7/0/2E/User_talk%7E70.48.250.150.html" title="User talk:70.48.250.150">t</a>·<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.48.250.150_db0b.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.48.250.150">c</a>) and another 65.95.60.89&#160;(<a href="../../../6/5/2E/User_talk%7E65.95.60.89.html" title="User talk:65.95.60.89">t</a>·<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_65.95.60.89_fb38.html" title="Special:Contributions/65.95.60.89">c</a>)}.

<p>I just tried to edit the Blue Oyster Cult page since there is incorrect information on there ie:</p>
<p>"They are currently in the studio with producer ChromiumSteel working on a new album."</p>
<p>This is probably the work of pranksters or vandals, and is not true much as I wish it were even without producer 'Chromium Steel', that's a reference from BOC song Golden Age of Leather for those who didn't know.</p>
<p>Anyway my IP is blocked because someone called Erwin Rommell has used it for vandalism. I am NOT Erwin Rommell, I am just a devoted BOC fan and a moderator on a BOC fans site (check Catholicschoolgirl out at www.bocfans.com) so I deplore spamming, trolling or vandalism especially with regard to my favourite band. If you can't unblock my IP could you at least see that the page is edited to take out the erroneous information.</p>

<p>Thank you Shanes. As for why I couldn't edit it myself well it seems I can post or edit here in this section but not on the page I WANT to edit since I get the 'IP blocked' message as soon as I click 'save page'?? You tell me, you're the administrators. This is the message I get:</p>

<dd>It's because of the stupid way that AOL dynamically assigns IP addresses: addresses are assigned from a pool of proxies on a per-connection basis. This means that you get a new IP address for each page you download, so you may be getting a blocked address when trying to edit one page, and getting a free address with another page. Further, AOL assigns addresses from the entire /8 address space it's got, so you can't range-block one person without range-blocking all of AOL.

<p>Can someone check this out. I tried redirecting to Christafari but cannot figure out what is going on.

<dd>It's redirecting ok but I think the pdf should be deleted. For one thing it says on the first page "This essay may be freely copied and distributed only in it’s entirety, provided that no money is asked (also no “production or shipping costs”)."

<p>I blocked the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cancer.html" title="Cancer">cancer</a> vandal IP range 2 days ago and a user has asked me to unblock. I tried and cannot. Something strange is happening as I have logged in twice as alteripse, but when I move to the administrative pages the skin changes back to default and I am no longer logged in although I can edit this. Therefore I had no "unblock" option when I went to the page listing blocked users and addresses. Can someone please unblock 195.93.21.104 as soon as possible please?</p>

<p>How many of the votes to delete and keep were made <i>after</i> the rewrite? If, for example, both the keeps were made after the rewrite, those votes tend to have more weight because the previous delete votes were made <i>before</i> the rewrite, and therefore may not have voted with all of the information neceesarily on hand. If the VfD gets reopened, maybe you or the person who rewrote the article should contact the people who voted before the rewrite (keep or delete) to reconsider their votes. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 28 June 2005 19:08 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was mistaken - all the non-VfD edits were made <i>before</i> the VfD began; the article was not revised once voting commenced. This makes me even more sure the closure to keep was inappropriate. .-<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> June 28, 2005 19:16 (UTC)</p>
<p>As one of only two individuals to vote <b>keep</b> on the article, Goldstein307 shouldn't have closed the VfD—if only to avoid any question of a conflict of interest. I have rolled back his closure, and leave the article disposition up to a neutral admin. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 28 June 2005 19:21 (UTC)</p>
<p>It appear rather obvious that Goldstein307 (who is not an admin) completely went against the vote and took it upon himself to decide that the page should be kept. There was only one other keep vote besides his own (vs 7 to delete). All votes were after the rewrite. I'm going to close the VfD as it should have been and delete the page according to process. If Goldstein307 (or any other user) believes that I am in error, please bring it to VfU.<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 28 June 2005 19:24 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yeah, with no rewrite, the correct thing to do was to go with consensus and let someone else decide. It's perfectly okay to close a VfD where one voted, as long as one follows consensus (whether the same as or different to one's own vote). --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 28 June 2005 19:29 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think you needed to be that cautious. Until the warning, you'd no previous involvement; if their response was clear abuse (i.e. not a judgement call as to whether it was or not), there's not much else one can say, is there? <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 29 June 2005 14:39 (UTC)

<dd>I think it's cool that you did that; it's sensible. However there seems to be a very strong consensus that this guy is one of the silliest trolls we've ever encountered. He's tried tricks that would work in a more troll-friendly environment. He's been caught red handed but he still insists he's innocent. Giving him warnings is better than blocking at this stage because it enables us to gather more evidence. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 29 June 2005 22:32 (UTC)

<dd>Good catch. This is obviously a sockpuppet, as demonstrated by the use of strikeouts, bolding and section headings in his <i>second</i> edit. Kurita77's first edit was about 15 minutes after Enviroknot was blocked. It's already well known that Enviroknot has an affinity for sockpuppets. I'd like an IP check before blocking, but I think there's little doubt that Kurita77 == Enviroknot. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 29 June 2005 15:18 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I <i>do</i> think he is gaming the system, but I would like to put this case to everybody's consideration. he appears to claim that he read through policy so quickly that he can act like a seasoned edit-warrior within 10 minutes of his first edit.

<p>The Arbitration Committee will probably ban all sockpuppets of Enviroknot permanently and allow him to edit only under his own account. It is possible mistakes will be made. All we ask is a good faith effort. Usually he is pretty obvious, as in this instance. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> June 29, 2005 17:29 (UTC)</p>

<p>According to email headers, Kurita77's IP is 66.69.141.11. Sound familiar?

<p>It appears that I have one chance to respond so I am responding.</p>
<dl>
<dd>1st edit: His first edit was made within minutes of Enviroknot being blocked for violating the ArbCom injunction.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Why does this matter? I was unaware that editing at certain times of day was proscribed. I certainly couldn't have predicted that I was editing right after someone was blocked. In fact it looks like you guys are blocking people all day long.</p>
<dl>
<dd>2nd edit: Quoted Enviroknot and struck-out many of BrandonYusufToropov's comments. Kurita77 used also editing features such as section headings and bold text.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I thought it was a good idea for the page. Even BrandonYusufToropov seems to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Jihad#Mirv.2C_I_liked_your_specifying_edit_on_actual_use_of_.22Jihad.22_in_Quran" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Jihad#Mirv.2C_I_liked_your_specifying_edit_on_actual_use_of_.22Jihad.22_in_Quran" rel="nofollow">agree with that idea</a>. Wikipedia policy says to BE BOLD about making edits. I was doing that. I didn't know Wikipedia was a persecute-new-users society.</p>
<dl>
<dd>6th edit: Began lecturing Brandon on "No Personal Attacks". Again struck-out several of Brandon's comments.</dd>
<dd>10th edit: Again lectured about "No Personal Attacks".</dd>
</dl>
<p>Aren't editors supposed to help other editors? Aren't we supposed to remove personal attacks as per Wikipedia policy? Aren't we supposed to inform other editors when they're doing something outside the bounds of policy?</p>
<dl>
<dd>16th-18th edits: Uploaded an image of "Eyeshield 21". Added a disambiguation link to the Eyeshield article. In an email he sent to me, Kurita77 claimed that this article brought him here.</dd>
</dl>
<p>It did. I was referred here by a friend who noticed that they had an article on the manga but none on the anime. I got my feet wet and got comfortable making edits before trying to make a whole new article. Is that a bad thing?</p>
<dl>
<dd>20th edits: Posted a message on Brandon's talk page referencing several Wikipedia policies and instructing Brandon to "calm down".</dd>
</dl>
<p>Is it wrong to ask someone to calm down when they're engaging in heated discussion and flinging around personal attacks? I find it very funny that he <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABrandonYusufToropov&amp;diff=17842406&amp;oldid=17842381" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABrandonYusufToropov&amp;diff=17842406&amp;oldid=17842381" rel="nofollow">removed the comments from his talk page</a>. As if he couldn't be bothered to read Wikipedia policy.</p>
<dl>
<dd>22nd edit: Posted a question on AN/3RR (regarding personal attacks ).</dd>

<p><b>I told you - and you REFUSED TO POST IT HERE - that my area's been having trouble thanks to my idiot neighbors putting in a pool and messing up the cable lines.</b> I think it's changed again. I'm not sure.</p>
<p>I don't know what this Enviroknot person did and I don't think I want to know. I came in here in good faith. I took the time - TWO DAYS - to read the policy pages and how-to-edit tutorials before I made my account and started in, because I didn't want someone coming in and attacking what I made for poor writing style.</p>

<dd>And what, pray tell, does the fact that your neighbors have messed up cable lines have to do with your using the same IP as Enviroknot? It's a lot of smoke you're blowing, but I'm not seeing any fire here. What's the connection? Are you saying that your klutzy neighbors have forced you to share Enviroknot's IP?

<dl>
<dd>Now, as to your question, the reason why I believe you to be a longterm wiki-user is that you get every single term right (a newcomer would have a more varied set of expressions), and you know a load about Wikipedia.

<p><b>Comments:</b> GrandCru (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GrandCru_fe86.html" title="Special:Contributions/GrandCru">contribs</a>) insisted that KMT is pro-communist which is absolutely not true. That was a major error, because his statement cannot explain the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_civil_war.html" title="Chinese civil war">Chinese civil war</a>.</p>
<p>GrandCru (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GrandCru_fe86.html" title="Special:Contributions/GrandCru">contribs</a>) deliberately deleted the criticism towards DPP. The covered up version is just illogical looking at the current chaotic Taiwanese politics. GrandCru (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GrandCru_fe86.html" title="Special:Contributions/GrandCru">contribs</a>) also claimed that DPP's formation was because a bunch of people are against the communism. That statement is also not true. DPP is a left wing party in the formation, and many founding members were even sympathisers of Taiwanese communists prosecuted by the KMT-ruled government then.</p>
<p>I reverted his works because those are just his POV without providing anything to back those up. By reverting his words he even accused me of being a communist. That's how biased he is. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobbybuilder_ac4e.html" title="User:Bobbybuilder">bobbybuilder</a> 29 June 2005, 19:55 (UTC)</p>

<li>I never insisted that KMT is pro-communist, just communist leaning - and it certainly is more communist than DPP. At any rate, I have ceased editing those two articles in a self-imposed cooloff period. Bobbybuilder, however is still reverting.--GrandCru 30 June 2005 01:11 (UTC)</li>

<dd>By keep on reverting to his version, I do think he was insisting that KMT is pro-communist. "it certainly is more communist than DPP", that shows how malinformed GrandCru (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GrandCru_fe86.html" title="Special:Contributions/GrandCru">contribs</a>) is, he didn't even understand the formation of DPP. Of course I had to continue reverting, even the other people GrandCru (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GrandCru_fe86.html" title="Special:Contributions/GrandCru">contribs</a>) called for help can't agree with his extremely biased POV. This matter can put to rest at the moment, but I do hope someone else can also moniter those two pages in case people like GrandCru (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GrandCru_fe86.html" title="Special:Contributions/GrandCru">contribs</a>) appear again and write baseless accusations. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobbybuilder_ac4e.html" title="User:Bobbybuilder">bobbybuilder</a> 30 June 2005, 19:12 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comments:</b></p>

<li>First up, I need to express an interest, as I have involved myself on <a href="../../../e/2E/_/Talk%7EE._E._Cummings_82ea.html" title="Talk:E. E. Cummings">Talk:E. E. Cummings</a>. There are only 3 reverts; a fourth is needed before the rule is broken. Secondly, this reporting is being used as a weapon by <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankfaze_d3eb.html" title="User:Blankfaze">User:Blankfaze</a> in his ongoing effort to insist on British English (BE) spellings on this US subject-matter article. <a href="../../../t/j/i/User%7ETJive_a615.html" title="User:TJive">User:TJive</a>'s reverts are all to the American English (AE) version. My own view is that AE is more appropriate for this article, but that is beside the point. What really seems to be at issue here is Blankfaze's stated willingness to get involved in conflict to defend his position. I would ask this user to assume good faith here and look for another way of resolving this difference of opinion. <a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFiliocht_c3e2.html" title="User:Filiocht">Filiocht</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/l/User_talk%7EFiliocht_11a7.html" title="User talk:Filiocht">Talk</a> June 29, 2005 09:56 (UTC)

<li>For the second time, this is <i>not</i> a "US subject-matter article". <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankfaze_d3eb.html" title="User:Blankfaze"><b style="font-size: 74%;">BLANKFAZE</b></a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankfaze_e367.html" title="User talk:Blankfaze"><b style="font-size:90%;">(что</b><b style="font-size:70%;">??</b><b style="font-size:90%;">)</b></a> 29 June 2005 13:55 (UTC)

<li>What's next - you're going to claim that <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horatio_Nelson_b37a.html" title="Horatio Nelson">Horatio Nelson</a> is not a UK-subject-matter article? This guy was born and lived in the US - how much more US-subject-matter can it get? (And note that I spell colour, harbour, honour etc with a "u", if you want to know where I'm coming from.)<br />
Plus to which, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=E._E._Cummings&amp;oldid=3397933" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=E._E._Cummings&amp;oldid=3397933" rel="nofollow">last version</a> before you started editing the article <b>was</b> in US spelling - note the "summarized". Looking at the history, I wonder if you're becoming somewhat possessive of the article, given the number of edits you have made. It's fine to be an fan of the man, but don't go overboard... (Like some other people we can think of, neh?) <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 29 June 2005 17:06 (UTC)</li>

<li>As Filiocht noted, this isn't a 3RR violation since there isn't a fourth revert. Also, I don't believe that Blankface should have used the rollback link to revert TJive (on two occasions). American English does seem to be more appropriate for this article and certainly can't be considered "vandalism". If the matter can't be resolved on the talk page, it's time for an RfC. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 29 June 2005 10:04 (UTC)

<li>I should also note that the "first revert" was not a revert as I went through the actual article and discovered some other words that I had missed on a previous edit, though this may qualify as being close enough. --<a href="../../../t/j/i/User%7ETJive_a615.html" title="User:TJive">TJive</a> June 29, 2005 11:14 (UTC)</li>

<p>Blankfaze has reverted the page to the BE version again, with the edit summary "combattez la bonne bataille" ("fighting the good fight"). Can someone who is not involved make a call on a version and protect this page to prevent a revert war and give time for the participants to calm down? <a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFiliocht_c3e2.html" title="User:Filiocht">Filiocht</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/l/User_talk%7EFiliocht_11a7.html" title="User talk:Filiocht">Talk</a> June 29, 2005 14:15 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I myself am perfectly calm. However, I'm not sure this is the place to request protection, which I dislike generally, anyway. --<a href="../../../t/j/i/User%7ETJive_a615.html" title="User:TJive">TJive</a> June 29, 2005 14:18 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not fond of protection, but this seems destined to turn nasty without some sort of cooling off period. I'd protect the page myself if it were not for the fact that I've become involved. <a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFiliocht_c3e2.html" title="User:Filiocht">Filiocht</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/l/User_talk%7EFiliocht_11a7.html" title="User talk:Filiocht">Talk</a> June 29, 2005 14:20 (UTC)

<dd>Blankfaze has now broken the 3RR and shows no sign of stopping. He should be blocked, perhaps just for an hour, to make him cool down. Page protection is undesirable. — <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChameleon_a79b.html" title="User:Chameleon"><i>Chameleon</i></a> 29 June 2005 15:10 (UTC)

<dd><b>CORRECTION:</b> I have <i>not</i> broken 3RR. I have three reverts in the last 24 hours. My last 4 reverts have been at <b>14:56, 29 June 2005</b>, <b>14:07, 29 June 2005</b>, <b>18:44, 28 June 2005</b>, and <b>14:08, 28 June 2005</b>. As you can well see, my fourth revert came 24 hours and 48 minutes after the first. Trust me, I am <i>not</i> going to break 3RR. I will time them carefully. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankfaze_d3eb.html" title="User:Blankfaze"><b style="font-size: 74%;">BLANKFAZE</b></a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankfaze_e367.html" title="User talk:Blankfaze"><b style="font-size:90%;">(что</b><b style="font-size:70%;">??</b><b style="font-size:90%;">)</b></a> 29 June 2005 15:25 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Given <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Blockip" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Blockip" rel="nofollow">this</a>, I think protection is infinitly preferable. As I have only edited thie page to revert some unrelated vandalism, I will protect in 10 minutes if nobody else does it first. <a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFiliocht_c3e2.html" title="User:Filiocht">Filiocht</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/l/User_talk%7EFiliocht_11a7.html" title="User talk:Filiocht">Talk</a> June 29, 2005 15:16 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>As Blankfaze has not actually broken the 3RR, and as he has given me an undertaking not to do so, I say lets wait until tomorrow and see what happens. <a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFiliocht_c3e2.html" title="User:Filiocht">Filiocht</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/l/User_talk%7EFiliocht_11a7.html" title="User talk:Filiocht">Talk</a> June 29, 2005 15:26 (UTC)

<dd>Blankfaze if you had continued that pattern I would have blocked just as I would have block anyone else who was gameing the rule. I have blocked people for breaking the rule by as little as three minutes. Why should a few minutes make so much difference?<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 30 June 2005 00:22 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't get this gaming the rule business. There has to be a cutoff somewhere and the cutoff is 24 hours. You <i>cannot</i> block someone for, say, making four reverts in 24 hours and three minutes. You'd have no policy to stand on. We have rules for a reason. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankfaze_d3eb.html" title="User:Blankfaze"><b style="font-size: 74%;">BLANKFAZE</b></a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankfaze_e367.html" title="User talk:Blankfaze"><b style="font-size:90%;">(что</b><b style="font-size:70%;">??</b><b style="font-size:90%;">)</b></a> 30 June 2005 00:30 (UTC)

<dd>At the most basic level game would consists of adding a single bit of punctation. This is trivial to do so the rule would be utterly useless if we went for an ultra scrtict interpritation. So we must allow for some coverage of gameing the rule. So the question becomes how much? Some admins do it simply be comapreing the amount of the change but there are sometimes legit reasons for make lots of simular edits. Personaly I look at a users past history to see if there is a pattern or in your case they admit what they are doing. Of course in your case if you were against a halfway skilled or deterimed edit warriour you would already be up in front of arbcom with people pointing out parrelles to the Everking case (and there may have been a simular case involveing DR Zen) so the three revert rule is the least of your worries. People are blocked for gameing the 3 revert rule all the time. It seems to be acceppted practice.<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 30 June 2005 00:58 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's protected and tagged. Hopefully things can be trashed out in talk. By the way, Blankfaze's timing his edits carefully is making use of a loophole to <a href="../../../g/a/m/Wikipedia%7EGaming_the_system_6091.html" title="Wikipedia:Gaming the system">game the system</a>, which is violating the spirit of 3RR and is just as bad. --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> June 29, 2005 15:31 (UTC)</p>
<p>I concur with Khaosworks' assessment. Timing reverts to avoid breaking the letter of the 3RR is still decidedly disruptive. Blankfaze has been here long enough to know better, and I would not be inclined to defend him if he were to continue to game the system in such a manner. --<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 29 June 2005 17:37 (UTC)</p>
