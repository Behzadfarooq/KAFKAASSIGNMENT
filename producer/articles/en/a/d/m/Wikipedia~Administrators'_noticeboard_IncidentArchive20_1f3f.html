<p>I am writing to ask an administrator to close the vote as <b>KEEP</b> on the following page: <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Joseph_Ratzinger%2C_Sr._c7d3.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Joseph Ratzinger, Sr.">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Joseph Ratzinger, Sr.</a>. Its been over 9 days and people have come out of the woodwork saying that this article should be kept on Wikipedia. Yet, the deletion notice is still present on the page. I am afraid this will draw sockpuppets and vandals if it stays up there. Its pretty clear a majority would like to keep this article and I ask that this vote be put to an end. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 07:00, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A reasonable request.

<p><b>Comments:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>why the 4 day delay in reporting this?<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 23:05, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>The final two "reverts" were necessary to undo AndyL's wrongful action: he reverted this article after he himself protected it. I had first tried the alternative (leaving his revert intact but merely unprotecting the article), but when he insisted on reprotecting it, the only other alternative was to restore HIS original version (the one he applied protection to).</p>
<p>I believe my actions were entirely justified: there are exceptions to 3RR when it is necessary to undo a wrongful action. Reverting vandalism is one such case, and I assert that undoing AndyL's violation of protection policy ("Do not edit or revert a temporarily protected page", which is precisely what he did) was another such case.</p>
<p>AndyL's action was particularly egregious because page protection was not necessary, the revert was against interim consensus, and his subsequent talk page comments reveal a hotly partisan motivation. Thus, in combination, the revert-and-protect was a serious abuse of admin power. This is the subject of an RfC against him by User:Philwelch and User:TheGrza.</p>
<p>The RfC appears somewhat incomplete at the moment; I intend to add my comments to it this weekend to better document what happened. The case has also been discussed at <a href="../../../t/h/e/Talk%7EThe_Matrix_1a4f.html#MIM_review" title="Talk:The Matrix">Talk:The_Matrix#MIM_review</a>. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 01:53, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Since there are two RFCs over this issue I feel it is not a matter for the three revert rule. As such I am not going to block and would recomend against other admins blocking.<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 02:41, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>1) the claim that protection was not necessary is contradicted by the fact that there was a revert war earlier that day and by the fact that protection has remained in place in the five or six days since.</li>
<li>2) If Curps felt protection was invalid or that the "<a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/The_Wrong_Version" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/The_Wrong_Version" rel="nofollow">The wrong version</a>" had been protected there are other routes he could have taken other than violating the 3RR.</li>
<li>3) " there are exceptions to 3RR when it is necessary to undo a wrongful action" yes but those are incidents such as blanking of pages or vandalism. To violate 3RR simply because one disagrees as to which version of the page was protected is an abuse, even if it is done by an admin.</li>
<li>4) If 3RR is to be taken seriously it has to be enforced no matter who violated the rule, even if that person is an admin.</li>
<li>5) "*why the 4 day delay in reporting this?" As I'm an admin with the ability to implement tembans for 3RRs I don't think I've ever listed a 3RR violation on this board before and was not very familiar with it. As I am a party to this dispute I thought it best not to tempban Curps myself so I decided to list it here instead. Also, I didn't realise there actually had been a 3RR violation until someone else mentioned it the other day.</li>
<li>6) For Curps' hyberbole to be valid, administrators have to accept that it is justifiable for an admin to violate the 3RR when <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/The_Wrong_Version" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/The_Wrong_Version" rel="nofollow">The Wrong Version</a> of an article is protected. This would be an unfortunate precedent. AndyL 15:16, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>7) The claim tha the "revert was against interim consensus" is invalid as there had been no discussion whatsoever on the Talk page and thus no establishment, interim or otherwise, of consensus. AndyL 15:58, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I'd like to add that Curps' 3RR violation was raised both on the admin incident page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;oldid=12917633#Curps.27_and_AndyL.27s_possible_inappropriate_use_of_admin_power_at_The_Matrix" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;oldid=12917633#Curps.27_and_AndyL.27s_possible_inappropriate_use_of_admin_power_at_The_Matrix" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> (by violet/riga) and on the Matrix talk page by myself. In both cases Curps' refused to respond to the criticism and it is only now that it's been raised here that he's given a rationalisation for it, one in which he refuses to acknowledge that he made a mistake either by reverting a fourth time or by editing a protected page in which he'd been invovolved in a revert war. What he should have done is contact another admin. Instead he acted unilaterally, broke the 3RR and refuses to say he made a mistake in so doing. AndyL 17:38, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The four-day delay was because AndyL knew perfectly well that reporting this would expose his own actions to unwelcome scrutiny. Anyone who merely clicks on the link for the "3rd revert" above (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Matrix&amp;diff=12812630&amp;oldid=12806731" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Matrix&amp;diff=12812630&amp;oldid=12806731" rel="nofollow">20:29, 25 Apr 2005</a>) will see an edit summary that mentions AndyL's misconduct, which was certainly worse than some mere 3RR (and this is just the tip of the iceberg).</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I have now contributed to <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_AndyL_51d2.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/AndyL">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/AndyL</a> and replied to <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Curps_850f.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Curps">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Curps</a>. I regret I was not able to do so sooner due to real life intruding.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think this will now be settled at RfC or quite possibly RfA. You yourself filed an RfC over this; having both an RfC and 3RR are redundant. I presume the RfC is the one you wish to pursue. Take your pick, but pick one of the two.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As to your other 7 comments above, the 3RR page is not the place for this. Just to address your first point, I give reasons why the page protection was never justified in the first place at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_AndyL_51d2.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/AndyL">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/AndyL</a>.

<p>"The four-day delay was because AndyL knew perfectly well that reporting this would expose his own actions to unwelcome scrutiny."</p>
<p>This is an absurd and offensive response. There is no reason why a four day delay would result in any less scrutiny. The reason for the delay was: a) I was not aware of the violation until violet/riga mentioned it. b) I brought up the problem both on the Matrix talk page and on Curps personal talk page several times hoping for an explanation c) Failing any response or explanation from him (save evasion) I then brought the matter here.

<p>Something has gone very wrong here, I don't know what. He has wiped his talk page and user page (by moving them to /archived), and reverted some of his Vfd votes. But now he has started to vandalize some pages he contributed to earlier. I have blocked him for 24 hours.</p>

<dd>That's not entirely fair, Calton. Grace Note was editing, not revert warring, and has as much right to edit as Boothy443. These disagreements happen every day: if all editors were to leave Wikipedia after them, there would be no Wikipedia. Also, in the interests of disclosure, you may simply be annoyed with Grace Note because s/he defended me recently when you started spamming my talk page with a personal attack. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 10:03, Apr 28, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>yes WP can be frustrating. this is no excuse for this sort of childish behaviour, all that does is frustrate yet more people. he vandalizes, we block him, just like any other vandal. And I don't think User space is sacrosanct enough to host "fuck Wikipedia" rants. On top of his short temper, boothy seems to suffer from legasthenia, two ailings that in combination would seem to make him a less than ideal WP editor. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 08:22, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</small>

<li>I'm not sure what you're objecting to. He's not banned. A block has been imposed to put an end to a string of vandalism. I don't think anyone here wants anything other than for Boothy to come back better adjusted.

<li>Certainly I object to not letting him voice his anger on his user page. I don't know whether a block is appropriate or not. It could be. I haven't seen the extent of whatever he's done. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 14:07, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We don't have the technical means to block from all pages except for userpages. As for the general situation, I think your comments on this page would be more generally helpful if you did read the evidence that people presented before objecting. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 14:13, Apr 28, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Generally I made statements based on the representations of situations I see here; I don't get into the evidence for the same reason that I don't involve myself with the actions of blocking or unblocking. If I was going to do those things, I would review the evidence more closely. Mostly I'm concerned with seeing what kind of logic is being used, and what kind of mentality is at work, when it comes to sysop treatment of marginalized users. Anyway, what I wrote doesn't have anything to do with technical abilities, the question is whether Boothy's comments should have been removed from his own page. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 14:32, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You may not get invovled in blocking or unblocking users yuorself, but you are extremely involved when others do. People present evidence on this page in the form of diffs and links, so teh whole story is not presented here. I fully agree iwth Snowspinner when he says that your comments would be more helpful if you did read the evidence people presented here. They reason they do present it is to justify and explain their actions. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 15:08, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>right. User came back, and I'm now featured personally on his userpage, as a quote-admin-unquote vandal. I do not think he should be allowed to edit while he is blocked for vandalism. If he wants to put me to trial for blanking his embarassing rant, he can do so after sitting out his 21 hours' block, right? So I do suggest he is blocked for another 24h for evading the original block. And no, ek, there is no inalienable right to "vent your anger on user pages". WP is not a soapbox. Should we host "Fuck Wikipedia" statements? No. The web is wide, and if you have an issue with Wikipedia, you can curse it all you want using your own bandwidth. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 14:19, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</small>
<ul>
<li>Well, there we disagree; I think of course he should have the right to curse Wikipedia all he wants on his user page. We can only benefit from the criticism, as I see it. Why would a user become so alienated and angry? I think it benefits us to know the reasons for that. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 14:32, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>Personally, I couldn't care less whether he's polite about it or not. If he has a point to make, he should make it. That comes with respecting others' opinions. You don't just delete somebody's personal opinions from their user page. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 18:27, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Everyking, the reason is that he is feeling utterly helpless while WP "goes to pot". There are all these different factions of people voting for things based on their "political party" rather than reasoning (e.g. Schoolwatch), and admins breaking the rules on Protected pages and whatnot, and so on. He sees things as getting worse and worse, and, to a large extent, I'm afraid I'm forced to agree. But the problem is both he and I are powerless. There is no way to change the current system. He was already angry when he'd finished telling me of his concerns, and I'm afraid <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a>'s last remark came at the worst *imaginable* time, inadvertently pushing him over the edge... sigh... I hope he comes back soon, but I do think that he will not be fully at peace here until his grievances are dealt with, either in part or in full... <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Master Thief Garrett</a> 22:45, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>MTG, I take your word his concerns are sincere. I know we have problems. I know some admins get away with breaking the rules. However, by going berserk he doesn't help us at all. We need a solid body of sane editors who patiently guard the Wikipedia. We have no use for sulking boys and foaming berserks. Everyking's opinion impresses me very little, since he has made a habit of defending the most blatant trolls. Show some good judgement, which means taking it upon yourself to draw a line somewhere, and your opinion will again mean something. I would like to have Boothy443 as an ally fighting the nonsense that is going on, but he doesn't seem to stand up very well under pressure, and when he vandalizes, he should be treated as a vandal, end of story. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 06:38, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)</small></p>

<p>And will probably go on, because he is falsely claiming to be exempt from 3rr because he labels other people's changes as vandalism... when the "vandalism" is the default way the article has been for a long time as agreed upon by consensus of all other editors.</p>

<dd>Please also note that after my first revert today he left a message on my talk page claiming that my revert of his violated policy and that he would block me. When I did not trust him and left a reply there and his talk page pointing out that I wouldn't fall for that, he left a second message claiming that he had blocked me and that I would not be able to make edits.

<li>Nope. I am his brother, he called me after he was blocked to report Gabrielsimon. Despite the fact that the POV term of ¨terrorist¨ has been there for ages, it does not mean it is not POV. Also, Gabrielsimon made no attempt to take it to discussion page as well. 66.194.152.87 12:02, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Actually, those were not all reverts... one of them tried to change to "convicted of terrorism" instead of just "terrorist" exactly like the anon user requested, so to label it a revert is simply a lie. Also Gabrielsimon originally reverted to remove terrorist completely and then changed his mind and made it include terrorist (not "convicted of terrorist")... that doesn;t really count as a revert either if he was reverting himself. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 12:33, Apr 29, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is not a fact that McVeigh is a terrorist. It is a fact that he was convinced of terrorism in the US court, however. There is a difference. Would you also allow Mandela to be called a terrorist even though he has been convicted of terrorist activities?? Please see <a href="../../../w/o/r/Wikipedia%7EWords_to_avoid_41db.html" title="Wikipedia:Words to avoid">Wikipedia:Words_to_avoid</a> which clearly says that words such as ¨terrorist¨ should not be used without it claiming whom is making the claim. My brother used to use the word matry to describe them but he stopped because it was POV. You can not have it both ways.</dd>
<dd>The fact is that he violated the 3RR believing he was right, just as my brother did. It is unfair for you to be selective on when you apply wikipedia rules and when you do not. 66.194.152.87 12:37, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It was a revert with a different edit summary. Compare your current version with the one that was reverted to by you earlier.

<dd>It was not a revert with a different edit summary, it made several distinct changes... the photo was moved so that the person looking to the right would be facig the article instead of off the page, correct comma usage was added to the date, and the improperly vague term "American" (which can mean anyone in the western hemisphere) was modified to specify the United States.

<dd>Oh, you forgot something. You accidently re-added ¨domestic terrorist¨ which was the phrase that caused all of the reverts in the first place. You can not do a revert, add a few other unrelated changes, and expect it not to count as a revert. You are in the wrong and you know it. But do not worry, the admins here do not really seem to care when people like you violate the rules, it seems. Lupo sure can down hard and quick earlier on my brother but now it seems you can flout the rules as you feel fit.</dd>
<dd>The double standards by the admins here are totally unfair. The admins fail to apply the rules evenly and justly. They will twist their views on the rules depending on to whom they are talking to. One minute the use of martyr is POV and my brother caved in. But the use of terrorism, as it is in the article, is definatly POV and is allowed to stay. The admins further allow their users to violate the 3RR who brute force their POV. 66.194.152.87 12:51, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are one to talk about the rules considering that you admit you showed up solely to do the dirty work of a banned user. Whether you are in fact the same person (which you obviously are, based upon your experience with the way things work here, a newbie with only one edit under his belt would not know to file a 3rr right away) or someone working at his bidding the result is the same: You are knowingly violating a 24 hour ban, and a ban that could probably be a lot longer than that because it was excessive violations of the 3rr AND impersonating an admin.</dd>
<dd>But, hey, I had an accidental screw up of the 3rr listed above that they were nice and gave me a warning on, and if this one here in some way counts as an accidental violation somehow (which I don't see, as I made substantial changes, but you want to believe it so whatever) then I already used up my one warning and should be blocked. What's the first offense of violating 3RR run someone (I saw wasn't it 3 minutes for the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cat.html" title="Cat">Cat</a> revert war, some small number of hours for others)? Admins, feel free to hit me with it. I can go reflect on how bad it was accidentally revert a highly biased edit that a consensus of several editors previously agreed should not be there which was only there at that time because someone decided to weasel out of his 24 hour block. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 13:09, Apr 29, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>since DreamGuy admits to breaking the 3RR accidentially, I will block him together with 66.194.152.87. I'm sorry DreamGuy, of course you were only reverting a pov pusher, but that doesn't exempt you from the 3RR. You might just have waited for five minutes for another editor to revert anon. Anon is up to 7 reverts now, including one revert he did evading his original block, so his block will be longer this time. Anon: sit out your block: you are blocked from editing, as a person, not as an IP number.

<dd>The database has been hiccuping again, so edits have been lagging all over the place. I don't consider it impossible for an article to "disappear" through a move, either. I'm betting a small (tiny, really&#160;:-) amount on the theory that MediaWiki created the new article, deleted the old one and put in a redirect at that place, in that order, and the last change didn't get propagated fast enough. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 23:34, 2005 Apr 29 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It was an arbcom decreed ban. Conflict of interest is generally a term applied to situations where some judgment is called for. There is no policy, written or implicit, that says that my block was inappropriate.

<p>While Snowspinner should have let someone else make the block, I'm not much concerned about that. He was, after all, just following the decision. What concerns me much more is that Snowspinner was evidentally going after Gohde with considerable energy, tracking all his edits—I remember once on IRC he called him "psychotic"—and he has been rewarded for that by getting exactly what he wanted: harsh punishment of Gohde. I haven't seen much of Gohde's work, as far as I know he works on subjects related to alternative medicine, doubtless a lightning rod of controversy surrounding issues of scientific vs. traditional medicinal practices and such, but Snowspinner has pretty clearly been on a persecution campaign against the guy, and now he's banned for a year...and required to write some essays, too, like a misbehaving child in school? <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 23:21, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I looked over the case and saw Sannse saying that she acknowledged the year ban would appear overly harsh, and then she went on to make some sort of justification that basically hinged on the idea that, regardless of whether or not behavior can be attributed to malice, it is nevertheless punishable. I don't know about you, but to me, yeah, that kinda makes him look like a victim. Just because a person does some things that are inappropriate doesn't mean that personally can't still be terribly wronged. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 00:56, 1 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I'm coming a bit late to this (I have no connection at home at the moment and so am very behind) but wanted to make two points. Firstly, what I said was that the year ban would seem overly harsh <i>if you didn't look in detail at the whole complex case</i>. It wasn't possible to include all the edits I looked at in deciding on my votes, I looked through a vast amount of John's and other contributions. With the evidence looked at as a whole, I don't believe it was too harsh. Secondly, I didn't say that behaviour is punishable regardless of whether or not it was malicious – because our purpose on the arbitration committee is not to punish. This ban is not punitive, it is intended to prevent disruption to Wikipedia. I would say that the majority of cases that the arbitration committee look at have nothing to do with malice, but that doesn’t mean we should put up with problem behaviour just because a contributor <i>means</i> well. If the behaviour is causing disruption, and the user can't or won't change, then we need to take action to stop them. -- <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESannse_0094.html" title="User:Sannse">sannse</a> <a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESannse_2ae9.html" title="User talk:Sannse">(talk)</a> 14:00, 8 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Vandalised <a href="../../../a/l/l/All-women_band.html" title="All-women band">All-women band</a> article more than once and then preceeded to threaten me by claiming: <i>I'm watching you, yes you with the Red hair in Sydney stay right where you are in your lovely pink cap. What you don't realise is there is currently an Armalite AR-15 Assault rifle trained squarely at the head of the blonde to your left, and unless you do exactly as I say I am going to kill her.</i>. While people might think this is funny, at the time this was happening I did not. I have no idea who this person is, I've never met them before in my life. They only apologised(?) hours after I had already left. I would like the IP to be banned if possible. This type of childish behaviour from 60.240.178.196 shouldnt be condoned. <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHelenWatt_fa58.html" title="User:HelenWatt">HelenWatt</a> 03:32, 1 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Comment - I was sort of shocked when I saw this. I don't mean to be critical, but I thought maybe a death threat might call for a firmer response.

<li>Note that there are now two slightly different VfDs on the same subject, after jguk took an off-hand suggestion of Korath a little too seriously: <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Cricket_%28portal%29_ae81.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Cricket (portal)">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Cricket (portal)</a> and the new <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Portal%7ECricket_69a5.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Portal:Cricket">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Portal:Cricket</a>. There's also been an attempted <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_1b83.html#SPUI" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration">RfAr</a>, and more revert warring over all of it than I can keep track of, but there's probably no point in blocking any specific individual. Let's do our best to keep this sane, preferably by talking. Exactly <i>where</i> we do that is probably less important, and I'm sure our <i>readers</i> are the least affected by this. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 10:53, 2005 May 2 (UTC)

<li>The so-called "fourth revert" was to remove a duplication of a VfD message. For some reason Korath considers that edit as vandalism. All it was doing was trying to tidy up the page - and as the diff makes clear, it quite clearly isn't a revert. (Indeed, I checked carefully before making the edit to make sure that it was not a revert - and I'm somewhat annoyed about being called a vandal on a page I have spent many hours developing, and Korath a few minutes trying to destroy!) <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 11:00, 2 May 2005 (UTC)

<p>For all I know, the Amerinese sockpuppets and the DINGBAT sockpuppets may even be linked into a larger circle of sockpuppets.

<p>Well, I thought I had to bring this up somewhere that some responsible admins would see. I'm not a party in this debate, but recently a firestorm of debate has risen about these articles. It started with <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judeofascism.html" title="Judeofascism">Judeofascism</a>'s listing on vfd, then <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a>, then <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_fascism.html" title="Islamic fascism">Islamic fascism</a>, then Americofascism, then <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christofascism.html" title="Christofascism">Christofascism</a>. Many of the editors of these pages and those arguing on vfd and reverting like crazy are disrupting to make a point, throwing around personal attacks, reverting excessively for their own POV, and even downright vandalizing. I'm just hoping someone can take a look at the page histories and possibly protect the pages if need be. This needs to quieted down and resolved peacefully and respected, whatever the resolution. I'm especially concerned about <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStancel_c73e.html" title="User:Stancel">Stancel</a> who used personal attacks, "Assholes", and created Christofascism solely in response to <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a>'s keep result and page blanked Islamofascism after it survived vfd. Also Klominus dishonestly tagged that page with a speedy delete tag for utterly POV reasons, not any criteria, and has also been the main reverter on Islamofascism. Another troubling occurence was when Islamic fascism was created during the Islamofascism debate presumably to get around the ruling. I've only started watching this unfold in the middle of it, but it is intensley disturbing, and no doubt turning numerous good editors off to Wikipedia and just generally deteriorating the environment. I know this page isn't for conflict resolution, per se, but could we get some more good, responsible eyes over there to perhaps protect these pages if need be, and enforce 3RR and NPOV and no personal attacks? Just had to get this out, sorry to disturb you. --<a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a> 23:38, 1 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Although in this case, extra information was avaliable. I know that the person in question has no intention of ever making sensible edits, and probably won't be much bothered by the ban. Note also the "friend of the person" (me) is also a friend of James, and so that he assumed sincerity is hardly surprising&#160;;) If the person in question has a personality change (not likely), and decides to become an editor, I'll be more than happy to lift the ban. <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_g2s_b24e.html" title="User:Ed g2s"><font face="verdana">ed g2s</font></a> • <a href="../../../e/d/_/User_talk%7EEd_g2s_9b37.html" title="User talk:Ed g2s"><font face="verdana">talk</font></a> 00:24, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It would have been very nice if this had been stated (preferably on the anon's talk page, and in the block reason). Thanks for your response; it makes it a lot clearer. It still makes it seem to the outside world (i.e. not you and Jdforrester) that this was an under-the-table kind of thing. Simply document this on the anon's talk page and it would be a lot clearer, and we wouldn't have gotten into this.

<dd>This apparent assumption of bad faith on my part saddens me. The entire exercise was to remove a particular static IP that will be used for vandalism, as has been confirmed to my friend, despite warnings of being blocked, but only for the length of time that it will be active (until the end of term). The removal of this IP will reduce the sysop's workload in tracking and correcting vandalism - note that one of the pieces of vandalism went unnoticed for 9 days.</dd>

The anonymous user, however, has been quite persistent for quite a long time (see the current revert war over a cleaned-up version of <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Cube_3125.html" title="Time Cube">Time Cube</a>). I would appreciate if some of you could stop by GMT and let us know what you think, or perhaps add the articles to your watchlists (regardless of whether you feel including Time Cube references or excluding them is the way to go). If problems remain, any advice on what to do would be appreciated as well.

<dd>I don't see any way that the Time Cube is notable enough to warrant inclusion in any of those articles. I don't even know how notable it is in the first place. How widespread is this theory? As far as I can tell it's just one old guy with a website who gives himself inflated titles like "the wisest human". I don't know, maybe you could compromise with this editor through the creation of some article like "alternative theories of time", thereby letting him write without giving undue prominence to such a fringe theory. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 07:03, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As a theory, Time Cube isn't notable at all. As an Internet phenomenon, on the other hand, it's quite notable. I mean, the guy has been invited to give talks at MIT and GIT more or less purely because people are in awe of how stark raving CRAZY he is. Time Cube is a bunch of incoherent nonsense - but it has a special place in Internet history. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 14:08, May 2, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>SqueakBox has an agenda to remove a pro-life link from the external section of the Abortion entry. He has broken the 3RR. He continues to try and push his POV as he says "abortion is not in the Bible," while the pro-life, external link is very pertinent and offers information about abortion directly from the scriptures, encouragement for those that have had abortions, exhortation regarding forgiveness, etc. There is no good reason to remove the link from the pro-life, external links.</p>

<p>Some of you probably remember <a href="../../../r/o/v/User%7ERovoam_02c5.html" title="User:Rovoam">User:Rovoam</a> with whom I was engaged in an edit and revert war in various Azerbaijan- and Nagorno-Karabakh-related pages, who then descended from POV edits to banal vandalism and eventually, was blocked several times by admins and also placed under revert limitation and personal attack parole by the ArbCom following <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Baku_Ibne%2C_et_al._7934.html#Final_decision" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Baku Ibne, et al.">ArbCom decision on Baku Ibne et al</a>. His actions have been previously reported in WP:AN/I too by <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">User:Jwrosenzweig</a> (see, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive12#Help.2C_please.2C_at_Talk:Nagorno-Karabakh" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive12#Help.2C_please.2C_at_Talk:Nagorno-Karabakh" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>)</p>
<p>After ArbCom final decision Rovoam disappeared for a short period of time, appeared briefly again, then disappeared and now, since <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_24.html" title="April 24">April 24</a>, he has waged a full-scale revert war in various Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh-related pages once again. These pages include <a href="../../../n/a/g/Nagorno-Karabakh_a51f.html" title="Nagorno-Karabakh">Nagorno-Karabakh</a> (his “traditional” target), <a href="../../../c/a/u/Caucasian_Albania_1fac.html" title="Caucasian Albania">Caucasian Albania</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artsakh.html" title="Artsakh">Artsakh</a>, <a href="../../../a/z/e/Azerbaijan.html" title="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a>, and since yesterday, <a href="../../../a/r/r/Arran_%28Azerbaijan%29_d4c9.html" title="Arran (Azerbaijan)">Arran (Azerbaijan)</a>.</p>
<p>This person acts under various anon IPs, introduces POV edits, vandalizes the pages (including sneaky vandalism), puts irrelevant tags, simply for the sake of trolling (esp. in <a href="../../../a/z/e/Azerbaijan.html" title="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a> and now, in <a href="../../../a/r/r/Arran_%28Azerbaijan%29_d4c9.html" title="Arran (Azerbaijan)">Arran (Azerbaijan)</a>) and and as a result, disrupts normal functioning of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>This person is very wily and smart which makes him rather dangerous. His edits sometimes are misleading and not obvious. Moreover, initially, he reverted pages more than once a day, but then, after being blocked by admins, he realized that he could more safely revert the pages just once a day. So, "legally" he's reverting once a day (although he may violate this rule whenever he deems appropriate and convenient for himself), but nevertheless, his actions disrupt normal functioning of Wikipedia. The history logs of the pages I mentioned above looks like an active volcano crater just because of one person uses Wikipedia for taking revenge from me...</p>
<p>Given the wide range of IPs I also suspect that he’s possibly using some program (e.g. anonimizer or smth like this).</p>
<p>Some list of his anon IPs is available in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Baku_Ibne%2C_et_al./Evidence#Whois" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Baku_Ibne%2C_et_al./Evidence#Whois" rel="nofollow">ArbCom Evidences Baku Ibne et. al</a>.</p>

<p>I ask for your help to deal effectively with this person. I personally believe that this person should be banned from Wikipedia, his real WP account (<a href="../../../r/o/v/User%7ERovoam_02c5.html" title="User:Rovoam">User:Rovoam</a>, should be closed down indefinitely, or at least, he should be banned (indefinitely or for a quite long period of time) from editing Azerbaijan-related pages.

<dd>I have filed a report on his vabndalisms in <a href="../../../v/i/p/WP%7EVIP_552d.html" title="WP:VIP">WP:VIP</a>. However, Rovoam went beyond mere vandalism by making <b>personal insulting remarks</b>, such as <i>"rv vandalism and spurious edit by Tabib. I like to play this game with stupid Turkich people! It's fun!"</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nagorno-Karabakh&amp;diff=13479088&amp;oldid=13477796" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nagorno-Karabakh&amp;diff=13479088&amp;oldid=13477796" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>, <i>"I like stuffed Turkey too!"</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Turkey&amp;diff=13491946&amp;oldid=13490527" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Turkey&amp;diff=13491946&amp;oldid=13490527" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>, <i>"rv changes made by User:Tabib, who has been BANNED from all articles in Wikipedia by me"</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Safavids&amp;diff=13502374&amp;oldid=13490244" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Safavids&amp;diff=13502374&amp;oldid=13490244" rel="nofollow">[40]</a>. This is in clear violation of personal attack parole to which he has been placed by ArbCom. Therefore, I ask admins to block this person for a week and also start discussion on banning the real account of this person forever. Any person who descends to such low-level vandalisms should be banned from Wikipedia forever. Rovoam should not be an exception either.--<a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabib_5b29.html" title="User:Tabib">Tabib</a> 07:53, May 10, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've protected the following eight articles from Rovoam's nonsense: <a href="../../../a/r/r/Arran_%28Azerbaijan%29_d4c9.html" title="Arran (Azerbaijan)">Arran (Azerbaijan)</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artsakh.html" title="Artsakh">Artsakh</a>, <a href="../../../a/z/e/Azerbaijan.html" title="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/u/Caucasian_Albania_1fac.html" title="Caucasian Albania">Caucasian Albania</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/g/Nagorno-Karabakh_a51f.html" title="Nagorno-Karabakh">Nagorno-Karabakh</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/f/Safavids.html" title="Safavids">Safavids</a>, <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>, <a href="../../../u/r/a/Urartu.html" title="Urartu">Urartu</a>.</p>
<p>He has announced his intentions. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADante_Alighieri&amp;diff=13502855&amp;oldid=13485426" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADante_Alighieri&amp;diff=13502855&amp;oldid=13485426" rel="nofollow">"I simply reverting ALL edits by Turkish User:Tabib, because I try to give him a lesson of tolerance"</a>. No, I don't understand how that's supposed to teach tolerance, either.</p>
<p>Because Rovoam is virtually unblockable, somewhat obsessive, rather irrational, and clearly more concerned with proving some kind of point than with good faith edits, I am treating his activities as a kind of vandalism.

<dd>Regardless of who this is, something odd is happening here. The edit linked above is from 2002. However looking at the contribution history for 99.54, even when clicking the link at the top of that edit, no contributions prior to 15:07, 24 Apr 2005 appear (this is unlikely to be a problem at my end as the same happens on this Windows 2k PC at work as happened on my Linux PC at home). This apparent short editing history, first edit being a revert and accusion of Iasson being my sockpuppet led me to make the accusation above. The Faethon series escallated numerically, and a very recent sockpuppet was named for the first string of digits of <a href="../../../p/i/_/Pi.html" title="Pi">Pi</a>. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 12:32, 4 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think 99.54 is a Faethonian and not an Iassonian, for two reasons. D'abord he is related with Ra the sun-god, then his password is the same as his username (try it). I wonder how Faethonians managed to delete all previous contributions of 99.54 account. This is either a bug, or a miracle, or there is a Faethonian developer that has access to wikipedia database. Lets pray all together to Jimbo god, hoping he is going to do something and help poor wikipedia community to get rid of the Faethonian public accounts disease. In Jimbo, we trust.

<dd>I suspect that Yaft (<a href="../../../y/a/f/User_talk%7EYaft_fb2d.html" title="User talk:Yaft">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yaft_5815.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yaft">contribs</a>) is Iasson/Faethon for the following reasons:
<ul>
<li>Their only contribution is to this section of this page (the comment and a minor edit to remove line inserted between Pjacobi's comment and signature, presumably accidentally).</li>
<li>The style of English used is very similar to that used by Iasson/Faethon</li>
<li>argues that Faethon and Iasson are not the same person - nobody else has done this since before the ArbCom case</li>
<li>Knew it to be or to look for it being a public account (there is no mention of this elsewhere on this page currently, and the previous discussions about it were archived several days ago.</li>
<li>"Yaft" nicely expands to "Yet Another Faethon Troll" (I know this isn't a reason in itself, but taken with the other things this immediately sprang to mind).</li>

<dd>Did you try to log in and change the password? I'm unwilling to try right now because I'm on a static IP. Even if Yaft isn't a public account, it can still be blocked if it's an Iasson/Faethon sockpuppet. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 20:02, 4 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I did try earlier and the password wasn't Yaft. I'm not an admin and so can't do any blocking (although I did get caught by David's block of 99.54 earlier when I tested that password!).

I have protected all the pages, and he was blocked for editing for 24 hours due to his violation of the 3RRR, howver he then proceeds to edit as an anon. He has left abusive messages on talk and user pages. Someone has suggested a range block, I don't know how to do that, and I'm not sure how wise it is to apply a range block for an extened period, since this editor is persistant (he's been at it for at least a month).

<dd>Range blocks are easy - e.g. 10.10.0.0/16 to block everything from 10.0.0.0 to 10.10.255.255, 10.10.10.0/24 to block everything from 10.10.10.0 to 10.10.10.255.

<p>Thryduulf requested (on WP:AN/I) a check into GRider and Tallyman's correlating behaviour. They have similarities, but there wasn't enough for me to be reasonably confident they were the same person. There does appear to be sockpuppet theatre going on here, though. A combination of reviewing edits, IP checks and a check with Tim Starling for further technical info lets me state with reasonable confidence that GRider, HERMiT cRAB, Tallyman, ..-. ..- -.-. -.- ..- and almost certainly Jonahhh are the same person. Furthermore, they have also set up accounts G Rider, HERMiT CRAB, HERMiT cRAB and TallyMan (note subtle variation). I've blocked the lot as sockpuppets. There's another bunch on associated IPs I'm still checking further.</p>
<p>I'd always thought GRider behaved oddly differently from a regular single-account editor, and this would explain it a bit - the sockpuppeteer, whoever it is, was treating it as a role account for particular types of edit and not bothering to humanise it much.</p>
<p>I eagerly await the no doubt perfectly innocent explanation in my email.</p>
<p>This particularly pisses me off because I actually completely agree with their view on school articles - I see no reason we shouldn't have an article on every high school in the world ever, if we have verifiable sources. But the way they've gone about it is completely unacceptable.

<p><b>Comments:</b>User 198.2808.160.27, clearly a Clay Aiken fan, has been repeatedly removing information in the article referencing speculation that Clay Aiken might be gay, despite a consensus to include that information on the article's talk page (which has been listed on RfC, that's how I got involved). I haven't seen any indication that this person has visited the talk page though -- they certainly haven't participated; I suspect they may be somewhat new given the last revert, where they added "Line removed by scanning utility". (?) Between the most recent two reverts, I left two messages on the person's talk page asking them to come to the article's discussion page to try to come to some consensus instead of just continually reverting information. My second message included a warning that they could end up having their editing privileges temporarily revoked. No response except to delete the information and again replace it with the "scanning utility" line. I am not sure that a temp block would do much good, given that it's a dynamic IP, but I thought this step should be taken before requesting the page be protected.</p>

<dd>You ever notice how ArbCom decisions always turn out really badly for the accused? It's just a question of more bad or less bad. This one, well, he can still edit and he doesn't have to write any essays, so I guess he got off easy. But nobody ever goes through the ArbCom and gets a decision like "We can't really see that this person did anything particularly wrong." If there is such a case, point me to it. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 08:04, 5 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If they can't see that the accused did anything particularly wrong, then the case is normally rejected.

<dd>As I already noted below, and you notably responded to only half of, this statement is simply factually incorrect. In both the noted cases, the accuser turned out to be the one penalised, mainly or entirely. There are other examples, but you appear not to be interested in doing your homework before making such statements. Perhaps you could check the archives? - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 01:07, 6 May 2005 (UTC)

This one, well, he's not <i>directly</i> impugning anyone's good intentions, so I guess we got off easy.

<dd>As a community we must do more right than wrong, or I don't think we'd still exist, let alone be thriving. It seems to me that others can be critical of certain users all day long, provided those users have been marginalized to some extent or another, but if instead of joining in the beatings you speak up and say, "Hey, I think you've broken enough bones already", that's just an intolerable form of criticism. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 03:01, 6 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comments:</b> Tagteam213 and Spastika are clearly the same user attempting to avoid the 3RR, as both are making the same edits, and the timing is so close. Note especially the edit summary on the sixth revert: "rv tagteam gang".
