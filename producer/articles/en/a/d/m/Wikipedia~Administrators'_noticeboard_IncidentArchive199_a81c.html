<p>Ahoy. I've reverted a non-admin's attempts at the early closing <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Ebony_Anpu_4b4c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ebony Anpu">this AfD</a> early; I feel the AfD is legit, and, my understanding is that admin decision should take precedence over non-admin decision in a closing of an AfD. If I am incorrect, or if another admin feels the article should be speedy-kept, please close as needed. Thank you. --Jeffrey O.

<dl>
<dd>Without commenting on the validity of <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdrian_9077.html" title="User:Adrian">Adrian</a>'s close, my understanding was that <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAfD_60e1.html" title="WP:AfD">AfD</a> closes should be reviewed by <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a> even if potentially improper closes by non-admins. The view that "<i>admin decision should take precedence over non-admin decision in a closing of an AfD</i>" seems to be rather a strict interpretation of the fact that non-admins should defer to admins in closing AfDs. <a href="../../../c/s/k/WP%7ECSK_91ce.html" title="WP:CSK">WP:CSK</a> states "<i>Although closing AfD discussions that end with an outcome of "keep" can be done by non-admins, it is recommended that only administrators close discussions as speedy-keeps</i>", it does not forbid it outright. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WjB</b></a><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe"><i>scribe</i></a></span> 10:43, 12 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Indeed, but, as much as possible, we should stick to recommended guidelines. Additionally, the one who closed the AfD also voted on it, which, while not expressly forbidden, is also generally frowned upon. The AfD is not illegitimate, and as such, we should stick to accepted procedures, either the full five day deal, or an administrative speedy closure. --Jeffrey O.

<dd>This <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> was opened by an anonymous user, who lacks standing to nominate an article for deletion.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia does not exclude anonymous users, but AfD and other processes are understood to be <i>community</i> procedures, actioned by members of the community who are familiar with the community. When an anonymous user shows up straight at <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a>, they're either not a member of the community since they've never edited before, or they are, and they're hiding their identity.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The only support for deletion in the AfD was from another anonymous user, who subsequently threw a copyvio onto the article for good measure. I did close the AfD, and I believe I did so in-process, because a procedure begun without standing can have no legitimate outcome, and an administrator cannot sanction an illegitimate process.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Afterwards, the anonymous user edited the closed AfD and re-opened it, an action supported by Jeffrey. The situation can have no legitimacy past this point. If my closure was improper, there are procedures to review it, and the AfD can have a second nomination. We do no, to my understanding, <b>ever</b> re-edit closed AfD's. They are an archival of a community process, and we've gotten up to (10th) AfD on some articles specifically because as new issues arise, new AfD's should be opened.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Having multiple anonymous users all intimately familiar with Wikipedia points beyond the province of doubt at bad faith. I can't speculate at Jeffrey's motives, but must assume good faith -- he's almost certainly doing what he believes best for Wikipedia. The same can't be said for anon users involved. To clear the air, I'd like to see a checkuser take place here.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As has been said elsewhere, Wikipedia is not a suicide pact. Where there is abuse, it should be actioned. In this case, an effort to correct abuse was countermanded without discussion. I've done my best in my given time, as I always have and will. Thanks for reading.</dd>

<dd>You should probably just let it run course so the "previous afd closed keep" tag can be added at the end. That said, I think Adrian felt he was doing the right thing here, though I just don't think this is a valid speedy at this point and probably should not have been closed as such.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 16:31, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The templates have been reverted by Geni, presumably as they are clogging up CSD when they don't need to (if they need to go, just delete them - don't tag them for speedy and expect someone else to do the work). As nowhere near all of them should be deleted, mass-tagging them for speedy deletion was the wrong move. Go through them individually (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Whatlinkshere/Template:PhilippinesGov" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Whatlinkshere/Template:PhilippinesGov" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>) and tag the ones that ought to go (ie, the ones that don't fall under a reasonable claim of fair use) for deletion, rather than dumping them all in C:CSD and expecting others to sort them out. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></a></small> 13:16, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>At <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Public_opinion_and_activism_in_the_Terri_Schiavo_case&amp;diff=102628643&amp;oldid=102628062" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Public_opinion_and_activism_in_the_Terri_Schiavo_case&amp;diff=102628643&amp;oldid=102628062" rel="nofollow">this diff</a>, we again find <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> causing trouble. He revered my edit, removing every single link that I put in, supposedly because of angst with one particular link that is a blog.</p>
<p>I don't think he is right to oppose that, but at least he makes a half-way argument about not being notable. (I say this to contrast the arguments <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto">Proto</a> made about blogs not being acceptable; Of course, he is wrong: Many blog links had been in the article after his edit.)</p>
<p>I will be fine with any consensus by the community on the links in question -if for not other reason than to make Calton stop arguing, a worthwhile motive, but not the best motive, I admit. (We should have as motives simply to make an Encyclopaedia article with sufficient details -and references to back them up.)</p>
<p>So, in short, <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terri_Schiavo_eb3a.html" title="Terri Schiavo">Terri Schiavo</a>'s article seems OK, but help is needed at the <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_opinion_and_activism_in_the_Terri_Schiavo_case_14cf.html" title="Public opinion and activism in the Terri Schiavo case">Public_opinion_and_activism_in_the_Terri_Schiavo_case</a> article -specifically, the links section.</p>
<p><b>PS: Any user can look at my recent contributions to see that I am a responsible editor, just in case anyone wants to know. Plus, I was the one who created the pretty Table of Contents template you see at the top of the page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:TOCcenter&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:TOCcenter&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">here</a>, which, for some reason, is needed: The Table of Contents doesn't automatically show like it used to. Anyone can help here??</b></p>
<p>In closing, if I am not around to vote, then my "vote" for each and every link enumerated is "add this link," but in the end, if some links are voted down, I would hope that at least some of them could stay -to strengthen the references section.--<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGordonWatts_0d94.html" title="User:GordonWatts">GordonWatts</a> 09:27, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I went ahead and made an edit revision and reverted to a prior stable version, but although I did not include the North County Gazette link, I want to clarify: My "vote" for each link is to "add" -including the Gazette link. I just wanted to clarify that I'm voting "for" its inclusion, and the only reason I don't myself add it is because I'm a peace-living person who does not want to be responsible for <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_Three_cdfc.html" title="World War Three">World War Three</a> on this wiki.--<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGordonWatts_0d94.html" title="User:GordonWatts">GordonWatts</a> 09:56, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Gordon, things are "degenerating" only in the sense that you're not getting your way: so far <b>every single editor</b> commenting has disagreed with you. All of them. 100%. Unanimous.

<dd>I saw it.

<p>Well here's my answer to your request for help - your sites are unsuitable for adding to a wikipedia article. I hope that is of help to you. --<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFredrick_day_9590.html" title="User:Fredrick day">Fredrick day</a> 14:08, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Gordon, we all saw your requests, and you must consider them denied. The problem is entirely yours - it has been since the day you got here. And while your acts are certainly not malicious, it became abundantly clear a long time ago that you have little proper understanding or appreciation of Wikipedia policies and procedures and especially community norms. Many people have tried to help you in the past. Community patience can only go so far, though. --Jeffrey O.

<p>My issue is with a persistant vandal, who as of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a>-<a href="../../../f/e/b/February_13.html" title="February 13">02-13</a> has two known IP addresses, and ten user accounts. These accounts are used to primarily vandalise the articles <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phil_Mitchell_2084.html" title="Phil Mitchell">Phil Mitchell</a> (where the user persists in calling the character fat, a point of view), <a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Mitchell_%28EastEnders%29_259b.html" title="Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)">Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)</a> (where the infobox image is constantly removed with the edit summary "I don't like the image", and insulting things are written about the character), and <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonia_Fowler_c45d.html" title="Sonia Fowler">Sonia Fowler</a> (where image captions are changed to call the character a troll).</p>
<p>This vandalism started on <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../n/o/v/November_7.html" title="November 7">11-07</a>, when nonsense was added to the article <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phil_Mitchell_2084.html" title="Phil Mitchell">Phil Mitchell</a>, and has continued almost every day since.</p>
<p>Four of the ten accounts have been indefinitely blocked, but I want to know whether there is any action that can be taken to stop this person creating new accounts.</p>
<p>Also notable is the fact that this user seems to have a personal vendetta against me (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wellard&amp;diff=106824714&amp;oldid=91637281" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wellard&amp;diff=106824714&amp;oldid=91637281" rel="nofollow">see this edit summary</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ATrampikey%2Fsandbox3&amp;diff=107823493&amp;oldid=106398338" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ATrampikey%2Fsandbox3&amp;diff=107823493&amp;oldid=106398338" rel="nofollow">this vandalism of my sandbox</a>), and the fact that the user has stated that they will stop editing when the articles are semi-protected (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Phil_Mitchell&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107837150" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Phil_Mitchell&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107837150" rel="nofollow">see edit summary</a>).</p>

<dd>Of what I can gather of this situation from reading talk pages and whatnot, is that Calton is, ONCE AGAIN, asserting his opinion in place of others and be damned those other that try to voice an opinion different. I am not defending either side, I am netural in this, but in my experience (and from what I have read on the articles and talk pages) Calton has responded to GordonWatts with rude and incivil comments to incite a response out of GordonWatts and keep the conversation going after GordonWatts has thrown his hands up and "trust God to let the chips fall where they may". Calton will continue to insult GordonWatts into a response and keep this going as long as possible. This is not about GordonWatts, it is about Calton's inability to act like an adult, calm down, and stop acting like a child throwing a fit. - <a href="../../../o/r/a/User%7EOrangemonster2k1_ef23.html" title="User:Orangemonster2k1">SVRTVDude</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../o/r/a/User_talk%7EOrangemonster2k1_f61c.html" title="User talk:Orangemonster2k1">Yell</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Orangemonster2k1_ce79.html" title="Special:Contributions/Orangemonster2k1">Toil</a>)</sup> 05:57, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><i>Bringing up psychological projection....that's a new low for you</i> So you apparently didn't bother to read the link provided. Pity. Let me help: "In psychology, psychological projection (or projection bias) is a defense mechanism in which one attributes ("projects") to others, one’s own unacceptable or unwanted thoughts or/and emotions" -- your attribution to me of what you were doing is what fits. I guess I could have simply called it "irony", but that term is overused in my opinion.</dd>
<dd><i>If you actually READ the "note" I sent you, you would have actual realized I was trying to be nice.</i> Of course! I should have realized you were nicely pestering me when I asked to be left alone, nicely filing an RFC, nicely stalking my edits and making nicely unexplained reversions of my edits and re-adding all of that nice spam I had removed, nicely removing deletion tags out-of-policy, nicely canvassing two of the biggest -- and presumably nicest -- Wikilawyers on Wikipedia trying to enlist their no-doubt-nice support, nicely inserting yourself into discussions because I'm nearby, and nicely asking for me to punished -- nicely punished, no doubt. So as far as "nice" goes, I do not think that word means what you think it means.

<p>I'd be grateful for admin eyes on what's going on here. After lengthy discussions (at <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia_talk%7EUsername_ba3d.html#Non-latin_characters_and_Unified_Login" title="Wikipedia talk:Username">Wikipedia talk:Username#Non-latin characters and Unified Login</a> and <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia_talk%7EUsername_ba3d.html#Latin_character_transliterations" title="Wikipedia talk:Username">Wikipedia talk:Username#Latin character transliterations</a>) on the issue of asking editors with non-Latin-alphabet usernames to provide a Latin-alphabet portion of their signatures, consensus was reached that we should require this. Kim Bruning disagreed, but things went against him. He subsequently turned up at <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">Wikipedia:Signatures</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ASignatures&amp;diff=107188049&amp;oldid=107170888" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ASignatures&amp;diff=107188049&amp;oldid=107170888" rel="nofollow">deleted the relevant section</a>. This was immediately reverted, and he took it to the Talk page.</p>
<p>When reminded of the consensus, he dismissed it as having happened elsewhere, and insisted that only the local discussion mattered (using authoritarian language such as: "I am provisionally willing to accept that compromise"). He then watered down the section, saying that he'd reached an understanding of the consensus in discussion with <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">Pschemp</a>. I pointed out that this was a novel notion of consensus, and he claimed that he was acting ina ccordance with <a href="../../../b/r/d/WP%7EBRD_8e65.html" title="WP:BRD">WP:BRD</a>; this turns out to be a procedure that is neither policy nor guideline, and which was largely written by... Kim Bruning. Moreover, leaving aside its status as nothing more than an essay (though it's in Wikipedia space with no descriptive template to say what it is), its own introduction says goes against the way that Kim Bruning has applied it in this case.</p>
<p>This whole business is worrying, as it seems to be a straightforward and sustained attempt on the part of one editor to overturn consensus; I'd really like others to look in on it. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Talk</font></a>) 00:00, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You know, I've looked and I can't seem to find a consensus on that page. Personally, I think the whole 'block people if they do not use our alphabet' thing is a bad idea and suggested a <a href="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8816" class="external text" title="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8816" rel="nofollow">code alteration</a> instead.

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"Block people if they don't use our alphabet" wasn't the consensus; it was that users should be required to use a Latin-alphabet identifier in their signatures (giving thema choice rather of sig than an imposition via software). Given that a good-faith, courteous person would surely have no problem with that, the question of blocking wouldn't really arise.</dd>
<dd>As for consensus — it seemed clear to me that the consensus was in favour of the current requirement. At worst, though, you seem to be saying that there was no consensus to change the text; my worry remains in either case. If there was no consensus to change, an editor shouldn't unilaterally delete the text, and shouldn't claim consensus on the basis of private discussions with one other editor. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Talk</font></a>) 09:32, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It seems people are not quite on the same wavelength. Mel appears to say that people should have a Latin-lettered <i>signature</i>, and Kim states that we shouldn't prohibit people from having a non-Latin <i>username</i>. That's not really a conflict. FWIW multi-alphabet usernames are bound to be useful for Single Login which should be online some time this year; it is not unreasonable for any particular language wiki to require a signature <i>within that wiki</i> that is legible there. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 13:18, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That's certainly part of the problem. Now he's discussing the issue, his arguments are largely that actions regarding the blocking of usernames have recently caused a fuss at wikimedia, and so we mustn't make conditions concerning signatures. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Talk</font></a>) 23:09, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Isotope23, I did consider the "tongue in cheek" interpretation; I just couldn't find it as convincing as the "give those who want to cause trouble on Wikipedia solid advice on how to maximize damage" interpretation. Had the section that advises editors to add phrases such as "some argue" and "Many critics" for 'NPOV' contained some appropriate tongue in cheek acknowledgement such as "And of course, these phrases are in no way <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_weasel_words_0886.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words">weasel wordings</a>" then I could believe that the true intended message was "do NOT use these phrases because they do NOT make your POV statements suddenly NPOV." But given the general contents of the page I just do not believe it's a tongue in cheek way to say "Don't do these bad things", I believe it's solid advice on how to disrupt Wikipedia and push POV. -- 192.250.34.161 20:26, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>If I may just say something. I shouldn't have called him "disturbed". Silly thing to do, and I'm sorry I said it.

<p>Today, he blanked a message I wrote from my talkpage <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AGardener_of_Geda&amp;diff=107867260&amp;oldid=107862607" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AGardener_of_Geda&amp;diff=107867260&amp;oldid=107862607" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>Later, he "stalked", and blanked one of my edits <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Greenhouse_%28disambiguation%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107872690" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Greenhouse_%28disambiguation%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107872690" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<dd>Thank you. Can we also go about identifying this individual? I don't wish to make any legal threats, but I would like additional information so that I could go to law enforcement if death threats continue. What recourse do I have? Blocking an anonymous IP address doesn't seem sufficient given the nature of the offense.

<p>Per the incident report above, I wish to report, separately, Evrik messing with my AFD nominations. I have never been so angry about the behaviour of another editor as I am at this moment. Even with the whole <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Abu_badali_b366.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Abu badali">Abu badali mess</a> I was generally able to keep calm but I am absolutely furious right now.</p>
<p>As outlined in the incident report I created a group AFD nom for four <i>Amazing Race</i> contestants at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_James_Branaman_b0f2.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/James Branaman">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/James Branaman</a>. I did this when I was checking through the Amazing Race contestants category checking the use of fair use pictures. Yesterday when Evrik created <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Conley%2C_Jr._9a1f.html" title="David Conley, Jr.">David Conley, Jr.</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Conley_e7ef.html" title="Mary Conley">Mary Conley</a> I also created a combined afd nom for those two people at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_David_Conley%2C_Jr._fac4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/David Conley, Jr.">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/David Conley, Jr.</a>.</p>
<p>I have just logged on and found that Evrik has created individual noms for each of the people included in the two group nominations, basically usurping my nomination. He moved them all to the same AFD page (James Branaman had previously been logged at 8 Feb and the Conleys at 13 Feb) and created a sub-heading, basically messing up the entire AFD log page.</p>
<p>I have never in my entire time on Wikipedia faced somethings so calculating. I have no idea about the policy regarding this because I have never heard of it happening before, but I feel that as the original nominator I have the right to revert all these subversive actions, which I have already done.</p>
<p>If what Evrik has done is outside Wiki policy (and to be honest I am not certain that it is, even though I feel it should be) I would request that you please take action against him. I feel he has violated <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> and I am feeling persecuted and harassed. I also wish to make it clear that I am taking the entire incident of the past week to Request for Comment as I feel I should not have to put up with what I have. Quite frankly I feel pissed off and miserable. -- <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_f0ef.html" title="User:PageantUpdater"><font color="#DE3163">PageantUpdater</font></a> • <small><a href="../../../p/a/g/User_talk%7EPageantUpdater_3fed.html" title="User talk:PageantUpdater"><font color="#660066">talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PageantUpdater_2fc0.html" title="Special:Contributions/PageantUpdater"><font color="#FF4F00">contribs</font></a> | <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_Esperanza_875b.html" title="User:PageantUpdater/Esperanza"><font color="#2E8B57">esperanza</font></a></small> 21:20, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>In Evrik's defense (and I may not be seen as objective), the afd's were done in a confusing manner. As far as I can tell, there is no right to make a group nomination, at least not the way it was done. The nomination should have mentioned the names of all the articles being deleted. In my mind, PageantUpdater did not list the articles fro deletion correctly, and Evrik was trying to fix it. Was Evrik the right person to do it - maybe not. There has been so much drama created here (primarily by PageantUpdater) that this whole thing should be dropped. However PageantUpdater should get some sort of warning for <a href="../../../s/t/a/WP%7ESTALK_e55b.html" title="WP:STALK">WP:STALK</a> and [[WP:POINT}}. --South Philly 00:13, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Folks, I understand that one's thunder shouldn't be stolen, but the end result should be what you both desire. In practice, lump nominations save time but risk making <i>enormous</i> mistakes. Essentially, lump AfD's like that are really RFC's in disguise, as they are attempting to set a regional include/exclude, like "all persons who didn't win the race or end up in the final two are out as stand-alone articles." That's better handled by a venue other than a mass AfD, but it's slow and aggravating. The matter really could be solved, though, by the splitter adding "reforming mass nomination by PageantUpdater" so that all know who did the original nomination. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:54, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I have had a Arbcom case against me in the past. I am now, I believe being harrassed based on it. Any dispute with a user, meaning disagreement involves a user threatening an Arbcom hearing against me. There is a page for enforcement that lets people complain about those who have had hearings, where do those who feel they are being harrassed because of them have to go? I was asked by <a href="../../../l/o/v/User%7ELovelight_bc72.html" title="User:Lovelight">User:Lovelight</a> to help with a template they were working on template:911cd. I added the events of 9/11 to the template, as the collapse of the World Trade Center is directly relevant to the theory that it was done by controlled demolition. That edit was removed by a user, <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">user:Arthur Rubin</a> with the following message <i>"Removing events which SHOULDN'T be in this template.

<dd>I agree that everyone should calm down. However, I see absolutely no reason to automatically assume that Nuclear's edits are "vandalism", as Arthur Rubin has consistently termed them, nor any reason to use administrative rollback on them. This is, at best, a content dispute, and should be resolved that way instead of using administrative privileges and threatening ArbCom sanctions against others.

<dd>No, but I do see them as essentially moot. The template looks <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplates_for_deletion_Log_2007_February_13_32e6.html" title="Wikipedia:Templates for deletion/Log/2007 February 13">likely to be deleted</a>, and that is probably the best result for the encyclopaedia since we have {{<a href="../../../9/1/1/Template%7E911ct.html" title="Template:911ct">911ct</a>}} which is more comprehensive and stands some chance of including articles sceptical to the 9/11 conspiracy twaddle. Above all, Nuclear is escalating this. Discourse, debate, negotiation, call it what you will, the fact is that Nuclear is being excessively passionate and the other editor did <i>not</i> call him stupid, quite the opposite. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 23:45, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think it should be noted that the <i>first</i> thing Arthur Rubin did when he didn't like Nuclear's edits to the template was to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template%3A911cd&amp;diff=107906967&amp;oldid=107479014" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template%3A911cd&amp;diff=107906967&amp;oldid=107479014" rel="nofollow">revert</a> (with an edit summary suggesting the edit violated Nuclear's probation); the <i>second</i> thing he did was to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:911cd&amp;diff=107908860&amp;oldid=107907627" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:911cd&amp;diff=107908860&amp;oldid=107907627" rel="nofollow">undo</a> Nuclear's edit, and the <i>third</i> thing he did was to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:911cd&amp;diff=107910270&amp;oldid=107909021" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:911cd&amp;diff=107910270&amp;oldid=107909021" rel="nofollow">roll it back</a>. Not once did Rubin attempt to discuss the edits on the template talk page or Nuclear's talk page. I do not believe that being on arbitration probation or parole relieves editors of the ordinary expectation of discussion and consensus. Making a good faith atttempt to find consensus that ultimately fails because the editor is disruptive is one thing; threatening to report an arbitration violation on the very first edit summary and never discussing it with the person is a different kettle of fish all together, and I don't think that's what arbcom has in mind when they put people on probation or parole. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 04:09, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../t/o/p/User%7ETop_Gun_a8ab.html" title="User:Top Gun">Top Gun</a>’s apparent field of expertise is 20th century American military history. Unfortunately, Top Gun seems to have absolutely no understanding of or respect for Wikipedia’s <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_8c2e.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright">Wikipedia:copyright</a> policy. Those articles by Top Gun which I have read have always contained sentences or sentence fragments from external sources without permission. My guess as to the modus operandi is that Top Gun takes some online news articles (most frequently AP material), mixes their content and changes the grammar; this makes it very difficult to identify the severity and extent of the violations. As an example, I offer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Hue&amp;diff=104413062&amp;oldid=104400143" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Hue&amp;diff=104413062&amp;oldid=104400143" rel="nofollow">[33]</a>, where I removed identifiable content from two external sources; the bulk of that article is lifted from a third source <a href="http://ehistory.osu.edu/vietnam/books/1968/0000.cfm" class="external autonumber" title="http://ehistory.osu.edu/vietnam/books/1968/0000.cfm" rel="nofollow">[34]</a>, which is probably in the public domain, merged with a different (presumably clean) article on the same topic. I would also like to draw attention to Top Gun’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=upload&amp;user=Top+Gun" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=upload&amp;user=Top+Gun" rel="nofollow">upload log</a>.</dd>

<p>User:Lantoka/Sandbox2, the page's creator is agitating about this on my Talk but seems unwilling to bring it here themselves. So.</p>
<ul>
<li>General Mayhem has been deleted and deletion reviewed.

<li>User:Lantoka/Sandbox2 was created on November 17, reportedly with the blessing / assistance of <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">User:Essjay</a>. There were about a dozen edits to the article that day.</li>
<li>On December 25 there were two further edits, bringing the total to around 16 (excluding creation of the original blank page).</li>
<li>I deleted the article on January 29 as <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#G4" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD#G4</a>, abuse of user space, and also I note that the original content was a copy and paste from a mirror, so violates <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>.</li>
<li>The user began to agitate on 8 February. I explained the problem, but the user evidently believes that the reported past support of Essjay is justification for keeping the page in user space in perpetuity. The user asserts that it was being "worked on" and that they have founght hard to keep the article itself (undeniable).</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, I should have been kinder to the user. Not at issue. Was it acceptable to delete it? I think so, but I welcome input. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 13:44, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>The copyright violation is a red herring - the user took it from a Wikipedia mirror. G4 explicitly does not apply to userspace. If Lantoka had asked an admin "I want to see if General Mayhem can be made into an acceptable article, can you undelete it to my user space?" then I think most admins would have assumed good faith and done it for them. In fact, Lantoka performed the same operation for himself without admin assistance. But as far as I read it, speedy deleting it without first raising a concern with Lantoka was an out of process deletion. <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFys_bced.html" title="User:Fys">Fys</a>. “<a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFys_bced.html" title="User:Fys">Ta</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fys_a016.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fys">fys</a> <a href="../../../f/y/s/User_talk%7EFys_d202.html" title="User talk:Fys">aym</a>”. 15:07, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Fys: You wouldn't miss taking a shot at Guy, wouldn't you? The page has been through the process many times before; and the clear consensus has been towards its deletion. JzG has already provided the evidence that the user in concern has been re-creating deleted material in his userspace, when no good would come out of that. I also expect that you know that content in userspace is available to the world-at-large by a quick search using Google.

<li>Can't see why the copyvio would be a red herring, the GFDL is quite explicit in terms of attribution. Persumably the mirror has attribution the version copied didn't. I guess we should be moving our real version to user space in these circumstances for further work. We do permit such activity if they are trying to actively improve the article (that would be to address the AFD issues), but as arbcom has reiterated in at least one case, using userspace to merely evade proper deletion process (or to keep POV forks if you don't like where the real article is going), is unacceptable. Sounds like a judgement call as to if the user was actively trying to address the issues of AFD and thereby ultimately enhance our collection of articles or if it were just trying to evade the deletion. I imagine <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> didn't evisage his involvment as being seens as some sort of permission (which he couldn't give) to keep it in userspace indefinitely. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 15:44, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Fys, it doesn't matter if you name the admin, comments like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ALantoka&amp;diff=107433951&amp;oldid=107030364" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ALantoka&amp;diff=107433951&amp;oldid=107030364" rel="nofollow">[35]</a> tell their own story. Lantoka appeared to have accepted matters until you stated with great confidence that there was no policy basis for deleting stale copies of multiply-deleted GFDL-violating content from userspace. Hey, turns out you're wrong about that! ArbCom says that this is an end-run around process, and <a href="../../../c/_/_/WP%7EC_2f43.html" title="WP:C">WP:C</a> and <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a> say it's a copyright violation and must go anyway, plus we have done it numerous times before under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a free web host, <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> and other justifications. Friday undeleted to User:Lantoka/gm in November, a different location, but then Alphachimp moved this version back to mainspace at General Mayhem in order to delete it, which was done on Jan 1. At no time between Nove 16/17 (when the two appeared) and January (when they were deleted) was there <i>any</i> significant activity on <i>either</i> copy. The copy at User:Lantoka/Sandbox2 was not an admin undelete for rework, it was a copy from a mirror. And <b>there was no work being done on it</b>. A good faith attempt to rework an article rather implies some actual activity, wouldn't you say? Two edits in nearly three months is <i>not</i> working up a new article. Lantoka obviously doesn't understand the details of <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>, not a big surprise, it looks like Lantoka is not a very active editor (either here or on the GenMay forums, only about 350 posts there since 2003). So although you're wrong on a number of levels I'm not surprised since you have not, as far as I can tell, been involved in any of the deletion debates or reviews for GenMay, and you've never edited it, so it's not a big surprise that you've not got the full picture here. I would, however, have expected a former admin to understand the copyright issue a little better. Anyway, thanks for trying to help, but you didn't. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 17:42, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

I, and many other administrators, will undelete and userfy deleted articles if a user expresses interest in improving them, but it most certainly is not an unlimited offer to turn userspace into free webhosting for articles not appropriate for mainspace. If it is not edited for weeks at a time (such as in this instance), then it should be deleted, as it is, in the end, an attempt to subvert deletion process. I'm not even touching the GFDL violations in this instance, which made it an even easier delete. —<a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell"><b><font color="#555">bbatsell</font></b></a> <a href="../../../b/b/a/User_talk%7EBbatsell_7978.html" title="User talk:Bbatsell"><font color="#C46100" size="1">¿?</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bbatsell_a457.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bbatsell"><font color="#2C9191" size="3">✍</font></a> 18:37, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

You were edit-warring and breached <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> on some political article and got blocked by <a href="../../../a/k/s/User%7EAksi_great_bb76.html" title="User:Aksi great">another administrator</a>. Later, you got yourself permanently banned from editing it. Then you evaded your block by editing through your IP address, for which I extended your block. I cannot comprehend what you mean by the word <i>true</i>. If it <i>looks</i> like a personal attack, I will block you. Stop provoking other users. — <a href="../../../s/i/r/User_talk%7ESir_Nicholas_de_Mimsy-Porpington_ae26.html" title="User talk:Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington"><font color="black"><b>Nearly Headless Nick</b></font></a> 12:01, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This looks more like evidence gathering in preparation for a mediation/RFC/RFArB than an attack page.

<dd>It is not. We are already in mediation, and the user has cited none of this so-called "evidence." The quotes are all out of context, without links so that the original context cannot easily be consulted. They are also all months old - one of them over a year old. The user has used the page once in a conversation with someone else on my talk page, and the user used the page to disparage me during the conversation, not to start mediation. If s/he wants to engage in another mediation, some indication of what dispute we are mediating would be a good idea. As it is, the only purpose of this page seems to be to disparage me. <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 21:14, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The user would be strongly advised to keep links to diffs where the comments were made, or at links to the appropriate section of a permalinked version of the page. Isolated, incomplete quotes taken out of context are at best useless and at worst deceptive for use in an Arbitration case.

<li>People should really be able to clip evidence in user space, if that's their inclination, but the "evidence" will be altogether worthless as a series of quotes instead of a series of diffs. In other words, it may be fostering an atmosphere of wiki-lawyering and hostility to keep such "evidence" pages, but in the particular instance the "evidence" would have been all but worthless anyway. In either instance, though, I thoroughly disagree with calling it an "attack page," if it's an evidence page. Those sorts of things are usually more for intimidation than an attack. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:59, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>(1) there is no evidence that it is an evidence page. All the quotes were too old to be relevant to any current dispute, and the only time the user cited the page was to personally attack.

Certainly neither should be permitted under wikipedia policy, right? <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 12:53, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, Yuser, on <a href="../../../b/p/_/WP%7EBP_c8aa.html" title="WP:BP">WP:BP</a>, everything under "unblocking" is a subcategory of "Instructions for Administrators". I don't think you should be replying to blocking instructions if you are not an admin. Not only is it overstepping your authority, but it gives a false impression to a blocked user, who thinks their block has actually been reviewed by someone with authority to do something ahout it. This presents the possibility that they will not return to Wikipedia, thinking they are permanently blocked. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffpw_23d5.html" title="User:Jeffpw">Jeffpw</a> 08:10, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>If a job doesn't require admin tools, then it isn't an admin-only job. Denial of unblock requests requires no pressing of the shiny buttons. It <i>is</i> possible for non-admins to abuse the template; but then it <i>is</i> possible for admins to do so. In either case, a quiet word on a talk page solves it (or if not, it can go <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERfC_a13a.html" title="WP:RfC">upwards</a>). Adminship really is No Big Deal<sup>TM</sup> - it's just a couple of extra buttons the community (s)elects people to have. It doesn't give the user of the buttons any more or or any less "authority" than someone without them.

<dl>
<dd>While I agree with you, Redvers, on the concept of adminship being no big deal (I certainly wouldn't want it), I disagree with you on this particular issue. Since unblocking somebody is an administrative action, it can logically be inferred that denying a request to unblock is something that also should be handled by admins. Further, though Yuser stated in his/her edit summary that s/he was not an admin, s/he did not do so in the user page, nor did s/he disabuse WWWUser of that false perception that an admin had reviewed the block (review the relevant talk page to confirm that WWWuser thought s/he was interacting with an admin). I feel Yuser has acted above his/her authority in this instance and others, and have left a message on his/her talk page to that effect. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffpw_23d5.html" title="User:Jeffpw">Jeffpw</a> 10:48, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Non-admins can do things like close obvious speedy keep AfDs or deny obviously bad unblock requests. They should just expect to catch more flak if they make a mistake. However, <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">boldness</a> should be encouraged: <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a> a bureaucracy, and administrators are just users with a couple of extra buttons. <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> <a href="../../../k/u/s/User_talk%7EKusma_087e.html" title="User talk:Kusma">(討論)</a> 10:53, 13 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's correct, Kusma, and closing Afds by non-admins (in some cases) is defined in policy (Yuser seems confused about that, too, but that's another kettle of fish). It is <b>not</b> defined in policy that non-admins can deny unblock requests. In fact, as I pointed out above, it seems from policy that it is supposed to be done by admins. Ryulong said that <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> applied in this case, and has not yet responded to my request for clarification of how that could apply to a breach of ethics (as I see this situation). <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffpw_23d5.html" title="User:Jeffpw">Jeffpw</a> 11:31, 13 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If that's the case, then somebody should change the template that says an Administrator has reviewed the block. And I would hope the reviewing administrator was not involved in the original edits that led to the block. I do think that only admins should be "officially" reviewing unblock requests; they've got the bits because the community trusts their judgment. Nothing against Yuser31415, but the same cannot be said for the gazillion other editors around here. <a href="../../../r/i/s/User%7ERisker_ce88.html" title="User:Risker">Risker</a> 11:17, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That's an excellent point, Risker. In the template section for "unblock review", the note is actually addressed to administrators: <i>Administrators: Replace this template with one of the following: {{unblock reviewed}</i>. This seems to make it pretty clear that unblock reviews are to be carried out only by admins. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffpw_23d5.html" title="User:Jeffpw">Jeffpw</a> 11:47, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Jeffpw: Ryulong's citing IAR only because he used to do it himself when he wasn't an admin. Many people have raised it as a problem, but he always continued to do it. I believe this was brought up at a couple of his RFAs. – <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChacor_1f31.html" title="User talk:Chacor">Chacor</a> 14:36, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>For future reference, is there a general issue with non-administrators declining frivolous unblock requests or is there an objection to the way <a href="../../../y/u/s/User%7EYuser31415_e4ea.html" title="User:Yuser31415">Yuser31415</a> handled this particular request? I realise the genetic enhancements and nano-implants conferred by a successful RFA make administrators much more qualified for this kind of work, but—with the blocked user being already blocked—I don’t see a qualitative difference when answering an unblock request in the negative (assuming, of course, that this is done responsibly and after careful review of all relevant policies), until the user talk page needs protection. (Regarding the template verbiage, if it really matters, I’d just subst the template and edit it.) —<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzy_n_12cc.html" title="User:Xyzzy n">xyzzy</a><sub><a href="../../../x/y/z/User_talk%7EXyzzy_n_2d1b.html" title="User talk:Xyzzy n">n</a></sub> 15:48, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh dear, what a fuss I've caused&#160;:). Well, I personally have no objection to responsible, reasonable community members <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUse_your_best_judgement_39b3.html" title="Wikipedia:Use your best judgement">using their best judgement</a> and helping reduce the administrative backlog. <i><a href="../../../y/u/s/User_talk%7EYuser31415_0c1d.html" title="User talk:Yuser31415">Yuser31415</a></i> 19:47, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think that it's worth pointing out that the "not a big deal" phrase works both ways.

<p>I think it was definitely inappropriate for a non-admin to give another user the impression that an admin had reviewed the block. While Yuser is enthusiastic about wanting to perform many of these duties, the truth is the community has not entrusted him with that power. <font face="Georgia"><a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_9cdf.html" title="User:Kathryn NicDhàna"><span style="color:navy">~ Kathryn NicDhàna</span></a> <a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_4e24.html" title="User talk:Kathryn NicDhàna">♫</a><font color="navy">♦</font><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_0d4e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kathryn NicDhàna">♫</a></font> 20:42, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, adminship is certainly not "power", it is a responsibility. I respectfully disagree with both of you, but will attempt to refrain from reviewing unblock requests before I become an admin.

<p>I approve of non-admins reviewing unblock requests. This is a wiki. It's not like said non-admin can protect the users talk page. <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 20:46, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I can't see an issue, as above we encourage people to deal with most things which don't require the admin buttons, I can't see how this is much different. Pass RFA one day doesn't magically improve the quality (or lack of) your judgment (I assure you). As a non-admin who someday runs for adminship doing such things is "risky", unless it's a very clear cut request they are likely to get picked up on it at and RFA particularly in the case of a good contributor who may feel hard done by and needs to attach that to the RFA process. An editor with a declined request can always add another unblock template, email the mailing list and so on. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 21:12, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I consider non-admins processing unblocks to be similar to non-admins closing deletion discussions or non-bureaucrats closing RfAs, which is to say it generally shouldn't be done. There are some exceptions, for example, non-admins can generally close bad-faith AfD nominations, likewise, I wouldn't have a problem with a non-admin declining an unblock request where the reason given was "FUCK OFF" (language used for illustrative purposes, not because I approve of it). But otherwise I don't think non-admins ought to review unblock requests. <a href="../../../h/e/i/User%7EHeimstern_8a02.html" title="User:Heimstern">Heimstern Läufer</a> 06:24, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>This maybe off topic, but I don't recall any rules against <i>"non-admins closing deletion discussions or non-bureaucrats closing RfAs"</i>.

<dd>Peace, non-admins may close deletion discussions only in very narrowly defined situations, the policy of which is spelled out <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_process_57c8.html#Non-administrators_closing_discussions" title="Wikipedia:Deletion process">here</a>. That is for much the same reason as Ju66l3r states below: often they cannot take the appropriate follow through action. Also, if a non-admin reviews a block, then in theory no other admin will be reviewing, if the blocked user does not place another block request on their talk page. That just seems unfair, in my opinion, and not very transparent. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffpw_23d5.html" title="User:Jeffpw">Jeffpw</a> 07:35, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>The only issue I can see is that if an unblock review were done by a non-admin user and the decision was to unblock, then they'd have no ability to perform the necessary changes to make that happen and the same for closing an AfD that resulted in a <i>Delete</i> decision. For that reason, I don't see why it would be appropriate for the opposite decision to be reasonable just because the outcome is <i>possible</i> to complete for a non-admin. In other words, before these decisions (like unblock review or AfD closure) has been made by the user, they can not effect all of the possible outcomes. For that reason, they should leave the procedure for someone who can effect the decision once it has been made, regardless the outcome. Otherwise, the implicit result would seem to be that a non-admin user could review an unblock request and find it to be reasonable and respond as such...then make a request that an admin follow through on their decision. This would be unreasonable since if an admin is going to use their given bit, then <b>they</b> should be the one to have decided if the right course of action is to employ the mop they've been given, not someone else's. It is a trust given to <b>them</b> and not the other person. It should be an admin's choice not to unblock someone after their review of the situation in a "could have, but chose not to" and not a "chose not to, and it's okay because I couldn't have even if I wanted to". Just my two bits on the question of non-admin users acting on situations that <i>might</i> need adminship to resolve. <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 07:13, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are two reasons why non-admins shouldn't review unblock requests. 1, they're not being asked. When a user submits an unblock request, they're specifically asking an admin (presumabely). 2, a non-admin can't unblock, so why would it make sense to have them refuse the request? <a href="../../../v/x/p/User%7EVxP_9dfc.html" title="User:VxP">VxP</a> 20:54, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi,</p>
<ul>
<li>Edit summeries entered by users should confirm with their edits. If they are not, can I revert it regardless of 3RR? Examples: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Arab_scientists_and_scholars&amp;diff=106985458&amp;oldid=106845113" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Arab_scientists_and_scholars&amp;diff=106985458&amp;oldid=106845113" rel="nofollow">[46]</a> (<a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">User:Khoikhoi</a> is an Adminstrator!!! and not the first time ), or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Arab_scientists_and_scholars&amp;diff=108089901&amp;oldid=108055458" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Arab_scientists_and_scholars&amp;diff=108089901&amp;oldid=108055458" rel="nofollow">[47]</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>My comments in the talk page of <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMardavich_3f4a.html" title="User:Mardavich">User:Mardavich</a> are continuesly being removed by this user himself <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMardavich&amp;diff=107951535&amp;oldid=107829332" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMardavich&amp;diff=107951535&amp;oldid=107829332" rel="nofollow">[48]</a> and the same adminstrator above <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMardavich&amp;diff=107961693&amp;oldid=107959001" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMardavich&amp;diff=107961693&amp;oldid=107959001" rel="nofollow">[49]</a>. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMardavich_3f4a.html" title="User:Mardavich">User:Mardavich</a> has provided multiple sources to prove the persian ethnicity of <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad_al-Fazari_c161.html" title="Muhammad al-Fazari">Muhammad al-Fazari</a>, some of these sources (till now 3) didn't mention <b>anything</b> about his ethnicity <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Muhammad_al-Fazari&amp;diff=107123810&amp;oldid=106186564" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Muhammad_al-Fazari&amp;diff=107123810&amp;oldid=106186564" rel="nofollow">[50]</a>, i.e. he was <b>lying</b>. IMO, this is the most serious crime you could commit in Wikipedia, because its very difficult to know that. Notice also thatI am not the only user to accuse you him of doing this unhonorable act <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMardavich&amp;diff=101404889&amp;oldid=101395095" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMardavich&amp;diff=101404889&amp;oldid=101395095" rel="nofollow">[51]</a>, of course this users comment was also removed by him.He does that to keep his talk page "clean". Therefore, I insist that my comment stayes in his talk page so that others can see this too. Here in Wikipedia you can get blocked by the simplest things that you can imagine, and this guy goes around posting false sources in wikipedia by reputable authors, all this without even a warning? Just imagine you were you a famous author, and someone writes something very stupid and the citation is your book, although you never wrote it? How would you feel? BTW, can this author legally sue this user? <a href="../../../j/i/d/User%7EJidan_3a52.html" title="User:Jidan">Jidan</a> 17:41, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Page protected over the edit war. Please discuss on the talk page. I note that Khoikhoi did remove Al-Fazari from the list (so his edit summary was at least partially correct), but he also removed Ibn Farnas and Ibn Yunus. I'm not sure what this means, but I suppose it's simple oversight on his part. No, incorrect edit summaries do not entitle you to revert more than usual. Yes, intentionally misleading edit summaries is disruptive (and thus, blockable), but I do not see anything intentionally misleading here. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 17:52, 14 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is a simple revert with an edit summary that is precisely as misleading as the one <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Arab_scientists_and_scholars&amp;diff=106845113&amp;oldid=106596396" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Arab_scientists_and_scholars&amp;diff=106845113&amp;oldid=106596396" rel="nofollow">preceding it</a>, which claimed to add only Al-Fazari but did more. Complaining about the edit summary is <a href="../../../k/e/t/WP%7EKETTLE_583e.html" title="WP:KETTLE">WP:KETTLE</a> here. <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> <a href="../../../k/u/s/User_talk%7EKusma_087e.html" title="User talk:Kusma">(討論)</a> 17:53, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>A few days back I had complained that User:AlamSrinivas had made death threats in the hindi language on my page for which the admins rightly banned him completely. Now he is back in another avatar User:AlamSrini1 and is making threats on my talk page again, this time in english - "This blocking thing is a joke - I already found your address and it is being discussed how to destroy you... will watch u scream and enjoy, MJ!!! Can't wait to thrash you with my belt&#160;!!".</p>
<p>All this is because of my edits of the <a href="../../../i/i/p/IIPM_abdc.html" title="IIPM">IIPM</a> page which he keeps whitewashing. IIPM is an unaccredited diploma mill in India which has been involved in many controversies. Alam, and others like <a href="../../../i/i/p/User%7EIipmstudent9_c5ec.html" title="User:Iipmstudent9">User:iipmstudent9</a> (who incidentally has made legal threats to me here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:The_Indian_Institute_of_Planning_and_Management#Filing_a_police_complaint" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:The_Indian_Institute_of_Planning_and_Management#Filing_a_police_complaint" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:The_Indian_Institute_of_Planning_and_Management#Filing_a_police_complaint</a> and here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:The_Indian_Institute_of_Planning_and_Management#Bullshit.21_Cheats.21" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:The_Indian_Institute_of_Planning_and_Management#Bullshit.21_Cheats.21" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:The_Indian_Institute_of_Planning_and_Management#Bullshit.21_Cheats.21</a>)</p>
<p>These are people from IIPM intent on whitewashing the page, wanting to remove trace of any controversy, and making it seem like an advertisement for the diploma mill.</p>
<p>Apart from requesting another block on the two users, in the light of continuous physical threats to me, I would also request that you put a full-edit-lock on the page or these people will keep whitewashing the page by threatening opposing viewpoints away. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakrandjoshi_d6c1.html" title="User:Makrandjoshi">Makrandjoshi</a> 01:38, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Due to a recent string of vandalism from 216.157.200.35 (<a href="../../../2/1/6/User_talk%7E216.157.200.35.html" title="User talk:216.157.200.35">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_216.157.200.35_cc87.html" title="Special:Contributions/216.157.200.35">contribs</a>), I have placed that IP on a six-month block, using {{schoolblock}} as the block reason. After blocking this IP, I contacted an East Lansing network administrator about the incident, who replied and gave me the IP of another proxy used by East Lansing, 216.157.200.254 (<a href="../../../2/1/6/User_talk%7E216.157.200.254.html" title="User talk:216.157.200.254">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_216.157.200.254_0849.html" title="Special:Contributions/216.157.200.254">contribs</a>). The administrator said that this second IP does not have logging capabilities, so that any vandalism coming from this IP could not be traced to a student. In light of this information, I've indefinitely blocked the second IP. Just letting some people know; I'm a new administrator, and, while I think this was the right course of action, I would appreciate any opinions on it. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadow1_a579.html" title="User:Shadow1"><font color="olive">Shadow1</font></a> <a href="../../../s/h/a/User_talk%7EShadow1_f31d.html" title="User talk:Shadow1">(talk)</a> 16:42, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think that blocking the other IP was a good call, especially as you have confirmation from the school's network administrator. The IP's contributions are consistent with school vandalism coming from East Lansing, as well. I support the block, and good on you for seeking an external opinion!

<dd>Looking at the editor's username and the numerous webrats links that he/she is adding, it sure looks like external link spamming to me. The editor was warned many months ago and responded contentiously. He/she disputes the interpretation of his adding of multiple links as link spamming. In less than 2 hours, more than 10 articles have had webrats links added. I've temporarily (24 hours) blocked Webrats for spamming. I've don't have time to review and revert edits now.

<p>Ouch. Is there any chance of having the decision reversed? Some of the catagories have 1000+ entries in them and are only index by 0. 1. &amp; 2. making them kind of ugly. Having them index in Hundreds of years eg <i>0. 1. 2. 3. ... 18. 19. 20.</i> works really well, looks great and uses the standard font.</p>

<p>Other benefits include not having to manually create 10 new subcatagories for when the Main catagory gets over populated with 0. 1. &amp; 2. (Instead add a 0. ... 19. 20. index into just on main Category)</p>
<p>FAQ:</p>
<ul>
<li>Q: Why didn't I get permission from wikipedia management to do the changes? - A: Basically I have been working on this slowly for 2 months of evenings. One group Catagory at a time. The results seemed OK and there was no negative feed back during this time about the improved ordering.</li>
<li>Q: <a href="http://www.google.co.nz/search?q=Γνώθι-Σεαυτόν" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.nz/search?q=Γνώθι-Σεαυτόν" rel="nofollow">Γνώθι Σεαυτόν</a></li>
<li>Q: How did I do it? A: Key binding in emacs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally: The latest release of mediawiki has some other additional and useful features. For example the {{#switch|||}} expression that would really help reduce the overhead of breaking year categories into hundreds of years. Where should I lead a discussion on this?</p>
<p>Request: Can you guy please put my 8 weeks of efforts back in place. The changes were not doing any harm, they even had real benefits. Could I at least unrevert one Category as an example for the purposes of discussion and some kind of voting? And move forward based on the outcome of the discussion?</p>

<p>I don't see why all these changes had to be rolled back before we had a proper discussion on the matter. I first noticed the changes to category sorting of years a few weeks ago, and thought it was an interesting and innovative approach. I don't see the harm in it, and I do see some benefit. Γνώθι Σεαυτόν should have raised the idea in advance, perhaps at <a href="../../../v/p/r/WP%7EVPR_1fd1.html" title="WP:VPR">Village pump (proposals)</a>, but that is no reason to undo all the work without first getting a consensus. I support the idea of restoring these changes to one category so editors can see the result to discuss it.-<a href="../../../g/a/d/User_talk%7EGadfium_49fb.html" title="User talk:Gadfium"><font face="cursive" color="#808080">gadfium</font></a> 20:24, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I vote <b>keep</b>, i.e. <b>undo</b> the reverts. Splitting years into hundreds of years was a real asset and I'd happily reapply the improvements myself.

<li><b>Undo</b> reverts, but I ask that ISO-8859 or any other standard western character set be used instead of unicode.

<ul>
<li><b>Technical note</b>: I don't see how this could be achieved this elegantly with characters from the ISO-8859 range. After all, the whole point of Gnothi Seauton's invention was to have <i>single characters</i> that signify "19", "18", "17", etc., because when sorting on the standard Ascii number representations, index entries would exist only for "0", "1", and "2", one per millenium. And what about "the English Wikipedia"? We use Unicode all the time, the whole site is in Unicode. -- by the way, I must admit I only now understood what the whole thing was about. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 22:58, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I am not opposed to Γνώθι Σεαυτόν's intent, its an exceptionally good idea and a nifty work-around. But there are other means to achieve this goal. First, has anyone filed a bug with our developers about this? A MediaWiki fix would go much, much further than having to plug unicode into hundreds of thousands of category sortkeys. Nor am I opposed to the use of unicode provided there is broad community support for the idea - if there is, however, we should keep in mind that widespread adoption of such a standard would be glacial at best, in part because of the inherent difficulties with unicode (most of the time, I still don't "get it" and I'll be dammed to memorize which string of %!?_ equals what number or symbol). However, we should not revert the revert as yet, despite Γνώθι Σεαυτόν's extraordinary level of effort put into it - there should be community consensus for it, or a developmental fix for it. --Jeffrey O.
