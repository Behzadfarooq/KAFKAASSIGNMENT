<dd>All right, I checked out that talk page. "Sophie"'s edits are so extreme that in a way they're hard to take seriously, but they're also outrageous. Look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Bogdanov_Affair&amp;diff=21836057&amp;oldid=21835477" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Bogdanov_Affair&amp;diff=21836057&amp;oldid=21835477" rel="nofollow">this one</a>, blanking and replacing a long post of YBM's, i. e. it's written as if <b>from</b> YBM (not that it's exactly likely to deceive anybody). And, oh, look, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Bogdanov_Affair&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=21835036" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Bogdanov_Affair&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=21835036" rel="nofollow">here</a>'s a legal threat. I'm blocking 213.237.21.6 for 24 hours right now. Yes, without warning, so desysop me. Actually I hope Sophie takes a mere 24-hour block <b>as</b> a warning, because if she doesn't I see a permanent ban in my chrystal ball. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 02:00, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As YBM did (and since he won't be able to announce it himself today), I would like you to have a look on the discussion page concerned: altough you had warned her, "Sophie" goes on debiting nonsenses, slanderous words and personal attacks.--<a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMax.Epiphysique_85b6.html" title="User:Max.Epiphysique">Max.Epiphysique</a> 12:18, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks. I have looked at the page, and written a warning on <a href="../../../2/1/3/User_talk%7E213.237.21.6.html" title="User talk:213.237.21.6">User talk:213.237.21.6</a>. I will re-block if there's more yelling and so on, but right now the IP hasn't edited for many hours. If anybody notices "Sophie" coming in from a different IP and editing abusively, please let me know, or, in case you're an admin, please just block her. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 14:31, 27 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I'll follow the advice you've sent to me, with the likely support of the sane contributor of the discussion page. Meanwhile, "Sophie" is vandalizing again the page. As predicted she is now accussing me to have "INFILTERED WIKI WEBSITE AND DELEETED MY BLOG AND BANISHED ME FROM IT ILLEGALLY BY STEALING THE IDENTITY OF AN ADMINISTRATOR" (sigh) --<a href="../../../8/1/2E/User%7E81.64.153.216.html" title="User:81.64.153.216">81.64.153.216</a> 02:58, 28 August 2005 (UTC) [this is <a href="../../../y/b/m/User%7EYBM_e89b.html" title="User:YBM">YBM</a>].</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Update: Most of Sophie's anger has been transferred to me for the moment. She's very upset—she was that even before being blocked—and I do believe her interaction style is making it impossible for editors of the article to use the talk page constructively. They seem to have left.&#160;:-( Here's a passage from one of Sophie's long posts to me:</dd>
<dd><i>"If you were following what he had done from afar, and didn't blocked me after he had contacted you, but from your own judgement, so it proves that you have friendship with YBM, or you will have warned him or blocked him immediatly and even the days before.</i></dd>
<dd><i>What you are confessing here is that you knew what he was doing you knew it was forbidden and you let him do it and continue to do it day after day, and awaited together WITH him that I became angry enough to do or say something that you could use against me to block me, as you had arranged it with YBM."</i></dd>
<dd>Of course she was angry at having been blocked, nobody's forced to like the admin who does that to them, and she's struggling with a foreign language. Still, it's a little ludicrous. I intend to block her for a week, after several warnings, and will offer to unblock early if she shows any willingness to compromise. (I realize it's a dynamic IP, but it doesn't seem very nimble.) I just don't want her owning that talk page. <a href="../../../b/o/g/Bogdanov_Affair_7b8e.html" title="Bogdanov Affair">Bogdanov Affair</a> has been protected for quite some time, and discussion on the talk page needs to get a chance. (She has never edited any other page.) <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 01:12, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sophie contacted me by email, apparently claiming that she was blocked from all wikis (I do not know how that can be true, but she also seems very unfamiliar with Wikipedia). From what I have gathered so far, her behaviour has indeed been quite unacceptable. I will try to explain the exact reasons to her, because at the moment she is just infuriated by what she considers an injustice. For the record, it should be noted that YBM's first messages to her on <a href="../../../b/o/g/Talk%7EBogdanov_Affair_a499.html" title="Talk:Bogdanov Affair">Talk:Bogdanov Affair</a> have been "<i>Please, Sophie go play your silly and lying game in the kindergarten, and learn how to indent</i>", "<i>Given the obvious mental illness of "Sophie SMJP", it is probably useless to insist on the fact every single word of this bunch of words is a lie, and Sophie a crank.</i>" and "<i>in your ill mind you confuse every people who ever laughed at you - quite a few&#160;!</i>".</p>
<p>YBM carefully forgot to mention his own personal attacks, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABogdanov_Affair&amp;diff=21721006&amp;oldid=21716005" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABogdanov_Affair&amp;diff=21721006&amp;oldid=21716005" rel="nofollow">this one</a>, or edits comments containing "<i>reverting psychotic garbage</i>" or "<i>→garbage - special subsection for Sophie, noone care, noone read the psycho</i>", or his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABogdanov_Affair&amp;diff=21805712&amp;oldid=21804892" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABogdanov_Affair&amp;diff=21805712&amp;oldid=21804892" rel="nofollow">complete removal of all of Sophie’s contributions</a> under the quite ironic comment of "<i>removing personal attacks in compliance with Wikipedia policy</i>" (note that when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABogdanov_Affair&amp;diff=21780138&amp;oldid=21778919" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABogdanov_Affair&amp;diff=21780138&amp;oldid=21778919" rel="nofollow">Sophie did the same</a> he <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Bogdanov_Affair&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=21780138" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Bogdanov_Affair&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=21780138" rel="nofollow">reverted, calling it vandalism</a>). Though it does not excuse anything of her behaviour, I am not surprised Sophie lost her temper, being pushed like that. Maybe YBM (who is well known for his Usenet flamebaits) deserves a friendly warning, too. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Hocevar_dccf.html" title="User:Sam Hocevar">Sam Hocevar</a> 20:47, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It certainly sounds like it, maybe you could issue it, Sam, since you've read further back in the talk page history than I have? I would love to see interventions from other experienced users on that talk page altogether, because the contributors are pretty much all new. They seem to be here to edit and discuss that page exclusively, and they're anything but seasoned Wikipedians (though <a href="../../../r/b/j/User%7ERbj_42ae.html" title="User:Rbj">User:rbj</a> is a notable exception). Sophie's not the only one having trouble with how things work, with NPOV, the protection policy, and such. Incidentally, if you notice Sophie complaining about my wiki e-mail function (sometimes that it's not turned on, sometimes that I lyingly pretend not to have received her messages), I don't know what the problem is there—I suppose there could be a technical glitch. I've never received an e-mail from Sophie. My wikimail has been activated the entire time, and other messages are getting through fine. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 22:14, 5 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I warned them, and since I do not have a personal stance on the Bogdanov affair I told both that I would be glad to act as a mediator, if necessary. I’ll be watching the page and both users. I also suggested Sophie to register an account, since that’s probably the reason why her email to you was not sent. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Hocevar_dccf.html" title="User:Sam Hocevar">Sam Hocevar</a> 01:36, 6 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Oh, right. It still seems anomalous, though, as e-mails from her have reached several other admins (you, for instance). Maybe she does use an account some of the time, or maybe the wiki e-mail function's just buggy. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 15:37, 6 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I still cannot know for sure, because her email was sent directly, not through the Wikipedia site. I believe she complained to an admin on the French Wikipedia for what happened here, and he gave her my address. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Hocevar_dccf.html" title="User:Sam Hocevar">Sam Hocevar</a> 09:15, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

As for deleting the edit wars page, I agree it's not a good page to keep around, but the community, stupid as it is (not a personal attack, collective attacks are allowed, right?), has decided to keep it, so there's not much we're going to be able to do about that for the time being. --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 02:38, September 1, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

It's notification of the remarkably petty behavior of someone who, entrusted to be an admin, should know better, and I think little peer pressure is more appropriate than whacking him on the head with a blunt instrument like RfC.

Incidentally, what part of "peer pressure" was unclear? Since his peers are administrators, notice of an administrator incident should be placed where administrators might notice it and apply peer pressure, which incidentally seems perfectly in line with page entitled "Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents".

<dd>Jtdirl has long had the habit of reacting quite aggressively to any edit he disagrees with. I have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jtdirl&amp;diff=13634197&amp;oldid=13633990" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jtdirl&amp;diff=13634197&amp;oldid=13633990" rel="nofollow">cautioned him</a> about this in the past, but he does not seem to have heeded this advice. For those above who are wondering how he became a sysop, it is because he was promoted before the current system was in place. Originally requests for adminship were simply posted to the mailing list, and it was quite rare for someone to be rejected. There was a fair bit of debate over his nomination, which can be read in the <a href="http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2003-May/date.html#3272" class="external text" title="http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2003-May/date.html#3272" rel="nofollow">May 2003</a> Wikien-L archives. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 03:44, September 1, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No. Fvw deleted an entry I wrote in which I mentioned how I had had to lock my talkpage, yet again, to protect it from a stalker. While you lot are babbling to yourselves I'm having hazzle from a Wikistalker who has been vandalising my userpage, posting personal allegations on Wikipedia pages about me, vandalising articles which, when I defend from attack <b>I</b> get garbage written about me on the lame edit war page. The same asshole has driven one user off Wikipedia, abused another on his webpage, used 24 sockpuppets and is banned, yet you lot make a song and dance when his vandalism is, as required by policy, removed from pages. That same son-of-a-bitch, while posting allegations about me on and off Wikipedia, has now begun writing letters to Irish newspapers. If he has no problem signing his name to things, fine. Since he is so open, people can find out on my page, in a cut and paste from a letter of his already linked on Wikipedia by another user, who precisely the stalker really is. And I really don't give a damn whether you are offended or not — you try put up with a stalker on Wikipedia for months, and see how much you like it. You try getting the ArbCom to actually do something about him. (It took Jimbo to intervene in the end to get him banned.) I've had to lock my talk page (again) to stop the supposedly banned user from editing it. At this stage keep going with all your childish babbling here. Its not your pages that are being vandalised, not you that is having lies spread about and not you that is being stalked. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><font color="#006666"><b>Fear</b><font color="#FF6600"><i><b>ÉIREANN</b></i></font></font></a><a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:Ireland coa.png">Image:Ireland coa.png</a>\<sup><font color="blue"><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl">(caint)</a> 03:35, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</font></sup></p>

<dd>Does it? Does it really? I can't imagine the deliberative processes that would lead anyone to think that. Skyring, who was banned by Jimbo (to the universal relief of everyone who had ever encountered him), has stalked Jtdirl for <i>months</i>. He's not making that up–I blocked at least one Skyring sock myself and have often reverted his vandalism. What Skyring has done to Jtdirl is quite likely a prosecutable crime in many countries. If Skyring is really writing to newspapers (and I've no reason to doubt Jtdirl on this one), then what we are witnessing here is an incredibly serious situation in which one (former) Wikipedian is attempting to ruin another in the real world. This isn't some game, or some silly revert war. I'm troubled that Jtdirl is so agitated, yes–but I'm far more troubled by the sequence of events which led to this and the churlishness of those Wikipedians who seem regard the whole affair a trifle. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 20:08, 1 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It seems to me that Skyring was himself driven to extreme (and not necessarily justifiable) lengths by his treatment here: all his edits were reverted by Jtdirl, even when they were of uncontroversial quality, and he was eventually banned for an entire year, no matter how reasonable he tried to be, a penalty we normally reserve for the worst of editors. As I see it you have a case here where both parties involved went way overboard about the whole situation. It seems wrong to pin all the blame on just one side. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 23:26, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's three different Skyring sockpuppets. I'll now clarify matters so that he'll hopefully leave well enough alone. Skyring is banned on Jimbo's orders. By policy and convention, anything that Skyring adds to Wikipedia must be reverted on sight. This is a long-standing principle. Every time Skyring comes on Wikipedia and mucks around with articles on Australian government, insults Jtdirl, or makes a fuss on a policy page, he's vandalizing Wikipedia. It was made explicitly clear by the community–through individual users, the Arbitration Committee, and eventually Jimbo himself–that Skyring is not welcome until/unless he gets his act together. If Skyring wants specific examples, I'll note that I've blocked three of his sockpuppets in the last two or so hours alone. In response to Everyking, Skyring and Jtdirl were both reprimanded by the Arbcom, but in accordance with their misdeeds. Skyring capped incivility and stalking with POV-pushing and factual inaccurracy–things most of us frown on. Talk page archives show that people were patient with Skyring until it became apparent that he was unwilling to work with the community. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 23:46, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Posting other people's home addresses or other RL contact information on Wikipedia without their permission should simply be a banning offense, no questions asked. Anyone who does it, thereby throws away their access forever -- simple as that. Doesn't matter if they're an admin, a developer, or the Flying Spaghetti Monster himself: using the wiki to harass or threaten others in this way <b>for any purpose</b> needs to directly and <i>necessarily</i> lead to a ban.</p>
<p>Can anyone suggest any reason this <i>shouldn't</i> be done? Any reason that a person who uses the wiki to threaten other people IRL should be permitted to continue editing?

I agree that it should attract an instant, indefinite ban. The only thing I'd say here in Jtdirls' defense is that being trolled by Skyring must be a formidably depressing experience, and I agree with Ann that it's a shame more couldn't have been done to support him. I feel bad myself about it, because I didn't do anything, except post the occasional comment here. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 21:01, September 1, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

If you had <i>bothered</i> to look at the edit history of my page you'd see that it was nothing to do with you but to do with two sockpuppets of a user banned for a year of Wikistalking me, but who has still been able to run 23 sockpuppets here in the last month.

<dd>For what it's worth, the two editors that (first?) warned Jtdirl were were <a href="../../../n/u/d/User%7ENudgeNudge_dfc5.html" title="User:NudgeNudge">NudgeNudge</a> (<a href="../../../n/u/d/User_talk%7ENudgeNudge_1d03.html" title="User talk:NudgeNudge">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_NudgeNudge_39c1.html" title="Special:Contributions/NudgeNudge">contribs</a>) and <a href="../../../s/a/y/User%7ESayNoMore_330e.html" title="User:SayNoMore">SayNoMore</a> (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SayNoMore_b812.html" title="Special:Contributions/SayNoMore">contribs</a>). Both are accounts created today, with six edits and <i>one</i> edit (the note to Jtdirl) respectively. I wouldn't be surprised if they were Skyring socks (a sock check from David Gerard might be of use) but they could also be random troublemakers.</dd>
<dd>That said, receiving a few 'helpful' remarks from anon IPs or new accounts doesn't strike me as warranting a page protection for vandalism. It's a talk page, not an article, and the socks or vandals will get bored and go away. It's also a bit troubling that Jtdirl removed legitimate criticism and comments from a number of editors in good standing (Khaosworks, Fvw, Calton) at the same time as he removed the socks' comments and protected the page.</dd>
<dd>Protecting his own talk page after posting the real name and address of another editor–even a banned one–also is just not on. Repeatedly <i>re</i>posting that information after it has been removed is, as Dmcdevit notes above, beyond the pale.

<dd>Skyring has now stooped to contacting individual users by private e-mail (through the "e-mail this user" link) giving them "proof" of Jtdirl's real identity. (Or to be more precise, he did it with me this morning; I wouldn't be surprised if he has done it with others, but I don't actually know.) I can't comment on what happened in the last ten hours — I was asleep when much of this was going on — but I think it's a pity that Wikipedia wasn't able to give more support to a victim of stalking and harrassment before this whole thing blew up. I am not defending Jtdirl, just pointing out that when people are subjected to what he was subjected to, the likelihood increases that they'll do things they shouldn't do.

<dd>The link seems to have been deleted, so I have no idea what it's about or what idiocy Skyring was trying to rope me into, but given his plentiful supply of sockpuppets, wonder why he was trying to talk people into doing his dirty work. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 12:29, September 1, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Nothing to worry. I checked: Mark deleted some parts of earlier revisions to erase any mention of Skyring's putative address from archives. Quite natural (and justified) that the Skyring did not like its publication, and now Mark, an uninvolved admin, has taken care of that. Btw, in my opinion, Jtdirl's reactions towards alleged stalking etc are itself harmful - Jtdirl could live much better if he just ignored such. Guess Skyring and Jtdrl deserve each other. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrigo_7e77.html" title="User:Arrigo">Arrigo</a> 14:53, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not sure that's quite fair, Arrigo. It's disorienting to have a troll after you, and what they do is try to spot your weakness and home in on it. Jtdrl's response to the harassment was all too human. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 21:22, September 1, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Meh, but it's to be expected. Arrigo's been harrassing Deb for weeks. He also had the uncommon courtesey to drop an unfriendly note on Jtdirl's talk page. Whether Skyring liked the publication or not is irrelevant, of course–he was banned for a reason. "Alleged stalking" is a rather monstrous way of putting it–only someone utterly unfamiliar with the case or a pathological liar could see it that way. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 21:27, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I removed the offending material from the page history using a partial undelete. I don't want anyone to interpret my actions there as support for either party in this dispute.

<p>I still don't get why it's such a big deal who jtdirl actually is. He's entitled to a certain amount of anonymitity here on Wikipedia. That's why we have usernames, not actual names. I don't care if he is James Duffy, George Bush, or Pope Pius XII.

<p>A couple days ago, this user popped up on my watchlist when he moved <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_system.html" title="Solar system">Solar system</a> to <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_System_ac3e.html" title="Solar System">Solar System</a> (despite a recently failed move request, with which he was uninvolved). He'd also capitalized all the headings. I reverted and left him a message on his talk page. I popped by today to see if he had responded or what he'd been up to and found a whole bunch of page moves without any prior discussion. A number of them were to move articles to traditional capitalization style, not Wikipedia style and other departures from convention (like moving <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vacuum_cleaner.html" title="Vacuum cleaner">Vacuum cleaner</a> to <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vacuum_Cleaners_25c7.html" title="Vacuum Cleaners">Vacuum Cleaners</a>. Most, if not all, look to be inappropriate moves, but I lack the expertise to judge a few, and I hesitate to blindly undo all his moves without concurrence from others. And unfortunately I have to get to bed because I have to be at the hospital in a few hours; if anyone has time could you take a look and move some of these back?

<dd>The problem with year-long bans is they give a person no incentive to respect the ban. It's too far off; nobody cares about whether they'll be able to edit again next September or not. Now, if you give a person a week or a month, then they can see the light at the end of the tunnel and just sit quietly and wait. But with a year you're going to feel like you've got nothing to lose, so you might as well make it an all-out war. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 04:00, 3 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ugh, I was about to go to bed. Quick synopsis up to this point. I was in the process of reverting lots of external links to OmniNerd when Uriah showed up on my watchlist reverting back. So I blocked. It should have been a short shock block to get him to discuss, not revert back, but in frustration I did 48 hours. Taxman unblocked him only minutes later, and I have apologized for that aspect. There is now extensive discusion at that user's talk page, and mine, and <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkMcB_984b.html" title="User talk:MarkMcB">User talk:MarkMcB</a> and <a href="../../../m/u/h/Talk%7EMuhammad_736f.html" title="Talk:Muhammad">Talk:Muhammad</a> and <a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">User talk:Taxman</a> (a little). Anyway, the disputed action has stopped for now, and we're trying to discuss (I hope). I would appreciate if anyone could chime in and/or keep an eye on this. I had a feeling that MarkMcB and I were making progress in our discussion, but I've really got to go to bed now.

It seems like we are making progress, but I would prefer some more to weigh in. Thanks, <a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> for doing that. But just for the record, the block on Uriah was the correct thing to do, it's just possible Dmcdevit shouldn't have been the one to do it. Looking back though the "currently engaged in multiple disputes" characterization was pretty generous considering the only dispute was Dmcdevit reverting links that seem to be spam. Anyway, the block and unblocking seems successful, as progress is occuring. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 15:12, September 2, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>And, by the way, we <i>really</i> need a better pagemove throttle. I propose that no user without account flags be able to move more than 1 article per <i>second</i>. --<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesarB_5f7f.html" title="User:CesarB">cesarb</a> 23:24, 3 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Mass-renaming pages (for instance, from (movie) to (film)). But then, that can be done by a bot (with a flag...) or an admin (which of course has an account flag). I believe 1 per second would slow down a lot of the vandalism while having a low enough chance of false positives (even more if the only result of a false positive is a "slow down, cowboy!" message and having to retry). --<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesarB_5f7f.html" title="User:CesarB">cesarb</a> 23:42, 3 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Hi Theresa, I can't really complain, I blocked <a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho_d957.html" title="User:Who">User:Who</a> some time ago for the same reason (I didn't look closely and mistook his undoing of Willy vandalism for the vandalism itself).</p>
<p>For what it's worth, my autoblock bot was the first to block Barneybumble... I really think it's a practical necessity despite some folks' misgivings. Until we get pagemove throttle or some other permanent solution. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 23:37, 3 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Something very interesting here. Check out this timeline.</p>
<p>Barneybumble commits petty vandalism on August 11 and gets blocked. Weeks later he gets unblocked by Golbez, and just a few short hours later the unblock is detected by a test edit and a pagemove vandalism spree is launched immediately. For sure Willy's using a bot (as if the 75 pagemoves/minute weren't enough of a giveaway).</p>

<dd>well, this page is not exactly hidden. Naturally WoW is watching the cries of desparation uttered here, with glee.

You might think that because this user contribs show him or her almost never editting pages, that this must be leaving a lot of double redirects and other problems behind, but you'd be wrong. Checking several of the pages showed that after the move an anon showed up to fix links (several different IPs were used). So, it appears that someone created an account just to do a series of more or less helpful page moves while otherwise editting anonymously.</p>
<p>Aside from getting this person to be wary of breaking naming conventions and/or stepping on the toes of WP:RM, there is not really a problem here. However, in the Willy climate of page move wariness, I thought it important to call attention to this account since it seems to exist almost exclusively to move pages, and probably bears some watching. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 09:16, September 4, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>It was brought to my attention sone time back that you have a Wikipedia page for me. Thank you very much and it is quite accurate, I would say. Someone has done a fair bit of research. However, over the past week someone has deliberately placed a sentence saying that "some say he has Nazi sympathies". Despite removing this, and despite a note being added to the discussion page, the poster has continued to reinsert it.</p>
<p>I regard this as positively libellous and disgraceful. I have never had any Nazi sympathies nor have I ever been associated with anyone or any group which had. Your pages are supposed to represent fact rather that weirdo opinion.</p>
<p>The thing is, if I posted on someone's Wikipedia entry "that some suspect him of being a paedophile" how would this go down? What is the substantial difference. A deliberate smear is just that - a smear, designed to get people thinking in that direction.</p>
<p>I would appreciate it if you could block the person doing this.</p>
<p>I am not entirely IT literate and your endless pages of instructions simply confuse me utterly.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<dd>In cases like this I believe it's best to not give the vandal "a name" by all of us using the same block comment (i.e. "Mandy Moore vandal"). When he sees the same block-comment from many different admins I think it only helps to encourage him to continue and become a wikipedia celebrety. "I am the famous Mandy More vandal!!!111!". I've used the slightly degrading "Mandy More obsessed kid" myself, but whatever helps him realize that what he's doing is simply just stupid and childish and not cool at all. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShanes_8450.html" title="User:Shanes">Shanes</a> 08:07, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree with the point on vandal-naming. Many of the lessons on dealing with trolls also apply here: some of these vandals crave attention, and the usual recommendation is to not give them the satisfaction of seeing their exploits highlighted in any way. Especially vandals who switch IPs/accounts frequently should be blocked only after a considerable delay (unless, of course, they start to actively vandalize), and with a neutral, generic block summary. Immediate blocking only serves to encourage them to continue playing hide-and-seek/whack-a-mole. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a><big><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkSweep_9d72.html" title="User talk:MarkSweep">✍</a></big> 08:20, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>&lt;shaking head&gt; So we should allow obsessive vandals like this to have their heads and attack as many articles as they feel like doing? For how long? Half an hour? An hour? All day? <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a> 08:29, September 6, 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The problem is that the IP blocking doesn't seem to be effective at all, and could very well cause collateral damage, especially when you block for extreme lengths of time. But if it actually worked I certainly wouldn't object to it. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 09:05, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>No, that's not what I meant. Obviously, if someone is actively vandalizing they can and should be blocked. What I was trying to say is, if someone is merely creating sleeper accounts (like you-know-who) without (yet) actively vandalizing, then there is no urgent need to block them right away. That will only encourage them to create more accounts. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a><big><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkSweep_9d72.html" title="User talk:MarkSweep">✍</a></big> 09:12, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Space Cadet unintentionally violated the rule just as I've done, Witkacy, which I pointed out on the 3RR of Space Cadet too. A double-standard-beset Witkacy had asked to block me just as Chris later asked to block the self-proclaimed "lawyer" of yours, Space Cadet. Why didn't you mention it? Why do you never tell the whole truth? That constant not-telling-the-whole-truth <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AGeorg_Forster&amp;diff=22403874&amp;oldid=22402445" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AGeorg_Forster&amp;diff=22403874&amp;oldid=22402445" rel="nofollow">even made Shauri angry</a> although she is a reasonable editor and not known for quickly getting angry or angry at all.

It's like Shauri advised you: you're like a football fan whose team has lost and crying about it doesn't help anything. At grammar school a book for the subject German had to be chosen - 9 votes for 'Faust', 8 for an easier book called something like 'Steinkreise'. Guess what book was chosen? Those who voted for 'Steinkreise' complained but they gave in seconds of a few minutes later because they were not unreasonable and pig-headed. You?

Repeated attempts to reignite the Gdanzig naming conflict and spread it to other articles are to be discouraged. I'd appreciate a third opinion on this, however, as Witkacy seems to believe I am some sort of puppet of Chris 73.</dd>

<p>In my opinion, Andy Mabbett has repeatedly harrassed other users, of which this is just the latest example. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Boulevard_f817.html" title="User:Nick Boulevard">User:Nick Boulevard</a> is another of his targets. Andy treats other editors in a way that appears to upset him when he receives similar treatment and he seems unable to see the parallels. He has a tendency to make unexplained reversions, repeated reversions at a rate of just 3 per day, terse responses to requests for explanation, snide or derisive talk page comments and edit summaries. Two editors have privately confided that they do not wish to participate in an RFC about him because they are frightened of his response. Nick Boulevard has hinted on several talk pages that he suspects Andy of harrassing him anonymously outside Wikipedia (although I may have misinterpreted these comments) and one of the two private correspondents has indicated that they fear something similar happening to them if Andy sees them participate in an RFC. On this specific issue, Leonig Mig has explained his distress to Andy about Andy's behaviour. He has asked Andy to stop specific behaviours. He has inflicted the offensive behaviours on Andy to make his points. He has asked Andy to remove the hurtful insinuations that Andy has kept on his user page. Andy was unsympathetic to any of these approaches. Leonig Mig then started the futile process of removing the distressing text from Andy's user page (when he knew Andy to be a serial reverter). I have twice asked for other admins to support me in my dealings with Andy. There has been no visible response to either request. I conclude that I am being oversensitive to his behaviour and it is one of the reasons that I have reduced my wikiactivity over the past fortnight. I know that Andy has been harrassed unfairly on usenet over matters unrelated to Wikipedia but I see this as no excuse for his behaviour here. —<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoClarke_a891.html" title="User:TheoClarke">Theo</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheoClarke_5767.html" title="User talk:TheoClarke">(Talk)</a> 00:23, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Wikipedia:Current charitable causes has been placed up for VFD. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> has removed the VFD notice from the page because the page is linked from the site notice. I can sympathize with his desire to keep such notices off a page linked from every page in Wikipedia, however the admin who added the VFD was well aware of the implications. Furthermore, Raul had two possible ways to achieve his goal. He could have removed the sitenotice, or he could have removed the VFD notice. Considering that the VFD is currently 2:1 (i.e. 75%) in favor of delete, Raul made the wrong decision. The site notice has been both supported and opposed by Wikimedia board members, so the only guidance available is from the community. It is clear that a substantial portion (and likely a substantial majority) of the community opposes this notice. Please re-add the VFD tag in conformance with our VFD policy. --<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 01:49, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd oppose anything like that—you need to take it to the ArbCom if he's such a problem. "Banned by the community" is too fuzzy unless we can have a poll on it. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 12:35, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You can't be serious. What possible contributions could he make to Wikipedia at this point? Now, instead of having to assume good faith, we have confirmed bad faith. That's fine if the ArbCom would <i>also</i> like to ban him, but this is not a user that belongs on Wikipedia. The community as a whole should make that crystal clear. Instead of having a poll, I'd like to hear from anyone who thinks that Zephram should continue to edit on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 13:03, 8 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with everything that it said above. But let me just discuss punishment. He has not vandalized other pages or other Users, unlike others who normally hold his views. So for his terrible comment on his talk page, the 48 hour ban seems appropriate. For the terrorism edits, I think a ban on that page is appropriate as he has never made a productive edit as far as I can see. But it seems that he ought to be given the opportunity to attempt to make productive edits on some other article (granted, he might not be able to or interested, but we should not just assume). --<a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoitall_1dc1.html" title="User:Noitall">Noitall</a> 13:14, September 8, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The "fucking Jews" comments is worse than just the insult. It reveals what motivates Zephram's edits, at least pages such as Terrorism. Editing Wikipedia is not a right and we don't have to accept editors that are blatantly antisemitic. We also need to judge whether other editors will be driven away (from certain articles or off Wikipedia entirely) should Zephram remain. In my opinion, the answer is a resounding <b>yes</b>. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 13:25, 8 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Zephram Stark seems to be trolling. He has made no useful contributions that I'm aware of. His only edits to <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">Terrorism</a> were to introduce original research, namely his own (incredibly silly) views on how terrorism ought to be defined, which were opposed by every editor on the page, now protected because of him. He has engaged in a revert war using sockpuppet accounts and open proxies, then claimed consensus for his edits because, as he put it, he was being supported by readers all over the planet. He now spends his time on the talk page trying to start polls to decide various issues, but if anyone takes him seriously, he changes the subject to e.g. the difference between science and religion, followed by outraged protestations of innocence if anyone calls him disruptive. It's very similar to what the feces troll did (e.g. User:Eyeon) for anyone familiar with that one. An indefinite block would be a mercy. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 23:51, September 8, 2005 (UTC)

<p>I am not sure what this person’s problem is, but they keep editing your Saint <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philomena.html" title="Philomena">Philomena</a> page. This user seems to have the unfortunate notion that Saint Philomena has been removed as a Saint.</p>
<p>This is not possible. Once the Catholic Church Canonizes a Saint, they are always a Canonized Saint. No one has the power to remove them. She was removed from the Liturgical Calendar in 1961, and yes, there is a petition drive to request she be added back on, now in the hands of the Vatican, but this user’s notion that some are trying to revive her is erroneous.</p>

<p>I am not able to respond to that, because this user has not provided an email address, i dont know what he wants from me, i can only assume that he is opposed to the page of the flying spaghetti monster, for which i voted on the related site. I thought wikipedia is a place of free speech, and now i am thrown out just because i told you my opinion?!?!</p>
<p>I'm outrageous, that cant be! I can only assume that this Radiant is abusing his permissions, or is just trigger happy. In either way, I would like my account back!!!!!!!</p>
<p>Ok, i looked up sockpuppet. What do you want from me?! i have an account on the german wikipedia under the same name, but that can hardly be a sockpuppet situation, so please release my account and lecture this Radiant person to be a bit more thorough with his research before he blocks a user.</p>

<dd>The only edits that account has made lately is removing the notice. Seems to me a block is only necessary if he tries to edit articles or user talk pages or so forth again. Odds are good that he knows he wouldn;t get away with it on that IP without erasing those comments identifying him, and if he did try, investigation back to those notices would get him banned. As a practical solution for right now I'd think just it's fine as is and it'd be esay enough to take care of it once a substantial edit somewhere happens. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 18:05, September 9, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

No attempt at discussion was seen, and those were the only type of edits he made before being blocked again.

<dd>Ignore it. This user, who is probably Willy, seems to feed off the discussion of his actions. The more we talk about it, the more he vandalizes. He has also made similar threats in the past, none of which have materialized. Love Virus has quite clearly demonstrated that he does not have the wherewithal to run a bot. It is, however, almost exactly a week since Curps block bot and other measures went into effect, so I wouldn't be surprised if Willy is spending the next hour industriously loading as many Firefox windows as possible to do some page moving or other vandalism. While this is aggravating, he is putting far more effort into his attacks than it takes us to revert them, so it doesn't represent much of a threat. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 23:24, September 9, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>You don't honestly believe that, do you? Not only is it simpler for him to do it than for us to revert it (It doesn't take an hour - He merely needs middle-click "random page" 50 times), but it's quicker. We are expending far, far more effort into fixing what he does than he puts into doing it. --<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolbez_ce9f.html" title="User:Golbez">Golbez</a> 23:34, September 9, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Try it. With Wikipedia operating at its usual speed it takes at least five minutes to set up group of thirty pages to be moved. To set up 600 it would take at least an hour. With the new tools these attacks are being fairly quickly reverted. It took three minutes for all of BBB's 17 moves to reverted, 6 minutes for VB.NET's 27 edits, and about 15 for 99 Willys's 127 moves. If we add in the time and effort he spends creating accounts and waiting for them to mature, his vandalism almost certainly takes more time to do than revert. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 00:12, September 10, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I'd be worried that adding the "has been blocked" template to a user's page might sometimes actually delay their being blocked, at least if nobody catches your edit summary on RCp, since an admin going rapidly over the newuser log or somesuch might just glance at their userpage, see the message saying they've been blocked, and assume that someone else already handled it. <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 01:11, 11 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>we need to think about our approach here. What is the point of blocking random accounts if the vandal just creates another one? We need the option to temp-ban the IP <i>behind</i> the account, without clogging up the blocklist with hundreds of single-edit accounts. I take it that Willy is using open proxies, otherwise he could not be back as quickly with new accounts (his IP would be banned). Admins need</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>either, access to IPs, so we can rangeblock Willy's ISP, even when he's only editing logged in</li>
<li>or, ar least, the ability to block the IP behind an account, and if possible, the ability to check if that IP is an open proxy, <i>or</i> if the IP is a major ISP, so we can decide on the length of the block.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm serious. Enough with this "IPs are privacy" nonsense. Not knowing vandal IPs seriously impedes our ability to fight logged-in vandals. Admins need to see IPs of vandals, or let the developers look after Willy. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 17:52, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The <i>edit summaries</i> were vicious, obscene personal insults to a good Wikipedia contributor. This was the kind of thing obviously intended to drive someone out of a community. Before they were stopped, each of these IPs did multiple vandalisms: various articles, equally nasty edit summaries.</p>
<p>This is one of the few times I think it would be worth someone going in and removing edit summaries. After all, if we don't do that, these will be visible to anyone looking through the histories of these articles. And we will be suggesting that there is a way to permanently attach obscene, personal attacks to articles of wide interest. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 05:47, September 11, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not sure if this is the right place for this problem, or if I'm going to have to go through the Wikipedia Dispute procedures instead. I and other editors are having some problems with <a href="../../../i/m/d/User%7EImdaking_1811.html" title="User:Imdaking">User:Imdaking</a>. See, for example, this post to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3APaul_Klenk&amp;diff=23020489&amp;oldid=23004442" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3APaul_Klenk&amp;diff=23020489&amp;oldid=23004442" rel="nofollow">User talk:Paul Klenk</a>.</p>
<p>Since he first started editing on the Wikipedia, Imdaking has been uploading images, first claiming {{<a href="../../../s/c/r/Template%7EScreenshot_14ab.html" title="Template:Screenshot">screenshot</a>}}, and then {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairuse_cee7.html" title="Template:Fairuse">fairuse</a>}}, when almost all of them do not fit the criteria for <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">fair use</a>. Because of that, I've been reporting some of them at <a href="../../../c/p/_/WP%7ECP_e7b9.html" title="WP:CP">Copyright problems</a> and leaving a note on his talk page. At first he was just deleting my notices on his talk page. Now he want anyone with a complaint about his editing behavior to hide the message on his special complaint subpage. (see <a href="../../../i/m/d/User_talk%7EImdaking_Complaints_b6a7.html" title="User talk:Imdaking/Complaints">User talk:Imdaking/Complaints</a>).</p>
<p>Even then, he just ignored my messages and continued his copyright violations. One of them, for example, was an unwikified and un-cleaned-up Google translation of a Mexican website. Recently he left this message on my talk page (see <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankVerse_add2.html#WackVerse" title="User talk:BlankVerse">User talk:BlankVerse#WackVerse</a>) which included a threat to vandalize my user pages, plus he started modifying my notices on his special complaint page. I tried reverting his modification of my messages AND his modification of my signature (!!), but it's clear that he will continue to do it, even to the point of violating <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>, (which he did the other day with four reverts).</p>
<p>I consider the crossing out of my signatures the same as "capping" a graffiti tag. At a minimum, that is a severe insult, and could even be considered a challenge or a threat. Although it rarely goes to violence, still there have been taggers killed over crossing out tags, and so I consider it an oblique threat. I've politely asked him not to do it, but he has made it very clear that he will continue to revert it ("don't bother, it will only be reverted again." see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Imdaking/Complaints&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Imdaking/Complaints&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">User talk:Imdaking/Complaints - page history</a>).</p>
<p>There is a rule about not modifying another editor's comments on talk pages, but there is not a specific rule about modifying another user's signature, I still consider it a serious breach of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiquette_3717.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikiquette">Wiki-eitiquette</a>. If you don't know what "wack" means, look up <a href="../../../w/a/c/Wack_MC_ee34.html" title="Wack MC">Wack MC</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, there are more insults and cursing (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AImdaking%2FComplaints&amp;diff=22930003&amp;oldid=22929221" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AImdaking%2FComplaints&amp;diff=22930003&amp;oldid=22929221" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>): "shut da fuc up.::Imdaking::", "you too, youre retarded! .::Imdaking::".

<p>I actually wouldn't do all those steps in this case, Flcelloguy; that's how good editors get worn out. I haven't had anything to do with Imdaking myself, but I'm reading his contributions now, and I'm thinking more along the lines of straight to an RFAr. Although he's only been around a few weeks (or, well, a couple of months, if you count <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonald20_630c.html" title="User:Ronald20">User:Ronald20</a>, see below), he has already been warned many times, and many people have tried to help him learn to edit more constructively: the only result is that they get into his bad books, and are henceforth subject to his taunts on their pages. As far as I've read yet, Imdaking's contributions are of three kinds:</p>
<ol>
<li>Uploading of copyright images.</li>
<li>Creation of articles by pasting copyright text.</li>
<li>Harrassment and personal attacks on userpages.</li>
</ol>
<p>Maybe I'll come across a useful edit any minute now, but I somehow doubt it. Note also the very similar contributions of these other incarnations of Imdaking (as demonstrated beyond doubt by edit patterns): <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUnike_04f6.html" title="User:Unike">User:Unike</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriss_P._5a15.html" title="User:Chriss P.">User:Chriss P.</a>, User:68.123.204.81, User:68.126.115.13. I also rather suspect <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonald20_630c.html" title="User:Ronald20">User:Ronald20</a>, an editor with many warnings about copyvios on his talk page, and with a similar interest in pages about TV shows and public transport, who suddenly stopped editing on August 25, the same day that the Chriss P. and Unike accounts were created. Unless somebody can show me something tending to actually help build an encyclopedia coming from this guy, under any account, I'd like to see him go directly to an RFAr. I'll help write it up, if desired. Mediation is surely moot: there is no "dispute", there is only disruption. Paul Klenk and others have tried (first mildly, then more tersely) to explain to him how to avoid copyvios. This has no other effect than annoying Imdaking intensely: when the complaints about copyrighted images on his Talk started to multiply, he simply created a special <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Imdaking/Complaints&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Imdaking/Complaints&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">Complaints talk page</a> and warned all comers from posting any more complaints on his regular Talk. His reply to criticisms on this innovative and fast-growing page is usually nothing, occasionally the kind of childish taunt BlankVerse describes above ("shut da fuc up"). Seems to me the community has made a good-faith effort to integrate this troublesome newbie, while he has never in turn shown an atom of willingness to contribute constructively. Just show him the door, please. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 13:55, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

BlankVerse asked me to weigh in on this and between him and <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWiki_brah_9e73.html" title="User:Wiki brah">User:Wiki brah</a> happily trouncing all over this site, it's no wonder that I'm stressed (which, of course, is "desserts" spelled backwards, but I digress).</dd>
<dd>I'm going through a somewhat stressful real-life period. Wikipedia is a pleasant hobby. Hobbies are supposed to help you relax. Uh-uh. These ridiculous threats and personal attacks from this user are too much. Add to that Wiki brah happily skipping on his merry, so-called "mentally challenged" way over such idiotic yet useless subjects as "anal sex in Brazil," "fetishes in Brazil" and that timeless classic, "anal sex in New York" and I am convinced we've been civil long enough. Time for some action, IMO. - Lucky 6.9 16:30, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that I've made the case for at least a temp block of <a href="../../../i/m/d/User%7EImdaking_1811.html" title="User:Imdaking">User:Imdaking</a>. I'm willing to do mediation after that if Imdaking wants to and there is a mediator who is willing to help.</dd>

<dd>I first came across <a href="../../../i/m/d/User%7EImdaking_1811.html" title="User:Imdaking">User:Imdaking</a> because of some pages that were on my watchlist because I had been tracking <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonald20_630c.html" title="User:Ronald20">User:Ronald20</a>'s edits. I highly doubt they are the same editor. Imdaking first started on 22 August 2005 (although he edited well enough that I doubt that he was a complete Wikipedia novice). Ronald20 quit editing on 25 August 2005, so there is a small overlap. Ronald20 also stuck to very simple language and very short edits and NEVER communicated on talk pages. Ronald20 said that he was from El Salvador, and some edits also suggest that, and that he was going to a school in the LA Unified district. Indaking says that he is a college student and appears to have some connection to <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talpa_de_Allende_566c.html" title="Talpa de Allende">Talpa de Allende</a>, a small Mexican town in Jalisco, central Mexico. Ronald20's anon edits were from o1.com and lausd.org, while Imdaking's anon edits are from dsl.irvnca.pacbell.net. The only thing they share in common are a few edits to a couple of Los Angeles bus transportation articles and the occasional uploading of company logos.</dd>

<p>After reviewing the edits this guy has made, I've never seen more personal attacks from any user. I blocked him for 48 hours to stem the tide of his nonsense so that we can more easily regroup and decide what to do. That LILVOKA character has me wondering as well. He left a note on Paul Klenk's talk page as well. I've asked him politely not to fan the fires. - Lucky 6.9 16:48, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Imdaking has been harrassing me off and on for a month, after I reworked a copyvio article for him.</p>
<ul>
<li>Putting my name on a "List of Annoying People" on his page.</li>
<li>Nasty comments on my page.</li>
<li>Using sockpuppets <b>Unike</b> and <b>Chriss P.</b> during the initial encounter with me. Imdaking has edited using <b>68.123.204.81</b>, self-admitted (I am certain about this), and possibly other IPs I have made note of. (A very out-to-lunch admin blocked <b>me</b> when I <b>correctly</b> tagged Imdaking's sock puppet pages. This admin has never, ever answered any of my questions about this incident and has refused to communicate with me about anything. I will make sure he is notified about this.)</li>
<li>Promising not to use those puppets, but he has used them since then. It is possible he is not keeping track of who he is when he signs in and out.</li>
<li>Retaliating for helping me to clean up his terrible work, even after I cleaned up his copyvios.</li>
<li>Telling me not to touch "his" work.</li>
<li>Singling me out for image violations, moments after his history indicates a dash to clean up his own work (which he then denied).</li>
<li>Deleting photos from an article when he know I already had GFDL licensing, and was merely having difficulty putting the information up. I asked him to help and he was no help whatsoever. His deletions were probably not kosher, either.</li>
<li>Baiting other gullible admins into taking his side.</li>
<li>Continuing and joining in on Wiki brah's recent harrassment and insults aimed at me.</li>
<li><b>Nominating himself for Adminship</b>, requiring quick assistance from <b>Dragon something</b> to have him remove the nomination.</li>
</ul>
<p>I was on to Imdaking the first day I came back after two years of not editing. I have racked up a lot of contributions since then, and realize my initial instincts about him were right.</p>

<dd>Bish, I think that LilVOKA's interest in everything hip hop is the most likely explanation of his friendship with Imdaking.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Folks, let me point out that the very first contact I had with Imdaking, not only was he sock-puppeting, he was logging out and leaving anonymous "Warnings" on my talk page, in <b>very official-sounding language</b>. I was tagging his three <b>known and confirmed</b> pages with sock-puppet tags, completely within procedure. I had read up on it and had even asked for help understanding the rules. These tags were being removed with lightning speed, including by Jtkiefer. He and Imdaking were leaving warnings on my page, and I assumed Jtkiefer was one of Imda's socks. I then incorrectly tagged Jtkiefer as his sock. (I couldn't believe at that time that someone could be so stupid as to 1] ignore my well documented tags, 2] stand up for Imdaking, and 3] blame me for this.) I'm telling you this to put things in perspective. Very quickly later, Ryan Delaney, an admin, gave me one, maybe two warnings, calling what I was doing <b>vandalism</b>. Again, as he didn't identify himself as an admin, and I couldn't imagine anyone being so stupid as to not see what Imdaking was doing, I continued reverting what they were deleting. That is when Ryan blocked me for 12 hours.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>You may not think 12 hours is serious</b>, but when you are new and are being harrassed, it really p*sses you off, pardon my French. Ryan has <b>not once</b> replied to any of my repeated messages to him about that incident so we could sort out what happened. He completely ignored me. I have seen Wiki brah and Imdaking get better treatment from admins than I did that day.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>At that time, Imdaking was a very new username. <font color="red"><b>It is clear that he has been here far longer.</b></font> No one who writes and edits so poorly, could also understand the rules enough to do what he is doing. He is here for two things: 1] Use WP as a plaything, and 2] Game the system's attempts to block him from doing it. <b>Sorry</b> -- I forgot to sign.

<dd>Admins don't really have any more power over users, other then the extra features, which they can use to uphold community consensus and to keep people in check through policies, and that we are <b>supposed</b> to be smart.

But APNIC is not an ISP, it's one of the five regional Internet registries, like ARIN. ARIN refers you to APNIC (or the appropriate regional registry) if you look it up at ARIN.

<dd>The APPT one would be problematic to block, since it's dynamic, but the school one may be static.

<dd>He keeps following me around on AfD pages calling me by a name which is not my User name. The entire tone of his comments is highly condescending. The name itself is not offensive in and of itself, but the refusal to use my proper User name and the reversion of my edit to remove it, after I had requested that he desist, caused me to block him. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 06:21, September 12, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Zoe, if you were in a content dispute with him at the time, which includes a VfD, you shouldn't block him, unless it's vandalism or clear disruption. How often did he call you that or any other name? Would you consider unblocking him? <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 06:28, September 12, 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I didn't block him for the content dispute, I would not do that. I blocked him for his repeated comments to me. It has happened three or four other times. This is only the most recent one.

<p>For what it's worth, I think that by looking at the page history and at the brief exchange between Zoe and Radman on User_talk:Radman1#My_User_name_is_Zoe, it's clear that Radman had a malicious intent. I wouldn't have done the block myself if I were Zoe, but I think its possible to infer why Zoe is so angry.

<dd>I don't know the context, and I'm sorry if I'm being a pain here, but you can't block someone you're in a content dispute with because he called you beau, or said "there, there, you poor thing." We're not allowed to block for personal attacks anyway, not in and of themselves. They have to reach the level of disruption before we can block i.e. they have to be pretty serious attacks. But if you're in a content dispute with that person, you're not supposed to do even that. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 06:47, September 12, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Zoe definitely shouldn't have made the block herself, and I think RadMan ought to be unblocked, but I think the circumstances surrounding it are understandable enough. I think if RadMan can be convinced to remove his own edit and that both users promise to stay away from each other on AfD for a day or two, this problem will largely go away. <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFernando_Rizo_ef9f.html" title="User:Fernando Rizo">Fernando Rizo</a> <a href="../../../f/e/r/User_talk%7EFernando_Rizo_69e0.html" title="User talk:Fernando Rizo"><i>T</i></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fernando_Rizo_71a2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fernando Rizo"><i>C</i></a> 06:51, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Intentionally trying to tick another editor off by calling him or her condescending names despite being warned seems disruptive enough to me to justify a block. It's especially problematic when it evokes condescending sexist rhetoric. That said, it's probably a better idea to ask another admin to block if you're the user being harassed, as many will instinctively favor the blocked party. That would probably involve another warning/name-calling cycle, though. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 06:58, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I will comment that as this little exchange proves, you have quite a problem with your version of what motivations are and what the motivations are on the side of the party. In fact, one would indicate that your methodology is "Classify and Crucify", based on tiny little crimes working from a penal code buried inside your own head and nowhere else. Your fellow admins are scratching their heads and you are taking on all comers. Just as a good con-man will only take his victims for a small amount, thereby ensuring nobody loses so much it's worth tracking down the lost funds, your sticking with one-hour punishments ensures a sense of power and authority with not too much time for a consensus to build on the fairness of your actions.

<p>The difficulty I have here is that, if Zoe wasn't an admin, she wouldn't have had the ability to block Radman. This is not just a self-evident distinction; being the object of the alleged abuse, Zoe is an interested party, and thus using her admin powers in this respect is a conflict of interest. What she should have done is call on <i>another</i> admin to assess the situation and take whatever steps they deemed fit. Now it just looks like bullying, and fodder for any RfC.</p>
<p>My view, for what its worth, was that although Radman's name calling was juvenile, it didn't deserve blocking. --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> (<a href="../../../k/h/a/User_talk%7EKhaosworks_e07b.html" title="User talk:Khaosworks">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Khaosworks_06d3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Khaosworks">contribs</a>) 07:36, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>A user has personally targeted another user with juvenile remarks, was repeatedly asked to stop, and was then blocked for the incredibly short time of one hour. That sounds entirely reasonable to me, and I admire Zoe's restraint in keeping the block to only one hour. I don't see anything inappropriate here besides Radman's behavior. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 07:46, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think Zoe probably did the right thing here. Civility is policy and Radman was being grossly uncivil. If he thinks he can be uncivil to an administrator, likelihood is he thinks he can do the same thing to other editors, so a brief one-hour nose-tweak, escalating to a longer block if he doesn't get the message, is in order. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 07:52, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't agree that she shouldn't perform the block; she performed it and then submitted it for review here.

<dd>Come on, Tony, calling someone "shallow" is a very personal remark? Look, I'm not defending incivility, but Zoe was involved in a content dispute with Radman; I don't accept that opposing someone on VfD isn't a content dispute. She blocked him, then posted here for comment. She then seemed to resent being asked for information, and was rude to people on this page who were asking for more details. If you dislike incivility (and you're right to), you shouldn't defend it no matter where it's coming from. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 10:51, September 12, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, calling someone shallow is highly personal and violates <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civility</a>; I don't think there can be any serious dispute on that. Moreover I see no evidence that Zoe and Radman1 were engaged in a content dispute--that would have changed things. The incident involving Zoe and Radman1 occurred on <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Matt_Vogel%2C_Jennifer_Barnhardt%2C_Eric_Jacobson_c93f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Matt Vogel, Jennifer Barnhardt, Eric Jacobson">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Matt Vogel, Jennifer Barnhardt, Eric Jacobson</a>.

<dd>I too will stick my head where it doesn't belong. While I appreciate that nobody wants to be banned for childish behaviour, why should we tolerate it or encourage it? I find it hard to belive that Radman was unaware that his actions were undesireable, or that he did not intend to be provocative. Zoe may be exasperated to the point where her (I hope Zoe is a her, if not, my apologies) writing is terse, but how much of that is due to Radmans behaviour? While it would perhaps be "better" in terms of neutrality if some other admin were to do it, it is a formality at best, as I can't imagine it would be hard to find someone else willing to do so?--<a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkypaws_784e.html" title="User:Inkypaws">inks</a> 08:24, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To be fair, I think finding an admin to block someone for that would be pretty easy. In fact, I have in mind a couple people who I expect would be eager to do it.

<dd>I too will jump into the discussion. Personally, I just find the remarks of Radman incredibly juvenile. Do the comments institute a violation of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>? Probably. Was it a blockable offense? Maybe. Was Zoe incredibly annoyed? Yes. But the fact is that <b>any admin</b>, regardless of the situation, who is involved in a content dispute should not block. I, personally, probably wouldn't have blocked, but someone on IRC would have listened to a request for a blocking covering a short period of time. However, an hour-block is not that big of a deal. SlimVirgin, in my opinion, is in the right here. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBratsche_d97d.html" title="User:Bratsche"><font color="#006666">Bratsche</font></a><sup><a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBratsche_6f8a.html" title="User talk:Bratsche"><font color="#FF6600">talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#339900">Esperanza</font></a></sup> 21:33, September 12, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

However, I do agree that when in doubt, find another non-involved admin to block. Personally, I wouldn't have blocked, but have asked another administrator to take a look at the situation and talk to Radman about it. If the problem persisted after warnings, then the other admin could block for disruption. <a href="../../../f/l/c/User%7EFlcelloguy_1bb8.html" title="User:Flcelloguy">Flcelloguy</a> | <small><a href="../../../f/l/c/User_talk%7EFlcelloguy_7b23.html" title="User talk:Flcelloguy">A <font color="brown">note?</font></a></small> | <a href="../../../f/l/c/User%7EFlcelloguy_Desk_89ed.html" title="User:Flcelloguy/Desk">Desk</a> 22:39, September 12, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In similar vein, I am asking this user to be blocked for his inappropriate use of the word <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigger.html" title="Nigger">Nigger</a> in the following link to knowingly and intentionally insult my race as a person of African descent - simply because he objected my use of the word "deletionist". I further find the snide manner in which this racial-epithet was hurled at me to be the height of racist insensitivity by stating "<b>they</b> use it", who are <b>they</b> exactly? Us niggers??? Beyond this, to compare being called a <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigger.html" title="Nigger">nigger</a> ( a word which clearly has a long-history of racially-motivated derision) to being called a deletionist (a term coined within the Wiki environment for those who wish to delete an article) is simply beyond all pales of racial insensitivity. I s'pose us ignorant niggers should all keep us mouths shut fo' Massa Aaron cuz he dun have a point ta be makin' when he dun call us's niggas.</p>
<p>Using a fellacious comparison in an AfD debate as an artifice to insult another editor's race certainly is just cause for a ban. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Bartlett_High_School%2C_Bartlett%2C_Illinois&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=23148864" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Bartlett_High_School%2C_Bartlett%2C_Illinois&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=23148864" rel="nofollow">[36]</a> unsigned by <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">User:Nicodemus75</a></p>

That is the very point of it's use in the discussion (if you stop and think about it, what other possible reason is there for a such a non-sequitor insertion in an AfD about deleting a school article????). Irrespective of whether or not you feel that his comment was directed or not, it's use in the context of the AfD in question is extremely offensive to people of African descent - suggesting that a rcail epithet used throughout history to deride and abuse an entire race is somehow equivalent with a legitimate term created for and used in Wiki projects, see: <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Deletionism" class="extiw" title="m:Deletionism">deletionist</a>. If using such a term is considered a personal attack, what is next? Aaron makes personal attacks on a regular basis against those who disagree with him. Fellaciously using "nigger" in the AfD as a comparison is nothing more than an artifice to encite response and make an attack by proxy on someone's racial origins. Quite possibly the most offensive part of his comment is(as I stated above) "Heck, <b>they</b> even call each other that!" (emphasis mine) What is being implied here by the term "they"? "they" being the "niggers" in question? I don't really understand how this cannot be characterized as not being an attack, even if you don't think he was surreptitously using this obvious non-sequitor as a proxy for hurling a racial epithet at someone with whom he is engaged in a debate. ie. Don't call me a deletionist because it is just as offensive as when I say "nigger". --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 03:36, 14 September 2005 (UTC) (also, I did sign the original request, I am not sure why my sig didn't show up).

<p>How is this any different from Radman Vs. Zoe? I asked <i>several times</i> for someone to desist with something I considered a personal attack. They not only failed to stop they stepped up the level of attack to include not only the "deletionist" label (I actually objected) to but use of my name (which I didn't). I gathered (from the above discussion) that the consensus was that this kind of venom was to be discouraged? (Oh, and I think it's dumb too.)<br />

<p>Well, here we are back to the claim that "deletionist" was being used as an insult. Originally it wasn't, then you objected and then Nicodemus did seem to use it with evident intent to annoy. But there are two sides to this: if you insist that people shouldn't use common shorthands like <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/deletionism" class="extiw" title="m:deletionism">deletionist</a> and <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/inclusionism" class="extiw" title="m:inclusionism">inclusionist</a> because you consider them to be insults, you're going to get some strong (and, I hope, mostly polite) opposition from people who find them useful. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 05:11, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Unless someone specifically calls themself a deletionist, I find it offensive to call someone else that. It's like using the term "liberal" as an insult.

<dd>This is a straw man if there ever was. Are you implying along with Aaron that it is by extension, "not offensive" to call someone a "nigger" because people of African descent may refer to each other in that way? I am sorry, but this position is fellacious at best. I am sure that you will now reply "oh it doesn't apply to things like racial epithets", what a nonsensical, subjective standard you are erecting about terms. Is "those who frequently vote to delete" offensive if someone doesn't like to be called that? Is "those that always vote to delete" offensive? Is "those that vote to delete this article" offensive? There is all sorts of shorthand to refer to people on Wiki who hold various and sundry positions. If this standard is actually going to be applied by admins, I am going to start complaining every time anyone uses a term or phrase of this sort and claim I am offended. By this standard, it is offensive to be labelled as "voting to include an article", since I do <b>not</b> "specifically calls [myself]" that. I am not saying this to make a point, but rather that it is inherently offensive to have some Wiki-only "labels" whether they be terms or phrases categorized as offensive by admins, and others not so.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 06:05, 14 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>David, I have yet to see a single <b>keep</b> vote from you in the AfDs on schools (correct me if you have voted keep on any schools please). Don't like being called a "deletionist"? Fine.

<dd>There is a good reason. The ones I consider keepers normally have so many keep votes they do not require further support. I think I have voted on three schools at most. Certainly no more than five. Conversely, I have created and improved many articles relating to schools. If I was a deletionist would I be putting time into the project? Life is not as simple as deleters vs keepers. There are other paths and ideas to consider, some involve compromise but in a project like this it is the only way forward. <a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDaycd_676d.html" title="User:Daycd">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/y/User_talk%7EDaycd_ee80.html" title="User talk:Daycd">(Talk)</a> 06:38, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well that's okay. Most of us would never use the terms deletionist or inclusionist as an insult, but should it ever become a potential problem we can use our commonsense, as in this case. As for using the term <i>liberal</i> as an insult, perhaps there may be some on the extreme right or left who would do that, but in my country at least it remains a very useful term. Let's not get carried away because of the Coulters and Limbaughs of this world. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 05:53, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Tony is absolutely correct. An apology is in order for my deliberate use of the term after Aaron objected. Even if those of us wishing to use the shorthand replace it everytime with "those who vote to delete", then that phrase will become "offensive". Be reasonable - the terms "deletionist" or "inclusionist" are <b>not</b> the same as "nigger" at all.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 06:17, 14 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Absolutely agree with you that the terms are not the same at all. With regard to the term 'deletionsist' you should realise that just because some do not vote to keep everything does not make them by default deletionists. I was surprised to be coined as such too. I don't think people should take offense but it does get annoying since it is often an easy accusation to make rather than actually addressing the disputed issues. <a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDaycd_676d.html" title="User:Daycd">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/y/User_talk%7EDaycd_ee80.html" title="User talk:Daycd">(Talk)</a> 06:29, 14 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>I was going to put the same note on N75's page, but hey, he's obviously watching this one.</li>
<li>How the hell was I supposed to know N75 be so sensitive? I used a word in a sentence and he's bloody crying about it. I asked him three times not to call me names <i>directly</i> and he persisted. With a <i>great deal</i> of malice. It's stupid I know, but he actually <i>hurt my feelings</i>.</li>

<dd>Fuzzy is good–in moderation–because it discourages rules-lawyering and gaming the system. As long as Tony can clearly articulate <i>why</i> he imposed the block (serious violations of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">WP:CIV</a> on top of the 3RR violation and apparent overuse of reversion in general) then a block for disruption would seem reasonable. As Everyking noted, the user's behaviour is probably arbitrable, but perhaps TDC will take the hint without us having to go that route. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 11:47, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, if I had merely blocked him for 3RR he would have said to himself "I miscalculated and a hostile sysop took advantage of it." Now he knows that there are problems with his general behavior towards other editors, and his overuse of reverts as a means of attempting to gain control over the state of certain articles. And he knows that if he keeps it up after the block there will be a longer block. And possibly a review to see if arbitration would be worthwhile in his case. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 12:09, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Blocked for another 48 hours. This may seem harsh, but his four edits after the block ended were quite disheartening, showing that he had learned nothing: one edit on a talk page, and three article reverts within the space of four minutes. My view is that he has used reverts excessively, as a way of fighting political wars rather than editing articles, and so he must let other people do reverts, if they're necessary at all. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 10:07, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

I can see the stance on POV pushing, but I'm not sure I agree with this block completely...regardless of his "history".--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 11:08, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm sorry I confused MONGO who appears to think this was a <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> case. Here's his contribution history:</p>

</ul>
<p>By my reading, every single one of TDC's last 25 article edits have been reverts. This is not editing, it's warfare. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a battleground</a> --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 13:42, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A very similar case has happened previously with <a href="../../../t/d/c/User%7ETDC_c89f.html" title="User:TDC">User:TDC</a> over the <a href="../../../p/a/b/Pablo_Neruda_61c3.html" title="Pablo Neruda">Pablo Neruda</a> article, which he kept reverting exactly thrice every day; after I warned him repeatedly (pointing out that the <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> does not give the right to revert three times, but only says that more than three times are not tolerated), I gave him a 48 hour block. His first action afterward was to continue his reverting exactly as before, for which I blocked him for 4 days for exactly the same reasons, aggravated by recidivism and provocation (I did this after particular consultation of other admins).</dd>
<dd>After this second block, TDC issued a policy of refraining of such incidents in the future, a policy which he more or less held until the recent edits, where he increasingly took back his older habits.</dd>
<dd>In this light, I do not think that <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>'s way in improper at all. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama_da58.html" title="User:Rama">Rama</a> 13:56, 15 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>OKay, I'm not asking anything be taken into consideration aside from the fact that those last 4 reverts were indeed to combat a sockpuppet account. Had I been in the same circumstances as TDC, I wouldn't have seen that going into 4 different articles to revert a sockpuppet who had been edit warring against me, would have been in any way a violation...even with precidents of past behavior.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 19:20, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well actually going around revert warring <i>is</i> frowned upon. The sock puppet, if that's what he is (as I see no attempt to pretend to be different editors I hesitate to use the term) several times in edit summaries asked TDC to go to the talk page, Talk: Vietnam veterans against the War.</p>

<p>Sorry for the short and not particularly coherent reply above. As luck would have it the system because extremely sluggish and then the database was locked before I could tweak my reply for coherence (or even sign it!)</p>
<p>I do agree that this sock is part of the problem. However blocking TDC seems to have had a salutary effect on just about all the articles he had been revert warring on. There are one or two other revert warriors around on those articles, but there is no longer anything like as much warring. The articles in question don't seem to have suffered greatly in the absence of TDC's reverts, whereas before I blocked him one of them was protected for three weeks because of his adamant insistence on removing an item of content. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 14:04, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dt>Okay, I trust your judgement Tony, just wanted to point things out, which you were probably already aware of and you may be more aware of TDC's edits than I am. I just saw that it seemed since he was at times in conflict with a sockpuppet, that he, at least, was up front with his edits, and more justified to his version. That's all I have to say on the matter.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 14</dt>

<p>I am baffled by this user's edits to the year articles. For one, he makes tens of piecemeal edits, each without a summary. Some seem useful, like removing births and deaths of people without articles, but other edits seem to be removing information, such as removing the mention of KFC from Harland Sanders description, removing Chelsea Clinton from the births section, or just removing wikilinks in general. Have there been new criteria for notability proposed for the year articles? In either case, the user has not been responsive to notices on his talk page, and continues to make sweeping changes like this without any edit summaries whatsoever. I have already revert <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a> three times now, and to do so again would violate 3RR (as these edits are not simple vandalism). Can other people keep an eye on this?

<p>He/she needs to be required to explain their edits.
